good,"Overall, it wasn't a bad experience. You have to work holidays. You have to turn around shifts. I don't like some of the changes that the company has made."
good,"You have to work holidays. You have to do turn around shifts. Overall, it wasn't a bad experience. I don't like some of the changes that they made as a company."
good,Not a bad place to work at. Decent benefits. Did not like the flexible hours..hard to do something else with that schedule. Rude customers sometimes..
good,Fun and outgoing workplace. Walgreens Pharmacy inside methodist hospital. Fast paced but friendly. They work with school hours and are really flexible
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work at. Employees are great to work with and although it can be stressful at times, we always make sure that we work as a team."
good,a lot of corporate quotas to meet. It is stressful. the motto is fill as many prescription as possible. Find ways to fill more prescription than possible.
good,"negative environment, there will be gossips, unhappy employees, management is okay, hardest dealing with cranky customers, I learned what to expect being a pharmacy technician. Get 15 mins breaks, 30 mins lunch, what else....can't think. Over all is okay."
good,"Tracked documentation for changes, authorizations and eligibility, processed and submitted claims, completed and submitted redeterminations and appeals"
good,Worked in IT sector for Walgreens client. Worked in Agile environment. So had less time to finish the work in every sprint. Client side people are very co-operative.
good,it was a good second job helped me get back on my feet and i learned a lot working in the photo department learned a lot of customer services and how to do inventory and how to open and close the store it was a good learning experience.
good,Very slow days.Management was ok. The hardest part of working at walgreens was having to go to work and stand around all day trying to find something to do. Some days are steady and some are slow.
good,"I worked part time for Walgreens to supplement my income while pursuing a Masters Degree as a full-time student.  I chose to work at Walgreens because it was near my residence and they had an opening.  I was paid minimum wage.  Working there wasn't especially fulfilling or satisfying, nor was it grueling torture.  Some of the store management and fellow employees were a challenge to work with, but others were not.  I ended my employment there when I moved out of state to go to another school."
good,eh would recommend as a summer job definitely. Mostly a lot of the same every day and a lot of standing around. Otherwise I would not want this to be my career
good,"when I got hired the store was already behind. in the time I was there we had 3 different store managers, so that says something. The store was getting caught up but favoritism caused way too many issues. I was on the management team, a shift lead, so I seen It first hand. the employees would get upset when you told them to work, and the other shift leads didn't really work, so it felt like everything fell back on a handful of us and it was tough."
good,Great for someone who is balancing their work life with school. Sometimes it does get stressful as a technician because there is a lot one needs to know before he feels comfortable working and going about daily duties. Insurance rejections are probably the toughest.
good,If upper management is good than a Distribution Center is a great place to work. Good pay and benefits. Just need good upper management or the morale will be terrible.
good,a very fast paced job. fill and count prescriptions most of the day. Customer service is key in this position and composure is key to the team. hardest part of the job is being short staffed.
good,"The people and staff are mostly nice. Favoritism plays too large a role here. No cushioned mats for feet when standing 8 hrs. It makes for bad back pain and posture. It was a common complaint and that's why they offer a chair when possible. I did a lot of work for the pay. It just barely covered rent and food. This is not the place for a single person to live on. Great part time job for 2nd income people with spouses or partners, but not alone. I was cashier, photo lab, pharmacy tech, floor person"
good,Very easy work and very nice place to work. This is not very complicated place to work just listen and follow the direction. The hardest part of this job is standing.
good,Only thing that place has going for it but you must bust your butt to get it or your efforts will go unnoticed. Management needs to be improved tho. Just from my experience.
good,"Walgreens is a company that makes billions of dollars but refuses to pay their employees enough. My Manager is awesome and very fair to employees, but Walgreens does not look like they are going down a good road."
good,Nice management and easy work environment. Learned a lot of beauty industry knowledge. Staff learned quickly and worked hard. Great customer service and gave opportunities to advance.
good,"Walgreens os a great job, with flexible scheduling and understanding staff. As a single mother, Walgreens has helped me get through a journey of disappointment and fear. Todsy I'm brave and faithful. I'm now settled and ready to be all that I  can."
good,I would recommend a friend to work at Walgreens. It's good pay and there was never a dull moment. Lots of different people to interact with. Making people's days while helping them was the best experience.
good,Walgreens offers many benefits but healthcare is expensive.  A lot of whether it is a good place to work depends on immediate management which can greatly vary.  Raises are small and only once a year
good,I am grateful for walgreen's helping their employee. Iam glad to have a wonderful manager who care about his employees. I am glad that i was a part of his store.
good,"No matter which position you're hired to, you'll probably be working in other departments, too. The skills and value you gain by doing this will not be reflected in your pay. This is, in the present climate, standard for retail workers, but worth mentioning, all the same. You'll be expected to both man the register and do work in aisles that keep the register out of your line of sight, apparently developing a sixth sense for the presence of customers. Scheduling may change with little notice, depending on how well-staffed the store is."
good,"Working as a photo specialist, I've learned more about the proper formatting to photo printing. Besides the other responsibilities, the company was an overall good job for a high school student."
good,Was considered head cashier as soon as the old head cashier bailed. Was given the opportunity to head my own department about 2-3 months into working here.
good,"There were times as a pharmacy tech that you were literally running from place to place, drive-thru to front counter like a chicken with your head cut off. It was challenging and not always in a good way. The management was hit or miss but mostly the pharmacy team became like a family. The didn't seem to care though."
good,"Good work environment, very chill management. Overall and easy job to maintain, although being a technician can become stressful at times, due to irate patients, and walgreens expectations of employees. Salary isn't worth the work and dedication the employer wants its employees to put forth ."
good,This company (esp. the store I work in) has poor management.  The managers promoted someone in the store with the MOST CUSTOMER COMPLAINT.  Most of us CSA are disappointed!
good,working at walgreens helped me to gain more customer service experience. interacting with the customers one on one helping them with their needs and learning how to deal with stressful situations.
good,Walgreens will continue to grow and wil work with you trying to find a career. They are a good but competitive company. Will work for them again with no problem.
good,"Its freaking walgreens. I worked here when i was fresh outta high school i think. It was a nice location, my boss was a fair guy and my supervisors were cool as well. All in all it was a great experience."
good,Walgreens was a great retail experience to work at. I enjoyed every moment of it. I love talking to people & Walgreens gave me a perfect experience for that. I also learned importance of costumer service.
good,"Not great, not horrible. If your coworkers are cool, you'll be fine. My manager was great about scheduling and helping you out. It can definitely be stressful though."
good,"Working at Walgreens was a fast-paced environment, standing long hours, minimum pay, nice management and some co-workers were bossy. Descent discount."
good,Great place to work back in the 80’s but as years went by and new people began to come they stopped a lot of great benefits. If you got in early you were good.
good,The company didn't care about there staff. You have to work very hard not to get any compensation.  Management only care about what benefit them. This was a great company to work for. But with all the changes it has gone down hill.
good,Nice place to work just needs room for advancement. Managers are friendly and the culture on the job is also nice. Group activities are fun too and nice to partake in
good,"The best thing about working at a Walgreens in San Francisco, CA is that it's unionize and you're surrounded with awesome coworkers!! Management good!"
good,"I'm a floater pharmacist with Walgreen's. I am still with Walgreen's because what few hours I'm getting are at least paying my bills. But the hours are inconsistent and I've been to, unarguably, the busiest and most miserable stores in Louisville. The working environment is too stressful and fast-paced because you are almost always understaffed for the amount of prescriptions you fill every day. Where I'm not consistently getting the hours stated in my ""contract"" I'm not able to apply for healthcare, either. Shifts do pop open, but they either get taken very quickly or at stores/times you REALLY don't want. Overall, the pay is the only reason I'm still here."
good,Walgreens is a good company to work but his very fast paced with little benefits. Salary is not fair. Store I worked at was unorganized and had poor management.
good,"Productive work day.Learned to improve with my Sales oitch, Management was very easy to get along with.The culture was very Diverse.Keep up with sales and price changes was sometimes had its challenges.Atmosphere was very lively."
good,"Typical day at work included inventory management, coaching and training employees, giving constructive feedback, stocking merchandise, building displays, creating weekly schedules, etc"
good,Busy store where sometimes technician hours are limited. the working environment is fine but therequirement on production is very high.some timebreaks are not taken
good,"Easy job, as many hours as you want by working at other stores, management really stepped up during Harvey.  Hardest part of the job is dealing with the unruly customers.  sick people can be rude"
good,"As a customer service associate I was the welcoming face that greeted you at the door and helped customers feel at ease with personal touch of  advertising sales and promoting the weekly special and numerous programs like Red Nose Day. . I also took great pleasure in delighting our customers through friendly, exceptional service with a fun loving attitude. I was able to learn the functions of cash handling and customer service, merchandising, store inventory, and updating store signage and displays."
good,I worked on refilling medications in their distribution/call center and I also worked doing click to chat. They are very numbers based and are concerned about average handle time instead of customer and employee wellbeing.
good,"Busy and productive"
good,I learned the entry level tasks of how to be a pharmacy technician. This is the first job that inspired my passion and desire to continue a career  as a pharmacy technician
good,"I did enjoy working at Walgreen's but I needed more money and better hours. I would recommend it to anyone that is in need of a job. They do have opportunity to advance, but have restructured the management level and there is a cap that a manager can make."
good,"Shfts take up your whole day. Managers/Shift leads give you their responsibilities."
good,"contract position. exciting company but they were going through major organizational changes at the time of my employment. Good people, a bit hectic at times but boring too."
good,the most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the communication with customers. I loved walking into work and knowing i was going to see some of my regulares.
good,Not enough employees to handle the walk in traffic.  Customers get upset when needs are not addressed quickly.  Dealing with irate customers was a negative.
good,Working over night was very tiring for me because I was not use to it. The manager gave us so much to do. For example we would set items up in one spot then the next day we would have to move it somewhere else.
good,it's a decent stepping stone for the youth. Gives the opportunity to communicate with diverse customers. is very convenient for those who live in the surrounding area.
good,"The typical day at Walgreens was very fast paced, but the people you work with make it fun.Although it gets stressful at times, asking for help is a common thing and everyone is always willing to give an extra hand to each other to try to make things run a bit smoother."
good,"Typical working environment. Fast paced and slow during the day, depending on the sales and holiday. Hardest part of the job may be setting up around the holiday season."
good,"Basic work, basic pay. Room for advancement. Fair working conditions. Good working conditions. Management would listen to suggestions . Would still be there if not laid off."
good,"Being a retail position it isn't a great long term job, but Walgreens has a very calm environment and a healthy job culture to make the experience a positive one.Good position for college students or someone looking for part time work."
good,"Provide customer service by building and maintaining with excellent, consistent relations.  Perform all functions related to managing and operating a retail Pharmacy.  Provide patient counseling on all new"
good,"In this job I had the great opportunity of meeting different people with interesting personalities, and having the privilege to help those in need of specific items. Being in this job has taught me to cooperate with both my coworkers and an overwhelming amount of customers at once."
good,it was a ok job for the time i enjoyed the people and the managment  the hours were good and rthe couustmer were friedly and the store was clean and the staff was great
good,"Walgreens is a job to get your foot in the door regarding pharmacy positions. Very fast paced. Technicians have to do pretty everything from ordering meds, typing prescriptions, and billing insurances. Learned a lot."
good,"I wish i would have a better experience when i was working for the company it was just the location i was placed at, at the time . Just  the whole experience for me wasn't what i expected."
good,"I enjoy the teaching, being able to hire employees, promoting from within. The other side is lack of promotion here in my region. I would like to do more and I am ready to explore other opportunities."
good,"I am only able to review the pharmacy department. Their pharmacy is EXTREMELY busy. At the time of my employment with them, if lack of employees, you worked through lunch and stayed as late as needed often times resulting in exhaustion!"
good,"cash handling and customer service skills , people skills, neat and clean environment also. was aslo a floater around the store for other arears as needed."
good,Continual reduction of staff hours despite a continual rise in prescription numbers in most stores; low morale overall.  Most days are stressful and management makes you feel like you're never doing enough.
good,"Walgreens is just a huge company. A lot like Walmart, they assimilate wherever they are. Nothing special about it, they've just got many niche markets cornered."
good,"A lot of the experience depends on the store manager.  Some are great, and some not so great.  They have well-developed computer training modules; however, there wasn't enough time to go through them properly."
good,process photos for customers for holidays and birthdays. ran the cash register and did the restocking for the warehouse. I made sure all orders was right when receive shipments from pepsi.
good,"pretty chill work place,management is very friendly. very good career advancement opportunity. working in a small store is very easy to become friends with everyone."
good,It was an OK place to work.  Love the customers but the employees sometimes were a bit dramatic which took away from the fun of it. I only worked 20 or so hours a week so sometimes felt left out of pharmacy decisions.
good,"As an assistant manager in training, you pretty much just unload trucks and stock shelves.  Easy to get burned out, and not very stimulating.  Decent pay though"
good,Great job to have. My success with the company has been pivotal and a great experience. Managment has provided great opportunities for me as well.Thank you!
good,First job out of high school. Started as a service clerk and worked my way up to shift lead. Taught me alot about the work life but wages in the retail profession are low so I changed carreers
good,"Retail jobs really open everyone's minds to deal with everything, and once you get through it, you learn a lot and bring all learnings to a better job."
good,walgreens has everything under one roof so working there is not difficult and employee discount comes in handy a lot of the time. You have to sacrifice holidays but get paid time and a half for it.
good,"Overall I enjoyed my time with this company, mainly due to the coworkers that I was working with."
good,"This company is customer service driven. No two days are  alike. It's about focus being efficiency. A strong work culture. The hardest part of my job is working in the Pharmacy. It's extremely busy and customers are often times impatient. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers interaction.  From working at this company, I've learnt that changes is constant.  New approaches changes with technology."
good,I liked working here.  it was a relaxed environment but I would've really rather have had a faster paced job.  I sat at a desk all day. if you like a desk job this is for you.
good,"Walgreens is not bad, its good only as a temporary job. Since in my previous relationship I was not working, this was a good opportunity to get back in. It was something to be able to put on my resume. The allow you to study and have an opportunity in becoming a pharmacy tech. Walgreens will pay for your books and allow you to get experience by allowing you to help out in their pharmacy. One thing is their schedules, you really don't have a life, it's retail."
good,Not a place you should stay in if you don't plan on moving up. It's just a job to start off with if you are looking for one. Other than that it's an easy job to learn new things.
good,"This job had ups and downs. The management at my particular store was great, with the exception of the store manager. She was passive-aggressive and didn't help much."
good,Was a great job to gain experience. Opportunity for growth within the company. Customers can be rude but that comes with the work environment. Fast paced environment
good,Walgreens was a good place for working at your own pace. It allowed yo to grow stronger as an employee on your own time without all the stress........
good,I was a billing and collections specialist. I was a very rewarding job. I was able to help people with their insurance issues to get their medications paid for.
good,"Good hours, good but small co-worker group, but not very good management attitudes. Customers were nice and friendly, not a bad first job, taught me professional communication skills and sales operations. I am now experienced in inventory check and stocking products."
good,"Iactually enjoyed all the people I worked with. Its just your average retail job. You only ever get a 30 min lunch but that wasn't so bad."
good,Job is pretty good they make you feel included in the day to day jobs. Management treats you good in that they accept ideas from hourly and don't look down on you. The only problem with the job is its low pay for this day and age in my opinion. I can not raise 3 kids on this pay and I'm tired of working two jobs and having no life...
good,"It was just a job, nothing too difficult and lots of opportunity to move up. Management is hit or miss, sometimes your manager can be very cool and other times they are mean and unhelpful."
good,I recommend this job for first time pharmacy technicians and anyone who is in this field and needs a very flexible schedule. They worked well with my school schedule.
good,Enjoyed working there when I did the only thing sucked was working the holidays and every weekend prices were good with discounts management was alright
good,"While working there at walgreens, I learned a lot on how to talk to customers and how to assess non verbal communication. This is a great job if someone is just stepping into the retail/customer service industry"
good,General Manager was disrespectful and talked about doing things that were illegal and privacy violations. General Manager lacked communication skills and empathy.
good,Working as a cashier and photo tech they take you for granted. Give you a list to do and if you finished they got mad for they did not expect you to get done with the list.
good,the hardest part is providing good customer service while keeping up with other things.  too many distractions that are not focused on taking care of the customer
good,I guess a job is a job but walgreens is very demanding for a place that shouldn't. Walgreens is like working for a tiny walmart except they care less for there employees
good,"I worked to be a pharmacy tech after my opportunity to become a beauty consultant was taken away due to being in school to finish my degree. Management quality depends on the district, the new one I'm in now is far better than the last one."
good,"this is a repeat area, my comments will be the same, I worked off and on with Walgreens throughout the years until I retired in 2017, which is the reason why I left the company"
good,really productive place but strict. Good managers and team. Lots of man working hours. Different shifts from AM to PM. Had to be consistent. But overall was a good experience.
good,"Walgreens used to be the ideal company to work for. They have gotten away from the family work ethic that used to make Walgreens, Walgreens. They overwork and underpay their pharmacy Technicians"
good,I have worked a couple days out of the week at 12.5 hours with no pharmacist overlap.  It is extremely stressful and you must be able to multi-task all while trying not to make a mistake.
good,Started as overnight cashier and stocker was eventually promoted to SIMS Coordinator and did all of the ordering and built displays most of my managers were likable
good,"A typical day consent of coming in, doing my job and dealing with customers. Sometimes it would be a good day and sometimes it would be a bad day, but the coworkers made it enjoyable"
good,"Monitoring and application support. Integration and development of web services and integration services with partners."
good,In short: they asked us to do more faster with fewer people and punished us when customer satisfaction went down. Hours were cut despite rx totals going up.
good,"I've been given the oppurtunity to incubate over 10 stores in the Charlotte market. I've worked in three markets. North Carolina, South Carolina, Puerto Rico."
good,It is a very faced paced call center enviroment and if that's not what your used to get ready for non-stop inbound calls. People point the finger at others for their own mistakes. I personally knew how to reveal other(s) mistakes and was not liked for doing so. However I was hard working and enjoyed some staff. Most people who work there think they are better then others.
good,Walgreens was a fun place to work.  The customers get to know you well and coworkers were great.  My particular manager had trouble with scheduling and treating people like adults.  Overall Walgreens has a culture of recognizing talent.
good,"Walgreens pays fairly well for a corporate retail job. However, the changes being made reflect the culture and business model of Rite Aid. Why would a company take on the business model of a company that they are in the process of buying is beyond me. Walgreens used to set the industry standards, now they are more concerned with getting in line with industry standards. By that I mean cutting benefits, hours, and pay scale."
good,"This is a good working environment."
good,"Management was nice"
good,"The company provides good fundamental knowledge of the industry, but given the lack of new technology too much time is wasted on tedious tasks.  As a result, I have not been able to grow as much professionally as I would like."
good,"When I first began, I was stressed that I was not going to be to work efficiently when it got busy. However my coworkers quickly caught me up on how to multi task and hep out customers."
good,It's a nice and peaceful store.  I liked stocking the products.  The registers were easy to use.  I got along with the managers and the other workers well.
good,The most enjoyable part of working for Walgreens was that the company has created a culture consisting of motivated employees and that makes the work day go by much more quickly.
good,"very very busy and fast pace environment, the company has become so focused on profit that it has cut staff and benefits This year was another year that pharmacist didn't get raises. ."
good,"Computer system is easy to navigate.  For work flow, it's all about who you work with.  If you have a strong pharmacy team (experienced techs, everyone gets along, etc.) your day will go smoothly.  If you are working with new hires, it may be more stressful.  Also, if the front end is on board with helping with lines at check out your life is much easier."
good,"manager at Walgreen is nice and helpful . job is very quiet , a.c , god workers , smart undercover cops . cameras everywhere so if you still you will get caught for sure"
good,Productive and sometimes fun. Management was not the best at times but overall it is a fair job for part-time. Most of my co-workers are okay only a few I don't really care for. When it comes to the work hours I feel like there is a lot of favoritism going on. That's the whole reason of me seeking new employment.
good,"very nice store manager and helpful pharmacy''. very friendly,courteous,profession staff.willing to go that extra mile in "
good,Ensure everything was in order and counters for customers was always properly manned. Helped restock shelves in the store and released workers for breaks.
good,"You get out what you put in honestly. I worked at 3 store during my time with the company and there's b.s. everywhere. It's not hard to advance if you really apply yourself, just expect not to have a social life."
good,"It was a fun place to work at, I had good working hours and drove an order picker and pulled full case merchandise and worked with lot's of wonderful people."
good,"Cashier, stocke shelves, set up displays, clean, shipping receiving, loss prevention, Cosmatician, I also provided customer service to walk in guest and callers."
good,Good job but can be very stressful and demanding. Communication is lacking between the front store and pharmacy. Maternity leave is not very good. Great job for someone that does not have a degree.
good,"Work pace is all over the place. A fast pace on starting a project, but stalls when it is time to implement. There is a disconnect between the other departments in Supply Chain and it is tough to get all departments to align with the project objective."
good,"Overall Walgreens is a great company to work for. They are flexible and wiling to work around your schedule such as school or another place of employment. Walgreen's also offers competitive wages as well a benefits such as: 401k, life insurance, medical, dental and vision."
good,"Walgreens can be a good work environment but management is in constant rotation and communication is lacking. Supervisors want you to learn everything so you learn multiple skills, however you are obligated to respond to multiple managers who give conflicting directions and tell you to not do something that someone else told you to do. Walgreens does encourage moving up the ladder and bettering oneself."
good,The job is ok but no room to grow. It's the same routine daily which is good because you know what your job is but that can get boring. Hardest part of the job is not losing it when customers disrespect you.
good,"I assisted in many aspects of customer service with these companies.  I also learned their computer systems, and followed company policies and procedures."
good,"It has been over ten years since i have worked there and everything has changed since then. i am not a good source of info on this one, I apologize. ."
good,"Can be stressful "
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my position I worked all three shifts and I found them very flexible until I was put on evenings permanently and I was on public transportation."
good,Not enough staff on to cover. It was extremely stressful all the time. You had to work 4 hours in the pharmacy even if you were a front store employee. Hours were crazy.
good,"It was a work environment for those who like to be on their feet and work at a fast pace most of the time. I worked very hard and went above and beyond in any way I could for both customers and my employees, yet I was routinely taken advantage of by certain other members of management. There was much cross-training that needed to take place as an ASM is required to work in all facets of the store including the Pharmacy. Which is one of the most difficult aspects of the job, knowing the store in its' entirety, knowing how everything works, and knowing the correct decisions to make in any given circumstance which are ever changing. Unfortunately that utterly necessary training is all online and up to your training manager to administer, and from my experience I learned much from other employees and training modules, but all on my own. The District Manager and the first store manager I ever worked for knowingly put me into a terrible situation, that would have been hard for even the most seasoned employees, one of the Mgrs. who was involved in hiring me told me later on ""yeah well, we knew we were gonna throw you to the wolves, it was a sink or swim kinda thing.""  However I made it through that situation and was never given as much as a pat on the back. Much of the upper management understands the need for great customer service and fair treatment of employees, but they understand it as something that only needs to be superficial. As long as everyone thinks that is the culture then everything will be fine. I would encourage working here if you know the store is a good environment"
good,Great entry level job if you want to grow with the company.  There is room for growth as a Store Manager or even in the pharmacy.  I enjoyed being about my coworkers.
good,Was a Pharmacy Technician while working at Walgreens. Never had a problem working there until I was a Sr. Pharmacy Technician. I was not able to advance myself any more unless I was a Pharmacist or left the pharmacy. I needed something closer to home.
good,"Being that i was the youngest member there in 2011 I felt that Walgreen's home health department was behind times on resources, searching the web for live time information.  But I'm sure now that its been 6 years I would hope that they utilize the internet more than when I worked there."
good,"Aumentar el salario ,darles las horas completas a los empleados ,y más seguridad en las tiendas ya que hay turnos de madrugada que no son seguros y de día también ocurren muchos delitos de robo"
good,"we a constantly watched we ar in prison ."
good,Walgreens is an alright company to work for. They under pay their technicians with many years of experience in my opinion. They are also most of the time under staffed.
good,Walgreens is always innovative. However they like to keep the staff very lean and this creates a ton of stress. The need for this impossible workload s due to poor decision making from corporate that causes the company to lose money.
good,The manager at the time was a little hard to get along with. The co workers were fun and entertaining. The customers were rememberable and funny. Currently the workers are rude.
good,"Truthfully the reason I love to work at Walgreens is my discount. My managers and my teammates are always helpful and supportive that is why I love to work when I can. "
good,"I liked working here, but what irritated me is that I worked my way up from a cashier to the senior beauty advisor, but then my manager was training me to be a supervisor, but when it came down to it he pushed it off then told me that he wasn't going to train me anymore because he didn't want to lose me as an employee."
good,Working there is fine. There is opportunity for advancement. It has its pros and cons. You must like working with people because you will encounter some great and not so great ones
good,"The job was great, fast paced and friendly environment. Sadly the new managers were less then stellar. Though taking them out the equation the job was great. The hours were flexible and the coworkers were always friendly. I worked with customers to help them make all kinds of projects from holiday cards to birthday banners."
good,"handling patients at check out area , and drive through ."
good,"Walk in, managers will provide you a task sheet. The task sheet will include what must be done for that day. You will assist customers in whatever they help in and you will also be at the cashier"
good,"I've been working with this company for over 14 years. I've seen many changes, but one thing is constant they require more and more workload for less pay."
good,"not at this time, over all the company has made many changes and I would like to work in a place that makes you feel wanted and cared for, its time for a change."
good,Tasks are increasing while compensation decreasing.  Just not happy with the trend of the company.  Corporate seems disconnected.  What is being asked of the employees do not seem to match the company goal.
good,Just not happy with the trend of the company.  Time to make a move for the good of my family.  Responsibilities are going up and compensation is going down.
good,Great to see different people everyday as well your regulars. Learned inventory management and how to manage a team as well. Workplace was fun and jobs were not hard...
good,"Very busy days, often 400-500 rx per day, usually staffed enough, but not always. Employee Stock options are definitely a nice part of benefits. Overall good place to work."
good,a typical retail pharmacy: stressful and fast-paced. Eventually you'll get used to it. The managers are great which makes your job a little easier. Customers are usually the one that makes it hard.
good,walgreens is a very fun place to work at with diverse culture especially if you work in the new york area. coworkers are very freindly and willing to help at anytime.
good,I learn a lot with this company it just that they went a diff way with the company doing pay cut to manager under staff in store and it just was not the place to work any more
good,"I loved my job there however management could've been a little bit better, also they only paid minimum wage and didn't give me full time hours and I needed more money"
good,"a typical day we would recieve many prescriptions type them in the system filling and providing the correct medication to the correct patient. "
good,"•	Communicate policy and procedure changes, system enhancements and clinical updates to all pharmacy staff."
good,"not much involved with being a cashier, checking peoples items. bagging items. collecting payments. on your feet a lot. fast paced when store has a lot of customers makes the hours pass pretty fast."
good,"I enjoyed working at the 24 hour location on Colorado Blvd and Mississippi.  It was a very busy store but the pharmacy team worked very well together.  It was organized chaos and i was very happy there.  The customers were, for the most part, regulars and enjoyed chatting with them about various topics."
good,I had personal issues with a Store Manager who would not consider me to be promoted even though the rest of her management team encouraged me to seek advancement opportunities.
good,"They want to be as bid as Walmart, it is very stressful to work there.  You have to spend half your time trying to drum up business, instead of doing your job."
good,"If you don't want to work in a retail location, this isn't the internship for you. It was good experience but you will work nights, weekends, and holidays."
good,Fine job. Retail is just not my end goal in life. The pay wasn't great but I imagine I could have gotten paid more if I had moved up in position or requested for it.
good,Pretty easy day. Definitley learn how to deal with all types of customers. Pay isnt great for the amount of work asked from employees. Reasonably flexible with hours. Sometimes give a hard time with scheduling
good,I didn't really enjoy working in the pharmacy department however the company itself was not a terrible company to work for. It was very stressful at times but I had a great manager
good,"outgoing co workers and respectful. everyone gets along."
good,"over all, it was very fast passed. it was a busy store, with not enough people working. some people worked well together, some didn't. people were in and out of working for walgreens."
good,"A typical day in retail is overall rewarding and full depending upon "
good,"It was easy going, i learned to avoid confrontation from any of the workers.It helped me more to work on my Customer service and have a strong ability to talk with the costumers.Also, it helped me to find a way to resolve their problems to be satisfied.It also helped me to be more organized and take responsibilities. I'm satisfied with the work I have done because I am able to improve my abilities and my skills."
good,I learned a great deal about what it takes in the sales industry.  You have to be very outgoing and friendly and have a great attitude to make it in this field.  I gained experience in the management field
good,A typical day is that your running around a lot and what I have learned is working with the team and managing the team. The hardest part of the job is when people call off and you don't have enough employees. The most enjoyable part of the job is the great people and customers you meet.
good,summers were slow...cold & flu season super high volume..pharmacy manager didnt delegate tasks equally..great coworkers...no lunch breaks on high volume days
good,"The job was very slow paced but there were many tasks to do. the people in the environment were friendly, nice and helpful the customers were appreciative and job itself was well worth it overall."
good,"A typical day was clocking in and going straight to my assigned duty for the day whether it was cashier, cosmetics or on the floor, took my assigned breaks and finished my day with closing duties. I learned to adhere to the customers needs to the best of my ability until customer satisfaction is achieved. The management did there job to the best of their abilities. The hardest part of the job was feeling like there was so much to do but not enough time to get it done to my expectation. The workplace culture was very diverse and well needed. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact with the customers and being able to be apart of a corporation that is so widely recognized."
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job was the people, my fellow coworkers and the customers. Everyone working always made the best of it and it was very easy to converse and befriend the customers."
good,"lots of physical and mundane labor, organizing various convenience items and assisting customers with finding said items. management was inconsistent and communicated ineffectively."
good,It was an okay place to work. it is a good place for high schoolers to work. Management needs work and can defiantly be improved. Shifts were based on favoritism. I worked there for several years and people came in the door making more money than me.
good,"Worldwide company that can turn your job into a career. Great experience, benefits, suitable pays and flexible hours. No disappointments guarantee. Outstanding with environment with honorable team players."
good,"I've worked for Walgreens for three years and transferred. The manager I had tried to frame me, push me and then she fired me. Do not want to get into detail. I really enjoyed my work position and it bums me she did unforgivable things."
good,"I did almost everything . I worked overnights .So when the manager was doing the paper work, and other manager things I was the only one on the floor.I enjoyed the job."
good,"Good job to get customer service skills as well as people skills, and possibly pharm tech license and certification which equals job security. But, the company shows little care for its employees, as they are often over worked due to poor staffing (understaffed) and low hours available for scheduling. Compared to other companies, good place to start and get skills, but bad place to stay, over worked and under paid."
good,"Good place to work, but keep in my mind its not my career goal. Management could use some help. They've cut many hours and even people who clean and maintain the  outside. Not bad for 9.00 an hour"
good,It was a Smooth shift and friendly co-workers I enjoyed it there. Walgreens had me on my feet a lot though but I managed to enjoy it and work very hard
good,I would recommend this job to someone who isn't working at all. But someone who is already employed and enjoys the job that they are working already then I don't think I could recommend it.
good,"I only worked there for a short amount of time due to better employment opportunities. However, I enjoyed my time there very much. They kept the store very clean."
good,There were different managers every month. Each one had different expectations and rules. It was a confusing place to work. I was scheduled for long hours.
good,Walgreens is ok. I think it is a great job to start out with but it does not allow for more growth personally of within the company without consistent reminders and even then it is hard to start out at the register and move into the pharmacy.
good,"Customers are friendly and regular clients make it fun."
good,"I have learned a great deal at Walgreens. I have gained experience in customer service, inventory and clerical duties. The management staff is very helpful and love to train new employees. Depending on which store you are located the pace of customers might be different so you learn to adjust to your different surroundings. Overall Walgreens is a great place to work but its hard to advance above a Management role."
good,Started at Walgreens in high school as a part time job. Didn't expect to be there for so long however it wasn't a bad job to have. Unless you plan on moving up with the company it isn't good for long term.
good,Kept me busy whether it was customer service cleaning or stocking I was always  occupied with work. However it is a lot of work but good to experience the real working world.
good,"i enjoyed my time with company however i went as far as i could with them. no  advancement or raise offered. i had aset schedule mostly second shift unless sba was off then id fill in for her shift. put warehouse away, scanned for out product assisted customers with skin care and make up choices"
good,"Typical pharmacy tech job, depends on what store you're at on how busy you'll be. Walgreens is all about pharmacy so pharmacy staff is favored. Management is hit or miss. Vacation and benefits are good for retail, but holidays are required."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Walgreens, it was nice to get in the same patients/regular shoppers. The only downfall were some of the staff and hours getting cut due to low sales"
good,"Very fast paced. Extreme amount of phone calls. Daily calls to doctor offices, emergency rooms, and insurance companies. Transfer of prescriptions from other pharmacies."
good,"Worked at Walgreens as a floating technician throughout San Francisco, some stores were harder to work at than others such as in the Tenderloin. Learned a lot going to different stores"
good,"Walgreens was my first retail job and I must say it is a good place to start out if you are in school. I feel like I would have enjoyed working at walgreens more if I had better managers. Also pretty stressful, if you allow yourself to be stressed."
good,"Its nice for a while depending on the location and the customers. Just remember to always be courteous and you should do well. For the most part, the work is easy and enjoyable if you like helping people."
good,"Any time in a managerial position, you will have unfair demands.  However, you are not expected to deal with unproductive staff due to union or lack of support"
good,This was a decent place to work. The only real downside is that if you want to achieve something higher in than the Store Manager level you really should be a pharmacist.
good,"Provide Customer Service support to employees"
good,Liked the co-workers and customers.  Management was not impressive and very micromanaging.  One of the locations lost so many employees due to management in less than a year it would make your head spin.
good,"At Walgreens a typical work day may consist of working at register or in photo lab, or maybe stocking. You have to help with customers if they need help finding something or have questions. Answer phone calls about products we have. The managers are friendly and talk to you but make sure you are working. The workplace is easy to understand and small enough to know most locations of products. One thing though about Walgreens is that they do not give you hours when you ask, even when you ask them to multiple times. I'd say I enjoyed having such a good community to work in and was able to get to know most of the people there and become friends with a lot of them."
good,Walgreens is a busy pharmacy that have drive thrus. The company does not hire cashiers so the  technicians are left to do everything on there own. Pharmacist don't get many chances to interact with patients unless patients specifically ask for them.
good,"Love meeting and getting to know our customers.  Day to day operations can be challenging but an enjoyable experience.  There is no typical day of work, different every day."
good,working  at  walgreens    was  a  good  experience  even tho  the   hours  started  to  be  very  low       and  some  customers  were  very  rude and
good,Walgreens makes excuses for why they will not move you up in the company after making countless promises. Work here for pay not opportunity. Good starter or good side job until you find better. Not long term.
good,"Nothing was particularly terrible. There wasn't any bad things, except that the stockroom was a tad messy and kind of disorganized. However, there was a system, and a store-supplied coat to go into the cold part of the store."
good,"Typical retail job. Clock in, do your work, deal with customers, and clock out. This company has been going downhill, in terms of benefits and working conditions, for awhile now."
good,The job is decent as far as entry level. If you are looking for advancement then I would recommend moving to a different job or getting into a different setting.
good,Employee discounts are great!  Overall the customers are friendly.  Typical day consists of greeting customers and handling cash/credit transactions.  Low pay
good,"This is a great first job, it is easy to learn in all departments. The job doesn't require a lot physical effort besides being able to be on your feet for 6+ hours."
good,Ok if you want to be a shift lead. Responsibilities of a store manager when you're alone while getting paid $11.50 an hour. Work you to the bone for little money in that position.
good,Management needs a little improvement in terms of the way they speak to staffs. Very customer friendly environment and the workload is balance. Good team spirit as well.
good,"At 18 years my 3 job I guess I had expected a better management team than I had. I worked as a cashier, stocked and cleaned shelves but left to go work at the PCMC hospital due to the drama."
good,"i learned how to talk to customers and react in certain situations. my managers listened to my needs, for example, with school, etc. the hardest part was learning the technology. the most enjoyable part of my job was talking to customers everyday."
good,"The company has been great, I love my coworkers. You'll get a raise every year and if you have good management and are a good worker, you will be recognized for your hard work. The company just needs to get ahold of this ""change"" they are going through."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was learning my new position when promoted from Assistant Manager to District Trainer.  It helped me to be more outgoing and to get over my fear of presenting in front of a group.  It also taught me patience and to listen to people.
good,"This is a good company to work for if you want to work retail. Small stores so you're with a small staff that can become like family. If you want to move up in the company, you can and your manager and so forth will help you forward. It's hard some days because this is a small store and so sometimes feels understaffed. Be prepared to help customers and get to know pharmacy. If you have an open schedule it feels a little abused at times, but it does give you a chance at OT as well."
good,Was a good place to work just ready to expand my horizons with a new company that offers better training and more productive people and employees to work with.
good,The work is very hard in my opinion..not for the pay. Retail pharmacy is way harder than the hospital. If they pay a little more and hire more staff it would be much better.
good,"Pay for Assistant Manager is low. Job is interesting, many tasks."
good,"You have to be friendly with customers, smile, be flexible and do your best. Try to keep busy. Be willing to do different jobs as required. Working together with good coworkers is very important."
good,"My experience at this Pharmacy was amazing loved, everyone I worked with. Unfortunately there was no room for me to be hired on at this Pharmacy but I am thankful for the experience."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers find what they are looking for. Answering questions about where things are located within the store. Bringing a smile to someone's day, brings one to my own face for the rest of the day."
good,Walgreeens was a great experience for me.  I loved working eight hour days.  Walgreens decided to have us work 12 hour days certain times of the week.   It is a long day and not heathy for anyone.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job for me was completing tasks well and in a thought-out intelligent manner."
good,Its just like any other retail job. The best benefit is the discount you get on products. But for a teen starting out its a great job to get your foot in the door.
good,"make sure you have a good rated store "
good,Working for Walgreens was ok at times but majority of the time it was a nightmare especially when I was promoted to the pharmacy. Most of the problems came from upper management. A few of the managers were very unprofessional and showed favoritism towards certain employees. The system of the pharmacy was not up to par and we always had upset customers. It was a headache!
good,"A decent place to work, it's not to bad you get one 30 minute break and the shifts aren't too long ,it really all depends on the store manager and the shift leads on how your experience will be."
good,Nothing amazing it was just a volunteer service through the actual job itself nothing more nothing less. helping those in need is just a basic traist of being kind to your fellow man
good,The pharmacy department was always understaffed and very busy.  Work sometimes became very stressful becasue of lack of coverage.  I feel like the company cared more about the dollar amout that thy will make then making sure that the staff and customers are well taken care of.
good,"I work as a shift leader for Walgreens. Work seems monotonous at times, but there is always new projects to engage in that will ensure personal and professional advancement."
good,Working in retail is always tough as there is significant pressure to deliver sales & earnings increases.  Pay raises do not come easily and culture is changing.
good,They deal with your schedule well. They typically give good hours. The pay is minimum wage and not very good. There are really no benefits to the job.
good,very slow. not many perks with work in sales department. enjoy the staff that I worked with but was not the best experience for me or the field of work that I was aspiring to do.
good,"Walgreens management structure just went through several major changes and I have to say, its total trash. As a company, there are so many instances of hypocrisy, I could no longer work there. Managers are extremely hit or miss and if you are unlucky to get the latter, you are in for a definite bad time."
good,I like working at Walgreens but I'm looking for a new career that pays more money so I can provide for my family. I have worked with a lot of managers. Some were nice and did their jobs faithfully and others had nasty attitudes an were slack in doing their jobs causing me to have to finish it before my shift ended.
good,"Walgreens was a great job, great people, an great customers. I will go back anytime just needed better security. Wagreens is a company were u can really build an build fast. There is no limit to how far u can go with this company if you are willing."
good,"Its a good place to work, very friendly people and pretty flexible with their hours depending on where you go to work. They worked well around my school schedule"
good,"I enjoy working at Walgreens. Most of the customers are really nice. I really like the crew at my store, we're a pretty tight nit bunch. Management is ok for the most part."
good,"High traffic during different points of the day with only a few store staffers. Hours are there but depending on the schedule you may be stuck with only closing shifts. "
good,"Hard to move up-hiring freeze. No opportunity to advance at store level, and corporate is on a hiring freeze. Tried to move up, but it's very hard with their current structure."
good,"Administrative duties include: answering telephones, greeting patients, updating and filing patients' medical records, filling out insurance forms. Answer phones"
good,"A typical day at work involves providing 100% customer service to customers.  I learned team work makes the job easier, management is great, good workplace culture.  The hardest part of the job making sure to ask each customer to purchase suggested sale item.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers and meeting new people."
good,"The only part of the job I really enjoyed to any extent was inventory day. Friday mornings, 5 am, our only goal to quickly and efficiently move an entire truck-load of boxes into our warehouse. No customers, just heavy lifting and teamwork."
good,"The summer can be very slow. Winter months are the busiest. They change managers often and have a high turnover rate. The pay sucks at least here in MN. The customers can be difficult as with any customer service position. It wouldn't be too bad if they paid better, but good managers can be very flexible and understanding."
good,It's an ok place to work. Co-workers were great. Some customers were too. But not all of them. Management was ok. Some managers better than others. Benefits were good.
good,"I gave 1 - 5 days on the vacation time because you rack up paid time off (PTO) hours as you work, and the rate depends on your position."
good,It's walgreens. Should not expect too much or too little. The location I worked has since been shut down because the area was too violent. You can expect strong support from management
good,"I've been a pharmacy technician at Walgreens for 10 years. The upper management views technicians as disposable and offers little incentive to stay.  There is a high turn over of pharmacy techs because there is little time designated to training. There is no room for advancement after becoming a Senior Technician, unless you're interested becoming a store manager. I've enjoyed working with great people, it would be nice if there were incentives offered to long term committed employees."
good,"this is a great way to begin getting job experience when starting out in the work force. you get discounts on all products and services, and medicine is cheaper."
good,"handling cash, greeting customers, handling complaints, printing/developing pictures, making displays, ordering, stocking, marking items down, demonstrating products"
good,"It is very busy most of the time, job itself isn't hard but the job is too monitored. Becomes stressful. The environment becomes hostile when managers are not getting what they want. There is no flexibility for when a personal day is needed or for switching. Difficult work/life balance"
good,This was one of the first jobs that I ever had and it was ok.  It seemed like they asked you to do a lot of things besides the job that you were hired for.
good,"Was a good place to work, definitely at my location very fast past and sometimes stressful, but overall the efficiency of their system is pretty well designed."
good,Some days are hard work and some day are easy work. You got to have some customer service experience because you got to be able to help the customer when they need assistance
good,"The store I mainly work at is very, very fast paced. Taking care of customers in the lobby, drive thru & phones. Data entry, insurance/billing, filling, putting up the order, checking out dates. Everyone I work with is very friendly & very good at their job.What I like the most is how quickly the day goes by due to the pace & efficiency of all the employees. The hardest part of my job is selling 10 packs of syringes to the heroin users & working short staffed due to all the hours that are cut on a regular bases."
good,"A typical day at work for me would include working in the cash office. I also work in the pharmacy, photo department and the warehouse. I find that I am constantly running from one department to the next. I help out in customer service, hanging up price tags and replenishing merchandise. "
good,"I was completing my externship for pharmacy technician at Walgreens, so I can't honestly say anything about the job security etc. However my wife is employed by Walgreens and overall from what I can tell it seems to be a decent place to be employed, but I do know from my externship time that the pharmacy is very busy and fast paced. I personally liked that because I work well under pressure."
good,"The hardest part of the job is customer service and the most enjoyable part of the job is team work. A typical day at work involves receiving, typing, and filling hundreds of prescriptions as well as resolving other issues such as insurance and inventory. It is a fast pace environment which encourages team work and self motivation."
good,"Walgreens provided me the opportunity to pay my own way through community college. However, as a service clerk there wasn't much chance for advancement without a college degree, but the advancement opportunities there were, would not have allowed for continuing formal education."
good,I enjoyed working for this company was able to move up in different departments in a matter of months.  Really enjoyed co-workers and the pharmacy staff.
good,Very easy place to work if you are just starting out. There isn't a lot of room to advance unless you stay for 10 years then try to move up. Overall was an ok place.
good,from customers to coworkers and working there is never anything not being done it is always a steady fast paced job with wonderful people working in it.
good,"No family time; lunch time; break time should pretty much sum it up for people. If you want an employer who ultimately cares very little about your health or well being, sign up."
good,"It is ok to work here as a starting job into the work field, I dont recommend turning it into a career, very long days and minimum wage pay. No job security offered on site, also in a very busy area."
good,Being a pharmacy technician is a lot of work for no pay. I seemed to work more than pharmacist typically and was payed less. Only way to advance or increase in pay is if you pass the Pharmacy Test.
good,"Cool company, decent pay, decent hours. I'd work there again if given the chance. You're not stuck doing one thing your whole shift which keeps it interesting"
good,Its a very quick work place.  Unloading trucks by hands and putting producted on pallets. Its a pretty good company to work for. They have a very good staff and hard working employees.
good,A typical day of work consists of being on your feet 100% of the time. Managers are bias and you have to learn on your own. Hours are being cut therefore there isn't a lot of work available.
good,"Not as busy, with no customers, was able to learn other parts of the job. friendly coworkers, got to know the customers by name. management was very kind and had open door policy"
good,This job was very productive to me.  A typical day at work would be interacting with adults and the elderly.  You get a lot of people bringing in coupons and wanting to take photos.
good,"Walgreens was very flexible when it came to my school schedule. When I first started in 2014, I absolutely loved it. My coworkers were great, management was phenomenal. As soon as management changed, it went downhill."
good,It's a a great place to work and they offer advancement opportunities. I enjoyed the staff that I work with and everyone was willing to help each other out. It's a lot of work and you need to put in a lot of dedication to run the Cosmetics department. But overall it's nice to work there.
good,"Pros"
good,"Relatively quiet. Heavy lifting.  Lots of standing and walking.  Retail means difficult customers.  Doing photo orders is fun.  Every non-pharmacy employee does a little of everything, such as front cashier, photo, cosmetics, janitorial cleaning, ect. with some focus on your position.  Lunch breaks are 30 minutes, which usually means 10 to get food, 10 to scarf it down, and 10 of actual rest"
good,This is a great place to work if you're new to the workforce or as  a part-time job as a senior. The store itself generally clean. but that's because they make the employees clean the whole store unless a manager is responsible for the cleaning then it dosesn't get done.
good,"This was an okay place to work. I wish my store got more hours so that I could work more, but it is okay. The corporation as a whole is not bad. They seem to appreciate people."
good,I liked working there and the people were always friendly. It got stressfull sometimes just doue to all the patinets going. Overall good place to start as pharmacy tech.
good,"The work is hard and is constantly busy. The wage does not match the work, CVS pays more an hour, but they are even more miserable. The skills are useful, but work days are always stressful. No real pride in work."
good,Since Walgreens was bought out about 2 years ago the company does not value its employees. They feel as if every one is replaceable and it has killed company morale.
good,"Fast paced , working with public. Multitasking is very important and flexibility. Pharmacists were friendly and helpful. Cross training opportunities. Good for an entry level position."
good,"Your average highschool job, works around schedule, nice hours. Easy to switch schedule if things happen. Very good job for teenagers to grow in before starting adulthood"
good,It's not a terrible place to work. I would honestly continue to work there is there were not so many changes in hours and if my job had something to do with my field of study.
good,"This can be a high volume atmosphere (depends on location). Metric driven company, constantly seeking new ways of improvement.  Possible advancement for employees depending on the setting."
good,"A day at work would be to clock in, and see where you were assigned to that day. Photolab, Cashier, Stocker, or On the floor."
good,"A typical day at Walgreens begins at 7 AM when I walked through the doors and greeted everyone with a smile. Clock in for my shift, count the drawer and let the day begin. Management was fair and easy to get along with. I enjoyed giving great customer service and would recommend this job to anyone who is looking for an extremely part time job."
good,Management did their job timely and well. Corporate gave benefits and raises. Overall a good place to work. Flexible hours and schedule was accommodating.
good,Loved the fact of meeting new customers daily and knowing that others had worse health issues than others. I learned a lot working with my fellow employees.
good,"Fast paced, forward moving environment.  Dealing with angry customers sometimes challenging, but teaches patience and composure.  Enjoyed always having work to do and people to interact with."
good,The position is supposedly under the admin group but we don't work admin hrs (M-F). Job is easy most of the time. Supervisor isn't so bad. Mixed culture environment.
good,"A typical day started with a sales meeting, inventory control and stocking shelves with new and existing products for customers. My work day also includes placing products on sale with new discount pricing to attract more sales."
good,great place to work at and the people are friendly. Manager like to expand there knowledge by training. The surrounding is great and be love to work there.
good,"Annual salary is 40,000 and the 401K is 3.05 for every dollar you invest. They promote store manager only from within which is good and bad. Good, because the store manager, in most cases, started as a cashier and could end up as a store manager, district manager, or regional manager. Bad, because without the right training you can be promoted too fast and become nothing more than a gloried stockboy who never learned the proper leadership skills needed to have successful staff."
good,"Afferent, or sensory, receptors are responsible for detecting or responding to a stimulus acted on the body. There are four main classifications of these afferent receptors that each respond to a different type of stimulus. There are chemoreceptors which respond to chemical stimuli, mechanoreceptors which respond to a mechanical force placed upon them, thermoreceptors which respond to changes in temperature, and nociceptors which respond to noxious or harmful stimuli. Once a stimulus is detected by one of these afferents the signal is sent via a unique pathway for each receptor type to create an overall perception. In three exercises, we examined four receptor properties."
good,"the company cares more about the bonuses the upper management gets, than they do about the employees. I have been working with them for 15 years, and I dont think they appreciate their employees at all!!!"
good,"great work experience working with people,"
good,Do not want to place my personal feelings regarding a job on the internet. I rather keep my personal feelings regarding this company confidential rather than public .
good,I liked working here was my first job pay was ok at the time you know i learned a lot here working on the register and the photo dept also stocking shelves and closing in the night woth the manager was good times
good,I started the job in 2006.When I started there it was first known as DRUGSTORE.com. I didn't plan on being there as long as I was. Ten years went fast.
good,Walgreens is a great company with many opportunities to move up in management. The company is not for everyone as sometimes it is tough to balance depending on position.
good,Working at Walgreen's is only okay if you're a high school student or if you need a little extra money. I like the people I work with but the town that I live in has rude customers/patients.
good,"i was hired on as a pharmacy cashier, have been licensed, and promoted. This is a great community starter job.its very fast paced and as a beginner you are kind of thrown into the fire from day 1. but you eventually catch on and learn how to process insurance and resolve customer issues, and then your fine."
good,"A typical day begins with clocking in, going straight to your department and not stopping until your break time. I've learned a tremendous amount about multi-tasking, working efficiently under pressure, and staying patient no matter what the situation. The team members are nice. Management is good at the store level. Constantly being scrutinized by upper management. Hardest part of the job is being asked to meet unrealistic goals. Most enjoyable part of the job is when you know you've made at least one person's day better."
good,"The employees were okay to work with, there were a few with attitudes that were not pleasant to have around customers. The management are extremely rude. They have no respect for their employees and treat people as if they are beneath them."
good,"I am appreciative to Walgreens for giving me a job but the company is growing too big.  It's obvious the head honcho's care more about their profit margins than the well-being of both the employees and their customers.  With the acquisition of two major insurance contracts, our daily prescription count increased by 40%.  While we acquired that additional business, Walgreens is attempting to purchase another company to increase their US North East market.  Because of this, they decreased our hours by 15% so that they can fund their acquisition.  So we are producing 40% more with less help than last year by 15%.  This adds stress on the employees as they are being asked to do more with less help.  The company also did not compensate for the increase in business and stress per employee.  The more stress the employees have the less positive customer service interactions.  Many of us have grown tired of the constant strain of expectations placed on us by the company with no benefit to the employees.  My Pharmacy manager is an amazing manager and we are exceeding expectations of the company but not one employee is happy with their job.  If I were upper management I would do my best to increase employee morale because as of now it is at an all time low and many of my co-workers are looking for alternative careers."
good,"Iffy company but the managers care about you. Great after school job, pay can be a bit funky make sure you are tracking it. can be a bit boring at times."
good,"I worked at Walgreens for almost. I began working there in Arkansas and quit after I moved to Pennsylvania. At both stores, I had issues with the management. The thing that I can say is, the transfer process is quick and easy."
good,"Fast paced work environment. Opportunity to learn new tasks. New management still learning the flow. Hard to plan things after work, hour call changes"
good,good company to work retail at if you are a high school student looking for a part time job or a full time college student looking for part time work.
good,"The mood during a typical work day is very relaxing and productive."
good,"Laid back, some work is tedious, few coworkers, days are flexible but the hours can be long, fair break schedule, coworkers become close to you, low pay"
good,i had been working for walgreens because i go to school full time and the hours are flexible for me. but i also need a different job for the summer and if can to keep it for as long as they will allow me
good,"Working as a cashier making sure it is clean, customer friendly environment responsible for the front of the store..Making sure all the prices and new tags are correct. Walking down isles and facing products, filling in the spaces, and stocking shelves. Older products in the front and new ones in the back. Checking expiration dates on the products on the floor. Customer first priority. Getting to know them by name and up selling them when you could. Receiving orders and checking them of the invoice. Photo department developing film, completing orders for calenders, posters, etc. Taking passport photos and helping customer print photos from their devices. Products more expensive than other stores. Wages lowest pay in comparison to other stores low."
good,"If you like to be seating in a desk for 10 hours a day just doing one thing this is the dream job!!! Is really repetitive. Management not the greatest if you need a day off good luck finding coverage!! Everything is done thru emails, nothing face to face, is a robotic atmosphere. Not for everyone ."
good,Walgreens served well as a first job for me the benefits where not the worst. i moved up in the ranks pretty quickly almost 1 promotion every year. the rate of pay needs to be increased tho
good,"A typical day at work goes by somewhat fast. You greet people as they come in, answer any questions they have, ring them up and bag their groceries, and tell them to have a great day. I learned that everybody has their own way of doing things but it all works out the same way. There is more than one way to meet your goals. The management is great. There's a couple leaders that need better training. It's not a bad place to work. The hardest part is dealing with customers that woke up on the wrong side of the bed and everything is just terrible no matter what. The best part is feeling like you're apart of a family when you're with the right coworkers and leadership."
good,my first job and i really enjoyed it just wished the management were better and the pay ares would be reasonable. but i loved working here and glad i got a hance to work for the company
good,"Walgreens as a company is very mediocre, they pay just above minimum wage with minimal benefits.  The work isn't very hard but the work pace is slow and unmotivated."
good,"Overall, Walgreens can be a fun place to work depending on the people you work with and the managers you work for.  I would recommend Walgreens to anyone who is looking for a job to start out their careers."
good,Working at walgreens was a helpful step in the next direction that I wanted to go towards. It was always busy so their was always something to do. It just was not the right fit for me personally.
good,"didnt really like this job it was so unorganized on the scheduling and the people where only friendly when they wanted to be, but i always maintained a professonal attitude."
good,Overall great company. There are many changes since merger. Many people within the company need to be trained better. Wish there were more room to grow with this company.
good,Gain experience. Nice work environment... you learn a lot in a short period of time. Pharmacists are nice and willing to help an answer any questions you may have
good,If you like getting hired for full time work you will be very disappointed only because work is slow and not enough of hours to give out. I drive 45 minutes away to work and most of the time get sent home after working 4 hours daily.
good,"The job was not too strenuous. The demands were usually fair. At times, the manager could be rude and disrespectful. The pay wasn't bad. There were never too many complications with customers."
good,"•	Receive written prescriptions, refill requests and verify information completeness and accuracy of information."
good,"I usually worked on the main register and stocked the front of the store. My schedule was almost always 3:15 to 10:30, and a 30 minute break. At the end of every shift you had to do your returns and fix things on every shelf."
good,"Required a lot of standing and long hours of work.  Managers expect you to stock a lot of supplies, open and close the store. More work for such little pay."
good,Pretty decent job. You are standing over 7-8 hours a day and it gets very tiring and boring. It is not very challenging but they are long day ahead but overall an ok job.
good,"Walgreens is a good company to work for if you need a flexible work schedule if you are going to school, or have another job. They offer a variety of departments to work in."
good,This is a good place to start off for the first time job. Did not really show how to do much jobs. Training was two days and you had to figure out how to do things on your own.
good,"It's a very good company but it doesn't pay enough money. The hardest part of the job is dealing with unpleasant customers, most of the time we check supplies to see if they are outdated, ensuring we give good customer service."
good,Good store to work or shop at. Employees here always smiled and were very helpful. The pay may be good for teenagers still in highschool but overall a good place to work
good,When the company want to close the store they just layoff the employees and hard to get transferred to other store. But employees are friendly and advanced.
good,The Pharmacy Manager is very friendly. But be aware because he will turn on you to save his self. He tries to make sure that all employees are treated fair.
good,Only with the company for six months.  Challenging time due to company acquisitions.  Staff had to relocate office and change leadership.  Normal issues you would expect during an aquisition.
good,Employees were typically trained in all areas regardless of the area they were hired for. Much was expected with little time and people. Some opportunity to advance but not into different areas.
good,"I did not work there for to long, but it was a great place to work. It was my first job and I did not enjoy the phamarcist who handle my sickness as a nonconcern but everyone else was great."
good,a typical day at work consists of constantly being on your feet and attending costumers. It is also required to wear clothes according to the dress code.
good,A typical day at work was very busy and always kept you on your toes. I learned that you always have to pay attention to your surroundings cause you never know.
good,"As an employee with Walgreens, I think the store is pretty good to work for. Of course you have your good days and bad days, but the open door policy applies which is good."
good,"I enjoyed helping others with whatever they needed.This was a fast paced job where there was always something to do,no time for boredom. Over all absolutely enjoyed cosmetics."
good,This company went down hill. cutting jobs and positions to keep their profits high. Letting go of long term employees that were more qualified and better at their position to keep less paid underqualified employees
good,A very unique place to interact with patients. This is a great place to help patients improve their lives and live better. I learned here greatly. It was for me a very positive life experience and is a life changer. It is indeed good to have direct interaction with patients.
good,"great place to start a job, meet a lot of people and learn how to stock and pull shelf. great coworkers and management. the benefits was great and you can transfer to a store near you."
good,it is a very strict professional atmosphere with nice coworkers who are very positive and motivating. I enjoyed my time from the consistent work schedule to upbeat bosses.
good,"Walgreens is a decent company to work for. The one positive I can say is that they produce strong thick skin employees and leaders of the future. They are are always looking for ways to stay competitive and relevant. The higher the management level, the less of a home life you have. You will realize quickly a day off is. It really a day off. Unfortunately you get use to it over time"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting customers and forming relationships with them. I learned superior customer service skills while working here.
good,I was a decent place to work. I was an outside sales rep so it was not the store front  management was very uninvolved and almost seemed to not know was going on ever.
good,great experience to work with people as a customer service representative to help patients that are sick feel comfortable in the pharmacy while purchasing there medication.
good,Structure makes the job very challenging especially and not well kept stores. I was in a store that had many store managers in the last couple years and it made it very difficult to deal with
good,Work can be slow and boring at times. It was a very peaceful environment. Have to be social and have the ability to deal with others. Have to be able to lift at least 40 pounds. Have to be able to stand on your feet for long periods of time. The best thing was this was an internship for me. The managers were very nice and understandable.
good,"Very, very, poor management. Not a good learning environment. My pharmacy manager was very impatient and critical and quick to cut you down for any mistakes."
good,Loved working for Walgreen's. Very nice organization. Many regular customers you had grown to love. Nice and clean environment. Pay wages where worth it. And had a very nice manager.
good,I used to work with a great team at Walgreens and everything went smoothly until they switched management The store hasn't run the same since. I wished that they hadn't done so otherwise id still be working there today
good,"Working here was very stressful. There is no opportunity to consult patients and as part of the staff, you're just working like a robot. The work culture was not very friendly at all."
good,I have been working for Walgreens for 11 years.  And in those 11 years alot of changes have been made to where it made work not fun anymore.  I had alot of responsibilities but was not compensated enough for what I was doing for this company.  I use to love going to work and always gave them 100% of my work ethic.  I worked very hard and Walgreens as a whole did not recognize my hard work.  I recently stopped getting raises because I was capped out for my job position.  I would have become Management but I would have lost pay and the position of SFL was not a good position because it wasn't worth it.
good,Being a employee at Walgreens was a pretty good experience for me because I learn a lot of custermer service experience. This job gave me a little taste of what it would feel like if I had a real job
good,At first I was intimidated by the other technitions for the speed and accuracy. But after a week my I become my pace was just as quick as the actual employees.
good,"I have worked at Walgreens for over 13 years, and overall it is a decent place to work, but not as good as it used to be. The compensation as far as wage is good, the insurance is not very good.  The management team tries well does pretty good. The hours can be a bit much at times with the overtime, if you enjoy working it it's not bad though.   Some of the starting times for shifts are a little much, such as mine starts at 4 AM and that's a little hard to get used to.  Most departments work for 10 hour days per week"
good,"good place to learn new experience,     you should count in yourself no one will help you. very poor salary.. just you lean something knew and a lot of coworkers are so freindly"
good,"employers were easy to work with "
good,"No chance for advancement... You have to work most holidays."
good,"I worked the weekend shift. The employees and management were great. I worked cashier. The biggest pet peeve I had about this job was that even though you treated the customer with great customer service, many would be extremely rude to you. Nevertheless, working here was a wake up call to hit the books hard. For that, I am grateful for the experience."
good,"first job after i turned 16. company was a top 5 retail company at the time. after bad moves by the board, employees got demoted and everything went downhill. as a result, good managers were put in bad stores and bad managers were put in good stores. this never worked out. it just made the good workers leave faster."
good,"It was okay, other employees and managers were nice. Lots of standing around sometimes. Sometimes there was work place drama among employees. Lots of stocking."
good,"I really don't know what to say about Walgreens, however it is a company that is great to start off with as far as experience. There are rare opportunities at Walgreens if you want to move up into management."
good,"I mean its a pharmacy/convenience store. What more do you expect, pays alright for what you do I guess. I think it could be more. You'll do a little of everything here."
good,I was a floating tech and enjoyed going to different stores.  Management was wonderful.  Pay was good.  I have nothing else more to say.  It is a great place to get a start into pharmacy.
good,"It's a great place to get your feet wet but then you should continue to move up and hopefully move on. "
good,"I enjoy working with the customers the most. There is never a dull moment working at Walgreen's. During down time, we all help out each other and that's what makes the time go by faster."
good,"The pharmacy position really intrigued me. However I quickly found out after my training that it's simply nothing but another retail job. The ""patients"" are really customers and it just made me really sad to see how this industry operations from the inside. I have a passion for chemistry and medicine but now I can care less."
good,"As a pharmacy retail company, the challenges that arise are the medical coverages in your pharmacy.  Customer service is a very important part of the job.  The way that our economy is changing, it is very important to have the skill set of how to handle employee's so they are able to communicate with your customers and patients."
good,"excellent  and fun,hard working,very polite,greet customers,warm welcoming.There is no hard part,most enjoyable part is getting  to know our customers.best job"
good,it a good job to work at but y'all doesn't have light duties jobs. Some of the boxes are heavy. They are very nice people. They have a lot of good benefit.
good,a typical day at work is good and fast pace but not overwhelming fast. Good way to gain more customer service skills.The staff was ok. Overall walgreens is a good place to work their benefits are good also
good,"Walgreens' management was unbalanced.  Some managers were serious about the future of the company, and some were not.  I was not properly trained to begin with.  It took me about four or five months to actually figure out what responsibilities I had.  I had to quit because I could not juggle both school and work."
good,"A typical part-time position in a customer-care position.  The location was very particular about using Company Standard greetings, though the standard hasn't been seen at any other locations.  Great management with a care for their employees.  Compensation was on par with other similar light duty jobs, but not adequate to support a one-person household."
good,Over all a good job if your just there fora paycheck. They don't require a lot just to be friendly and show up. Perfect as a first job and for students.
good,I had a horrible experience being employed by this company. my superiors and coworkers were all hateful. so much so that i had to quit. i did not feel accepted and their rudeness was making my job unbarable.
good,Worked there for 5 years. Other than upper management pushing for minimal payroll hours leading to skeleton crews it isn't a horrible job. I left because I wanted more.
good,Too many calls to get anything done at this store. employees are over worked and not benefited. Stress level is always at a high. some of the employees are nice.
good,"There are way too many tasks to do in one day to realistically think one is ahead. Too many calls, not enough employees to answer them. Pharmacy is always slammed."
good,I enjoy working for the company overall. Your typical day at work is enjoyable and goes by fast. I learned that each store manager and assistant store manager has their own style of managing. The hardest part of the job is not having enough hours for full time employment. The most enjoyable part of the job is building different relationships with the employees and customers.
good,"This job is okay to a certain extent but really makes you perform and do duties that suppose to be done by a shift lead or manager. Not saying that all walgreens is like that but I've worked at two, my last one because I transferred back home after I finished college. Don't plan on working for this company much longer."
good,The work space can be fun but challenging at times because of the various and different customers that you can meet. some days are good and some days can be bad.
good,"Under staff for the work load, wont hire full time, after hire they reduce hourse, over if you have a good manager that cares about the employees the manager will take care them otherwise you will need second part time job"
good,"A typical day included cashiering, stocking and cleaning. As my first job, I learned plenty about customer service and money handling. Management experience varied. Overall the workplace culture was tolerable. The hardest part of the job was working with irate customers, but the most enjoyable part was getting familiar with the rest of the customers and helping out as much as I could."
good,"I work with great staff.  However, the company overall does not particularly care about the lower end employees.  A typical day at work is usually really busy and the phones are ringing constantly.  The company has yet to fix the phone system which makes the customers mad.  What I've learned from working there is the company does not care much about the individuals that make the store run.  All they care about is numbers."
good,I actually really enjoyed working here . I just was too young to realize it. If I had an opportunity to work here's again I will. Very simple job. I was on registers and also on the floor stocking items. Certain days we would get truck with product be we would unload and fill aisle with them
good,Over the last 7 years walgreens has gone in a negative direction in my opinion. I feel that they care more about money than the employee. When I first started I felt like they cared about my advancement in the company and were there to help me move forward. Now I feel like I'm stuck with no where to go.
good,Learning all the departments was a great experience. Finding the one department you have a great passion to work in. The staff were great always helping and answering any questions.
good,"Job was great.  People were great and the atmosphere was also great.  Benefits could be better, management can be better, but the job culture was okay."
good,Was nice and never over crowded and always kept you busy. Had fun and reliable co workers. one manager was a sexist . Never was too much to handle on the job
good,"typical starter job, ok location, make sure breaks are taken, mostly busy work, sups. are professional but approachable. flexible hours, mostly only part time work."
good,They don't appreciate when you do over time and benefits suck. They don't pay enough and work you like a dog. When you need time off they wont give it to you even if your dying
good,"As a manager you have to be able to multitask. You will have many responsibilities such as overseeing daily operations in the pharmacy and on the front end. You have to take care of vendors, merchandising, payroll, scheduling, hiring, inventory, customer service and complaints, etc. You can progress in the company if you work very hard and know the right people. They will teach you some things but you have to be able to pick up quick and figure out a lot on your own.  You must also be flexible. They will relocate you without your approval."
good,"The work is typically easy nothing you can't learn "
good,No comment.  Company has decided to close the building that many work in after 10 years of service.  We were the east coast fulfillment center for online orders.  We serviced from Maine down to Florida.
good,"very busy and fast-paced. retail is very demanding, especially on and around the holiday seasons. get used to working with countless customers on a daily basis"
good,"Being in the corporate office, is very nice and team members all ways willing to help each other out in time of need. Different department head are very helpful to each other if you need help on taking a report or planning a meeting for training."
good,"Walgreens helped me to become certified, they sent me to school and reimbursed me for gas and time. They also paid for me to take my certification test but other than that they are a money hungry corporation. Most of the management staff is brain washed to only cover themselves and to not look out for the their most dedicated team members. They are only interested in helping themselves."
good,Walgreens is not bad but its not good either. There are a lot of requirements but it is strict on schedule because there aren't many people working there so if you cant make it then its a big deal. Overall it was fun just make sure you have communication with your manager and it will be okay.
good,"A lot of work with little pay that was intense and laborious. I did not like the work environment and thought there was not potential to grow, terrible hours to work too"
good,The customers were my favorite part of the job. Truck days were not all that great and very disorganized. I learned alot with this company. Pay could have been alot better.
good,good people to work with lot of physical work long hrs work lots of weekends and nights when i was there also did acct work computer work lots of customers
good,"Upon first arival I was eager to learn what goes on behind the scenes in my local Walgreens Pharmacy, the staff was very nice and seemed to get along well with one another.   The experince was greatly appreciated and helped me further my decision about what avenue I will take in the futrue when it comes to my career."
good,"Working here was just fine. Management was fine, staff was fine, customers were fine. Benefits were okay. Everything was mediocre so I left when I found  something better."
good,"I worked the overnight shift here and was blessed with a great manager. It was my first experience with selling alcohol and cigarettes and it prepared me for my current position today.  Most nights, we cleaned and restocked the store."
good,"While working at Walgreen's, I garnered strong customer service skills and product knowledge. I also became more familiar with handling cash and engaging a variety of customer transactions."
good,"Management could have been more lenient on days off when it came to family emergencies and losses. Also, more understanding when you are on new medication and it may be hard for you to do things, since they are the founded pharmacy since before time and all. All in all the training is great and the people are pretty great at my particular location. Management just lacks here on communication, they don't ever really let you say much they just speak over you as if they know what you are going to say. Just a bit different management and I would have stayed for life :)"
good,"over all was decent place to work I learned to use the kiva robot system to replenish and pick stock for customer orders"
good,Working at Walgreens was similar to what I do now at CVS. The store I worked at was always busy since it stayed open 24 hours. The management there was very poor which is why I finally decided to leave that company.
good,"This place has taught me a lot. It was known to be one of the busiest stores in my area and with one of the toughest store managers. I learned how to work during tough situations and handle the worst possible customers. My store manager was a great manager. She knew how to organize the store in the best possible way and how to make more profit. However, her people's skills weren't the best and the schedule was very difficult for me. I appreciated everything she taught me as a manager and i do like the opportunities this company gives people in order to get promoted."
good,"With flexible hours, one can be a student and work at the same time. As each semester schedule changed, I was able to adjust my availability and get some hours."
good,Great company on the macro level but the culture can be a little tainted in the micro level.  The culture varies from district to district.  I have been with the company for 13 years and I feel we have made a move in the wrong direction as it pertains to taking care of our employees
good,Too much to say other than it is quickly going downhill in terms of middle management and the constant differences that one area of the company is doing vs another.  What I mean is that the standard in one district may not be the same in another.
good,The work place helped me improve my skills as a pharmacy technician. I gained very great customer service skills. Helped patients in a timely manner and was also very efficient in assisting the pharmacist
good,the store was always clean and the company is great . the people there were nice to work around. The schedule always had enough hours. Money was not enough.
good,"It was a basic retail job, with some extra responsibilities as well. I was in charge of ordering items for the store and the Photo lab. I maintained the lab equipment, the chemicals and computers. I learned good ways to interact with customers and how to organize and maintain a work place. The hardest part of the job was maintaining chemicals, never been a fan of chemistry, but I learned everything I needed to know so I could do it well. The most enjoyable part was optimizing ordering for the departments I was in charge of and my own project of writing a manual of common problems and troubleshooting steps, to fix the lab equipment."
good,"Management is a contradiction, didn't know how to manage hours/ kept hiring people we did not need. You need to be on your toes, and work quickly. overall great place to work for  first job"
good,Working at walgreens was a ok job. there was barely enough work to be done to keep occupied. also the management was very bad and they would play favorites a lot.
good,"My assignments included tasks such as unloading the conveyor and loading shipment products into semi trailers. Consolidation ,  data entry and more tailor labor ."
good,"Walgreens is a nice place to shop once and a while, but to work there especially during holidays was brutal. I don't recommend for anyone who isn't patient with everyday people."
good,Walgreens was a fun place to work but managers don't see you as people just as pieces on there board. typical day is running between departments and dealing with complaints from employees while not having any real power as a shift lead to do anything
good,Everyone that seems to work there takes life's little challenges and makes a big deal about it. I'm so sorry you had to change the receipt tape and got a paper cut Becky.
good,Our pharmacy on average fills up 500 to 800 prescriptions daily. I enjoy helping our customers the most. Being able to provide our patients with a solution to an insurance issue makes me happy I have become a pharmacy technician. I enjoy the fast pace of my job. I believe the hardest part of my job is not being able to help some of our elderly patients fully understand some of the high cost of their medications. I have learned to become efficient at multi-tasking.
good,"after the restructure they have an unusual work flow, and high turn over because of starting wages and a low cap on pay, the top ranking executives are no longer pharmacy based."
good,It's been too long ago for me to fairly & accurately remember so I can not actually give a proper review. I did get the opportunity to work in multiple departments.
good,"As a whole, Walgreens Pharmacy provides great customer care. They truly care about their patients. However, the area I worked in was very understaffed and we were very busy, almost to the point where it became unbearable. Would recommend to work in an area that isn't too busy. They do provide good service and learning opportunities for pharmacy technicians."
good,"I was a cashier then a beauty ad visor. "
good,"It was a good place to work. I fared well until I counted money for a fellow manager while I was not on the clock. Mind you, I was asked to do many other things off the clock. I was terminated for this and so was the other manager. Be careful what you do at this company because they will find a reason to get rid of you if you make too much money there."
good,"A good place to work, typical day would be coaching employees on certain aspects of the company and what the company wants to drive at the time."
good,"After completing school and an externship at CVS. I spent many months seeking a job as a pharmacy technician. Finally I reached a very kind Pharmacist who gave me an opportunity as a new tech. I worked in a fast paced pharmacy. Our store had 24 hour pharmacy service. I prepared prescriptions, took new customer orders and worked the drive thru. My time at Walgreen's was a valuable learning experience."
good,"They couldn't keep good employees for long due to bad hour management and under staffing stores. Keep requiring more from you and give you less, as well as can't keep the same management in the same location for long went through 4 store managers in 3 years."
good,"Great place to work, very understanding company with a bright future. I've enjoyed working with Walgreens! The job teaches you a lot personally and professionally."
good,"Lots to do in retail sales. Always something to do like stocking and facing products, cleaning, assisting customers and checking out. Learned to make sales tags and cash count at the end of the night. Did not have any issues with management. Fairly relaxed work. Hardest thing for me was standing all the time, but I really enjoyed the interaction with the customers."
good,"This store was very unorganized, ran by poor management.  I basically had to do everything in this store from stocking, cashier, photo, cleaning, cooler, inventory, etc. I was doing way too much to just be getting paid minium wage. When I told them i was moving and needed to transfer they ignored me. When i left the whole store fell apart, lost manager and almost every employee. If I was a manager it would have been different."
good,A typical day included order entry of prescription information and customer service i.e. making sure customers got a good experience when coming into the pharmacy
good,very fun and exciting learned a lot about make up and was able to take control of my department manager at the time help me advance to pharmacy tech only reason I left
good,Typical hourly job good for HS kids . No real in depth training and hours shift alot depending on the season. Internal opportunistic people do best
good,"Walgreens is a good workplace overall, they work you too much. family does not seem to matter much and there is not much overtime stores are usually understaffed and overworked"
good,"I worked my best, but at this time in my careieer, I was pretty new. "
good,"A great place but it wasn't what I had needed, I am in need of a full time job which they were not able to provide to me. overall it was a great place to work for and they are very friendly people. I had learned a lot at this job given that is was my first job. I loved my costumers the most."
good,"A typical day at work is engaging with customers and co workers"
good,"I normally assisted customers with beauty care products: fragrances, cosmetics, hair care,  hair color, etc."
good,Interacting with customers is the most challenging and rewarding aspect of this profession.   You need to make yourself heard or you can get lost in the shuffle.
good,I had been there just for two months for internship. manager and pharmacists  are nice and helpful people. it was one of the busy pharmacy and it is open 24 hours and also it has car thru. i had learned fill prescription.
good,good job for young adults just entering the workplace. Flexible hours. Willing to work with student's class schedule.
good,I have a lot of control of my emotions but this job is not for people who cant handle bad management skills terrible ephathy bad manners an so on so forth just very bad management
good,"customers vary from day to day no day is ever the same"
good,"It was very hard to move up at this store, every senior position was filled, and no knowledge of other stores job openings were posted in sight. Hours were always inconsistent from week to week."
good,"As an ASM for Walgreens, it is imperative for you to learn and apply multitasking skills, as well as time management skills. The typical work day is not only spent managing your staff but also completing your own assignments that come the store manager, district manager, and from Walgreens HQ."
good,"I worked as a Customer Service Associate at the Walgreens flagship store in San Francisco. Things that every CSA does at work is fairly easy for me. I like the management team at this facility because they're approachable, but since the weary graveyard shift has never quite work our for me, I had resigned in the end."
good,Students are given an opportunity to be self dependent and are encouraged to take up responsibilities and overcome problems by handling situations appropriately.
good,"While I wasn't technically hired by Walgreens nor was I payed by them (an external program was in charge of that), I still have no real complaints about my time there. My opinion of the job I had there is lukewarm at best. I will say that I enjoyed assisting the elderly in finding what they need as it would always make my day, but that's just me."
good,"Walgreens is not a bad place to work, they just do not provide enough hours or pay enough for me to even live.  I loved the customers wish I could take them with me I will miss them a lot.  I wish they wouldn't change store managers as much it just makes everyone start all over just like starting a new job and it was very stressful for the younger employees who were starting their first job."
good,I advanced from sales associate to senior beauty advisor within just a few months. I had a lot to learn in a little amount of time. I feel as though we could have been a bit more organized as far as tasks and work divided.
good,"Good work, a lot of work, personnel good people. Overall is was hard job but learned a lot while working for this company, no regrets, got me where I am right now."
good,"Your routine retail job, big company, many employees, managers were good, hours were okay, seemed to have a higher turnover rate of employees. You should really enjoy customer interactions to work at walgreens."
good,"Enjoyed working there, unfortunately too far to travel, nice co workers, duties were and tasks were easy to accomplish, hours were great, commute were the only problem."
good,"Typical day at the pharmacy was routine.....calling MD's in the morning to verify prescriptions and add refills, filling the day's requested refills from patients or new ones brought in by patients, and counseling patients throughout the day in person or via phone."
good,"when the merchandise come to the store I help pack it into the store , I enjoy working at Walgreens I don't mind stocking and putting items where they before."
good,Loved it was just to busy for the small amount of people they had working. Working till midnight was the hardest part. I loved bring able to take care of the customers
good,"Overall, not a bad place to work, the hours I was scheduled helped me to finish school.  Management could be a little better, but all in all, not a bad company to work for."
good,"A typical day at Walgreens can be stressful if we have a lot of customers that day, or if we have a lot of customers with ""problems"" that day that put us behind. There are days when we don't have many customers, so those are more relaxed, and we can spend that time getting caught up on all of our side work. Walgreens always has lots of busy work for techs to do to keep them occupied. So if you think you have nothing to do...think harder! The days are long. The breaks are short. Employees get a 30 minute unpaid lunch break, and are supposed to get 2 paid 15 minute breaks if they work 8 hours, but.....good luck with that if you work in the pharmacy! You will get your lunch! They will be furious if you don't take your lunch because you will risk getting overtime! But forget the breaks! You are lucky if you get to leave long enough for a bathroom break! Oh, and did I mention you can forget overtime? Unless you work for a bigger store.Labor hours are always the first thing to be cut from the budget at Walgreens, so sometimes hours will be cut. The hours given to a store will be based on that store's prescription volume. However, the hourly rate, for techs and other employees, is higher than some of Walgreens competitors. Walgreens will pay to train, certify, and license pharmacy techs, and will provide continuing education courses for techs to recertify. The insurance and benefits seem to be good. You can choose your medical, dental, and vision coverage options, which is nice. The prescription insurance is good. I haven't gotten a medicine yet that hasn't been $5, and there is a"
good,"Would walk in and sometimes would right away have to start helping the line at either pickup, drive thru or dropoff.  At a certain time I would have to rotate to a different station and perform the duties that were required at that station.  I would sometime be called over to counsel a patient on their medication."
good,"Once was a great company to work for, would've considered a career here. Management seems like it's become sloppy over the years. Used to call work ""Walgreens Family"", seems divided now. Overall a job is a job."
good,"The company strives to deliver everyone's right to be happy and healthy. Highly capable,hard working colleagues make the time in the office enjoyable. The market leading position drives people to deliver a tailored experience for patients and customers."
good,"A typical day at work involves a lot of customer service. I've learned a lot in the years I've been employed with the company. The hardest part of the job is irate customers,"
good,very high volumes of prescriptions. Have plenty of staff depending on the store. Good pharmacist. Can be long hours. Really depends on your customers.
good,"Walgreens just got bought out by prime. Walgreens is a call center/mail order SPP. They promote from within. "
good,"Same tasks everyday, days are slow sometimes which always for you to get things done. Night shift is very slow so sometimes it could be boring if you have nothing to do. Perfect job for a teenager in high school. Flexible hours."
good,incredibly busy at times and easy to get overwhelmed. Workplace culture is friendly. Hardest part of the job is dealing with customers that are difficult and irate.
good,"Worked here and did an internship. I learned a lot about retail but learned very quickly what I did and did not want for my career. It was a great internship program with great structure, though. Got offered a full time position through it."
good,"It was a good company to work for, and it offers good health benefits. Not a very demanding job, but you are able to find ways to keep yourself busy through the day."
good,"Walgreens has been a great experiences.working for 10 years with the company i learn alot from working on the sales floor in the photo dept, to cross training and becoming a pharmacy technician,along the way learn managment position to help out my co-worker when they are overwhlem with customers.I enjoy working with my co workers and working in diferent store where they needed help , met new people all over.Its just time to get out my comfort zone and challenge myself to other opportunities."
good,There isn't a lot of opportunity to move up in the company.  The company can be biased at times.  It is a good starting job.  There are people there that are nice.
good,Plenty of work to be done but systematically under staffed at most locations. A typical day in the pharmacy is fast paced with little time for lunch much less a break. Expect to work holidays and late hours.
good,"I was hired on for stocking and inventory purposes.  It was routine work,  yet satisfying when you get a job done.  The part I enjoyed would be the creativeness on putting up displays during the seasonal times."
good,"When I began my career I viewed my job as running my own business without putting up the capital investment. Now you are micromanaged constantly and must follow the corporate, cookie cutter plan."
good,"It was an ever-changing, fast-paced environment with flexible hours, a nice benefits package and the ability to telecommute. Co-workers were all enjoyable to work with."
good,It was a good exp..for me I learned a lot about the different departments. My store had a pleasant enviorment. I was n charge of the cosmetics department and had other beauty advisors under me. We all got along very good exp.
good,"As one of the higher volumes stores, they seem to cut hours in the pharmacy and the sales floor when there are more and more customers, making it difficult to complete many duties and neglect small things, like cleaning and dusting, because there is simply not enough help due to the lack in hours the pharmacy and store manager have to work with. The coolers also have mold an nothing has ever been done about it."
good,"Walgreen's is customer service, that is it. It is what you expect out of the experience you use the register to ring people out and stock shelves"
good,"Walgreens has a wonderful culture/environment.The people are nice,  friendly and welcoming to new comers. A typical day is normal distribution center operations, receive, pick, pack and ship."
good,"Pay isn't perfect, and workload can be heavy. But it was good for my scheduling needs. Managers are often over worked and that can tend to affect the general mood. It's Retail Pharmacy."
good,"My responsibilities include: pharmacy technician schedule, third-party billing and charge back (patient collection), Filing, customer service, Salvage/customer returns, Drug recalls, Vendor returns, Inventory, Parata/Yuyama maintenance, Cleaning, Making Mylars/ Counts"
good,It is fast paced with a high volume of customers at my current location. My co-workers are usually friendly and professional. I enjoy seeing regular customers that are appreciative of what Walgreens does for them.
good,"I stocked shelves and knew how to run every department. I know how to run photo and how to do certain things in the pharmacy and how to up-sell cosmetics. Everyone is nice and management is good. Corporate is very cheap though, they cut costs where they can including your hours and your salary. They take away positions so they can pay you less."
good,"I like working with the customers, I have a lot of fun with customers"
good,"Depending on the shift: day/night, the prior manager, and the condition of things before you walk in the door your shift can either be great or one crapshoot of a ride."
good,"I learned the importance of customer service and was able to connect with customers and other team members. "
good,Walgreens is a large and successful company but only because they understaff and expect too much. I did not enjoy working for this company.
good,you stay on your feet and its hard to get breaks. You are constantly doing resets on products and when the truck comes in   you have to get the belt cleared off as fast as you can.   Always short handed and management is not willing to work with you to help you out but expect you to have everything done.  The hardest part was not getting district to see the importance of getting more help.
good,"Too many budget cuts, ever changing policies, and management receives no training on how to effectively handle employees."
good,It is what it is. Nothing special nothing bad either. You show up you do your job and you go home. Some days are better than others.
good,I got to work with people from different places. I understood the meaning of team work. The work environment was open and understanding. The store managers would communicate with the employers so that as a team we can all be on the same page.
good,Walgreens recently raised their national starting wage to $9/hr which is a considerable step up from the federal minimum wage of $7.25/hr which some states pay.
good,You have to be very personable and energetic in order to be able to deal whit this job. There is always work to be done even when it seems like there isn't.
good,learn something new everyday with working with the people in stone mtn ga. building and growing within learning about managment
good,"Communication is key to life and this job lacks proper communication. Too many inconsistencies. Recognition has fallen away. Job hours are inconsistent. Constant turn overs. Management needs to address some issues individually to correct problems."
good,"Used to be a great place to work but management and other structure had changed so much that it just wasn't the same. They lost alot of good employees when the changes were made and then they started cleaning house on the ones that stayed. In comparison to my next job,  it was alot better than I realized."
good,"Great experience , I learned a lot about how a pharmacy worked . My manager did a great job with teaching me different techniques and how to work through problems with customers when they occurred. The hardest part of the job was adjusting to the long hours .My coworkers was great, they took their time to explain things that was new or difficult for me. The most enjoyable part of the job was making a long term mentor with the manager ."
good,"Don't make Walgreens yours first choice, research on other employment opportunities first. Pharmacy technician pay is very little with very stressful work conditions. Every Walgreens differs depending on location and state. Some are great and many are very terrible."
good,"Work life varies from store to store depending on the type of leader you have to develop the team. It can be great, it can be terrible."
good,The company is a good company. We were all really young and they would us up to 30 hrs no more than that because of school. Can't complain I learned a lot.
good,With retail and high volume comes high stress so just be prepared for that. Also the times and shifts that are required to work can at times be a challenge and being away from family on holidays also is quite hard
good,Really enjoyed working here my co workers were very friendly n I enjoyed working here. It was interesting and it helped me improve my customer service skills
good,It was really great.  Best thing ever.  Couldn't have been better.  Maybe this all adds up to twenty words.  I guess I'll have to add on another sentence.
good,"Nice place to work. Coworkers help one another but breaks are short. Overall, it is nice conditions but you will work hard."
good,"Walgreens sales associates may perform a wide variety of duties during a daily shift. Sales associates at Walgreens assist customers in a variety of departments, including photo development, grocery, pharmacy,health and beauty sections. Walgreens sales associates may also operate cash registers, stock shelves, and perform cleaning duties while at work. Cleaning performed by sales associates with Walgreens may include light mopping, dusting, and bathroom tidying. Sales associates work with Walgreens managers to keep customers satisfied and ready to return."
good,"Handled dropship and vendor issues with little supervision. Worked closely with Customer Care and accounting to resolve customer issues and invoice issues. Setting up new vendors was fun and it was exciting seeing new products come in, finding ways to ensure the content was informative and eye-catching and watching them take off in sales. Worked very closely with legal to assure compliance with regulations and laws regarding California Prop 65 and Haz-Mat for shipping and customer awareness surrounding potential cancer related exposure to hard plastics, chemicals and proper shipping of Lithium and other proponents that were regulated."
good,"I was a photo specialist and a cashier. The important roles was being able to maintain a clean environment as you worked with chemicals which was quiet a mess. If only they could train all supervisors how to operate a photo processing machine, that would be a plus. That way, you could leave during your breaks without having to stay inside the store. The hardest part was when the photo processing machine would go down. When the machine goes down, it can't print no more and usually a technician comes in. You would get upset costumers asking why now and when will it be fixed. Fixing the machine could take up to an hour or so. The fun part of the job was learning how photo processing works and knowing how important your job is to costumers."
good,Great co-workers that always made working fun. Everybody worked well as a team to get things accomplished on time with little complaining. All around good team.
good,"A typical day at work involved processing customer transactions, which include sales and returns, as well as coupons. "
good,I really leaned a lot here just wasn't going any were they cut all of are hours so it was working part time with no insurance.
good,"Good and friendly co-workers. They worked with my school schedule. Walgreens trained me all different departments. The most enjoyable part of the job is working in pharmacy, the only bad part was they had too many people working in that department so there was a role conflict for me. Overall, everyone was nice."
good,"I started working for this company with the promise of only one night a week and full time hours. This resulted in being schedule between 30-40 hours one week and 10-25 the next and working three nights a week and every weekend when the pharmacy's policy was a rotating weekend schedule. It's a typical hourly operation, nothing too bad but you should expect typical hourly attitudes and practices."
good,Learned about the retail sales system and relative pharmacy processes. Don't agree with some management and upper level decisions. Average custom can be very fun or very difficult and most do not understand how retail medicine works.
good,Walgreens has an excellent learning environment to learn about retail and customer relations.  The managers are willing to share knowledge and prepare you for a future in retail.
good,Very financially sound company. You will not have work/life balance. They expect you to put your store before family. they pay well but family is more important.
good,"I clean, fill prescriptions"
good,"Very busy , must answer phones,  fill prescriptions,  give flu shots and maintain inventory.  High volume with low amount of staff to help out."
good,"Great customers as well as co-workers. The benefits were great also but when you need a day off, although you do have a co-worker to swap shifts with you, the managers will not work with you."
good,"My current Walgreens location is a good one to work at. There are nice people and friendly staff. The only downside is that hours keep diminishing and for a part-time college student working who has payments due every month, not having those hours is not so good."
good,I had fun working here considering it was while I was still in High School.  I enjoyed my time there because some of my supervisors and co-workers.
good,good for a career starter or to carve good habits. open 365 days a year. political type of establishment. a lot of heavy lifting. working holidays and plenty nights.
good,"I work in the pharmacy. I have a great pharmacy manager, and we all work as a team. Its a good place to get started if you want to pursue something in a heathcare field."
good,"Was a great place to work, everyone who was employed with the company were amazing people. Was labor intense, always on your feet. Employees were able to grow and move up with the company. The management team always want the employees to grow. Great team effort"
good,working here gave mixed emotions on the company. partly because I felt like my hard work as a member of management went overlooked and was back hand by a vindictive store manager. The store manger picked favorites and didn't like because I had no interest in moving up through the ranks of management when ever I did something well while work the store manger was quick to try and take credit for work he did not do. I learned very little about the job from the people who trained me and had to learn most of what I know by myself if you can avoid this place or don't stay long
good,"A typical day at work includes filling prescriptions via online, telephone and handwritten scripts. We count and verify accurate medications and dosages.  We collaborate with pharmacists, healthcare facilities, insurance companies and doctor's offices using modern technology systems to provide quality customer care.  I have learned how to handle difficult circumstances surrounding customer care,  Our management team is made up of our store manager, shift leader, and pharmacy manager that we directly report to on a daily basis.  The hardest part of my job is when helping a customer is out of my hands and cannot be directly fixed.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and helping people."
good,"On my feet most of the day doing data entry, filling prescriptions, answering phones, working the cash register. Worked with some great pharmacists and technicians."
good,"i have no comments, or reviews nor opinions for this company... still weighing my options for the Walgreens company overall i can  state/mention  that i am enjoying experiences so far"
good,"Good company, with great benefits."
good,"Very fast paced"
good,Ok place to work. Not much managed care coverage and training was not very good.  Not sure they are invested in their employees.  I think they care about patients.
good,"Great group of people to work with and for!"
good,The guidelines Walgreens managers have to follow(at least at the store I worked for) is frustrating. It seemed as if all they cared about was their numbers.
good,Working overnight is the best at Walgreen's.  You get nighttime differential and you get to be creative.  You also get to learn more about your job through other departments.
good,I would make sure that all of the photo orders were processed in a timely manner. Also had to keep my area clean and organized. Would make sure the cooler was stock. If we had a truck then I would help put away the items.
good,"Had great co-workers who made work fun."
good,"There were many aspects that were fulfilling but I'd have to say that compounding medication was most enjoyable. Customer service, money handling, receiving stock, inventory, third party transacting and prior authorizations kept one busy."
good,"First job, room for growth and promotion. Community based job. allows you to form relationship with frequent customers. Great managers and coworkers.."
good,Walgreens was a good retail job with many people who were engaged and enjoyed what they were doing on the road to helping customers improve their health.
good,"This is a company that plays favorites and takes advantage of managers. They pay used to be great, but has since gone down hill for new employees. They have lost sight of the founding principals that once created a wonderful company with thriving, happy employees."
good,I loved working at walgreens but the pay was not enough the managers was always nice and helpful working at night and closeing the store was the worst
good,"great customer service driven employees"
good,"My experience working their was good and bad.... there were 418 students and I loved them all, the staff wasn't all that great but the students and the parent were the best!"
good,"Under staff, overworked and most employees are under pay. I guess management everywhere is about the same; if the numbers are good, they take the credit and the employee are left unrecognized, if the numbers are bad, everyone else gets the blame. Co-workers are usually great.  Hardest part of the job is trying to make everyone happy by completing the work load of 3 people. The best part of the job is when the customers/ patients are happy and thank you for the helping them."
good,"Exactly what you would expect from working at a retail store. Nothing overly great or enduring, a truly middle of the road job."
good,Pay caps and ridiculous expectations for pay. Keep taking benefits from long term employees and no job security. Always a new program or service to push.
good,"Greeting and assisting customers was a part of my typical workday. My co-workers were a breeze to work with and they each taught me numerous things about working all over the store. Management changed a bit during my time working there, so there was no set way of doing things. The most enjoyable part of my job here was meeting new people as well as creating a rapore with return customers. The hardest part of the job was learning and working every department. Working here, I learned that getting familiar with change can help make any job a lot easier."
good,The pay is competetive but there is a huge lack of a good training program. too much favortism in the company. They don't seem to care about thier emplyees.
good,The management sucked. It wasn't a fun place to work. Co-workers were always putting others down. Its just something I wasn't too fond of.
good,Enjoyed working and interacting with my coworkers. Advancement was tough to come by and came with very little perks.  Hours were often cut and management was often unhelpful.
good,"I learned alot at this job. I started as a Driver I, which is bottom of the totem pole. Worked my way up with proving my potential. Wound up climbing the ladder as far as I could. A typical day at work was always fast paced."
good,"Usually my day consists of greeting customers, answering the phone, and keeping the front end immaculate. When I have the opportunity to work in the cosmetics area of the store, I put of products that the store receives, replace missing mylars and signs, and  organize (face) that area. I learned how to read a mylar and what each number on that mylar represents. My customer service skills have improved and I am more aware of patterns in human behaviors. I have more confidence in my cash handling skills. The hardest part of being a cashier is lack of security. Sometimes we have customers with mental illness and homeless customers that harass the coworkers and other customers. It would be nice to have a security guard to escort them out of the store. The best part  of being a cashier is interacting with the local customers."
good,I've gotten multiple raises and promoted quickly. All of my bosses have been amazing and since I'm a hard worker it has paid off! Always have opportunities for overtime.Not enough pay for the responsibilities given. Sometimes if one person calls in you're understaffed. Depending on your work ethic you can get unmotivated.Needs to be harder on employees who call in a lot or show up late.
good,This job has taught me how to time manage properly and how to set/ accomplish both long and short term goals. It has also taught me how to manage a budget and how to be responsible with my money.
good,"The company is a great place for those who are just starting out, there is room for growth and advancement. In my experience I enjoyed work with and around our loyal customers, co-workers and management."
good,Have Worked For The Company For Almost 3 Years And Was Promoted Twice Within The Past Year. They Just Need Longer Lunch Breaks And Better Security For Area Thieves
good,Very slow days. I did learn a lot about being a manager like having the right attitude and what kind of tone or body language to use with employees. Some co-workers do not approve of promotion. Makes it hard to work. The hardest part of the job was doing warehouse. The best part of the job was being able to interact with customers and helping them out.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job on third shift is getting to interact with regulars and help them with their health questions.
good,"Developed strong customer relationships while processing merchandise orders and proving prompt service. Responsible for training all new second shift employees, providing information on company policies and procedures."
good,"I worked overnight i so i didnt encounter too many customers but more than you would expect, along with regular cashier and associate duties."
good,"Short with the staff because they do not want to hire more people and pay more, and  to many customers and stressful work environment. "
good,"Through our industry-leading network of more than 2,200 dialysis facilities, outpatient cardiac and vascular labs, and urgent care centers, as well as the country’s largest practice of hospitalist and post-acute providers, Fresenius Medical Care provides coordinated health care services at pivotal care points for hundreds of thousands of chronically ill customers throughout the continent. As the world’s only vertically integrated renal company, we also offer specialty pharmacy and laboratory services, as well as manufacturing and distributing the most comprehensive line of dialysis equipment, disposable products and renal pharmaceuticals."
good,"Pharmacy staff typically overwhelmed, given the job that is required. Hours/schedule without regard to personal life. Management with a by-the-book mentality, never focused on practicality. Co-workers great for the most part- we survive off each other. Hardest part of job is being salary and putting in way more hours that go unnoticed and unpaid for."
good,"It's an environmental for fast pace, high volume prescriptions. The salary is good. Managers and staff were like my family. Very important to have that in the workplace."
good,Have learned many retail and customer support skills since I started working with Walgreens.  Everyone is always willing to teach you anything if you want to learn.  There is always something to keep an employee busy!  I love working in photo department because it lets me blossom in an artistic way and I love helping others learn and create their photo works!
good,"Worked closely with pharmacy team to process medication prescriptions to completion. Contracted doctors to verify pertinent information. Called insurance for filed, labeled, and sold patient scripts. Mixed medications and updated patient records. Ordered drugs and pharmacy supplies, checked expirations, completed inventory and tender handling forms. Renewed certified pharmacy technician license every two years and completed continuing education courses per company and state requirements."
good,"productive work environment..very flexible, benefits are not that good..pay is horrible..they need to pay there technicians more money..wish i didnt have to wear uniform..just some pants and a white coat.."
good,Job has its perks.  Also has down falls to it too.   Overall it was an ok experience .  Pharmacy employees were great.   Some store managers were great
good,"Walgreen's is Walmart Jr. Fewer staff. expected managers to run the store/ solve problems AND run to the Pharmacy, dispense prescriptions accurately, especially if a Pharmacist wasn't a ""people person"" and didn't want to deal with customers."
good,"Responsible for holding store keys to open and close without management as necessary, including all required systems start-ups, required cash handling, and ensuring the floor and stock room are ready for business day. Responsible for opening back door of store for deliveries (vendors).  Completes product returns, order voids, customer refunds, cash drops to the safe and provides change as requested to the cash registers, as well as ordering supplies for departments as needed. Models and delivers a distinctive and delightful customer experience.  "
good,"Started off as a on call cashier and ended being a shift leader.  Was a good environment, Friendly staff, benefits, hours. Didn't enjoy working holidays but other than was fun place to work"
good,It was very quite and professional. The team I worked with was very skilled in comms which made for exciting new products to test. However I wouldn't recommend for a social person
good,"Walgreens is an ok work place, majority of the time its at a pretty high stress volume level. I wont complain about it because in any situation you just have to make the best out of it; therefore, it provides, however, its time for me to expand."
good,"ive been working there for over a year and they fail to give enough hours that could be flexible with school or medical appointments. unfair on how hours are given but they try and its not like they have much to give now anyways, the company is going bad. ive had to travel to different walgreens in and around my area and still not being able to reach the desired hours, sometimes even only worked for 6 hours in a week. currently struggling to pay bills so i must find a new job soon. but overall the work environment is great, employees and managers as well. working in the pharmacy can sometimes be very stressful and busy but the best part is you're not in it alone."
good,There was no work available and you would be sent home after being at work for about an hour. They were very unorganized and you were never sure who was in charge.
good,I enjoyed the store I worked at but as a company there was not much room for growth and the pay was not competitive. To do the same job at any different companies my compensation would have been much higher
good,"Great pay, benefits are good, upper management understands changing in employees lives and you could make up hours if you needed too. Management help you become better leaders."
good,"Lots of times, unprofessional atmosphere and unaccommodating to college students. Was afraid to ask to even go to class, because management were hard on hours, even after working for 3 years. Lack of leniency."
good,"here you have you own cube space that you can decorate any way you want, it makes you feel like you are home while you are away from home. SOME of the supervisors are understanding and know that life happens"
good,"A typical day would be you clocked in and you would see where the last photo tech left off or if you were being a cashier that day you would go and relive the last cashier to go home. I learned how to develop photos and how to run and clean the machines there. Management was wonderful, the manager that I had would push me to be a better employee and had faith in me to do more than what I need to do. They also gave me a little freedom since I would get all my work done. My co-workers were nice. we all got along and had fun when we were slow. The hardest part of the job was sometimes keeping up the demand for people to develop their photos some people wanted them done right away. Sometime we could not get them all done at the time that they needed since developing photos takes time. The most enjoyable part was my co-workers and working 3rd shift. It was quite and slower at that time than during the day shifts. You could get a lot more done at night than during the day."
good,OK place to work. good for part time work. customers are reliable to show up for the sale prices. staff is friendly. management will listen to some of your needs.
good,"Walgreens is a good job for starting out, but it caps out fast and its hard to earn enough money to live on a Walgreens budget for more than a few years.  They ask for a lot, but pay very little, and they do not compensate for extra skills like learning the photo lab or other equipment.  Everyone makes the base amount and you will go up very slowly every year only if you do well on your performance review.  No in between positions anymore, they have a cover all ""customer service associate"" position and the next jump is ""shift lead"" which is like a pseudo-management position (quite a big leap) and then the next jump is ""assistant manager."" It's hard to get a raise, but its a secure job in a steady and safe environment.  Good benefits, discounts, and healthcare.  Friendly team members and heavy customer focus."
good,I haven't worked at Walgreens in over 19 years.  When I did work there I enjoyed being part of a team atmosphere.  It's a solid company that will be around for a long time.
good,Taking orders and making sure the lobby is kept neat and clean. Getting the customer there food in a timely manner. Making sure the food is prepared the way it was asked for.
good,"As this was my very first job I am very thankful to the Walgreens company. I have learn so much about what I could do in a workplace."
good,"- most of the co-workers are friendly "
good,If you are very high energy and are great at multi-tasking while needing to be a perfectionist then the pharmacy is for you. This job takes a strong and caring person to succeed at it.
good,Working here was working at any typical restaurant gig. The owners were probably the only downfall. They could not seem to keep a steady staff to save their business. This restaurant is now closed.
good,Any strip locations is incredibly hard to work at. The amount of staff to the amount of trouble that runs through those locations every night is horrible. The team I worked with was amazing but the store manager really needed to learn some human decency. The pay was alright for the job done but it was extremely difficult to get ahead.
good,"They care about numbers over employees, No yearly increase in salary anymore. they cut hours all the time. Try to be a full time employee to survive."
good,"Was really fun seeing new people everyday during the flu shot season. Was a fun time wouldst change a thing. Would only change Mouton of time would have been netter,"
good,"no one day is the same"
good,Great place to learn and gain experience work while listening to music do multiple things during your shift and never feel board because there's always something to do
good,It was an interesting experience working for a company like Walgreen's. To experience the work ethic of my fellow peers and my managers.
good,Place has a good working atmosphere. Plenty of opportunity for learning. Great first job for younger adults looking to get a foot in the working field.
good,"A typical work day as a pharmacy manager tends to be exhausting, but generally rewarding.  Most days I work as a pharmacist while also completing pharmacy manager and pharmacy technician duties."
good,First job I had that I loved worked during high school and years after. I learned every position there unfortunately management was not what I thought they were.
good,This company could be better if they gave us more than a lunch break which means we work standing for 8 hours...There is no consistency .No teamwork and No motivation from upper management!
good,"has ups and downs, but overall it's very diverse and a good environment. fast paced and demanding. hours are good and pay is decent for the amount of work you have to do."
good,"I hate retail, however this store allowed me to escalate in my career developments at that time. Management was terrible."
good,Come in and intake new prescriptions being dropped off by patient. Type and fill orders as they came in. Very busy fast pace environment. Assist the pharmacist with daily task.
good,"I worked in an extremely high-volume pharmacy that always felt under-staffed. I do not exaggerate when I say I was rarely worked that hard during my 5 years in the military. Very underpaid with how hard we worked and the time we put in to making sure patient's medication, information, and insurance profiles were all correct and they were getting the correct coverage. We did a lot of work and had to daily learn new guidelines and information, yet we barely get paid more than a fast food worker."
good,Fun at times. Called to other departments when busy with your own work to do. My manager was great but he left to another store and I left soon after.
good,"At the time i was employed at the company, my overall experience was okay."
good,"a typical work day consisted of helping customers , stocking shelves and changing prices to the markdown prices. the most enjoyable part are your coworkers. least enjoyable part was the  maintenance and cleaning of the workplace."
good,"In my opinion, Walgreens is a job not a career. People entering the work force will find Walgreens to be very demanding with not enough incentive for growth."
good,i spoke to alot of people. over 100 a day. people with accents made it harder to communicate with them.
good,I love how the pharmacy was busy. there was always something to do. I most likely go back to the pharmacy route. one thing i did not like was the management it was sloppy at times.
good,"romises to provide truly exceptional offerings and services, and we will not be happy until you are. If any programs, products or services of NPTA do not fulfill our promise, we will make the situation right or refund your money."
good,"I enjoyed walgreens, i meet alot of new people, I helpedmany people, the wage was just to low and the time of advancement took to long"
good,"I love the people I work with ! I even love my job ! However, things can be a bit unfair at times, the pay is a bit low for the workload given and the budget is always going down, causing employees' hours to fluctuate."
good,"it was an ok job, room for advancement if that's what you are lookin for, great working environment great employee discount."
good,Stable company with great people.  A great place to start your career and develop your skills and business knowledge.  Versatility is highly valued.
good,My location was very busy and always hands on deck thankfully the hours went by quick but sadly the stress got to some people like myself and i did not like it anymore
good,"Walgrizzles is a good place to start, transition, or grow.  Don't stay here, please do something more meaningful with your life."
good,"The hours are very chaotic, the manager i worked for never got the schedule out in time for much life planning and you never had a set schedule. This is not to say all walgreens is this way. Turn arounds were very prominent. The job itself was very easy and most of the time customers were fair to employees. Paid vacation and sick time was nice. Advancement was promoted fairly."
good,"Meet, greet customers, friendly, rude, lost all kinds of people. Having to direct and take care of customers that are in need or wanting help! Making their experience very pleasant from the time they arrive and to the time they leave."
good,"Maintain all the customers. Making sure that customers are first. Work is done. Inventory. Prep for the next day. Best part of the job is meeting and greeting with new people. Like working in teams, but also can work along. Like task. Being assign a job where I can finish at a timely manner doesn't bother me."
good,Typical work day busy from start to finish. I acquired new infusion skills and as a new Texas resident became familiar with Houston and the surrounding areas.
good,"Typical pharmacy and retail store. The local management was great, very helpful and understanding. Corporate however doesn't seem to care about its lower employees that much anymore. When I first started compensation & benefits were great but as time went on, the company started thinking more with their wallet than their own people."
good,"Walgreens is a wonderful company to work for when it comes to benefits. I would suggest someone to make it into a career choice. Even working as a pharmacy technician there, isn't a good idea. You're paid much less than what an experienced pharmacy technician would get paid at other places such as hospitals. Don't settle for less. I recommend this job to students or someone who just graduated high school and looking for some extra income."
good,"This is a great place for a first job, the staff and the customers are great. a typical day is price changes, customer service, managing time and employees."
good,"A typical day at work is like working at a factory. You are under a lot of stress from working on your feet all day. Everything from unloading the truck to putting up the truck is all manual labor. You are not allowed to take 15 minute breaks within the Government guidelines. You are constantly being monitored the whole time you are on the clock by management in the back office. Far as training goes you are not properly trained....you learn as you go. When you first start working there, you are taken to the office to learn PPL modules and that is your training. The hardest part of the job is you do everything...Unloading the truck {shipping and receiving}, putting out stock, ordering merchandise when shelves are empty, putting out tags every Saturday for the next weekly ad. Building the Displays on your own and also keeping up with Customer Service."
good,"so far i have done fills; answered a few phone calls and a few drive up customers.  still learning, but wanting to learn more.  Management seems to micro-manage.  i have liked working with all my co-workers - they are all very nice and helpful.  the hardest part is learning everything.  and the most enjoyable is learning it all."
good,"under paid , no lunch breaks, of course its retail so depending on customers that is how your day will go! If you have a great rph manager that will help but still worked under pressure but doesn't feel appreciated!"
good,"Many pieces of equipment but all high in the air needing to be reached by a Cherry Picker Lift.  Difficult to repair items in building, bad design.  AGV's really old but have nice people to work with."
good,Like any other job it has its up and down. working at Walgreen's I learned how to interact with people and also helping people with different needs.
good,"Walgreens used to be an incredible company to work for. They took care of their employees, and fostered an incredible culture of striving for the health and happiness of both their customers and their employees. Nowadays, it's much less like that. Corporate continues to expect us to do the same caliber of work we used to, but with half the staff. And when we don't meet metrics, they slash hours even more."
good,Honestly it was a very enjoyable job with an lots of things to enjoy. customers were nice and work was not too hard. it was nice to have a pharmacy setting involved. made me feel helpful
good,I enjoyed my time at Walgreens. The employees were friendly and management was respectable. Pay scales are very low and not much opportunity for advancement.
good,Typical retail store not bad to work at start out as cashier and make your way to the floor stocking selfs then to the photo department. and if your lucky you can be promoted to assisant manager
good,this is a fun first job for college students.  being a pharmacy tech allows for a semi flexible work schedule which is great for a balance between work and life.
good,"Over the course of my time at Walgreen I have acquired various skills. Working the registers to assisting with customer plans and running the photo lab, preparing displays accordingly."
good,Walgreens has been a very rewarding place of employment. There is no better place to gain retail management skills. The most rewarding part of the job has been the ability to advance.
good,"The work was fine and not challenging, required basic communication skills and a positive outlook. Most days were slow and resulted in simple tasks to be repeated over and over. The most interesting parts of the job were when I learned new tasks."
good,"it was a nice place to work at, people are very friendly and nice! i was always working with customers and my manager were fun people."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of helping customers find things. keeping photo orders organized, keeping inventory stocked and organized. The environment is ok depending on the store you're at."
good,"Walgreens enjoys a positive reputation among other businesses in the industry and among the communities across the country it serves. This position afforded me the ability to build and foster beneficial working relationships with collegues in the industry, elected officials and state decision makers."
good,Customer service is the main priority as well as well stocked shelves. We always made sure each customer was greeted and had everything they needed.
good,"My work experience at Walgreens started off a little rocky. I was hired during a time period when the head manager was out due to surgery. The temporary manager hired me and gave me no training, so I was very uncomfortable for the first month or so. After that, things got a little better. Many of the employees would occasionally teach me things and show me the ropes along the way. Great people to work with. Very sweet and care about the customers."
good,"At Foote hospital I worked in several different satelite pharmacies.  I worked in the ICU pharmacy, the surgery pharmacy , and the main pharmacy. It was a great learning experience which included pharmacokinetic dosing."
good,"Ok to work for no advancement, the bosses promise you the chance to advance and everything falls through. The pay is horrible started at 8.50 and new people were making the same as me. finally bumped up to more."
good,"The job is as what's expected for someone with those responsibilities: fill prescriptions, use the computer to bill insurance and transcribe prescriptions, answer phone calls, verify patient orders, etc. Walgreens is a good company to work for, but they tend to lean for favorites, and a result, your hours can be cut short on a short notice or without any notice at all. There's also the ideal of ""at will"" employment, so you can also be laid off without any real reason. So as for job security, there is little to nothing guaranteed here."
good,Great place if you are looking for part- time work. Multi tasking is a must with this company you will be doing a lot of different things. They are open everyday so no holidays off something people with family might want to consider.
good,"The company overall was great, some of the local managment was less than friendly. Would recommend this company to anyone for employment."
good,"I enjoy working here,great co-workers and nice managers. It is nice to interact and help customers. The hardest part is, that you don't get as many hours as you'd like."
good,The management was ok and it was nice work environment.I enjoyed my time Walgreens Pharmacy it was a pretty simple job. The hardest part i would say was finding the will to do some of the more boring task.
good,"Overall a great experience, where obtained a well of knowledge of medications. It was a great introductory opportunity into the world of healthcare."
good,"Good retail store to work "
good,"Typical day consists of checking out customers, helping customers find products, and stocking. I personally learned more about the retail industry. Management is average. Co-workers are average. Hardest part of job is working 8 or 9 days a week before get days off. Enjoyable part of job is earning paycheck and serving customers."
good,"Performed daily Pharmacy activities"
good,"my first job at 18, and it was pretty cool. very competitive so easily moved up within the company. pay is fine. the job was fine people were fine."
good,Management was very bad. If you enjoy working with bipolar managers this is the job for you. The hours were not good so if you have a family definitely not the job for you
good,"Very busy at work as a pharmacist. Included prescription reviews, data entry as needed, patient counseling as needed, interact with prescribers as needed, check out and ring up pt's meds  as necessary."
good,"I interact with different types of people every day, which makes for a great learning experience.  A typical day includes helping people, stocking shelves, and working with employees.  It is a great team environment, and I get to help them learn new things."
good,A typical day entails filling prescriptions and ringing out patients in person and in drive thru. Every tech when they come in starts at the drive thru and stays there until relieved by the next shift. If the situation arises I may have to call a patient's insurance company to get an override. At a busy store like mine this usually happens multiple times in a day.
good,"The fact that they opened an office (in 2012) in Chicago helps this company. That completely separated from its headquarters in Deerfield, IL."
good,"As a graveyard shift shift lead I found the myself very busy with store work such as stocking and cleaning. I got along very well with my coworkers and only left because I moved away and became a full-time student. The hardest part of the job was when I would get drunk or angry customers, but the most enjoyable was the positive relationships I had with my regular customers and coworkers."
good,"A typical day at work would include being a casheir, mostly. I learned how to become a great cashier, it also made me very good with money. My co-workers were great. The hardest part of my job was tilts, Tilts are basically restocking, but I had to restock many tilts and the items were small as well. I enjoyed interacting with customers, when i'm feeling down, they almost always make me feel better."
good,"retail pharmacy in a fast paced environment. Duties besides retail, are immunizations, and counseling patients on the medication needs and over the counter products"
good,This job will teach you how to work with the public. It will improve typing speed. I learned how to process prescriptions and bill insurances electronically. I communicated a lot with doctors offices and other pharmacies. This position has much to offer.
good,Working for Walgreens has taught me better customer relations and customer service.  I've built relationships with customers to where they request you for your services.
good,"tough environment, with little rewards, high expectations and high demands still a good learning experience, learn to handle difficult situations"
good,"good lace to work, I would usually just clean stock and ring up customers. The co-workers were ok, management was great. What I dislike is being promised a raise in pay and never getting it,"
good,Doable work environment. Employees and management is nice and helpful. I've learned a lot about teamwork while working here.
good,"Working for Walgreens was a good retail experience. I learned to work very well with customers, multitask, and do different jobs through out the store including some training in pharmacy."
good,I worked here for 6 years and sadly I can say I made more the first year I worked there than I did the last due to decrease in hours and commissions.
good,"Walgreens can be an enjoyable place to work. It all depends on your manager and assistant managers. It depends on the mood of your manager and their assistants as to how the store was going to be. A lot of times it depends on who you knew as to if you advanced. Seen this plenty times and some employees treated wrongly due to this."
good,"It all depends on your location. Some locations are great to work at and some are not so great. It relies heavily on  your management and coworkers. If you have a good team, the job is tolerable and the benefits are decent. If your team sucks, you will hate your life. Also, Walgreens has recently been firing their employees that have been there the longest so that they can hire ones who will start at a much lower rate, so keep that in mind--- they are quick to remind you how disposable you are."
good,For the 5-6 of being an intern at walgreens I found myself to become more knowledgeable. Walgreens is a good company to be at. The pay could improve though.
good,"They gave great training for Pharmacy Technicians. A field in which I had not work in before, but learned a lot in a short period of time."
good,"Walgreens wasn't a bad company to work for, but it wasn't the greatest either.  The relationship between management and it's employees was cold and distant.  It made for an uncomfortable work environment.  A typical day for me, would be waiting on 1000 or more customers, either taking in a new prescription, refill, or they were there to pick one up.  I would answer the phones all day long, and do data entry.  I would also maintain the robot that we had as well.  The hardest part of this job, was seeing many of our customers who were very ill or learning of them passing.  Even though I waited on several customers in a day, I would still build a relationship with our regulars.  The best part about this job, is the relationships that I did get to build.  Even now, even though I am no longer working there, I will see my regular customers out and about, and they always greet me with a warm smile and a hug.  My co-workers in the pharmacy were like a family to me.  I spent more time with them than I did my family at home.  They made going to work every single day enjoyable."
good,"Walgreen's is a decent company when it comes to retail. It's similar to a hierarchy with seniority. So hours are given to those who have been there longer, and as are jobs, even if those are incompetent for the job. I see no opportunity at Walgreen's. Some of my co-workers have been working there for more than 10+ years and are still exactly where they started."
good,learn a lot working for the company for 3 years now still working there its a good job to have moving up in the company learning more and more everyday
good,SEE PREVIOUS REVIEW. Job satisfaction varies on what kind of team you work  with. Good team support makes the job a lot easier vs. no support from mgmt. or supervisors.
good,"Typical day would be Monday inventory, Friday shipment, days in-between customer service/replenishment,cashier,phones,every other saturday we had events to promote push products. I ran them and my responsibility was the goal for that day's event, As well as daily goals for me and the advisors,"
good,Working as a sales associate was very beneficial in my high school years. During the time I have gained excellent customer service skills and great interpersonal skills.
good,Not as good a place to work since the merger. Most of the IT work has moved offshore.  That shift has caused a huge gap in on site knowledge of systems and processes.
good,OK place to work while you're in college. Not much to say about the company. The pharmacy department is always going to be intense.
good,"When I started with the company, they cared more for their employees and patients that they do currently.  They seem to be making some strides to get back to patient-centered care, but time will tell what changes will be made.  I like those that I work with like a second family, but feel as if the corporate entity does not see me as a person."
good,Very fast paced environment. Enjoyed checking out customer in a timely and efficient manner. learning about all the different foods and products we sold in the store.
good,"I am a positive, hardworking, forward-minded, well mannered, responsible, true, friendly, outgoing, and honest individual. I work hard and always have a positive attitude. When I set my mind to something, no matter how complex it may be, I achieve it. I strive to be the best I can be and I take pride in everything I do. I always believe in acting in a professional manner, being punctual, and being in a clean environment. I am skilled in organization, customer service, and construction; I am also a great learner and easy to talk to. I will learn and know any opportunity you give me. I was a service clerk, helped customers, and stocked shelves"
good,"Overall, Walgreens was a decent place to work at during high school, as opposed to a fast food restaurant. The pay was decent; however, it was unbalanced for someone whom worked at the company for years that was making the same as someone that was just newly hired. Being surrounded by great people made the days go by faster and definitely gave me some good skills in customer service."
good,"Fast paced! Effectively learn to triage! A wide and varied patient base. Need to rely on pharmacy techs, and they are well trained."
good,"Hit the floor running."
good,I started the job expecting to leave after 6 months and ended up staying for 6 years. The job is constantly changing and becoming more 'corporate' and less 'personable'. The company has long since forgotten that happy employees keeps a company running effectively.
good,"I gain a lot different kinds of experiences from walgreens and I will be forever grateful for that. But I didn't enjoy working there. Then management could have did a better job training and assigning responsibilities. But after you get the hang of it, it is a bad place to work."
good,"Retail, customer service.  Staling of shelves.  Management ok.   Learned a lot about developing of photo's and working with the chemicals."
good,"it was definitely a learning experience but as time went on i felt the job draining, not because of difficulty, but because Walgreen's lack of appreciation towards employees"
good,"The job was very easy, there was not anything hard about working there. I enjoyed the customers and the management."
good,I like the company for its benefits though due to circumstances beyond my control they cannot add me to the schedule for more than a day a week.
good,"Walgreens is very strict and demanding, not very flexible, management has favoritism. not very promising to move up and they will nit pick anything you do wrong. Worked there for 9 years and not a very positive experience"
good,Walgreens is a good company to work for as long as your able to balance work and personal life. The schedules are flexible and their is always room for advancement.
good,"Typical day included but not limited to customer service, loading and unloading freight, running from back of building to front constantly to take care of customers and finish assigned jobs.  What I learned to go with the flow and not to stress over little situations. Co-workers were wonderful to work with and made your day as we worked as a team. Hardest part of the job was the constant running and expectations were impossible to meet due to the shortage of help. The most enjoyable part was the Customers when I was able to help them.  I had customers seeking me out just to help them because they were impressed I would go above and beyond to help them."
good,"Walgreens is a great Company To Work For If You Dont Have Small Kids..Hours Of Operations Vary. Customers Are Great, The Staff Work Together,and Its Clean.."
good,This was a part-time job for me while going to school. This company was very flexible and understanding in my requests in regards to school.
good,On a daily basis you would be bringing items from the stock room and restock the shelves. Other days you're unloading trucks.
good,"Job will over work, there are only short breaks 30 minutes for the whole day, management is cool, difficult to enjoy your off days because your too tired from being overworked, easy to move up the ladder because your always working, pay is good!"
good,"As a Shift Lead going back and forth from store to pharmacy was stressful for me, management at time was not very helpful but i did learn new things such as different cash handling skills etc.. the hardest part of job was planograms and pharmacy"
good,"I have been at this job for 5 years. I started off doing resets and revisions around the store, but got moved to the photo department within a year cause the original job dissolved out. On a current day I am stocking my shelves, taking care of the liquor bay assigned to me, answering photo questions as well as providing customer service within my department, as well as around the store. I am also used to being the head cashier, working in receiving, and in our beauty department."
good,"I have seen alot of changes in 6 yrs of being there. I would like to say it got better but it hasn't."
good,A typical day at Walgreens can vary; either it is really slow and management is pretty much asking you to go home; or it is extremely busy. The Pharmacist I work with is a decent character. Management is decent as well. Walgreens can be a bit unorganized as far as scheduling and spreading hours throughout the business. I learned a great deal of patience and task and time management.
good,Each location is different and every store manager is different. If you are use to constant change this is the job for you.
good,"Working at Walgreens Pharmacy entailed very fast pace work and being on my feet all day. I always had to multi-task, I would go from filling prescriptions to answering phones to stocking medications, filing already filled prescriptions in alphabetical bins, making calls to patients informing them medications are ready for pick up, helping patients or customers to pick up or drop off prescriptions or simple request like helping them find over the counter medications located on the floor. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping patients and seeing a smile of satisfaction on their face, that always made my day!!"
good,"Provided assistance to customers calling to place orders or to confirm and track their orders. I also responded to customer inquiries on products sold in our website. I learned how to work in a call center operation and how to function in that environment. I believe that the call center management tried their best to keep the agents happy, and motivated. My co-workers were all team players and I enjoyed  working with them. The hardest part of the job was the very slow operating system,and due to this, frequently,it would affect the call time goal as set by management,"
good,"this is a basic retail job. customers can be terrible, but the managers are good people and and coworkers are usually good people. pay could be better"
good,Everyday was a new experience and I liked everyone that I worked with. I definitely liked meeting different people everyday as well but I had to resign because of personal reasons.
good,no comments There was to much overtime. You never knew when your shift was going to end. Not aloud to leave the building. To much stress.
good,This employee found the company to be an adequate training tool for growth in a deeply rooted corporate culture providing opportunity to learn implementing the vision of others.
good,Too many changes that were unorganized and had no plan on how changes were to be implemented. Worked there for several years and initially loved the company but the management changed for the negative.
good,"Set up my routine, come on time, everyday at work. Have a good mood and be prepared to work with my co-workers, customers, and mangers. Enjoy your time with your customers and help resolve their problems"
good,"very nice, love it. it was worth it. I think that they can improve on their wages. but overall it was great."
good,"A typical day would be to call all national walgreen's to obtain ID numbers, this job was very routine.  The staff was amazing and eventually over time I did try to help out in other areas of the freight business."
good,The environment provided me with the ability to provide excellent customer service to sick patients.  I learn and enjoyed all aspects of providing customers with the knowledge of leading a more healthier lifestyle.
good,"This job ended due to Medicare competitive bidding. Good morale, hard working people and a great team effort. The company treated the workers good."
good,"The day's duties involved me taking care of customer's photo orders, packing the shelves with any stock that came in with the truck delivery. When there was no truck to be unpacked, I would help any colleagues in the store that needed help. I did not learn much from the job. I learnt how to use their photo equipment to develop images. Management and co-workers were pleasant to work with. The toughest part and some times the easiest was the customers. Some clients were really delightful to work with as they often made my day as often as I made theirs easy around the store."
good,The company made too many major changes in too short of a period.  The last few years there were many people eliminated due to organizational changes and a lot of out sourcing happened which added to job loss.
good,"I worked at Walgreens for 20 years.  I achieved the position of store manager.  The company that I left was not the same as the one I started with.  In 1993 the company was all about market share, customer service and employee benefits.  The company I left in 2013 was all about cutting expenses at the expense of the customers and employees.  I did not agree with decisions made at the corporate/district level and could not associate myself with them anymore."
good,A good place to work as a part-time/full-time employee living at home. The pay is not competitive and makes it hard to live on your own.
good,"great coworkers great location. loved the daily interaction and problem solving for all the customers,loved to create happiness with the customers in the photo department"
good,"Walgreens is a normal retail job. Some locations are much better than others. I have had some pretty amazing managers and I have had some really horrible managers. Like any other job in Retail you have your good locations, co-workers, clients, managers, and vendors and your bad. Depends which location you get hired on at. Benefits and pay are average. Your regular clients and most co-workers/ managers are the best part of the day they become a second family to you. Worst part is bad managers/bad co-workers and angry clients."
good,"My typical day at work would be to set up the registers, opening the doors and greeting the customers. I would also ask them if they have a rewards card and if they do not I would like to sign them up for one. I also ask them if they would like to buy the item of the month and if they found everything in the store okay today. I got to learn how to use the AS400 which is on the computer and we use it to look up items and prices among other things. the good thing about my job is that management is open to listening and giving their feedback. My co-workers show that they are there to work and they shown that by stocking, multitasking and  showing they care. The hardest part of the job is meeting the sale quota for the item of the month. The most enjoyable part of the job is the friends you make through work, and the appreciation from the customer."
good,I have already done this one before. I hope you have a good night!! Your cite is pretty awesome!! I worked there for 12 years and that was that!!
good,"a typical day at work "
good,the location of the company was close enough to public transportation to make it easy for me to travel to. The hours were flexible and easy. Management was good.
good,"Walgreens is a great place to start in retail.  Excellent benefits, 401K after 1 year with matching 4%, and 15% employee store discounts, 25% on Walgreens branded merchandise.  A typical day at work is logging into your shift on time, going to your assigned department, and giving customers a positive customer service experience."
good,"Very busy store with friendly staff and management. Generally, rules and expectations are learned as you go.  Management has been very accommodating of my schedule and unexpected scheduling needs."
good,"clean environment, good benefits, nice people to work with, lots to learn and always on the go. Never a boring place to work always something to do"
good,"this company is slowly going downhill as a job.  I have been here since 2009, and have never been so unhappy.  My co-workers are friendly.  My pharmacy manager keeps ignoring me"
good,Retail is always a struggle. Can't take vacation whenever you want. On your own a lot as a manager. Low pay as a Manager trainee.
good,Always Be On Time because there very serious about it and always stay active and busy so that work can finish as soon as possible
good,My job at Walgreens has taught me excellent customer care skills and I find that the most enjoyable part of my day is the interactions that I have with the customers and my co-workers.
good,"It a stressful job."
good,productive and very stressful and hectic. A fast paced environment. The co workers are very friendly but some supervisors/managers are very intimidating. Having to stay longer because returns are needed to be done. The most enjoyable part can be interacting with coworkers and customers.
good,Walgreen's was my first pharmacy experience.  I learned a lot and worked with a lot of great people.  I appreciate the opportunity they gave me!
good,Felt like you did the same thing everyday. Performed managerial functions and would have to relocate in order to be promoted which was not appealing. Driving 2+ hours to work and back for OK money was not ideal for me and made me lose my drive to want to continue trying for a managerial position.
good,"Fun workplace with a supportive team.  Lots of opportunities to job growth.  Team members worked well together as well as with management.  Not ideal for a parent, being as scheduling was varied."
good,Both the most enjoyable and challenging part of this job is providing customer service that exceeds customer and management expectations.
good,"Its a pleasure working at walgreens. I've gotten used to the fast-paced environment. I wish there was more time to counsel patients though. I believe that is the most important part of our job, answering questions and concerns patient's have regarding their therapy and making them feel comfortable about taking their medications."
good,It's been soo long since I've worked at Walgreens im sure a lot has changed. There was not a lot of opportunity for growth within the company when I worked here...
good,"Working at Walgreens is pretty straight forward. Nothing too out of the ordinary. Learn as many departments as you can, it'll help you obtain more hours."
good,Emphasis on metrics and quantity / speed. Little time allotted for required counseling. Constant staffing issues with technicians. Feels like lack of support / understanding from corporate management for staffing needs and for retaining good technicians.
good,Work day varies from very slow to super fast. I learned how to stock shelves quite quickly and become oblivious to hygienic items that before working here I would have felt embarrassed to be around. Some management understands how to respect people and not show favoritism while others....not so much. Co-workers are sometimes a little moody but usually nice. The hardest part of the job is changing the sales tags on the Saturday night. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people save money from the Walgreens Reward Card.
good,"On average you manage teams of 20 to 25 technicians/pharmacist. It was mainly an inbound call center where customer service was provided for different lines of business.  As a manager you were able to manage salary and hourly employees and were responsible for all aspects of the business (payroll, performance, attendance, accountability, etc.)."
good,The company does many things well but cuts too much payroll and expects employees to perform much higher than their pay rate.
good,"Very good work place"
good,I don't like to share. All places have different pros and cons. You just have to adjust with that environment. And all places will be awesome to work
good,"great place to have co-workers, very easy going. Great customers who come in and seem very eager to always come back. I learned geat customer service skills."
good,"demanding job but you learn a lot. It is a great company to work for but currently under going a lot of changes. A lot of jobs have been cut, as are other companies."
good,"Walgreens had severe payroll cuts over the 4 or 5 years I was there. I was making less money by the time I finished from the time I started. Hours are bad too, some days you'll close the store then have to open the next day and you'll never get to enjoy holidays with the family unless you're store manager."
good,"Pros: several safety checks in place to protect patients, good with time off requests."
good,The company is not one I'm looking to advance in. I have learned a lot and gained experience but it is time for me to move on and gain more else where.
good,A very easy going place to work. Very repetitive at times but anyone can do it. The pay isn't all that great but if your looking for a little income then this might work for you.
good,I really like the job and the people I worked with. The only down fall was the heavy boxes and stocking but other than that the job is great and the people who work there are wonderful as well.
good,The work place is satisfactory with great coworkers. You required to work at a fast pace in meet quota. And sometimes you are transferred around the department to assist with other duties when needed.
good,You can see the same review from my other Walgreens store.  I have done an outstanding job and more than what is expected of me.
good,This job taught me to work hard at everything I do but still providing strong customer service when needed. We had plenty of things to do at this job but the customers always came first. Management rotated fairly often which made it hard to get comfortable at some points. Like  most jobs we had some really good coworkers and some coworkers who didn't work as hard or get along with people.The hardest part of the job was at some points getting the task list done when we were so busy because our first priority was the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the relationships that I was able to build with some of my customers and hearing them say that I was the reason they kept coming back.
good,Great coworkers and store manager. Corporate is becoming more and more controlling making it difficult to enjoy work.
good,"Customer service expert, Data entry, Inventory management, Fill Technician, third party reconciliation on rejected claims, compounding, shipping and receiving, calibrating machines, maintain priorities, workflow company policies and procedures."
good,"Despite it's small size as a store, Walgreens is a very busy place of work. You will learn about customer service, cash handling, as well as stocking and other task based skills required to work there. There are only 1-2 managers per store (store manager + one or two assistant managers and assistant manager in training).  the range of shift leaders varies with each location, and staff varies according to busyness of store."
good,"A typical day at work includes seeing a minimum of 5 patients within 5 counties including and surrounding Philadelphia. Teaching, blood work, dressing changes and head to toe assessments are an essential part of the job"
good,I honestly think that if you want a starter job you should definitely start here. Meet a lot great people. And if they see any potential in you for moving up the chain. Take it!
good,"Nice people, nice place to work, and many convenient locations but starting salaries are low. I would recommend it as a place to work."
good,See me personally. I worked from home and covered the North Shore area. I learned a lot about new drugs on the market. My colleagues are wonderful.
good,Walgreens gives the sense of care to all their customers whether they need a box of cereal or a prescription filled.  As soon as a customer walks in they are greeted warmly by the head cashier and they quickly work to get questions answered
good,The management development programs they have in place are really good. Advancement gets a little stagnant after being a store manager but great experience
good,"Walgreens was a good company and I enjoyed working there, but didn't care for their restructuring. They reduced everyones pay and changed all the titles"
good,"Walgreens is a growing company, however they are open everyday of the year from 7:00a.m-10:00p.m even holidays which means limited family time."
good,"If you're lucky enough to be grouped in a location where others (co-workers and management team) do their job just as well as you do, then you're good. Otherwise, good luck relocating or moving on."
good,"I loved this job at first, it was completely different from my previous work. I learned how to develop film, unload trucks, stocking , working a hand held computer. This was an easy job, no real complaints."
good,"The management was good, but one of the pharmacists I worked under was terrible. He was very demeaning to me and always trying to find a fault in me."
good,"Walgreens as a whole is a decent place to work. The benefits are nice but, job security and advancement are somewhat difficult. walgreens preaches of a wonderful job culture but hardly display it their actions. For instance, customers are right but they are very rude in the way they want to achieve their personal goals. Walgreens doesn't celebrate any Holidays."
good,"Everyone there is very nice and helpful with anything you ask for. It is a very laid back and relaxed setting. Sometimes getting calls back to back can be overwhelming, but they let you go at your own pace."
good,Do the things you are supposed to do. Apparently I excelled since I actually did them and on time. There isn't much to say. They asked me to perform tasks and I did. It was fine. They didn't pay me enough to live but I couldn't blame them given the work.
good,"Fun Place to Work And Experience New Things , Such as Stock, Retail And Handling a Cashier Position . Everything Was Basic And Easy To Pick up On. The Most Enjoyable Part of The Job Was Cashier"
good,"A typical day at work involved greeting customers, catering to their every need, organizing displays, wringing people out at the cash register, assisting with inventory and  cleaning/ maintaining an organized store. I enjoyed putting up displays because it allowed my imagination to flow. I also enjoyed working in teams to get inventory done. Overall it was a good experience and I learned a lot about what goes into keeping a business up."
good,Walgreens was a very adventurous place to work i really enjoyed interacting with my customers and keeping up with the fast paced environment.
good,Tough retail environment.  Corporate has good intentions but store level employees feel a disconnect.  Challenging environment to excel.
good,"This was once a crazy, fast paced workplace with long hours then it turned into a slow paced normal 9-5 job. I learned everything I know about IV medications."
good,"Attended many manager workshops as well as training in MTM,Specialty meds, and retail bedside delivery of meds. Middle management needs to improved and business direction seemed to be always shifting"
good,"Coworkers are fun and easygoing. Managers are rude, talk to employees and vendors in a demeaning manner. The managers are disrespectful and pushy. Pushes employees to sell flu shots and pushes employees to get customers to buy candy at the front register. Takes forever to get a raise and the raise isn't that much. Can't request a day off after October due to the holidays. Changes schedule at last minute without any notification, But the fellow employees are really fun and the work is for the most part easy."
good,"i had to run the cash rap while cleaning and stocking up the whole store i didn't see  much help on duty and break down pallets,"
good,the people where nice and my co-workers where nice too. we all worked together to get the job done. when you work at Walgreens you need to be able to work in a team and i learned that from working there.
good,Management hates the place as much as any of its workers. We are always short staffed because the men in suits are trying to save money.
good,"Walgreens provides good compensation and pay.  However, it is a busy place to work.  It is hard to get vacation time off with this company."
good,This is probably just an easy place to get a job. But the hours can go up and down until you secure some type of relationship with the scheduler.
good,"Excellent place to work , Colleagues and customer are most enjoyable. Fast paced and flexible hours. A typical day at work consists of remaining busy and learning new things"
good,"It can be hard to work in the pharmacy but many times it can be rewarding to know how much you have helped a customer. Attention to detail and the ability to learn quickly is very important. In addition, customer service skills and being assertive/direct is an important component too."
good,"A typical work day is fast paced, long hours, and involves multitasking. Each day is a new day to learn something new. The most enjoyable part of my job for me is interacting with customers. I enjoy putting a smile on each customer face and helping with them with any inquiries they have. If in need of assistance you can call on your colleagues or management to lend a helping hand."
good,not really the type of place for anyone just starting out. they will not train you right. not recommended for anyone who is easily offended or bothered by what your boss thinks
good,Walgreens was not very employee oriented they cared more about numbers then employees and safety. The warehouse was very hot with no air conditioning and they demanded their employees to work 10 or more hours a day in the heat
good,"Store manager always tried to help when they could."
good,"okay place to work if its your first job"
good,"As most of the co-workers are great to work with, and usually become friends, the organization and management-based structure of this place is definitely the company's demise."
good,Great place to start a career and get you self in the medical world. Great atmosphere and the company cares for the employees.
good,When I worked their I wads the youngest one their. My coworkers were kind of rude and they tried to put their work on me.  But i did learn good communication and sales skills there.
good,"cleaning and fixing isles, helping customers with makeup and finding things, closing duties and helping count registers and the safe and the end of the night."
good,"If you are interested in retail sales then I suggest for a beginning to management. The work load is not too hard, it is a good stepping plate."
good,"The store's mission is admirable, but the poor management of certain store locations is something that can't be ignored. Employees are often expected to do work that is far outside of their job description."
good,"overall this job is fast paced and demanding for most people, although it helps you become well versed in a variety of areas surround retail and the financial industry."
good,This is a specialty pharmacy consisting of many drugs that are not found in a typical retail settings.  The pharmacy works on prior authorization and co-pay assistance to help serve patients with complex disease states.
good,I really enjoyed this job. Its a fast paced working environment. It was a joy to work with a great staff as well. I was able to form lasting relationships with my co-workers and the community.
good,i learned a lot as the head photo specialist however at the time i worked there the photo equipment was so old that it malfunctioned a lot to the point where i couldn't even do my job and customers would get upset because there picture orders were taking so long to be completed. the co-workers were great tho definitely made friends here
good,"The retail environment provides an opportunity to take care of our customers in the following day to day interactions: in addition to medication dispensing, health care counseling, health screenings, provide/administer several vaccines (certified immunizer) and MTM services"
good,"Day shift work is pretty standard, but depending on who your manager is, they may ask for certain things to be done even at very busy times or during equipment malfunctions. A 15 minute break and 30 minute lunch are standard; another 15 minute break is included for those who work over 8 hours."
good,Bright and growing work environment with room for growth within the company. Work well with others and love to be challenged in different situations. Willing to learn and take a risk of making a change in my career. The most enjoyable part of my job is taking care of my patient and getting to know them.
good,"Overall its a great job if you work with a great pharmacy team. Typical over work under paid job, but better than working at Walmart (which I have worked before). Great benefits for full-time not sure about part-time. The management at the store I work at is great! Can't say I feel the same way about corporate."
good,"Working at Walgreens is a great experience, I learned that I can do anything that I set my mind to and accomplish it. I made some pretty good friends there, not everyone was nice but everyone I became friends with is. Management was good, until there became a lot of favoritism. But that didn't effect my work."
good,"It was mine first time working 1 year & 6 months."
good,easy going environment which encourages customer interaction and learning more so than its competitors.  The DM is great to get along with
good,This was a good learning work place before budget cuts and limitations set forth by management. It's a specialty pharmacy working with doctor's office and building relationships to manage patient's health.
good,"Walgreens is a company which focuses on numeric numbers.  Advancement is extremely competitive; continuing learning is required. While some stores embrace a team-driven atmosphere and encourage individual professional growth, it is not the same across the board. This would be a perfect employment opportunity for  young adults yearning for retail experience, or those who have a medical background but do not desire the typical scheduling requirements of such."
good,"Everyday was busy, understaffed, and overwhelming."
good,"Great place to work if you're a college student. Not a day went by where you didn't learn something new. Lots of phone calls from/to doctors, patients, and nurses. It can sometimes be stressful and fast-paced."
good,The company is ok. The security there is horrible.The managers has been there for years 10+ and will never get any other job so they are jerks about even the smallest things. They are not at all friendly.
good,great place to work; great people to work with; good location; bus accessible; good spots to eat at for lunch; great shopping area too
good,"I installed satellites, computers, Point of Sale registers, switches, routers, alarms, phone systems, printers, etc.  I installed all the equipment that a typical Walgreen's store needed to function with.  It was a fun job."
good,"great 1st time job, employees and customers are very respectful of one another. Hours were very manageable and so here the days."
good,it is good place to work at unless you attend school or have another job. Your work schedule changes each week which makes it hard to balance out your personal life.
good,"You learn about what its like to be a every day person at Walgreens, you meet people of every age, background etc.  The stress at walgreens is high."
good,Laid back atmosphere. Great co-workers and management. Good job if you are just starting out on your own. Flexible scheduling.
good,Fast paced community setting that was very demanding but rewarding at the same time.  Worked closely with patients and doctors to ensure the best possible patient care.
good,"•	Managed team of 40+ Work at Home Pharmacists in a production center style atmosphere.  Utilized company developed metrics to drive specialists to optimum productivity.  Maintained daily WFM analyst functions in IEX to ensure Pharmacists and specialists adherence and productivity."
good,good company to work for. decent benefits. average pay. good supervisors. family friendly environment. creating comraderie among co-workers is highly encourged. good training program
good,"I worked here for a short time and enjoyed learning new things. I learned how to break down freight and go in early when needed and I put away items. I answered phones, and rang people up at the cash register."
good,"There is never a dull moment at Walgreens. Everyone has tasks assigned to them to get done during the course of their shift. I learned how to change photo ribbon and paper. I also learned how to take passport pictures. I would have to say one of the hardest parts of my job is when I have multiple vendors come in at the same time and our parking lot is filled with their trucks, I have had many customers come up to me and complain about not being able to find parking. I enjoy working with my coworkers and chatting with them outside of work."
good,"I have worked at Walgreens for about 2 years. I work as a clerk and sometimes, I would have to alternate between photo tech, clerk and beauty advisor when there is a lack of employees. On truck days, we're responsible for putting away shipments. The staff is friendly"
good,"Its a good first job for people. You learn many skills such as customer service, organizing, money handling, and people skills."
good,"I worked in the photo lab, and for a while at one location I was the head photo specialist. Processing film, working with people, chemicals, and other retail related tasks always kept me busy."
good,"productive, fast-pace workload, team working, decent manager, nice co-worker relationshhip, working under sressful situation, enjoyed in patient relationship and helping patients with drug dosage and drug formulation."
good,"Fast pace and you learn something new everyday. Great opportunities for you to grow within the company. I have learned how to work with team members, train, manage, and delegate."
good,"Taking in prescriptions, typing prescriptions, filling prescriptions, take care of insurance problems, deletes for the day, stock the drams and vials."
good,"very strong minded, very focus , very above and beyond group of ppl my time there was well invested and i will always love the ppl that i worked with"
good,Overall Walgreens is a good place to work. I learned that the hardest part of being a manager is managing your people. That is job in itself. The most enjoyable part is that there are always goals to achieve.
good,"A typical day at work in the current environment revolves around positive customer service.  On a daily basis I am also responsible for inventory, shipping, filling prescriptions and scheduling.  I do enjoy working with people and solving problems."
good,"I can definitely say I received the best 'quality' of training for customer service at Walgreens. The pharmacy is always fast paced, unless it is a holiday or summer break. I do wish there were more hours available for the staff to work more productively and efficiently and faster for the great amount of customers that constantly show. The waiting time has had to be extended from the automated systems hour and a half limit to two hours to assure the patient will receive their medications on time, because there aren't enough technicians to attend drive thru services, front desk, and still fill prescriptions and type scripts that are brought in. The management is wonderful, very family friendly oriented, even with loyal customers, however, it is difficult to call for help from management when they are as well short staffed in the main store. My personal review would have to emphasize on the limited amount of staff available for such big crowds of customers expecting someone to attend them asap and still have their medications on time. It is similar to walking into a convenience store seeing ten registers open, and only one cashier available to attend all who enter the store."
good,"I was moved to 5 different stores and was moved to my final store 25 minutes away when I had three stores within minutes of my home. I only accepted the job as they stated I would stay close to home. As a young assistant manager in training I found it hard to get anyone to listen to you. I think that can be attributed to the areas where I trained, bad parts of Canton and Akron, OH."
good,"I like to be busy and have plenty of projects in my day, so this job isn't one of my favorites."
good,"Typical day at work are solving customer issues, manage employees and keep the store need and organized. "
good,"Great benefits and the pay is ok for what you do. Overall Walgreens is a great company, management could be better but not as bad as other jobs."
good,"A typical day consist of assisting customers, checking out, printing photo orders, making photo calendars and collages, stocking the shelves and maintaining the store. Although working here can sometimes be nice, my managers did not recognize employees work and needs. My co-workers were fun to work with and helped when needed. The best part of my job is making photos and other photo products."
good,"A typical day at Walgreen's in the photo area was pretty interesting. I would meet new people, take photos so customers could get there passports. Also customers would bring in film and memory cards to print pictures that I would have to process for them. When there was no customers doing photos I would make sure the shelves were stocked nice and neat also if it was to busy open registers to ring out customers"
good,"Like I said before, I really hope the company starts investing their time into their employees, you would really see more results if they did."
good,"OK job and work environment.  The employee's are shady and some of the management does not treat you fairly.  People there like to cliche up and set others up for failure.  It would be a nice place to work, but the situations that happen between team members make you not want to work there.  A lot of the employees there are immature and it is not much of a team in my opinion."
good,Walgreens is a slow paced job. I would recommend this job to teens. I loved working there just not fast enough for me. I enjoy working with people.
good,I would stay at my station and I would take pictures all day. I learned how to sell to mass amount of people at one time. The hardest part of the was during holiday season. I just love people that's was the best part of my job. Management was fair and co-workers the same.
good,"Leadership,"
good,I got to learn how to deal with a variety of different customers and people when i worked in this job. It was a good filler job for me.
good,"unload truck, stock shelves, cashier, and assist customers, management was very much engaged every work day and my coworkers and I all worked as a team. There was no hard part, I enjoyed working with people on a daily basis."
good,The management does not back up the workers when it comes to being a mentor nor growth. The lack of pay is disturbing as well for high volume stores.
good,A typical day at work for me is being in the cashier register taking care of customers. I learned customers come first. This is a good job if its just part time
good,Fun place to work for the most part. Just not a lot of opportunities to move up in the company. I enjoyed all my co-workers and management was good. I left this company to go to school to start a long time career.
good,"I completed an education related training externship at the Walgreens Pharmacy on North Main in Salinas, California. It was a very busy and thus fast paced location. My work there was very appreciated as management policies had left the pharmacy somewhat understaffed. I enjoyed the activity level and very much enjoyed my hard working and friendly coworkers."
good,I loved working her it is easy. They don't get mad if you are late but you will not become rich here you must have a side hustle.
good,"externship, unpaid working experience. great people, worked there for short amount of time before graduating from school."
good,Corporation will look out for them and they wont invest in their employees. Frequent policy changes because of frequent DM changes.
good,"Walgreens is a good company to work for.  Working nights, weekends, and holidays isn't fun but its what you sign up for when you work retail.  I think they need to pay more for the work you are required to do."
good,honest place to work if your desire is the community and serving. very fun work place and co workers and staff are great. its not really a difficult job
good,"This an okay company to work for. Not the greatest but I am quite positive there are much worse. Work constantly presents different challenges each day, not because they vary often but because of call offs, lack of open availability for employees."
good,it is a very fast and quick place to work.  and the client are always very nice and polite. they never close on holidays or do snow we are always there for my customers.
good,"The company is moving in a great direction, but it really depends on who your store manager is. My first store manager was amazing, helped me move up, taught me so much about the company and how to further myself. Unfortunately, two store managers swapped stores and my second manager was just awful, he made it feel like it was just a job again, and made everyone's life awful."
good,Great team at times. Met my best friend there and really liked some of the management. Had a lot of fun with the surveys and games we played.
good,Management needs help. Good coworkers. No sense of caring for health of own employees. Made life long friends. Was able to put school knowledge to use.
good,walgreens was a nice place to interact with other people and u got to make companions while doing your job. i also did alot of organizing there.
good,"If you are a hard worker you can move up in the company, but at a store level. I like working with most of my co-workers, but it's hard to work for a company that doesn't value what their employee's do.  Assistant Managers went to be called Shift Leads.  When they changed our job title they also took away part of our hourly wage."
good,"Past that, it is not a nice place to work. You get paid bad. You get treated poorly. The stuff they make you do is stupid. The fact that they make you work regular hours on ALL holidays is totally crazy. It is like a smaller Wal Mart."
good,"There isn't really much I can say about Walgreens other than its an ok place to work. I did enjoy working there, but I don't remember a whole lot about my time spent there."
good,"Advancement is sketchy. Your told one thing and another thing happens. Co workers and good, and good team environment,."
good,"i worked with a great boss, i got my paycheck almost always on time, and i didn't get robbed on night shift. but, my cashier job became a sales job and couponers invaded the store every morning."
good,"I enjoy working there and the patients. the working envirorment was ok,  always had something to do, there was no down time to get board."
good,they are ok. they] are ok they are ok they are ok. how much do you want from me  its walgreens not the greatest job in the world. hope u are happy now
good,"As an extern, Walgreens was well worth my time. I would open and close the store at times, i filled typed, did returns, stacked files, i literally did everything there is to do at Walgreens. I very much enjoyed the workplace and all the things i learned on a day to day basis. Everything i learned can been seen in my resume :). Managemant sucked though, and im just being honest. they just didnt care enough about their employees. I very much enjoyed the fact that i learned something new on a regular basis while i was there though. My issues with the company came when i noticed things weren't balance and everything was extremely disorganized. Im pretty big on organization so that became a major concern of mine. As well as the fact that Walgreens Co. as a whole just didn't care for their employees like they should. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the CONSTANT changes. Overall id go back in a heartbeat. Pharmacy is my life :)"
good,A technicians day is full of customer service and filling prescriptions. We are in charge of the inventory ordering the daily truck and put it way all while we answer phones and do are daily task. Pharmacy technicians spend time on the phone with third party trying to resolve  insurance matters. We even call doctor office to get refill authorize for our patient. During the day we compound special medications as needed. We are responsible for all he nightly cleaning and trash. Its very important for a pharmacy to stay clean. Last thing i always did as a technician is organize and file the scripts at the end of the day.
good,"Working at walgreens was different from hospital and home care, the reason why is because you actually work the customers in person. You have to deal with a lot of different attitudes. Working here was a good experience for me and i like doing it"
good,Walgreens is a real fast paced place to work at. A typical day is non stop from beginning to end no matter what shift you work. I've learned a lot from various Store Managers in business management.
good,Walgreens provides the opportunity to learn a lot of new things.  You must be a strong self learner as they do not have strong management training programs via systems.
good,"A typical day at work consist of dealing with the general public. Providing very proactive customer service. Walking customers' to products, asking if they required any assistance with anything else, and thanking them for shopping at Walgreens. Learned how to lead by example by when becoming a manager, by setting the standards on how work should be done properly. Co-Workers very supportive, cooperative effort to get daily tasks complete. The hardest part of the job was not being fully informed about policies and procedures, I felt as though I had to teach myself everything and if I did not know I would get into trouble. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things so that it would better my customer service skills, and help me grow into a more detailed oriented person in life."
good,Long days starting with writing note to hold employees accountable while training to help advance employees.   Company has gone through some major changes in the past few years so the culture is a lot different from when I first started 10 years ago.
good,"-Engages customers and patients by greeting them and offering assistance with products and services. "
good,"Typical day at work; count safe, approve and process any daily price changing/markdowns, assist Rx in processing scripts, receive vendors, help customers with every need. manage staff."
good,Nice place to start a first job to learn and gain responsibility. Co-workers are usually friendly and customers can be very nice as well.
good,Wonderful place to work at if management would simply put away these engraved politics and really listen to what the employees are asking for from them.
good,This job allowed me to be creative when it came to sales plans and how to hit them. Not much room to move up in the company and they will transfer you all over the place. The compensation isn't bad to start off.
good,"in the pharmacy you have to work at a very high pace, keeping up with phone calls, patients and filling medications. no error is acceptable, I love my job I've been doing it for 10 years with the hours of operation and trying to raise a 2 year old alone it has become hard to joggle both with getting off late"
good,"The work was not hard, its basic money handling and stocking, a bit of cleaning the store after hours, shifts are 8 hours, get ready to spend a lot of time on your feet, the management at this particular establishment was awful. he kept us late and had to be told by corporate office to stop it. The co-workers were pretty nice, there was joking and such, but they didn't seem inclined to step up and say the boss was treating them unfairly even going so far as to say that is was ""bad team attitude "" to say staying till 2 AM was wrong and not letting people transfer to other locations for perfectly innocent reason was unacceptable. Hardest part of the job would be staying late and learning overrides for the register, easiest would be stocking shelves."
good,"working at walgreens was fun always busy. I like talking to the customers and helping, I would of stayed if management was better and more approachable."
good,"Every day I cashed out customers and answered their questions as the ""Beauty Adviser"". This title also doubled as customer service because I answered and transferred all the calls to the store. I did work at the busiest Walgreens in Western New York, so the store was very busy each and every day. Besides cashing out the customers, I was in charge of restocking and facing all of the products from baby care to shampoo, and makeup to face wash. It wasn't a difficult job, just always on your feet. Management was average when working with availability, but tried to give many hours to the employees. My co workers were very task oriented and friendly. I Enjoyed the employee discount the most."
good,"Overall its a good company to work for if you like working with customers. Its flexable, the co workers are great to work with.  Management has been consistant so far."
good,Worked with a great group of people. Was never to satisfied with working there. Management was very unappreciative. worked terrible hours. My regular customers were the best part of the day.
good,It was always nice to get to see the customers and help them out. I liked having things to do all day so I could feel like I was really earning my paycheck.
good,"Typical day is accurately placing items in tote but you have to make rate. As in, you have to do it in a very timely matter. Management is kinda bad."
good,"Was a very friendly company, that was the first to help me get my manager experience. My co-workers were awesome and higher management was great."
good,Good company to work for. Never a dull moment working in this company. Always something to do. One good thing about this company was customer service was always in place.
good,"Receive payment by cash, check, credit card, or automatic debit. Issues receipts, refunds, credits, or change due to customer. Assist customer by providing information and resolving their complaint. Answer customers' questions, and provide information on procedures or policies. Process merchandise returns and exchanges. Maintain clean and orderly checkouts. Create prints according to customer specifications and laboratory protocols. Examine developed prints for defects. Insert processed negatives and prints into envelopes for delivery to customers, and maintain records. Receive written prescription or refill requests, and verify that the information is complete and accurate. Answer telephones, respond to questions or request. Fill bottles with prescribed medications, and type and affix labels"
good,The company in itself is good.  There are a few problems just like every other company. Like not enough hours to fully cover stores the way it should be.
good,"The company is not the same company I started with nearly 20 years ago, a lot has changed. I can not say it is all good or all bad, all I can say is that the transition of new upper management has been bumpy at times. Knowing that every company needs to evolve over time, it felt like the lower levels of the company...the employees running the store... had the hardest brunt of the transition. Personally speaking, I had to learn the new ways of operation, train others, as well as explain to our customers what was going on at times. In the end, it evened itself out and all was good. Now there has been a merger and we are going into another transition. "
good,"Any retail place you work at, is bound to have issues. Walgreens is an overall great retail store to work at. But there are some kinks in it that need to be changed. A lot has changed within my store in the last month or two, but there are still a lot of issues that need to brought up. One being, management needs to be a little more understanding about their employees needs. And not make coming to work more like a chore than a great place to be."
good,"Very fast paced and strenuous jobs. A lot of lifting, bending and stretching. I've learned the ins and outs of how a distribution center works. Some managers are great and good to work for; others not so much. My co-workers are a great bunch of people and everyone gets along. The hardest part of the job is trying to make rate on a consistent basis."
good,Typical day would be overseeing the operations of my store as well as another 5 in my community. I would make sure the operations of my location are running ok and then touch base and work with the other 5 locations. I mentored and managed over 180 people and was there 1st point of contact with any issues they had in their stores.
good,Like a family. Everyone is a team player and the manager really cares about the employees. He takes the time to understand everyone's different personalities.
good,"A typical job day at Walgreen will include helping customers mostly importantly, merchandising and sticking items. While working at Walgreen I have learned several things such as having great customer care and the customer is always right, I have learned how to do inventory and more. My management team is great, they push me to exceed and teach me new things everyday. As for my co-workers, I love teaching them new things that they may have a hard time with, I love working as a team with my co-workers. By doing so, things get accomplished faster. The hardest part of the job will have to be keeping things that are on sale stocked on the sales floor at all times. I say this because most times, not enough items are received and we run out. The most enjoyable part of my job will have to be meeting and interacting with customers."
good,Fast pace retail pharmacy environment. Great opportunity to provide   care to the community. Must be excellent at multi-tasking.
good,"Overall Walgreens is a great company to work for.. Great 401k and benefits, but pay is minimal.  "
good,Hard to work for this company with two small children. Not very flexible scheduling for a part time pharmacist. But it was an exciting place to work.
good,Walgreens is a good company to work for with good benefits.  They like to promote from within and train employees for that task.
good,"Working with excellent customer service, pulling up photo orders and printing them out. Helping customers at kiosk and up selling by showing customer what else we have to offer. Helping the front register with ringing out customers when lines are too long. Helping warehouse stock shelves and unloading truck."
good,Great place to learn and become a CPhT. Stressful work environment as payroll is tight causing you to often skip breaks and sometimes meals.
good,Cool place to work. some co-workers you have to watch out for and others can make you day better. the work is moderate and spread evenly. hardest part is dealing with difficult elderly folks. All in all not that bad.
good,"Walgreens was okay. I worked in the bad area. So there was a lot of theft & craxyness going on. The managers are nice"
good,The company is going through so many changes that it has forgotten about the little people. This company has become money hungry and doesnt care about its employees. Ive already achieved the highest position available as a tech and now im stuck..... in a company that sees employees as cattle.
good,Thai delight had awesome employees and manager was great. manager worked with my schedule. I always enjoyed work. The owner was unprofessional but other than that it was ok.
good,"I have loved my time with Walgreens. During my time with the company I met a lot of wonderful people and have made several lasting friendships. The physical demands of the job are a little more than I had anticipated when I applied. Now that I have had a child and am still recovering from it physically, the demands of my job are proving to be a bit too much. A typical day has me going an average of 14,000 steps per day, as well as lifting, pushing, pulling, taking deliveries, stocking shelves, and many other tasks. This often involves loads of 40 lbs or more."
good,I worked as a Pharmacist Technician. This job was fasted paste environment.  I worked assisting the Pharmacist with the preparation of prescription. I entered prescriptions and prepared prescription verified insurance.
good,It was good for awhile but bosses matter and they have both good and bad bosses. Hope you get a good boss otherwise it will be a long slog.
good,My main issue is the  lack of concern for employees versus the overwhelming concern for the bottom line. No other concerns at this time.
good,like every retail jobs you work with the public. you get to know your customers and they get to know you. if your shy it brings you out of that and has the opportunity to build confidence.
good,"Average company to work for. Some interesting and strange company policies. Patients do not come first, prescription count and profit is more important."
good,Very limited and restricted in terms of hours for techs. Spends more time looking to improve their bottom line by cutting hours instead of through improving customer service by having appropriate staffing.
good,This is a good job with better hours as opposed to working the entire day. I learned a lot of experience in terms of working in customer service and resolving important insurance information to provide customer satisfaction .
good,"i would have to take in prescriptions and scan them.  I would have to file and type each prescriptions correctly and then fill the appropriate prescription in the vial.  Handle the cash register, call patients, and doctors.  The hardest part of the job is to put in the order.  It would take a while to get used to the system on the computer and you would only have an hour to put the order in the system before the online order store is closed.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that  you get the learn the names of the drugs and what each one does.  It was very interesting learning new prescription and new pharmacist terms and codes"
good,"I did not learn how to work in groups. My co-workers were okay. They tried to make me feel comfortable. My shift when I was working there would vary. Sometimes my shift would be in the mornings, it was mostly at nights. The hardest part of the job was having to do the things that nobody else wanted to do. I did not have a part of the job that I really enjoyed."
good,"Shift ours are great and steady with a good amount of work always to be done to keep you busy.  You are taught great customer service skills to help you stay at the top of your game in the industry.  Management is management, the positive about the management at Walgreens is that they don't micromanage, you have a given list for whatever position you are working that you are expected to complete by the end of your shift.  Co-workers are pretty good and everyone tends to get along.  The hardest part of the position that I hold is the long hours standing in one area for the entire shift, but with your given breaks it all works out in the end.  The most enjoyable part of working with the company are the customers that come in especially the regulars that you actually get to know."
good,"There is no typical day at work. I love that every day is different. My role as an admin is more like being a jack-of-all-trades. When anyone on my staff needs assistance right away, they will call me and I will make it happen. Whatever it is. Spreadsheets, fix machines, order lunch, schedule meetings with 'hard to get' people, borrow tools, grab a postage stamp. I like that they know I can do whatever is needed and that they appreciate it."
good,working at Walgreens is ok the pay sucks for what you have to do sometimes it was a better place work before even when I started only two years ago it seemed better
good,For my first paid job Walgreens was not too bad. They worked around my school schedule and helped me learn skills to move around the company well. Eventually the manager was not around much and was hard to get in touch with. They started cutting my hours and i had to move on.
good,"I enjoyed working at walgreens. I helped out in every department, from cashiering to maintenance, to stock room, replenishing floor stock, organizing the stock room, checking inventory, etc."
good,"typical day includes:"
good,"a very exhausting environment, but the manager can hire in store in stead of a divisional manager that will never see you again."
good,"There is a strong requirement of quality customer service there.  There are strict limitations on bathroom breaks and lunches, however."
good,The enjoyment part about working at Walgreens was the learning something new everyday. It's never the same thing everyday.
good,Working through college or just starting out is a perfect time to work at Walgreens.  There is room for advancement but it is really only for someone who truly loves retail.  Advancement is hard to come by and it requires years of time to acquire.  It is great for those who love contact with customers.
good,"Handled and took care of the cash register. "
good,At Walgreens you are slave labor.  Nothing more.  They don't care about you and you are just another number.  Schedule stinks and its hard to balance a life outside of work.
good,In my opinion the most enjoyable and important part of work is assisting the customers and assuring that they leave the store completely satisfied.
good,"I loved Walgreens it was organized and well managed."
good,"A typical day in a pharmacy can be a long one, the pharmacy I worked in, we did approximately 500 presciptions per day what a rush.  Each day could be a challenge, the ability and the must know information varies at times, learning the Medi-Care insurance programs in order to assist the patients with which one may be best for them, new terminology, keeping up with the new laws on different types of medicines, how they can or cannot be dispensed, ICD codes that doctors must have on prescriptions for different instructions.  State laws governing the meds and even our qualifications.  Irate customers that you just can't reason with.  I love giving the best customer service possible in order to ensure my patients satisfaction."
good,Productive and fun workplace very busy and a welcoming place to be.helping customers come and get there fast shopping with or close convenient items.
good,"It is fun and constantly moving forward. As the store manager the atmosphere in my store is what I make it out to be. It is fun and enjoyable"
good,Need to provide excellent customer care to demanding clients. Assignments should be tackled as a team. Be aware of managing your time.
good,Added some more customer service skills. I learned how to work overnight and opened up my job search to work any time. Hardest part is dealing with certain co-workers that the management won't do anything to fix it because of how long they have been in the company.
good,Loved working for this company. They had great management and great employee benefits. Lots of room for advancement. Loved working with the public.
good,"Fast paced with multi tasking while coaching and leading people. "
good,I actually credit Walgreens with teaching me about hard work. It was my first time being a manager and to this day lazy people annoy me.
good,Great place to explore new skills and co workers are friendly. Management should focus on nurturing the talent and make resources ready for better opportunities
good,Very good hands on job experience. I enjoyed the many duties and varied tasks each day. Great environment and opportunity for growth.
good,"Constant movement"
good,"My job is to provide feedback to specialists entering in prescriptions information. I have the ability to see the image a specialist see on my screen and provide an answer to their question. My job was not hard but  was rewarding in that I could assist specialists in their jobs, and ultimately the patient. I learned that accuracy and efficiency are key to any productive teams goals. The hardest part of my job was answering questions that I felt should have been common knowledge or easily found in the operating procedures.The amazing people I worked with. Also I was giving numerous opportunities for leadership training"
good,"The job is tedious and require multi-tasking. But it is going through growing pains since it has been reverse bought out by Boots Alliance."
good,"Sometimes there is shortage of workers and hours are always being cut.  Co- workers are nice. The hardest part is trying to juggle all of your duties with little help. Even though you express this concern to management, nothing is resolved in the matter. Instead, more duties are added to the worlkload."
good,I have worked with walgreens for some time and they are a good company to work for. The only thing i didnt like was the fact that my location never closed
good,"Being the only associate on the floor at night: stocking, cashiering, replenishing, made me learn a better usage of time management."
good,It was a good first job for me. I enjoyed the flexibility and the co-workers I encountered. The hardest part about the job was having to pull extraneous hours of work.
good,I enjoy working with and helping the customers that come into the store. I have learned a lot about running a store on a day to day level in every aspect. The hardest part of the job is not getting the pay for the amount of responsibility I handle daily. I have met some really awesome people through my years working with the company.
good,"Preparation of claims, timely submission of claims, collection of payments, understanding of insurance billing requirements, obtain prior authorizations, complete daily reports"
good,"Licensed pharmacist with long and diversified, worked in retail, pharmaceutical companies looking for part time from home job, flexible with rate as long work environment is healthy and joyful"
good,"customers are great. management is awesome, employees come with a great attitude and are always willing to help others and work as a team"
good,"a day of work for Walgreens was always a busy one, especially when working in the pharmacy. I learned how to interact with customers and fill prescriptions . talked to doctors to request refills for patients and interact with all of the pharmacy staff. the hardest part of my job as a pharmacy tech at Walgreens was how impatient the customers were sometimes, when I would get a rude customer I would handle the situation as best as I could and have common curtousy for the patient."
good,"•	Overseeing all other employee’s with supervision by the store Manager communicating with employees running the register, Management register functions Managing Photo Inventory. "
good,The company in general is a great company to work for. But the in store work environment is a matter you must discover yourself.Not all stores are the same in no aspect. Depending on what location you are applying for and the friendliness of your coworkers will determine your overall experience at Walgreen's.
good,A typical day in the pharmacy is providing the best customer service possible. Going that extra mile for the customer. Making sure the customer leaves happy and statisfied with the staff and reguarding any concerns reguarding their medications. In the store that i work in it is a small pharmacy staff myself and two pharmacist. WE did everything we can to help each other have the pharmacy run smooth. The most enjoyable part of my job is customer service making sure the customer is happy and interacting with them. The hardest part of the job is when we lose a customer do to them passing away.
good,Very Hostile work environment as everyone scates around trying to get ahead. Was fun at the start but things have continued downward. Management is very untrustworthy and self contained to themselves not the Hourly workers.
good,"I work at the front cashier counter. I take care of the majority of customers that come into Walgreen's. My co-workers aid in assistance if it gets to busy. We have a system of codes that makes the work environment flow very well. The most difficult part of the job is dealing with unhappy customers, although I have learn different ways to overcome situations like such, and honestly it's the most rewarding part of the job to help someone who is unhappy become happy before they leave the store. I enjoy the challenge."
good,"Working with great team members daily. Teaching and training people, managing the store and pharmacy. Always adapting to the changing environment."
good,I enjoyed working at walgreens co.  There are a lot of opportunities for advancement within the company.  I loved the customer service part the most!
good,"Work days are basically working inventory, customer care, money management and making sure cashiers and floor members do their jobs."
good,"•	Greet customers with extraordinary customer service"
good,"Cashier: handle transactions at the register, greet and acknowledge incoming and exiting customers"
good,"Working with the regular customers brought me joy."
good,"Been working for Walgreens for almost a year,  for the most part it is ok being its my first ever real job. It has its ups and downs just like every retail job. The amount of time spent at work doesn't really allow for being with family and your not allowed over 40hrs a week."
good,"Good growth opportunities, but not so good pay. Be willing to work a lot of hours with a lot of physical work involved. Management opportunities are slimming down and it is hard to achieve a greater wage even for those who have been with the company for years."
good,"There really is no typical day at work;  we need to adapt to whatever the outbound processing volume is.  I have learned a great deal and have had a great time.  I really like the folks I had a chance to work with!"
good,One thing you will learn working here is multitasking. Everyday is a new day as there is so much to do and learn.
good,"-There really is no typical day at work, everyday is different and I enjoy that"
good,I believe all in all working at Walgreens has been a learning experience for me.  I have learned a lot of valuable work experience.  I had always worked for a family owned company until Walgreens purchased Sorg Pharmacy.  Going to work for a large Corporation has been a huge adjustment for me but I have managed it.  I enjoy many aspects of a busy pharmacy.
good,Stocked the counters and checked customers out taking payments and give money back
good,Good job for someone new to the workforce.  Great learning experience in customer service and customer satisfaction.
good,Poor job environment with cliques. Enjoyable work with customers though.
good,"fast pace job"
good,"Cashier, Target, Oklahoma City, OK "
good,A multi task work place. You learn how to counsel patient and improve customer services skills. Management is willing  to help you with things you need improvement on. Work can be overwhelmed many of time. There is no lunch break. The company offer training on medicare updates.
good,"a decent place to work, very flexible hours and a kind work place"
good,Dealt with it for almost two years and dealt with the rudest customers.
good,A typical day starts with working on projects immediately.  Management area always present.
good,"The company is moving in a poor direction. It is constantly concerned with budget and sacrifices its employees comfort at work. Constantly understaffed stores with long lines because of the lack of man power. Constantly cutting pay, hours available, switching management on a 6 month basis, and does not give credit to its employees where credit is due. The company is ok to work for if you are not trying to make a living or move up in the company. Managers and higher-ups will not allow for you to move in a vertical direction. horizontal movement is preferred by the company."
good,"The location I work at has honestly the best management team I have ever worked for. They are caring, supportive, and hard working. That being said, the company overall has a severe issue of trying to force too much on too few people. Not only are pharmacy technicians required to do usual pharmacy work, but Walgreens has partnered with Theranos and now required its techs to become Theranos certified. So we are essentially Pharmacy and Phlebotomy Technicians."
good,i'm still friends with most of the employees and management when i worked there. i loved the atmosphere and people where a joy. the hardest part was the wages and time spent at work and away from family.
good,"I started at walgreens in 2008, worked there for 3 years to be moved to the photo department. I was not trained properly and I learned by day to day activities with a lot of trial and error. Management pretends to listen but never any action. Customers were always great and the job itself is relatively easy. Most of my complaints are directed to the management side. Other than that, I loved what I did once I figured everything out."
good,I work on weekends at Walgreen's and love working with co-workers and customers. Management works with the employees in a great way in providing benefits and work schedule. Meeting different customers and building a relationship is the fun part. The salary is not satisfactory as compared to the workload.
good,I would clock in and be the cahier there. not much was a small compony. I would greet the consters that would come in everyday. I didn't mind working a little bit overmy time. I loved helping the custmors out in any way I could even tho I couldn't do much.
good,i started right when christmas shopping started so was very hectic when i first started but my job as photo specialist wasnt a hard job and i got to make a lot of people happy
good,"I worked with individuals in the photo department, produced photo orders, and performed accurate point-sale transactions. I enjoyed working with people one-on-one, and learned that even a small conversation can brighten someone's day."
good,"Loved working here, it was close to my home, and I enjoyed meeting alot of new people."
good,The staff is very helpful and a pleasure to work with. Great place for students and people working their first job to work. It's a good place to work while you look for a better and higher paying position elsewhere.
good,"Good opportunity to learn & create ideas for others to use. Ability to multitask and improve your communication skills. Work at different tasks, become more aggressive to accomplishing goals, and interacting with others. Also introduce yourself to your partners that you will work with to provide a better working experience."
good,"As a pharmacy technician extern at Walgreen, I was exposed to reality of pharmacy world and customer care. There I functioned as a fully pharmacy technician and fulfill duties as one would. I also provide customer service to patients who came in to drop and pick up prescriptions."
good,Not a bad place to work and your always busy. Very friendly staff. Willing to always help you.
good,Pretty ok type job. Had some of the best customers.  Hardest part of the job was when we recieved shipment and that was not to tough
good,It was mostly older people that worked there and i didn't connect with them very well.
good,"A typical day at Walgreens involves dealing with frustrated customers first hand, fill prescriptions, and filing completed drugs, some of the co-worker and very helpful and other can be very rude which can be one the hardest parts of the job."
good,"A typical day at work, would be eight hours on your feet, helping customers find what they need. Helping customers with prescriptions, photos, and cosmetic products. Stocking and maintaining departments in the store. I have learned a lot working at Walgreens, not only job duties and responsibilities, but learning to be a leader and going the extra mile. The co-workers there are a big part of what makes your job. Making sure everyone feels part of the team and get the training they need. I always feel it is important to get everyone one involved and socialize, like for instance, having potlucks and doing birthday and holiday cards/gifts. The hardest part of the job would be, your work load and the photo machines. The most enjoyable part of working at Walgreens is, it's never boring, always much to do and meeting new people, and building relationships."
good,"Typical day at work:"
good,The job required alot of multi tasking while meeting expectations
good,"flexible schedule"
good,"Not for an individual who wish to advance. "
good,"I have learned a great deal about the retail corporate world, photo developing techniques, and working as part of a team."
good,"Productive fast paced environment, training lacked coordination, schedule changed from week to week, senior technician was to mentor new employees but was not willing to do so. Was unhappy with this position and would not want to work for this company again."
good,"Walgreens is definitely a wonderful environment to work in, my managers and coworkers were all friendly. I didn't like the fact that most of the time there were only a few people working the whole store not including in the pharmacy, that was hard and unusual to me. I learned a lot working there, when I worked in the photo department I learned how to operate the photo machines, and everything that comes with that, and I really enjoyed it."
good,A typical day at work would be to come in and get started with customer service.
good,"At Walgreens I stocked the shelves, I worked in the refrigerator, I helped customers find what they were looking for. Also I organized a shelf of shoes and a stand of sun glasses. Another thing i did was go outside of the store and collect all the carts."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me greeting all customers, ringing them up as a cashier, assisting them with finding anything they needed, stocking the shelves, and cleaning the store. The cons to working at Walgreens is there isn't much variety to what you do, however is was nice to not have look for something you needed to put away because the layout of the store was easy to memorize."
good,"Not enough help putting a lot os stress on pharmacist management does not care about stress co works,ok busy day always company interested in botto  line"
good,"I would count my money on my register, check my station if needed I would clean and front face the shelves, help any customers with questions on products or selection. I learned a lot on different female/baby products and how to set up displays, stock and organized all new products.  My co-workers were very help full and nice to work with.  Hardest part of the job was learning how to set up a display while matching up my paper work with inventory, and still attending to all my customers.  I really loved getting to know my regular customers and seeing them again and getting there input on the product."
good,"During a typical day as a shift lead, leadership skills will take command, providing each employee with plentiful tasks, keeping busy throughout the day. Customers are the number one priority, ensuring no one leaves empty handed and everyone leaves happy, healthy, and well."
good,"Typical day at work consisited in dealing with different varieties of customers. Majority of customers usually were sick, so knowing what product to suit their recovery was a must. Excellent management. This Walgreen location customers mostly consisited of   elderly people, I loved the fact that they were always willing to share stories of the past."
good,I always had a fun team to work with but management has never been Walgreens strong point. Working here was like every man for himself.
good,"Used to be a good company to work for but things have changed the over the past couple of years. Lots of co-workers had their salaries cut just because of a change in their title. I was spared due to being promoted but do not like the new position nor having to drive past four Walgreens to get to the one that I was transferred to, a 45 minute drive one way."
good,"learned a lot about customer service, good pay and benefits."
good,The Walgreens I worked at was a 24 hr store. Everyday it was very busy and stressful.
good,"Not a lot of room for advancement. Long hours, stressful and you get transferred often."
good,I liked all my co-workers the work flow was great you didn't have to do the same job all day we rotated. I learned a lot working here this was my first pharmacy job if they would not have giving me a chance i would not know as much as i do now.
good,I enjoyed working my co-workers. I worked in many departments at this store.
good,Can be a place to where you can make a difference in alot of peoples lives
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is our customers."
good,"My manager was sarcastic and rude and so were the customers. No one trained me at all, I had to train myself and it was just an overall horrible experience"
good,"The company is extremely limited in allowing employees to move up. There is also limited visibility between store employees and upper management. Besides these factors, there is a lot of opportunity to learn a vast amount of skills to bring with you to other career paths."
good,"Walgreens is a growing company that is committed to delivering high quality customer satisfaction, but needs to take a stronger interest in the quality of working conditions of its employees."
good,it was a pretty good place to work. the hours were tolerable and most of the staff worked with me instead of against me.
good,was ok to work at. at first you are thrown around to so many stores it is hard to acclimate. you then get your own store if you are good enough which is better. I would work there again.
good,"I've learned the basics of pharmacy"
good,"High volume of work, company was good to work for, too bad it was bought out by another company."
good,"Company  worked well with the employee, a lot of overtime. Company was bought out by another company."
good,"its a job that's thing its a job not a career very repetitive no real change, some co workers are OK others just don't get it hardest part of the job is dealing with unreasonable people, store management is good the higher up not so much, nothing to enjoyable unless you like people"
good,"Customer service, filling, data entry , multi-tasking. "
good,"Excellent co-worker, As photo specialist work in different areas of the store."
good,"It is an ok place to work. It is a typical retail place to work so if you like working retail then it is fine. They don't pay great, and it can be difficult to move up in the company even though the company advertises something different on their website pertaining to advancement."
good,"The experience I gained from this job gives me more appreciation for those who work in retail. I learned how to be understanding and to sell products. The management at the time was okay, there was no opportunity for growth and no recognition for my work efforts. My co-workers were fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was to continue being able to sell products as well as meeting quota. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to socialize with clients/customers."
good,"I work as a photo clerk. Unfortunately that doesn't mean I get to just stay in the photo department. As a full time employee, you go where they need you and right now since a lot of people quit within the last 6 months, that means I'm stuck on the main register. I don't really care for it since I just got a state medical license and would like to leave. If retail is your thing and you want to make it a career, Walgreens can be good to you. At first, it is nice. But after 3 years it gets tiresome. You learn which customers are trouble and which are nice, that being open 365 days a year really sucks (especially during Christmas time), and if you have a manager like mine, you learn to appreciate what hours you are given because they can just as easily be taken away. I have to request time off usually 3-4 weeks in advance but since Christmas is coming, the requests are blocked and you have to go straight to the manager and hope and pray that you get it approved and that your manager remembers that you requested it when they make the schedule. Also, don't be surprised to get stuck doing jobs not in the job description, like cleaning a public restroom where customer either have no hygienic manners or enjoy shooting up in. Catching shoplifters is not my favorite thing to do either because it is extremely difficult but it can be rewarding at times. I enjoyed my job before it ate away at my soul slowly but surely. I never thought I'd be there for 3 years. It is nice to have something that works well with a college student's schedule changes. I also enjoy maintaining the photo machines"
good,"Excellent customer service is the main goal of this company, which is great since you will build a good relationship with the customers or patiens"
good,"ok place to work, nice environment , almost good ppl to associate with."
good,overall a good job but too many scheduling issues i learned all aspects of the pharmacy enviornment and work that entailed it i enjoyed the people i worked with and i really enjoyed the customer relationships.
good,"I am always the bearer of bad news. Everytime we have to tell a patient ""no"" they send them my way."
good,"Working for Walgreens, can be demanding at times but you gain good customer service and experience working with a diverse group of people."
good,Walgreens is a good company and it has a lot of potential but there are far to many upper management people outside of the core store management. The wages are not anything that would encourage someone to stay with the company for an extended period of time. With the budget cuts that Walgreens made there are fewer hours to have people scheduled to work which makes the workplace stressful and less enjoyable for the employees as well as the customers.
good,"in charge of stock, also worked cash register management was not too friendly had to make the best of it. Quit because school got in the way"
good,"A typical day consist of taking care of customers and maintaining inventory to meet their needs. Working here I really learned the meaning of multitasking as each day was truly a different day. There were many times when I would be expected to assist in the pharmacy while still being expected to make sure the daily tasks were being completed by myself as well as other staff. As a member of management, there was generally a list composed after the store manager walked the store with the assistant store manager that identified problem areas (missing signage displaying pricing, old fixtures needing replacing, weak displays that needed attention and so forth. The hardest part of the job was keeping employees motivated to reach their maximum potential and produce quality results while the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing customers and patients leave with smiles on their face and saying ""thank you"" and I am thinking no ""thank you""!"
good,I spent such a short time there.  I wish that I would have had more time to increase my knowledge and experience.  A typical day was filling prescriptions.
good,This is a fast paced environment with many checks and balances. Short breaks. Good co-workers.
good,got to work maintenance and assist with cutting the grass and cleaning up the grounds
good,Greeting Customers Welcoming them to Walgreens doing the EEC.

good,"The days are usually long, and if you are stuck at the front counter, you are not allowed to leave the counter for any reason. The best part of the store is the photo department because there's always something to do. The management is difficult because they have a very unapproachable aura to them. This is an okay place to start, but I'm looking for something more substantial."
good,"This company paid well when I was here; however, we worked so many hours that you could rarely enjoy the  money you made.  The holidays were the worst!!"
good,"The most enjoyable part of Walgreens is working around the public, I've learned a lot working at Walgreens the past 10 years from balancing customer service skills with my other chores to reconstructingthe store. If I felt that there was more room for advancement it would probally be the perfect job for me. Most times I feel that my manager have a lot of faith in me and like my work effort. I have devloped strong relationshipss with my other co workers."
good,ok to start room for growth fast pace standing on feet long hours
good,Provide customer service for employees and customers to meet quota for the day.
good,"recommend products to suit customers skin type, and face shape."
good,"Working management in Walgreens is very demanding.  Your work/life balance will be in the gutter.  As an ASM, you are technically scheduled 44 hours a week, but many end up working 50-60 hours a week.  Very physical demanding job.  Lots of new initiatives from corporate that will have you going to meetings, creating projects, and working alongside store manager and pharmacy manager.  Pay does not match the amount of workload and hours you put in."
good,Walgreens is not the company it once was. The whole company is changing more for numbers then for employees who work there.
good,"- A day at work was quite long and slow"
good,"This job has helped me develop and fine tune my customer service skills. I am proficient in managing the front end of the store, as well as operating the photo lab equipment."
good,Walgreens is the kind of job that u don't have to worry about losing. the only way you lose this job is if you don't do your job. However I don't think that they really care about their employees anymore Walgreens used to be a family company ITS NOT ANYMORE!!
good,"My coworkers and management are great to work with. We all get along well and work as a team the best we can. I have established good relationships with staff and customers. The only issue with that job is the pay. Being in the Keys with the cost of living, $10.00 an hour is not sufficient for anyone to live off, especially getting paid biweekly."
good,"great environment "
good,fun and happy place to work. Dealing with customer was the best part. The team building was very good and safety consciousness was good
good,"I work in a busy store with customers who need assistance finding items and they have questions on items that may be for their health or not. We do a great job at offering the customers quick service and answers to any problems. The work crew is great and they become good friends with your time there. Ive learned a great deal about products and information that i can take with me not just in a working environment but in life. I've learned about health products on a large scale so i can assist or give an opinion on various medical supplies. Ive learned how to deal with upset customers and how to calm people down and figure out things at the moment so everyone is happy. I've learned marketing tactics, hot to promote items, and the push to want more from a company and myself. I enjoy helping people find solutions everyday."
good,I believe Walgreens in general is a geat place to work...Each store has a personality...Find the one thats right for you...And you will love it
good,"I loved working at walgreens, setting up product displays, interaction with customers. Customers would come in and ask for me to help them, they knew I would find what they needed even if it was not the product they came in for.  I was not management but mean customers thought I was and would tell me I should be. The hardest part of the job was making a living . I am single and making $8.67 per hour and only working 32-36 hours a week, I could barely make it. Then the cut hours on everyone, I explained I could not live on less hours. Two of my friends even donated some of there hours to me occasionally. It is a hard world and I am a hard worker, but we all need to make a living."
good,"Typical day at work would be stocking, inventory, greeting customers, up selling, cleaning. I learned at the last walgreens I worked for that not all hard work is recognized. Other then the last walgreens I worked for the management made working there fun and competitive. Most of my co-workers were nice but there is a lot of drama and ""clicks"" in the company."
good,The hardest part of the job is the erratic schedule and involves a lot of time away from family.
good,"My first job was with Walgreens, it has been the company I've grown up with. The co-workers have come and gone and I've made some great friends along the way but the company itself hasn't changed much. It can be the most rewarding job in the world or it can be the most soul-defeating, it all depends on how the customers feel like treating you that day."
good,"No matter where you work or what position you're in, if you're in retail you will NEVER get any respect from customers. As an hourly manager, I feel respected by both the salaried managers and clerks in my store. The pharmacy employees, especially the pharmacists, have no respect for anyone in the front store. They treat us like we're beneath them."
good,"Despite the salary; it was a nice to work. The managers were always helpful, cheerful and outgoing. I was always active, it is a fast pace job and that's one of the things I liked about walgreens."
good,Walgreens is a busy work place where there is a lot of multi-tasking involved. Face to Face customer service is a must.
good,"If i worked in the am shift:  place money in all registers, wipe off assigned areas, waiting on customers, I have learned that customers like to be acknowledge and make then feel welcome,  I learned that some co-workers considered they were your boss, because of yrs served and they did not have the title. Hardest part of my job was keeping the front end neat and clean,  It was a constant duty and there were times when it was hard to do this and meet the customers needs.  Customer is supposed to be number one. I enjoyed this part."
good,"I love helping people, and what I love about my job at Walgreens as a Photo Tech is that I get to genuinely help people every day. I give tremendous customer service, and patrons return to my store because they know I am there to help them with a warm smile and an upbeat, can-do attitude. It feels good to hear that people value me and the assistance I provide to them."
good,"Good atmosphere, good people, well trained individuals, out going staff"
good,"-cash register"
good,I have been working here for a long time & i just want to work in my career.
good,A lot of customer interaction. Learned new skill in processing film. I work with a great crew that pulls together as a team.
good,"•	Supervised 3 member team in beauty department"
good,"I'm not sure how it is now but in the first few years, they changed the rules several times. If they ever settle on the rules than it will be a great place to work."
good,"Productive and fun place to work"
good,went from 50 hours per pay period to 8 hours per pay period because flu season ended
good,"A typical day at walgreens can be handful. My last position is SFL [Shift Leader] which is to open and close the store, cash handling, delicate out task[s] to employees, etc. which that leads to what I have learned to operate the store with other managers and treat customer the way how you wanted to be treated when you go to any retail stores. Co-workers are very good and always seems to be on top of things and get task done on time. Employees always help others if they're done with their task and if there isn't any. "
good,"Co-workers are friendly, helpful, and easy to get along with. They are pretty much like family. Its a very busy place, so there is always something to do. I learn something new everyday. What makes the job difficult is having faulty equipment, and not having the best ordering system. This results in unhappy customers in the end. Overall, it is a satisfactory job."
good,This store is very customer friendly! I learnt mostly about how to multitask between tasks I had to get done and customer service.
good,"Pharmacy is always changing every patient has different needs, so one must learn to adjust quickly and find the right tools to help everyone get their prescriptions in a timely manner. Management at times could make things interesting however, for the most part is easy going.  The employees in a pharmacy must work as a team, otherwise, it can be a lot confusion and unhappy customers. Hardest part of the job is when a medication is needed by someone and their insurance does not cover it, and many times that medication is rather expensive and patients are unable to pay for it. The most enjoyable part is seeing patients walk out with smile on their faces, knowing we have help them."
good,"Great work environment, friendly staff, and hardest part is rude customers"
good,"for the love of kids"
good,"I learned to work the Photo lab"
good,I learned how to multitask under pressure and in a fast pace environment.
good,Customer service.  the most enjoyable part of the job is learning new things
good,Terrible treatment of employees. Showed me a lot about how to deal with irate managers.
good,A good a Experience and it was a Very diverse place to work at very easy job to work the Register
good,The work week always fluctuated and my work ranged from unloading trucks to cashiering to stocking and my days were very long
good,"Daily I do medical billing and collections for Medicare and all replacement policies."
good,"payroll, manage employees, invoices , employees schedules,"
good,"operated cash machine, receive  and distributed money and restocked shelves as needed"
good,Fun place to work with friendly employes.the hardest part was unloading the trucks.
good,"data entry, customer service, high confidentiality, multi tasking a must"
good,Fast paced working environment. Constantly trying to push immunizations on patients. It's a great learning environment.
good,it was a good position had a blast love to work on cars and talk to the customers
good,great place to manage multiple people across multiple areas of business
good,I learned a lot about customer service while being here and the managers were extremely helpful
good,"The company has great flexibility, but it currently lacks in career advancement opportunities."
good,walgreens was a normal job. you get to interact with different people and get to know yourself a little better as well
good,"I was an integral part of my patients receiving their correct medicine."
good,"Worked with a consistently lean budget despite higher than average growth quarter after quarter. Would manage customers, phone calls, fill and deliver prescriptions. Multitasking and organizational abilities were a must. Developed meaningful relationships with patients over the years."
good,"I had been with Walgreen's for 7 years and during my time there I had worn many hats. I started out as a front end cashier, worked in the cosmetics department before settling into the photo department where I really found my niche. Customer service was the biggest priority where I excelled at helping customers find what they were looking for either in the store or online. I performed cash handling, stocking the shelves and in the warehouse, I ordered for my department (snacks, groceries and drinks), I would train new employees on how to use the photo lab equipment, I would also instruct others on how to work the new machines that would arrive from time to time. As the Head Photo Tech, it was my job to maintain the machines once a month, make sure the chemicals were drained and replaced, fix any problems that occurred in the printer and general cleaning of the lab. I feel that during my time with Walgreen's I became a more confident woman who knew what I wanted and that I was able to go out and work for it. The last year I worked for Walgreen's, I was going to school. I worked there full-time and attending class part-time. I felt that if I was able to work that hard at two jobs, then there was nothing stopping me from moving forward into a bright new career."
good,Management lacked in job scope. Employee attitude was also aggressive when asked to do duties at work.
good,"A typical day involves many pharmacy related tasks. To name a few, I administer vaccines, monitor patient blood pressure, monitor adherence, conduct data and drug utilization review on all prescriptions, tightly monitor inventory, train new employees, work cash registers, and conduct comprehensive medication reviews. I enjoy learning new skills and new facts on a daily basis. The support staff is limited, therefore, I excel at prioritizing and multitasking in order to provide excellent customer service."
good,Management and staff could be better. But overall an ok place to work for.
good,"Fun place to work, not for a career. I learned how to function in a professional manner."
good,"Went to work, did what was required of me, went home."
good,"You can learn a lot of aspects of community pharmacy at wag like immunization, MTM, customer services"
good,"restocking new merchandise"
good,Working at Walgreens is a great experience. My co workers are great.
good,"The company is going through an overhaul in which a lot of the processes are changing. In the midst of the changes, the employees are not being valued as much as they could be in certain departments."
good,I worked as pharmacy technician in college and part time as a young adult.  I worked with great pharmacists and it was a very educational experience.
good,"I worked in the pharmacy for my externship. I liked doing this job, but unfortunately, it was temporary."
good,Photo Specialty is a fun job. It seemed important at the time because everybody didn't own digital camera's. I loved learning about the chemicals and the paper and how to use the machines to get rid of red eye and so on.
good,Walgreens Was a great company to work for when I started 6 years ago it had great benefits
good,"A typical day at Walgreens was customer service.  That means helping customers out with questions that they may have, cashiering to get the customer checked out and making them fill satisfied."
good,"great place to work. treated fairly, good compensation, helpful upper management"
good,A decent place to work but constant slahing of hours not good for making a living.
good,The co-workers make this a fun place. Shifts are 8 hours in length. Management is usually helpful.
good,I was only there for a month not really a lot I can say about this job
good,Walgreens is a good company I was placed at this store for my schooling. I was only here for a few months
good,"processes 700-900 prescriptions per day, not given enough hours"
good,I wish the leadership in the store was more professional. Besides that it was always positive relationships with other employees and it was good to connect with the regular customers
good,"walgreens was my first job as a pharmacy technician,and it was ok. it was not what I expected at that time , but it prepared me for all of my jobs."
good,Pharmacy and store manager are great! They continuously help to provide a positive work environment despite hours being cut. I love working here but I need a reliable schedule and source of income for myself.
good,enjoyed everyday. loved helping the elderly and being needed. love working with women with dementia
good,This is your typical retail store with those who know there job might be surpassed for promotion by those who are robots for the store manager.
good,Wasnt the greatest job. got hired to be a pharmacy tech. Was working as a customer service associate the whole time. Got to work in the pharmacy but got paid minimum wage even though I am a certified pharmacy tech.
good,"too many things to do with a few people"
good,"I basically just stocked shelves and worked the registers. I learned a lot about working in a company from this job, because it was my first retail job. The management was alright, but not very flexible or nice (which I'm sure is normal). Several of the co-workers were rude and wouldn't even help me with the simplest of things. I asked someone where something was on my second day and got snapped at. It didn't seem like a very team oriented environment. The hardest part of the job was probably dealing with the customers, but it wasn't too bad. I'm pretty good with people so the job wasn't very difficult. The most enjoyable part was being able to organize stuff. I love doing stuff like that, and also seeing people happy after you helped them."
good,"working at Walgreen was quite and experience. all work days were very busy and it was a must that you stayed on task at all times. our patients were from multiple age groups from toddlers to seniors so it was nothing that surprised us most of the time. My pharmacy manager was very strict, however, she does a great job in preparing her workers to work anywhere and always being able to perform at the best of our abilities. we were trained to go above and beyond the call of duty to make sure that our job was done proficiently and expeditiously. the hardest part of this job i would say was keeping your composure under the most intense circumstances i.e extremely angry and sick patients. the most enjoyable part was being able to establish relationships with our every day patients and knowing that you have satisfied their needs."
good,"My day start with opening the store, get registers out for customers/cashier.  I then count the safe and balance the cash report.  My day then is basic task like answering calls from staff, checking in vendors from receiving door, assist pharmacy if needed, and maintain inventory."
good,"On a typical day at Walgreens I would run the photo department along with assisting customers with anything they needed. Some of my other duties included stocking shelves, checking and editing periodic counts (inventory), unloading trucks from different vendors, creating displays and doing resets/revisions. I learned how to develop photos while working with chemicals and various types of computers. Overall the management was fair to work with, considering that management changed after working there only a year. While the store is currently in much better condition than it was with previous management, our current store leader is very tough about scheduling, hours and availability. My co-workers are great to work with, everyone does there part are very helpful to one another and the customers. The hardest part of my job would be the heavy lifting on truck days. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with."
good,A typical day would include sitting at your cubicle along with a few hundred others and do data entry for eights hours straight. You were not aloud to speak to co workers and they made it feel uncomfortable to approach your supervisor if there was a question or concern.
good,I enjoyed working there a lot but the business didn't stay open for too long.
good,"Customer Service/Photo Specialist/Cashier"
good,"Everyday is a busy day, but I've learned how to mult-task better. I answer phones and check out people at the same time, and I also do sells.The Management is ok but everything is not fair in the work place. Some co-workers get treated better then others but overall I do like the workers. The hardest part of my job is getting help with the long lines, sometimes I have to call for help two or three times before somebody comes. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping the customers find whatever it is that they need and to get them in and out with a smile."
good,you weren't giving enough hours. the shift didnt allow you to have no free time or tie to do anything
good,I took orders for printing film into prints of various sizes. There was the up keep of the machinery and chemicals that were used for printing. I had to be time oriented.
good,Walk in answer the phone greet the customer and go. The pharmacists are always ready to answer questions and II was always ready to provide extraordinary customer service.
good,typical retail work. different duties on a day to day basis. most employees are dedicated and easy to get along with
good,"I have learned alot of things from all the years i have worked there."
good,there aren't many opportunities while working at walgreens. working there is good for someone who wants freedom
good,"I had a good location so my experience was very good. I enjoyed the help and the people I worked with. However, some other locations do not get as much help and can be overburdened with the workload Walgreen's expects the pharmacist and technician(s) to handle."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is my coworkers. They helped me through the chaotic and stress of the day.
good,A typical day at work is rather rewarding. I really liked my job but when you constantly feel a threat of you job is going away in a 2 years span of  time.  I gave this company  100% every day...My co workers are hardest working people in the company and i'm going to miss them.
good,"You have a quota to meet daily and weekly. You get written up if you don't meet your goals and eventually fired if your overall review is bad. The pay is good but you're only maxed out after 2 years and the only way for advancement is if you apply for a lead or other positions which could be based on salary, so as far as advancement there are not a lot of options. There are no lunch breaks but you are granted 2 20 minute breaks daily. Benefits are good and the long labor hours are tiring."
good,"I have learned everything I know from being with Walgreens for over 3 years. "
good,"It's hard to plan your life around the mash up that is retail scheduling so you have to find a rhythm with your sleep and your appointments.  Walgreens is no worse and no better than any other corporate entity in that regard."
good,Great place to work I work there for 12 yrs. The best part of the job working with my co-worker an I love the customer.
good,"Very fast paced atmosphere, with daily learning on the fly. Many last minute changes that required shifting focus to different areas of the building. Learned to take responsibility of my areas, managing several areas at one time, budgeting. Co-worker's were awesome and great to work with. Most difficult part of the job was lack of communication and "" stretching the truth "" regarding company vision."
good,"Definitely a neighborhood store....Most of the customers are regulars....Everyone's know Everyone, family environment.... it's the Perfect Part-time job! Great for students.....nice benefit program!  Nothing hard about this job, not even tough customers! Great environment!"
good,"A typical workday at Walgreens is punching in operating the cash machine providing quality customer service. What I learned from being an employee at Walgreens is have to learn have be patient and remain calm dealing with the public which can be challenge sometimes. Working with management and my co-workers were good at times. I believe the hardest part of my job is as mention sometimes dealing with difficult customer, but I learn to be calm and relax because I do not be the person who trying to provide good customer service to them fault. The most enjoyable part of the job was they were really flexible with schedule during the time was going to school."
good,"If you want to come in make quick buck while, then work here.."
good,Helping people with photo development and helping customers with problems and other random stuff to acheive
good,"Work with friendly coworkers, who are goal oriented and make work fun. A typical day at work for me would be answering IC-3's (code for need more cashiers on front end), printing online photo orders through dry lab, maintaining inventory of assigned bay, ordering, and providing customers with a great experience shopping at Walgreen's."
good,"This Pharmacy is severely under staffed. Where as the employees are pleasant and the patients have patience, it was an overall good company."
good,"A typical day consisted of greeting customers with a smile, having them enjoy their shopping experience and assisting them with anything that they may need."
good,I liked working with makeup. the salary wasnt anything to brag about and it was too slow paced for me.
good,"A typical day includes restocking equipment, varifying patients insurance and information. Dispensing medication."
good,"On a typical work day, I would meet over 75+ customers. I learned that working in retail requires outstanding customer service skills as well as strong communication skills. The hardest part of the day would be working during rush hours; when customers were just getting off work. The most enjoyable part of any day would be a few hours before closing; when the atmosphere became a lot more calmer."
good,"Greeting and taking care of patients. Entering there information in the computer correctly ,enter insurance,allergies and health information into computer. Pulling, filling the correct medication into bottles and vials  Marking and returning the drugs to the corre ct location. Processing receiving orders,put the inventory away and post the account . I love my co-workers they are like my family. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping the customers. I have learned that we are all diffident individuals and need to be treated with respect.  I have seen several managers  come and go some where  great and enjoyable to work with  and you felt respected as person and a team member.  The hardest part of my job  is not being able to spend more time with my family."
good,A place that could offer advancement with the right leadership.
good,"Worked at Walgreens for seven years as a photo specialist. Was nice to have a good work environment and I personally had great coworkers, but it'll depend on who you work with and how you act. No overtime sucked, cutbacks and hours lost on a regular basis to save money. It was a job, but had some perks."
good,On a tipical work day i would go in for my shift and manage the front register and because we are always short on hours i would also maintain the photo station as well as help customers with there photos. i learned how to maintain the photo center and how to operate the machines through trial and error. Every one of my coworkers as well as management were wonderful and willing to help me learn as well as grow as an indivitual. I did have some trouble at times eather dealing with upset customers or dealing with machines that broke down but my coworkers always were there to help me and make my work day an enjoyable one.
good,"Easy job if you like the call center life, can be very rewarding."
good,"Typical day starts aroud 11 am. Package orders for delivery to patients. Deliverys could be 1 mile to 150 miles away. "
good,Wide range of job opportunities.. good sales experience and great co-workers
good,"Typical day: Directed and supervised numerous employees engaged in sales,"
good,"I worked for Walgreens for approximately two years as a Pharmacy technician. I enjoyed my experiences there, the coworkers including the store and pharmacy managers were great to work with."
good,"Working here is very fun and energetic, very quick pace. I love working where I feel as though I can grow as an indivdual"
good,I enjoyed get to work with a lot of great customers.  Most of the people I worked with were great people as well. The hardest part was a lot of walking back and forth in a small space and long hours with limited or no breaks with time to sit for a few minutes to catch your breath.
good,"A typical store-level job dealing in customer services, stocking duties, film and digital picture production, and cashiering."
good,"Great people"
good,I really have to comment about this job other than it was a great place to work
good,it is a good place to work if you are looking for a retail job. theres usually a list of things that need to be completed in your shift and you are told to do so. if they don't get finished it is okay they next person to come in will finish.
good,great place to work if your in collage not to support a family
good,"A typical day at work included me printing out customers pictures in the photo department. Stocking the shelves.  Checking customers out on the register, or just simply showing a customer where they can find a item they were looking for"
good,"Great place to work if you're an associate. Management is filled with extremely long hours (especially in holiday months), no work/life balance, and I never had a lunch break in 5 years. New management structure is putting more stress on upper management and doesn't pay sufficient wages for lower management."
good,"I am lucky to have landed a job here. Most people there are either related or very good friends, which how they got their jobs. Too much favoritism, but on the bright side they do promote from within."
good,"managers push and push but they don't know what's all  involved in the job that they're telling you  to do."
good,"It's not that bad to work at Walgreens. I mean don't expect to get rich off it but the people who you work it generally make it fun. As far as pay increasing goes, you'd have to be there for a number of years. It does depend on who you work with if you are going to have a nice work life but at my store we all try to make it a fun experience and look out for each other."
good,i loved styling people but its a good temp job. not for long term
good,Moral is at an all time low. Constant cutbacks with hours is eventually going to catch up with the company not only at a warehousing level but at the stores. Customer service is seriously going down hill which is a shame because Walgreens has always been a great company to work for.
good,I learnt how to develop film in the photo lab was being trained to work in the pharmacy the only bad thing about the job was there was too much drama caused by the management and they would expect me to do the job of 3-4 people
good,"Meet and greet all customers.  Data enter patient profile without proper verification.  Type, fill and sell prescription.  Call customers, doctors, and insurance.  Receive, stock and return drug inventory"
good,"On a daily basis, I helped customers find what they needed and checked them out. I also stocked merchandise and set up displays, helped with inventory, operated photo machines, and counted drawers during closing shifts. I also assisted the pharmacy from time to time. My co-workers and the management made the job enjoyable the created a pleasant work environment. The hardest part of the job was handling difficult customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was providing excellent customer service to people."
good,I had fun working here. Very nice and quiet I liked working by myself.
good,I've learned to be patient with the customer alot of times they come in the store upset and want you to take care of their needs right away even if you are already working with someone.
good,"•	Gaining experience as a pharmacy intern while completing the Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience and preparing for the NAPLEX examination"
good,"I was a customer care specialist,   I assisted customers in many ways,  including showing them where the products are and carrying the products to the car for them.  I learned how about profits,  suggestive sales, and extraordinary customer care while at Walgreens.  I really enjoyed working at Walgreens and interacting with the customers and just helping people in general."
good,"A typical work day at Walgreens is transcribing doctor/prescription orders, operating the cash register, giving good quality customer service, correcting insurance claims. I learn so many things working from working a Walgreens such good customer service skills, data entry, correcting insurance problems and job dedications. I realize being at Walgreens that the customers was the first priority. During my 22 years of service at Walgreens, I built relationships with the people I work with. What I enjoy most about my job at Walgreens is meeting new people and ensuring the customer received good quality service, however being short staff made my job sometimes difficult, but I was able and determined to make it through by remaining positive."
good,"You basically are given the skills to succeed, the management leaves you alone as long as you are producing the numbers and stats they want."
good,good place to work. needs more space for employees so each can have their own desk as opposed to sharing.
good,Philly Temp is a Temp Agency and they only call me when they needed me. The people i used to work with were friendly and with very positive attitude . The hardest part of the job is it was a on call job.
good,I enjoyed the friends and management I met at Walgreens through the years. A very busy workplace that never had two days that were alike.
good,"There is no typical day at Walgreens, one day your on the floor, next register, next juice bar, next café, next greeting. We do it all. I love my customers, and they definitely teach you how to manage your time, great job for people starting off. You do every thing and should likely be paid more but you won't get a raise no matter how good you do."
good,"Always working ahead of schedule on patients to meet there needs. I have learned all points that come with as being a Pharmacy Technician. My co-workers are very hard working and are team players. I think the hardest part is obtaing the right information from nursing agency example lab work, medication profiles etc. The best part of the job knowing the patient is statisfied."
good,"Un-secure Managers don't know to treat employees, at some store employees label rigths are abuse."
good,"Great working atmosphere"
good,Flexible hours...not much to say about it!! It's best for a student...not for an actual career unless you work in the pharmacy or as salaried management.
good,difficult hours. Sometimes worked grave  yard shift. Great manager very kind.
good,"A Typical day at work is being on the register greeting customers as they walk in the door, and offering assitance. Also answering the phone if you work at main. Another aspect is working photo lab which can be hectic at times but mostly enjoyable to do. I learned how to manage my time and work to out do what ive done before. Managment has the people who care about their employees and then the ones who make helping seem bothersom. My coworkers are all great and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is the moment when you loose your paticents so you step away to regain your composure and keep your cool. The most enjoyable is genuinanly helping customers and co workers who need your assitance makes you feel good and like an valued asset to the team."
good,"The company is a good company to work for, but very hard to move up in."
good,"- A typical day at work for me is to come and and accomplish my task to the best of my ability. "
good,I liked working at Walgreens for the most part. It was a decent job
good,I had the chance to work in different departments even had the chance to experience what it feels like to work overnight.  The hardest part was making sure that you were not being scammed you had to be very detailed behind the register and on the floor.  The most enjoyable part was being able to interact with different customers and being able to have them leave your store very satisfied.
good,Walgreens was very rewarding. If you got your tasks done correctly the managers would always make it know.
good,"Good place to work with decent pay.  Nothing to difficult and they are very flexible with work schedules. It mostly depends on who you work with, i have had some great management and some terrible ones."
good,Deliver quality patient care and excellent customer service.  Assisting pharmacists in filling prescriptions.  Quality customer service.  Stocking medication and answering phone calls.  I learn the basics of retail and serving the patients with proper medication.  Management and co-workers were reasonable and well respected.  The hardest part of the job was take control of filling in orders of prescriptions and to use the cash register when I was the only pharmacy technician came in that one day.  The most enjoyable was that I had good reviews of my performance as pharmacy technician intern.
good,"Not being able to help the customer's the way that I want. I love working in a team enviornment. I'm fast,motivated, smart and self motivated. I can multi-task and I only had to be told once about anything."
good,"Work usually includes a variety of tasks. Some daily tasks include handling prescriptions, doing inventory services, returns and assisting customers. I learned how to order medications, compounds and input prescription insurance into the system. I learned about different insurances and what they cover. Recently, there has been a high turn over rate so the downfall included co-workers who were inexperienced. It is a high stress job that led me to enjoy it even more.It gets so busy sometimes that it hard to take breaks."
good,the hardest part of the job is dealing with rude costumers. the management is not all the same every store has their own manager and they all work different.
good,"Everyday I would come in, gather all the returned items and restock them. Afterwards I would do whatever needed to get done, such as stocking, ad tags, ring out customers whenever the cashier need help, and helped customers locate items. Then I would cover breaks, and go on mine. In addition I took out the trash, vacuumed, and helped the manager count money if they needed me to. The last few hours of my shift I would make my aisles looks nice and tidy them up then I went home."
good,"Sams club was a good company , they just don't tell associates all the details on LOA, and FMLA"
good,Its a good place to go for a first job. There is not much to do so it is very easy. Co-workers are nice to work with.
good,"My typical day at work is making sure product is out on the shelves and ordering them if out of stock. Customer service is the number one priority. Cash handling is another important part of the job. I learned a lot working for Walgreen's. I learned how to solve customers concerns, cash handling, customer service, how to work the photo lab, some pharmacy cashiering, and cosmetics. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know my co-workers and customers."
good,"if you are 16 and looking for a good start, walgreens is great for you."
good,"Assist customers, stock and face shelves and displays, and maintain clean and orderly conditions. Co-workers were friendly and nice. No hardest part of the job. I enjoyed everything in the workplace."
good,Worked as a Pharmacy Tech. Worked there for 9 years and am looking to get a job in my current field. Electrical Engineering is where I would like to work in.
good,Walgreens isn't a bad place to work but I would like to be at a company where I can advance.
good,was a great  experience for me to learn new things and different jobs withing the work pace
good,hours are ridiculous(no work/life balance). Not a place for someone looking for a career since the turnover is huge and they make a point to emphasize the fact that we are all just numbers and all replaceable.
good,"Walgreens is an ok company.  It is a good job for college students and move on,"
good,Just like any retail job the goal was a happy customer was a repeat customer.
good,"if you want to progress in life go somewhere else."
good,"My job typically consists of being the front of the store which is being the cashier and welcoming customers. My job also requires me to organize the store, assist customers to the best of my ability, help with price changes and putting in new products into aisles. I also help assist in the cosmetics department."
good,The management shows a lot of favoritism towards some employees
good,"This company is decent. All stores are different, all mgt is different."
good,"A typical day at Walgreens included working drive thru, in putting data, fullfilling orders and answering phones. I learned how to be a great technician at Walgreens. Management was always willing to work with scheduling needs and accomadating. Co-workers were friendly. Hardest part of the job is getting yelled at by customers for issues that are beyond your control. Best part is the smile that comes from a patients face when you've made a postive difference in their day."
good,"As a manager I am in direct contact with 3-4 floor employees, a pharmacist and 1-3 pharmacy techs. I help motivate employees to get stock to sales floor, help with customer service, and provide a healthy and safe work environment."
good,"its not too bad,good beginner job the pay is ok, corporate doesnt care about there employers"
good,"high call volume, fast paced workplace, productive work atmosphere."
good,maintain production and preventive maintenance and I work with some great co-workers
good,"Great store manager, and co-workers. I really enjoyed working at Walgreen's."
good,"Under new requirements, greetings must be scripted.  While benefits are available all are very strongly encouraged not to utilize them.  "
good,"Walgreens- Columbus, Ohio                        08/2012 – 10/2013"
good,"I work at the liquor store at the register, stoking the store"
good,Hardest part is dealing with difficult customers with zero back up support.
good,"Greet customers as they walk in, assist customers when needed, apply code of conduct on daily basis, acknowledge the open door policy, learn to adapt to open ideas coming from co-workers, stay actively involved in company news, work hard towards your daily suggestive goals and being respectable to co-workers and customers."
good,"KMart was a decent company to work for. Kmart worked around my full time job. My shift would include but would not be limited to overseeing and supervising co-workers, assisting customers and co-workers with any questions or concerns, assisting the manager on closing the store, interact in the exchange of money, cash registers, and returns/refunds, answering and assisting phone calls in a courteous and professional manner, returning unwanted stock, maintaining a safe, clean and orderly retail Center and retrieve carts."
good,"flexible schedules"
good,"I learn how to find a right medicine ,count it and dispensing the medicine and send it to the pharmacists for final check."
good,A good place to learn about handling with customers and people
good,Walgreens is a good place for teenagers to start work. They will be taught responsibilty.
good,Customer service in the alcohol dept. learned how to operate different types of pos units.
good,Call center environment. Good place to work for entry level and mid level career.  They notice your hard work and promote from with in.
good,"Worked on my ex ternship there.  Did not learn as much as i wanted, was difficult because the rules always changed."
good,you work hard and take lip from customers. If you like to stay active this is the place to be.
good,"There is no typical day at work when you are in retail. Although there are day to day operations, things that must be done, working with the public brings many different situations on a daily basis. As the store manager I touched base with everyone working in my store, most of the time working side by side to accomplish our store goals. The best part about my job was my employees, they were a family and we enjoyed working together. The hardest part was having constant corporate instructions that were counter-productive to the actual running of the buisness."
good,Constant change and department growth. Never a dull moment-
good,"You work long days with only 1 break, their is no potential for growth, plus the pay is poor."
good,you learn a lot about team work and building customers trust in your community a great plus.
good,the people I helped was worth it. I did like working as a Pharm Techn but the Seniors Techn were mean and always rude. I worked there for 3 years and learned a lot.
good,"Been with the company for almost a year. It has it's downside but I always try to look at the better side of everything. My co-workers are fun to work with, no troubles with anyone. The pay could be a bit better for the work we put in daily but it is what it is."
good,"A typical day at work, given if it is not busy at the LOOK Boutique, I'd usually do anything around Walgreens such as help stock or treat customers. If there was more traffic at the boutique, I'd normally help the customers by finding products and giving information about them. This also included analyzing their skin, talking about their skin concerns and recommending products, and applying makeup to demonstrate certain products or for a special event makeover. I've learned to be more confident in my make-up applying skills, and picked up a tip or two. "
good,"Inputting data into a computer system to assist customers with their medication orders. My goal is to provide excellent customer service which I have done, and I feel the management are a team of very detail oriented and dedicated personnel. I have learned a lot about medications, brushed up on my mathematics, and even learned a few aspects of computer systems I wasn't familiar with before this job. "
good,"Great peer to peer relationships.  Of course, it's a corporation which is equivalent to a dictatorship.  No bureaucracy here!  If you take orders well and can duck in time to avoid flying clipboards, then you'll do just fine"
good,Walgreens is a ok company over all. It just not a place for someone that want to advance and move up the ranks base on merit and hard work. The work/life balance is horrible. The company has went thru drastic changes and is not the company it once was. It is just a ok place to work.
good,loved working there good employers' learn a lot cashier customer service develop photos
good,What more can you say? If you put in the work the rewards are far greater.
good,"Listening to music entering patient confidential information. Either registering and updating patient files, and making patient calls for payment information. Management is pretty laid back and so are the co workers."
good,"Busy, wide variety of jobs, great coworkers, good managers"
good,"monotonous, everything based on sales, not very fun, pay not great, lots of work, not enough time"
good,There really is no such thing as a typical day because every day varied day by day. I've learned not only to be patient with irritated customers but also how to make them leave the store Happier then when they came in. Management could have some improvement as to distributing the work flow evenly. Co-workers are to reliant upon the management staff and get away with to much nonsense . Hardest part would be an unease feeling of doing most of the workload . Most enjoyable part would be meeting new people and how to meet to such a wide differences in personality. Also it is rewarding when jam able to not only make and upset customer happy but also make them a repeat customer to my store and ask for me by name .
good,Working with my co workers is great. The management is very organized and the work is always completed. Great environment and great people.
good,Great company to work for with great opportunities for growth.
good,While working at Walgreens I increased my ability to multi-task
good,"Typical day - Manage All Quality Aspects"
good,I like helping and assisting customers as well as working on a team to complete an efficient work place.
good,I had a lot of fun i worked with great people everyone was great i moved on from walgreens because i moved to staten island.
good,"I had been with walgreens for almost 10 years and had the pleasure of working in both a slower volume store and very high paced stores. Slower stores gave me the opportunity to really know my patients by name, know the medications they were taking and be able to make doctor calls at any given time. At the higher volume stores, your day flies by and there is always work to be done. I didnt really get to make the same patient connection as I did at a slower paced store. The only downfall to this corporation is that hour budgets for pharmacy technician hours are set as an ""estimate""  done months in advance and we (as a pharmacy staff) never felt like the budget was correct thus causing understaffing when we were busy and having too many staff when we were not so busy."
good,It has been many years since I have been with Walgreens but from what I can remember everyone was very nice and willing to help each other out.
good,"fill prescription"
good,I loved this job. Great place to work however Walgreens decided to close this facility and direct the business to the other two locations that had.
good,Walgreens is changing the store management set up in stores. Compensation has been reduced and benefits/paid time off are not as good as in years past.
good,"A typical day in the life of a Walgreens employee is that everyday of the week is repeated weekly.  You come in and already know what needs to be done.  Whether it is stocking the floor, helping consumers find basic needs, or organizing aisles based on seasonal changes or by limited income items.  I have learned for the most part the importance of customer satisfaction.  When I go somewhere to shop, I know I want to be treated as how I would treat my customers.  The hardest part of the job is standing in one place at the register for hours at a time and a manager, cash handling.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the praise I receive once I have done a job well!"
good,"There is no such thing as a typical day at Walgreens!  Every day brings new opportunities!  I began by opening the store, assigning tasks to my employees, checking emails, balancing the books, invoices and ledgers.  I love the variety the job provided...each day, each season something a little bit different.  My store manager is awesome.  He is very supportive and appreciative.  He allows me to be the best I can be.  My co-workers are great people who also provide great support.  I also love the customers.  They are what makes it all worth while.  The hardest part of my job is dealing with decisions made at the corporate level and sent down to the stores.  It seems they have forgotten what is like to run a store!  Each year we are expected to do more with less.  I know this is typical of todays society, however it is frustrating and creates many new challenges.  They have mandated so many displays and order product in for it for every store.  Every store is not the same.  We all have different dynamics which results in different items selling in some stores and not the other.  As a result, our inventory goes through the roof!  The problem is, now we are way over our budgeted inventory level. This is just one example of how corporate decisions aren't always the best.  The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to know the customers and doing the best I can to make their day!  I love going the extra mile to satisfy my customers.  They appreciate it and that makes my job worthwhile."
good,Exceptional company that is focused on  innovative stragey and the growth and changing form of the retail industry
good,Quite hectic and fast-paced work environment. Did not enjoy the lack of customer contact. Spread thin at times given the quantity of prescriptions without additional technician help.
good,"i learned how to interact with customers to fulfill their needs, my counting skills, advising skills, and retail skills grew, co workers very friendly."
good,"Worked here for 10 years, and they treated me well. Benefits were really good years ago, they are mediocre at best today. Nice Co-Workers, decent workload, able to spread it evenly between Employees to get the work done. Long shifts at times, mainly around the holidays and season changes. Decent pay for the work if you put some time in, starting pay isn't awesome, but it gets better. All in all, not a bad company to work for, they have direction and a sense of morals, at times. Advancement has been reworked, years ago you could make it ahead without a College Degree, but it's required now. One major downside was no sense of Tenure. Everyone is equal when it comes to requests and such, which after being there 10 years, is a big let down."
good,I help customers with their needs. Handle inventory. Able to multitask.
good,"Your life must revolve around them. You end up working 60+ hrs a week because someone always ends up calling in and you have to cover for them, And don't expect to get paid a sick day if one of your children is sick, only you can be sick and get paid."
good,Heavy workflow. Multiple duties. Multitasking. Required to work between two buildings and meet timeing deadlines.
good,I absolutely adored my shift lead manager however I did feel overworked and underpaid at times.  I learned a lot about the retail industry and enjoyed working with my manager the most.  The hardest part of the job was worrying about getting robbed.  I also didn't like the fact that there was nobody to cover us if we got sick or was unable to work for whatever reason.
good,"Gave me the opportunity to increase my experience within customer service, mangerial duties and gross profit VS loss."
good,"It's a great place to work, healthy and fun environment. Daily, as a photo specialist, I would in the morning; date the thawed food, start the photo equipment, make sure the cooler is full, check with the managers for daily tasks and a the most important thing is always customer service. In the evening it is mainly customer service, filling the cooler, and working on photo orders. Finally finishing up the night with facing the aisles, checking the cooler, pulling items to thaw and sweeping. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with all the odd's and ends off the day while keeping your customer service at the utmost level. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the customers and chatting with them."
good,Well counting pills and filling prescriptions and helping people is always fun. I learned to work on my customer service skills and to have compassion for people with serious medical conditions. This job was fast an fun.
good,"The job is decent with regular shifts, and fair pay. I worked here when I was in high school and enjoyed it. The environment was nice too."
good,I enjoy working with the public and love my customers. Never a dull moment
good,"Walgreens is a good place to work, but it all depends on the manager."
good,Multi tasking every day to get the work done and help customers.
good,I did enjoy working at Walgreens. The Managers were easy to get along with. I didnt like the random shifts. But over all it was a good job
good,"I had worked their for 13 years. Due to the economy they were getting rid of positions. Due to the fact that I had been there for 13 years and the manager of the department did not like me, I was terminated."
good,I'm not much for sitting still but I did enjoy the ability to speak to many different people and I gain valuable knowledge in the pharmacutical industry.
good,"-typical work day is really busy for morning. the morning shift tech has a lot of work to do to start the day. mid shift tech and night tech have the best schedule and work load. "
good,I was pregnant when I worked for walgreens and I was hired for two positions so I was in the pharmacy twice and week and a cashier the remaining time I was working. Overall it had its perks and they definitely were sensitive to my needs while pregnant.
good,"Stock shelves"
good,learned the ideal way of providing excellent customer service
good,"the lack of hours and lack of money causes a big issue, when expected to work as though you make 45 dollars an hour"
good,"Walgreens, and all other major pharmacies like it, are very typical in their workflow. There are not any major challenges except for customer satisfaction. There is not a clear career ladder.  The job was easy and fun but not something that was long term for someone as ambitious as I was."
good,Its a very productive work place far as learning new things bc it is very challenging
good,"Most employees at my Walgreens are very lazy. My managers don't put in time, unless it's to give orders, or express their concerns on a mistake. Not a very good team workplace."
good,"a typical day there would be me greeting customers, cashiering, setting up displays in the sore"
good,"Walgreens is a okay place to work if you are working at a store that is fully staffed. I liked working at walgreens , fun loving happy environment ."
good,Need to have better compensation for the amount of work required.
good,"Walgreens was my first pharmacy job and I learned a lot, such as processing insurance claims, compounding and improving my customer services f,rom working there.  It was a fast-paced job and constantly busy. The only problem was the need for more help! Customers constantly complain about the pharmacy being under staffed."
good,Overall good environment and supportive co-workers. Learned about healthcare industry and the best practices around it.
good,"My overall view of the company is that it's ok. Every job has its shananigans.But at the end of the day ,work is alot like life.. its what you make it and having a proper attitude."
good,"You get what you expect with it being retail. Long hours. Late nights, holidays, weekends, overnights."
good,"I came from the plant in Wax as they call it in Texas where they considered the people opinion their before they decided to do stuff. The one here in Bethlehem, Naz Pa is more a my way or the highway kinda place. I have seen good people lose their job and people cause they been there along time or will sit there and walk over them keep their job."
good,This pharmacy just wasnt for me and didnt work well with my school schedule. Over all did not like drive thru and thought they could hire cashiers for that.
good,"I no longer work for Walgreens.  After 17 years of service, I was let go for a bogus reason.  I feel I was discriminated against because of age and medical issues.  I worked with the greatest co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was standing at the front register all  the time without being able to move around much."
good,"Overall, It's a great company to work for since there are many benefits for full-time employees. A typical work day consists of faxing doctors, making doctor calls for patient refills, getting deliveries set up, filling, ringing up customers, answering questions, answering phones, putting in new prescriptions and typing prescriptions...etc. Depending on which Walgreens you work at, a typical day can be totally different. There are slow stores and fast paced stores. The hardest part of the job is not being able to fill a patient's medication and telling them why. Another toughy is trying to explain medications to patients who cannot speak English. This problem arrises all the time. The most enjoyable part of the job is fulfilling patient's requests and getting everything done in a timely fashion."
good,"Walgreens staff are friendly people, you have your laughs and learn so much. You get the opportunity to meet all kinds of people. You find yourself doing the best you can to help people, you feel better about your character after each day of work."
good,"Good Team member,motivating,helpful,interactive."
good,"•	Assisted with Photo station.  Helped customers with questions and products. "
good,"Fairly Friendly people, Very clean and positive environment, smoke free environment,"
good,Enjoyable place to be..Management was good. Answer calls on multiple lines
good,"Since I've worked at different stores in different states, I've learned a variety of things.  Due to the area of each store and the specific location, I had to learn how to transition my work pace from a fast paced store, to a slower one. I got to meet different kinds of managers and each one showed me an unique way of assisting the company or how to make my job easier.  "
good,Ever changing programs to better customer service. Little room for advancement.
good,"Slow paced, monotonous.  Loved developing photos for vacationers"
good,"Overall a decent company to work for; however, they do tend to work you with very little technician help."
good,Great place to work. Im only moving on because my scheduling needs could not be accomodated.
good,"Most have good customer service skills, the ability to advance."
good,"hardest part of job, there are customers still unsatisfied even you did your best doing a good customer service."
good,I was employed here for 10 years and I must say the first part was not too bad but the second half was a nightmare.
good,"*A typical day at work it was very busy "
good,Walgreens was a laid back job with many rewarding attributes.
good,I worked in the Beauty Dept. I enjoyed helping customers out with health and beuty questions.
good,on a typical day not much changed pretty much routine work once you get the hang of it.
good,"A typical day at work is easy going."
good,"Typical day at work will either be opening or closing the store. Anywhere from cash handling, handling vendors, to giving superb customer service. I have been working for the company for some years and I have learned a lot. I have called the role model to the store and mentor to most of my coworkers there."
good,Walgreen's can be a fun and very energetic company to work for i just all depends on which one you are working for but all in all i did learn a lot and i did gain many great while working for this company.
good,"work to satisfy and assist customers with great customer service, learned how to grow and expand within companies to have a better career."
good,"A typical day at work involves cleaning my entire work area, filling suggested sale items, and performing cash transactions."
good,"An average day of work at Walgreens for me involves handling customers' complaints and issues, stocking products, putting up and taking down sales tags, facing products on the shelves, folding shirts, and cleaning up my work area. What I've learned so far is that when dealing with customers, coworkers, and managers you have to stay cool, calm, and collected. Walgreens' management system could really improve in my opinion. Most of my coworkers are fun to be around, but we also get our work done efficiently. The hardest part of my job would have to be remaining patient with customers if they have an attitude and are arrogant. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I have customers say pleasant things to me about me."
good,Handled customer's inquiries and resolved customers issues.
good,It was a very nice environment to work in. Clear responsibilities were listed and it was easy to perform duties.
good,A typical day at Walgreens would be very bebeficial. I love working. No matter how bad a day was I always put on a smile and give the best customer service. I interacted with Management and Co-Workers in a professional manner. To me there was no hard part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job would be to always go above and beyond and Management/Company showing appreciation for work well done
good,"A typical day at work included stocking, shelving, working at the cash register, responding to customer inquiries over the phone and in person."
good,You are able to work with the public and lend a helping hand where every needed
good,Walgreens has had challenges in the recent past. Due to these changes the moral  at Walgreen has declined.
good,A typically day at work would be answering multiple phones calls back to back.  Verifying medicaid eligibillity for the Take Care health clinics. Making sure that patients questions were answered before attending the clinic.
good,We have a very busy day each day. We have to do everything quickly and promptly. I have learned to be fast but yet efficient. You have to make sure your customer/patient is happy and you have met all of there needs. I love the staff that I work with and the regular customers that are in on a daily basis. I love to develop relationships with everyone. I love to be involved with their lives and know what is happening. I feel that makes them more cared about and that they know that I will remember all they tell me.
good,I worked in Florida during tourist season so I got a taste of retail quickly.
good,Work there for a couple years if you dont see yourself being manager or want to be you will never adbance in that job place.
good,"A typical day at work would be filled with completing tasks from a list composed by a manager. I learned to manage my time well enough to keep the customers happy and to complete my tasks. The management team and my coworkers were a group of energetic, hard-working individuals that made work a better place. The hardest part of the job was maintaining the sales floor and my jobs in the pharmacy at both times. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to have the opportunity to show that I could carry and complete a full load. "
good,"A tpical day at walgreens varied, I could be working cashier, or relieving breaks or stocking shelves, etc. The Co workers were always fun. The hardes part of the job was sometimes finding something to do."
good,Typical day at work would be providing excellent customer service in person and over the phone. I learned how to work a telzon. Management was helpful. Co-workers were friendly. Hardest part of the job was constant schedule changes. Most enjoyable part would be realizing what I had accomplished throughout my shift.
good,"You belong to Walgreens as an assistant.  Expect long hours and to always work during holidays, weekends, and evenings."
good,"Ok company, nothing special. Could be better, could be worse"
good,"A typical day would be like any other day, taking care of the people and make them feel they are at home. I love to make people laugh and feel better about them selves. "
good,"Great computer system, customers generally nice. Very fast paced when busy. "
good,"Open or Close store, put out tills, safe count, customer service, returns/exchanges, receive vender deliveries, warehouse, stock shelves, resets/revisions, price changes, relief for pharmacy."
good,"Just typical working environment and the rest allow me to say it in a quote,"" Motivation is within reach in inner principles and determinations of the person""."
good,"I am looking for a new job opportunities, where I can develop my skills as a person and professional."
good,"My typical day working at Walgreens was running a Cash Register"
good,day to day I would be at the register mostly. The pay wasn't that great and not flexible with schooling.
good,We were able to migrate our patients into the retail store although there is no privacy for counseling.
good,"Just love to work in the pharmacy, and the knowledge and understanding of the complexity of medicine. Love the fast paced-environment."
good,"Focus on customer service, sales, informing customer of upcoming promotions, suggestive selling procedures, retail operations, pharmacy operations"
good,Non-stressful job with good management and fun employees. Good hours available.
good,"customer service"
good,Working in high volume pharmacies will try you patience as corporate was cutting back hours at the time and trying to run the pharmacy with the minimum amount of staff. Working in areas that are not as busy is fine though. 
good,"Entering and filling prescriptions, cash register, and drive thru. I learn about people and their situations. Management is good, but sometimes subjective in their approach. Co-workers are a good staff. The hardest part of my job is explaining insurance to patients and lazy co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my are the patients. Most of them are good people."
good,The growth is not there from within. Its seem that want the assistants to stay in store with no way to make it to corporate.
good,"   Head Cosmetician"
good,"over the years the company has moved towards the work them harder, pay them less mentality.  Unreasonable expectations of what managers can make happen is rampant.  All the while telling you that you and your family are most important and not to neglect them.  However, if you don't spend the extra hours away from your family, you won.t get the work done."
good,I love my job. I learn a lot of different things from working at Walgreens. I like working with my co-workers. They are fun to work with. The hardest part of the job is stocking the shelves. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping and greeting the customers.
good,"My typical day at work would be to set up the registers, opening the doors and greet customers. I would ask them if they have the discount card and if they don't, I would ask if they would like to apply for a card. I would also promote the ""Item of the Month"" (which is just random that we would have on sale for the whole month and we earn commission from). After all that, I would ask them to call the survey hotline that Walgreens has and ask customers to give us a rating on our services. During down time, I would look around and see what needs to be fixed and faced properly and clean occasionally. "
good,"easy job , friendly enviroment, handle customers at the register also stock inventory and pll needed items to floor."
good,"If your wanting to move up it is very competitive, but way too much politics involved in actually moving up as opposed to actual skills and accomplishments within."
good,A typical day at work would consist of keeping rotation in each station so one technicain was not stuck in a stressful station for too long. We keep every line moving with helping each and every patient to the best we can pushing out prescriptions as fast and efficient as possible. I have learned the best ways to calm down an upset patient and how to make things right for them and also taking what I have learned and teaching it to new technicians. The hardest part of the job would be keeping every one happy. There are days when a patient will expect too much and will not settle for less. But it is rewarding when you are able to help with a problem a patient is having and they are grateful and appreciate it everything you do. 
good,"Walgreens is a rather typical retail setup. When I started in '06 it felt (and was run) more like a small neighborhood store vs a major chain. This allowed for more personable experiences for staff and customer alike. Upward mobility was much more likely then but as with a lot of companies opportunities have tightened considerably in recent years. I enjoyed working for this company for a hand full of years although the creative freedoms and personality that was a part of that culture has dwindled and it feels like a much more sterile environment these days. If you're looking for a retail job, Walgreens is a decent choice."
good,needs more work in mgmt and organzational skills more hands on experience...not enough hours or pay for work assigned... 
good,"when i started w/happy harry which walgreens had purchased, it was great.  Many advancement opportunities and they actually cared about employees.  Now walgreens cares about the money and not employees.  Was let go due to economy drop and they eliminated number of mgrs per store."
good,It was difficult to meet all the expectations when you did not get acknowledge for things done right
good,"First time I was a cashier, learned counting money, sales, stocking, and facing."
good,"I applied for the position online, received a call within 3 days to complete a series of 4 test from prove it.com excel, powerpoint, tying and data entry..if you passed the test you are then given a call back to come in for a face to face interview at the call center which is located in South Orlando South Park Circle.. The interview took place with the HR manager and a floor supervisor.. the interview is a behavioral interview type questions.. i received a call 3 days after my interview that i had got the job. An offer email was sent to me and i had to go into the call center to fill out some paperwork.. and consent to background check and drug testing which needs to be done in 48 hours.. My class starts on June 23 second shift 1:30-10 for now until a shift bid. the training class is for 6 weeks 8-5 good luck.. and we shall see how the rest of the process goes..  "
good,All Was great. Very friendly company. Did great job on training new employees.
good,I assisted customers with their shopping. I took inventory and ordered the necessary items for the cosmetic department.
good,"I was there for 2 years, and they treated their employees better than I had expected.  We all treated customers equally as well.  Had I wanted full-time at the time, they probably would have given it to me, if I had just asked for it.  My hours were very good, I just wish that I could have more during the day than at night."
good,review prescriptions and translate sig codes into computer system. easy job and great management
good,"i started as cashier, then moved to beauty adviser, then to Head Photo Specialist. i was in charge of photo dept and grocery department. i learned to work on the photo machines, developer, processor, printer computers.Assisted management in smooth running of the store. Did inventory, set up sales displays to help promote sales. I truly enjoyed helping the customers at kiosk and with new and creative ways to display their photos. it became my department and my committed customers."
good,They sometimes treated you like someone they didn't care about
good,"During the course of a day, I make schedules, budget payrolls, pay bills, balance ledgers, merchandise the store, all while training  employees and assisting customers.  I have learned a great deal in providing excellent customer service through this job.  The most full filling part of my job is training employees and helping them advance their careers."
good,Walgreens would be better off if they would allow on site managers to manage. Every site is different and the needs of the employees vary per location.
good,Working at this place helped improve my customer service and my typing skills. It also improved my medical terminology and medications knowledge.
good,I loved the customer service experience I received from the customers.
good,don't know much about the company because I just did internship with them
good,"a typical day at work was doing 7 day calls, filling prescriptions, labeling prescriptions, typing prescriptions, doing insurance calls, doctor calls and etc.. I learned how to do insurance calls, seven day calls and other things, managment was fair, co -workers when had the time would help in most parts, the hardest part of the job was the insurance calls but after learning it, it became easier, the most enjoyable part about the job was making the customer happy "
good,Dedicated employees and customers help make the days enjoyable. Not having a consistant schedule and the possiblitiy of being transferred at any given time with very little notice can be problematic.
good,Helping customers was a typical day at work.  I learned how to use the cash register at a fast pace.  Management always made sure we were comfortable and so did co-workers.  The hard-part was determining who needed more hours.  The most enjoyable part was we all got to rotate shift positions.
good,"Recently had a large ""reduction in force"" leading to a sacrifice in customer/patient service."
good,"I filled many prescriptions during a day. I learned how to fill scripts efficently. The management was very friendly. I enjoyed my co-workers. The hardest part was making sure I kept the correct pace at filling prescriptions. The most enjoyable part were the patients, the overall enviornment and the staff."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walgreen's.               "
good,"While the employees are easy to get along with, the store needs more organization to run better."
good,"Printed Photos, Stocked Shelves and helped customers when needed."
good,"I was fortunate enough to work a few positions at Walgreens.  I worked back in the pharmacy, in the beauty department and at the front register.  Loved my co-worker, but had some difficulties with the overnight management staff.   "
good,"I start the day off making sure everything is needed to take care of daily tasks. The hardest part of work, is trying to deal with co-workers who do not want to work. The best part of the job, is being able to help customers."
good,lots of work holidays and weekemds good for me as I was in high school.
good,"a typical day would be clock in, then a work list is made. The manager is a newly promoted manager that needs more people skills. The most enjoyable part is working with customers.  I enjoy working with people. The company used to be an employee favor company, but sadly they have changed and now are slowly becoming a company that is only interested in making money and becoming the number 2 company. Positions are depleated and along with it are pay cuts. Big pay cuts. Mine went from 17.65 to 11.60.per hour."
good,"Pharmacist hated working there as well as techs, they work you to the bone and treat you like your nothing "
good,stressful work imvorment not for me slow pace work sitting alot no very good managment
good,Filling of prescriptions and verification of prescriptions. Overnights meant working on my own with no additional help.
good,"On a typical day the staff would ring out customers, stock shelves, process photos and help customers find items if needed. I learned how to Interact with people in a short period of time. Management were nice and understanding. For the most part the co-workers were nice but we didn't work as a team as often as I thought we should. The job was pretty easy so there isn't anything that i could say that was to hard. The most enjoyable part was dealing with the public."
good,Love it!! Its hard to move up the company but it still pays really well.
good,Overall I enjoyed my work at this company. i learned more than ever from all of the staff
good,I come in pull up the sales numbers the last years numbers of the same day of this year. I put together what needs to be done in and have a five min. meeting with my boss of how to build up the company and or store. I learn and get along with management and work with them to learn new things eveyday. The hardest part of my job is the working on thw weekends. I enjoy working with the customers that come in. I love the interaction.
good,The hours were uncertain from the get go. You did not work a steady job position and often your position would be changed with no consent from yourself. Favoritism was a major issue. Many workers who didn't deserve their positions were working the best positions while the hard worker were stuck with all the left overs.
good,"its has its days of being good and bad, i learned so much in my 7 years of service ."
good,"Good job in high school. Fun managers = fun job and vice versa, although Walgreens is cutting back on the budget a lot so it is becoming less and less of a decent job."
good,• Assisted over 100 customers daily.
good,There's always new challenges at work. Most of the co-workers I have worked with are hard workers that values and appreciate their job.
good,"Management is usually awful, but they go through people so often that it doesn't matter. Basically if you work at the front register or cosmetics section, your day consist of ringing people up, cleaning/facing your area and answering questions."
good,"Enjoyable employer overall. Overnights are interesting, co-workers are pleasant and professional. Stock nights can be a bit harried, but fun. I've learned different departments of retail. Hardest part of job is running back and forth between the POS when customers are ready to finalize shopping, and fronting/restocking merchandise simultaneuosly."
good,"The software system employed by Walgreens needs some vital over haul, particularly in terms of inventory management."
good,customer service
good,I really enjoyed this job but i was looking for better hours and more money. I was hired for a 40 hour a week job but only got about 34 hours a week.
good,It is an okay place to work if low pay does not matter. The management was alright but they were not flexible with hours in the pharmacy
good,"Not a bad place to work, like any other store. They have a bit of confusion here and there."
good,It was ok They didnt really give me any hours but while i worked there it was a very good job
good,Most enjoyable part about the job are my loyal customer base and friends.
good,Learned a lot of organizing while working there.
good,"Nice to work for awhile, but will get redundant after awhile"
good,the job came along with alot of responsibilities and it was short staffed on more then a few occasions... Very fast pace
good,All the above company I have worked and I am currently working are good companies.
good,"5-700 daily average script volume mostly waiters with many insurance rejections to solve lead to many challenges that were exciting to overcome. Excellent store manager and coworkers that provided a great work experience. The most enjoyable part of my day was knowing that I provided the best service and assisted someone on their way to being well. I have gained much experience, education, and many tools that I can carry on to my next field."
good,"I learned many valuable lessons in IV infusion, being able to work with adults and children. I did a lot of teaching in the homes of many diverse people and origins. I worked with a number of fabulous nurses with an expertise in IV therapy including central lines, implanted ports, for example. I was also a clinical liaison for the hospitals, working up new clients for IV therapy at home."
good,"There is never a dull moment at Walgreens, you are expected to know how to deal with any situation and make the best of your day."
good,I enjoyed gaining hands on experience with customers. I was constantly learning new things.
good,a 8-10hr shift
good,"This company and I just grew apart. I feel this company turned its back on its loyal employees only to replace them with cheaper work hands. The push out the door started with a simple action of requiring me to work on Christmas yet cutting Christmas gift card gifts; replacing those with a 25% day. Requiring you spend money to get your ""gift"". Then it went to cutting the better insurance policy out. Then to cutting hours at stores requiring you work with less help."
good,"Cashier work, stock work."
good,I liked Walgreens. I always met the people in the neighborhood because that's who came most often. I liked my coworkers but my store manager was so upset and mean about everything. I do not think the job is challenging as a beauty advisor.
good,Productive work but bad scheduling. stressful work environment with no breaks
good,"At the time I worked for Walgreens, it was very much a ""boys club"" for management. This has been proven in court. While I loved the actual work, it was an exercise in futility because I would have never been given my own store."
good,-perform managerial duties
good,Going in a different direction. Its a very different company then it was when I started.
good,Enjoyed working with customers and helping them understand the various products that are available.
good,I enjoyed working for Walgreens. The managers and culture that was there at that time was fantastic my only problem was that I didnt make enough money to survive on
good,Walgreens is a great company to work for. They take pride in what there company stands for. Its always about the customers. It just was not a great fit for me.
good,busy
good,"I actually have met plenty of people who love retail and management so Walgreen's has been great for them. In a typical day you have to manage about 5 employees at a time. You will have to check in vendors, put up truck, work the overstock on the sales floor, build end stands, and clean the store. Customer service is a huge part of the job. I have great customer service skills so that not a problem I just don't like doing it. I don't like the hours. Usually I work most weekends and my schedule changes every week and from day to day. During holidays we never close. EVER. So when I really want to go visit family out of state for Christmas, I can't. The work schedule is actually the biggest thing I don't like about Walgreen's. I have been there 7 years so everything isn't that bad. The pay has been what has kept me around. It has afforded me the opportunity to help my family and buy a house. I'm very thankful to Walgreen's for that. I hope them the best in the future but I need a career change."
good,A typical day at walgreens was to make sure the store was in order. i had to make sure all shelves where stocked and the inventory room was organized as well. i liked my job it kept me busy for the most part.
good,"Workplace is clean, fun, and organized. Learned how to manage team members very well and create strategies to increase company's profitability. Supervisor is very knowledgeable on how to run the store and put into action directive that comes from upper leadership. Hardest part is not knowing what kinds of customers are going to be coming in thru your doors everyday but that is what makes it so enjoyable for me (meeting new people everyday)."
good,Operate Cash Register and handle the cash money and solve customer need
good,I would ring out customers at the register all day. I learned how to provide great customer service. The management was fair and nice. My co-workers were open and friendly people. The hardest park of the job was to keep customer lines down. The most enjoyable part was helping the customers get out of the door in a timely manor.
good,Busy
good,Utilize ten-key skills.
good,"This company has it's ups and downs, but over all it a good company to work for."
good,I think the job is good. Im just looking for something different with a chance to advance.
good,"As a sims-coordinator, the job changed day by day different tasks bhad to be completed in a timely matter. Many customers to please, and great environment for work."
good,"Staff very knowledgeable, and dedicated to providing good customer service."
good,"The Pharmacy is a little stressful because of the amount of prescription we got in, but over all, nice working place and time went by fast."
good,"Walgreens is not a difficult place to work. The most challenging aspect is dealing with difficult or hostile customers, the frequency of which depends on your location. You develop a team mentality with your coworkers."
good,"cash handling, unload truck, stocking merchandise, cashier."
good,"Easy work for the most part, good if you are a people person. Management pretty much keeps to themselves and on slow days it is hard to keep yourself busy and occupied."
good,Managers were willing to work with my schedule. Truely a nice place to work
good,"Assist with customer checkout, as well as stocking shelves, and answering customers inquiries about the products we carried."
good,"I was always turned down at retail jobs because I didn't have any retail experience under my belt. I always thought that was funny because I would never get the chance to have retail experience if I was never given the opportunity. When I was finally given the chance to work retail, I took the offer so I could have the experience for future jobs. I worked really hard to better the company because you never know how it is until you go behind the doors or closed scenes. I made a lot of friends and enjoyed helping customers. It always made me feel good to be able to have knowledge about what I was doing."
good,Typically people wander in from nearby transportation terminal - this can be very distracting
good,Its a fast growing company that is very diverse but advancement is not always based on performance but favortism.
good,Did a lot of work that went unnoticed to help advance with the company. Hard department manager to get along with.
good,challenging position with a flexible schedule
good,Not too bad not too good. You can move up but not always easy. The pay was good but lots of changes coming to the company.
good,"Walgreens is a fast pace and upbeat environment, helpful co workers"
good,"A typical work week will entail merchandising, scheduling, offering superior customer services. Management is good and the co-workers are great. The hardest aspect of the position is being open 24 hours a day and on holidays. Also, One can hit ceilings in regarding advancment. Most enjoyable aspect of the job is interacting with people."
good,Very small pharmacy so we bumped into each other. The people were very nice if you like the retainl environment. I am looking for a position in a hospital or compounding facility.
good,A typical day at work is busy and this is what I enjoy so my day can run smoothly at work.
good,"You can go to work with a goal for the day and sometimes it is so busy that when you are able to accomplish your goal it is the greatest. Employee's are great along with the customers. The hardest part of my job is when you are pulled apart in all directions, so you don't get all the projects done you wanted to get done."
good,A typical day at Walgreens was ok. I had to maintain the store and make sure the employees and what the needed to make sure their shift went smooth. the employees were nice and kind. There really wasnt a hard part to my job. The most enjoyable part of my job was work with customers.
good,A typical day at work includes assisting customers with various questions about consumer products.
good,Good job but management is not trained on how to manage. They make changes that are not justified. Cutbacks since 2008 really hurt training and raises.
good,Typical days work is talking to customers and checking them out and making sure that they get the best service.
good,"Being that I worked outside the cities for walgreens I didn't get to enjoy the team building and outside events that the company was a part of (such as relay walks etc.) Also, I didn't feel that my work was appreciated and that my skills weren't used to its greatest potential. I learn alot form my position, understanding how to deal with customers, co-workers. Also, the ability to get the best out of my employees ans the joy of them succeeding throughout my career with them. Overall a positive experience, that I appreciate and has helped me develop into the person I am today."
good,its alright you hours can be cut at any moment. Its nothing I would do long term.
good,takes up your entire life. a manager is not a manager... more like a stock boy/janitor.
good,Every day is a new way to make someone coming through the door a customer for life.
good,Always had something to do and the customers were always pleasant
good,"Nice place to work, including benefits and caring. great co-workers to work with."
good,"The customers are amazing. It was great to see all of them or who ever came in the store. I tried to make them feel at home like some one cared they came into our store. They loved the new products!! They loved the small enviroment. If the older cliental was not feeling good, they could get everything they needed to get buy, and they could do photos. I have worke on other Kiosk machines but I LIKE Walgreens the best!! The Make UP and finger nail dept or beauty is awesome. They have everything a girl needs. Co Workers are great they are even better when they are happy. There are days you work really hard specially if your store is a TOP 10 Store out of 47. The hardest part of job there really was none if you are feeling well it is do able."
good,A very fast paced job that is very demanding. There is always a ton of things that must be done within your shift time. Management is not always the nicest but it depends on the manager.
good,"A typical day at work includes ringing up and interacting with customers, countinting draws and the safe, and making money drops and band deposits. My co-workers are friendly and hardworking most of the time. The hardest part of the job is keeping the employees busy and the most enjoyable part is meeting the new people that come into the store."
good,"I very much enjoyed the years I spent working with the Walgreens company. The oppourtunity and knowledge they provided me with has helped me grow into a competent, hard-working individual."
good,Its a good place to start out and learn but corporate does not value you and does not allow for enough pharmacists and technicians
good,the most enjoyable part of the job is my customer what i learned about is how to order
good,I started with the company young and have held many positions. I have learned numerous amount of things. If you willing to learn they willing to teach. I worked my way from front cashier to Senior Certified Pharmacy Technician. When I started it was like everyone with Walgreens was family. In 2006/2007 I noticed as the change in economy started it to changed the way people treated each other and handling of situations. It felt very corporate after that. I really enjoyed helping people with challenging problems to solve. After a little over 12 years with the company we parted ways. Stability of the job was great as all roads have speed bumps and will have their own challenges but stability of a person job I feel is the key to happy employees which in turns will provide the BEST customer service. Happy employees=Happy customers= Profit for the company and the circle will continue.
good,"Manage 7+ employees daily, tend to customer needs, set floor displays for optimum sales, run daily sales numbers and look for trends, provide unbeatable customer service"
good,"Company used to be much better than it is now. Not the worst company, but they run a dangerous pharmacy."
good,Great place to learn management skills. Management at the store level focuses on metrics. Staffing can be difficult and turnover at the store level is high.
good,"A typical day at work mostly consists of stocking shelves, but also includes helping customers, cash handling, inventory management, and merchandising. I've learned that there's more to merchandising than simply putting things on a shelf, how to turn negative experiences into positive ones, how to adapt and react to new situations, as well as others. Management thus far has been great in that they are down to earth and friendly, and at the same time remain professional and helpful; co-workers have been the same way - most are great with customers and work hard. The hardest part of this job is self-motivating, as this is difficult due to the worry of job security and being completely disposable. This company, as I'm told, has been caring and understanding in the past. Unfortunately, this is not the case anymore, as most employees will tell you. The executives of this company seem dishonest and delusional, which again, most employees would say. The most enjoyable parts of the job thus far have been the friendly customers and the camaraderie of the employees. I also enjoy playing active roles as a manager."
good,"Answer phone cals, Receiving and process refill request, receiving new prescriptions, fill medication orders, work at the drive thru register. prepare and processing insurance claims."
good,"Everyday was a multi-tasking day. Very busy. I learned a lot about how retail is run. My co-workers were very helpfull. I was responsible for checking out customers, answering all incoming phone calls, greeting customers that came into the store, handling cash, debit and credit transactions, stocking merchandise and helping set up displays when my time allowed."
good,face to face contact was great I learned more customer service skills
good,"cashier, unload trucks, put merchandise away. ive learned to help others, customer service skills, and how to be good in a team. hardest part was to many hours to the point i lived in walgreens. most enjoyable was working and feeling accomplished finishing my assignments each day."
good,"constant flow of customers in the pharmacy, company needs more hours to provide for employees though."
good,I learned how to use the cashier and how to deal with customers
good,only 5 or 6 employees worked so it was easier for everyone to get along with each other.
good,very family oriented company they are very flexible with family emergencies and things as long as you dont take advantage
good,Great and friendly people to work with. Always something to do.
good,"I Work in different departments, and on different tasks. My main department was the photo department. Helping customers print there pictures, processing there film, and taking orders. Also put up new stock, and ordering."
good,"Typical retail position where I was responsible for maintaining all areas of the store, from cashiering to stocking the sales floor. I learned how to give great service to a wide variety of customers with many different needs, including difficult ones. The hardest part of the job was handling a large crowd on days where I was the only associate on duty. The most enjoyable part of the job was feeling confident about what I was doing every day, knowing that I could handle anything that came my way."
good,It is a good place to work while in college but it is not worth trying to make a career out of the job. Company has changed drastically in moving away from helping/ supporting the workers
good,- a lot of multitasking and one must prioritize themselves if they want to do well.
good,"typical day at work , welcome the customers in a fast pace enviroment.I have learned to be patient ,careing and understanding to the needs of many. I have assited the managers in a respectful manner and enjoy working well with others.Team member."
good,"I learned to fill medication, multi-task answering call, helping customers, order inventory"
good,"I can honeslty say I gained a lot of experience from working at Walgreens. I learned how to create effective sale displays, how to use a texlon to check inventory and create signs and weekly sales tags. I learned how to assist customers in a timely and friendly manner."
good,"A typical day at my job as an Executive Assistant Manager goes as follows: After opening the store by putting out all the drawers, your journey begins. Hopefully you have a full staff because if you don't, half of the store notes go out of the window due to filling the gaps in customer service. You check email and the district generated assignment program for tasks that are near due or overdue. Then you walk the store and make notes for your staff. You compile your tasks that you wrote down, tasks from the email and tasks from the district generated assignment program and delegate them out. Next you are responsible for most of the consumable products in the store and you must make sure those sections are being checked for outdated merchandise. While working on the daily tasks alongside your employees, you must make sure that the tasks are being done with 100% follow through. All the while, you are also dealing with customer issues and employee issues. I learned how to be an excellent delegator. Without delegation, retail will eat you alive. My co-workers gossip about each other as if it was a reality TV show. As an EXA, I must get to the root of the gossip, correct the issue and deter it from happening again. The hardest part of my job is being #2 in the store. So if someone doesn't show up to work, I must come in and cover the store or even work a double shift if it's required. It's very difficult to maintain a personal life or commit to school or any reoccuring activity outside of work. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing someone having a bad day or upset with the"
good,I think the hardest thing about working here is all the managers they have. There is never just one manager
good,"A typical day at Walgreens requires signing in at the front office, putting your things away in your locker, and heading straight to work. I've learned that this job does not care much of their employees' needs. The management changes ever so often.The co- workers are just doing their jobs. The hardest part of the job is really getting paid, which is not rare. There is no enjoyable parts of this job."
good,Interpret medical abbreviations
good,"It was a Great experience. A typical day at work would be, communicating with patients and doctors to come to a comclusion about the patient's medication. I learned a lot about billing patients insurance, and i was also able to enhance my customer service skills.The most enjoyable part of the day was knowing that at the end of the day we were able to help hundreds of patients fell better."
good,It's retail. You get a lot thrown at you to learn in a little amount of time and need to be aggressive to meet expectations. Be ready to work your tail off and not have much of a life or if you do it will feel crammed together a lot. Great job for someone who doesn't mind the long hours and what not.
good,"Positive work environment. Great experience. Good folks to work with, which makes leaving the job the toughest part."
good,"My experiance with Walgreens is that the store owner only like to hire high school kids so long as there 18 or over you got a job there but of your over 21 chances are no so good, I worked there my self for a while and I notice the photo lab manager was nothing more than a child much younger than I am and did not really know how to behave properly she always tried to make her self seem older than 18 what I could not belive is that this 18 year old girl had a good position in this job but used it to frame other workers and dig up dirt on other people so they have to come into work earlyer so she may leave early !! I say the store manager here needs to be replaced with some who can give everyone one over the age of 21 a chance to work not just some kid"
good,"Enjoyable to work .learn new skills,have opportunity to grow in the company."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walgreens because I got lo earn about their products (which I frequently use). Therefore the knowledge I educated myself on helped me to be a better Cashier, because I was able to inform the customers about their purchase, which inspired them to return time after time. The management was fine, we all got along great and worked as a team towards the maintenance and professionalism of our store."
good,"typical day at work , i operated the cash register"
good,"If you enjoy interacting and keeping up a friendly rapport with customers and performing the same exact tasks day after day, then this would be a good job for you."
good,"This was a great company to grow with after college but not long-term - hours can be rough for someone with a family - working nights, weekends, and holidays."
good,"This company is restructuring their current management team, some of us are having to take considerable pay cuts. Yet they are still a high profit company"
good,Great work enviroment. Management was great. Co-workers always willing to help.
good,the management in the Walgreen's company has eliminated key position of managers with time in grade
good,"Bad pay, move up 10 cents a year, horrible benefits, no advancement opportunities"
good,Part time job during my school days. Assist pharmacists in store.
good,"At walgreens you learn a lot from resetting the shelves to learning how to order, create and print photos. the most enjoyable part of walgreens is meeting new people everyday and being able to interact with them."
good,a typical day is to finished your list that was hand to you by the manger on duty. I learn that retail job is very demand on you mined in physical you to have to been very patenail with the customer. the mangement is pretty ok . the co- worker are very easliy to work with. the hardest part of my job is have people disrespect and beliltle.
good,"Good working environment, excellent practice for customer service and inventory skills."
good,A typical day at work would be taking phone calls for mail order prescriptions refills of specialty medications and making sure any new orders are processed and sent through appropriate areas to get shipped ASAP. Co-workers are great but some as with anywhere can be too dramatic or too personal with their discussion at work. Management is pretty decent. M-F off my 8 saturday over time on occasions.
good,the managers cwere super nice and always took time to talk to and ake sure u were ok the customers were great
good,"This was one of the busier Walgreen's locations in Baton Rouge. The management was good and easy to work with, but some of the other employees were not. The staff lacked cohesiveness because of people constantly leaving for other jobs."
good,made a list of thing that need to get done in every department.
good,"A typical day at work for me is very busy, fast pace for the most part and never nothing for me to not do. Over the years with ever customer service job i have held, I have learned how to handle any situation that may come my way. I have also learned some of the many ways i can advance within the company. A lot of my co-workers i really enjoying working with. My co-workers make me feel like I'm part of the family not just the team. I would have to say the hardest part of my job is not having the right answer to a customers question. The most enjoyable part is being able to interact with my customers, and them noticing the great changes in me."
good,i would open or close daily. prepare food or beverages for the customers. i cleaned up hourly to make sure store didn't get out of control. i restocked and reordered items when ever needed. i also handled money and closed the register down when closing.
good,I learn how to efficiently manage my time and be productive to the maximum. Everybody including management work together harmoniously in improving sales and inventory on a daily basis. I enjoy improving sales and productively making the store a better place for customers and sales. The hardest part of the job is some of the mundane aspects of the job.
good,Great pay. Not to many hours available but goof for a person who is going to school.
good,Work experience was satisfactory. Not a lot career opportunities but overall a good work environment.
good,I have learned quite a lot at this job. The hours are always changing and it is difficult to have a normal life after work.
good,Working for Walgreens has been a great opportunity. At the Distribution level a typical day was fast paced and challenging.
good,"A typical day at work was helping customers and working the registers. I learned how to be patient and listen to the customers and the managers over me. My managers were very strict but understanding at the same time so it wasnt a hard thing to deal with. My co-workers were kind of to themselves, as was i. The hardest part of my job was referring make up to the female customers in the beauty department. The most enjoyable part of my job was researching and learnig about the mke up."
good,Fast paced and good on the job learning experience. The company was growing by leaps and bounds and fast advancement.
good,The company is forever changing. Typically it takes alot of work to move up in the company. If you like retail I would go ahead and work it. However if you just want a job I'd keep searching.
good,- Interacted with customers and learned all of the store's daily functions.
good,Co-workers are friendly and do not hesitate to ask questions. Able to maintain company policies while staying within regulations of the law and other pharmacy duties are easily completed.
good,Walgreens is a good place to work and the company's core values are respectable. It is not a company to be in if advancement is wanted. I felt stuck in my career and there really was nowhere for me to go.
good,Very stressful company to work for. Very little help for management team. Hard to get things done as manager because there is no overtime allowed.
good,"My first and second store were good to work in, the third store was a disaster. I worked as a beauty advisor for my first and part of my second store and then moved to be on the front register. I received a special award for Customer Service in one district. I loved my job in Bradenton, but hated my job in SCC. It really depends on the management at each store. I even liked the SCC store for quite awhile until a certain assistant manager was hired. He did not like me and felt I was not doing a good job. When in fact I was. The"
good,Terrible store coverage structure. Management work is extremely demanding in busy stores and painfully agonizing in slow stores. Also they can relocate you at anytime within certain radius without your consent or even consulting you.
good,I worked in every department. I wish i hadn't gone into preterm labor otherwise I would be still employed working in the pharmacy.
good,"A typical day work includes merchandising, helping pharmacy, customer service, cash handling, and other retail store functions."
good,"while going to high school,manager was flexible with me,offered me to be a manager but i refused because of school."
good,I would rather not review the job at which I am currently employed
good,Maintained an orderly checkout area
good,I worked in the pharmacy dept. and I loved the fast pace and the multitasking that was required to perform the job at hand. Management was great to work with and very helpful. I really liked my co-workers because they were always willing to help when needed. Hardest part of the job would have been telling a patient that their insurance didn't cover their medication. Most enjoyable part was being able to help people get the medication they needed to feel better and get well.
good,"The work place was for the most part a great environment, the only thing that made it not as good as it should have been was the management not communicating properly with the employees."
good,I would go into work and able to delegate tasks to my staff with no problem of having them completed at the end of the shift/day.
good,"At the start of my shift I always check the sales numbers from the day before. I look to see if there is any way to increase those numbers. Then throughout the rest of day I am providing customer service to all of the customers that come into the store. Weather it is in the photo department, on the sales floor, in the pharmacy I make sure I ask every customer I see if they need help with anything. The Management team at Walgreens is great they are always willing to help when it is needed. My team member are great too, they are all fun to work with and make the job really enjoyable. The hardest part of the job are the hours you have to work sometimes. Walgreens is always open so that means sometimes you have to work holidays. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I can make a customers day by : helping them find what they are looking for, helping them with a photo order, getting them in and out fast, or whatever it takes to make their experience at Walgreens great."
good,Currently under going an exciting transition. Growing a robust business plan.
good,I was able to get my first job at Walgreens back when I was in high school and I was overall a good experience. I was able to learn about inventory management while develop good skills working with customers.
good,This was my first job right out of high school. I learned a lot about retail and how to interact with customers.
good,"co-workers were great, i enjoyed the customers and managment. hardest part was hours, deadlines, but was able to reach the goal, but long work week"
good,xyz It was great working here. I worked here as a consultant. good documentation
good,A typical day as an intern included performing a combination of both pharmacist and technician duties.
good,Sales associate on the front end of the store
good,"Help customers, keep store up to date, daily tasks, cashiering."
good,"Printing pictures, editing pictures, and helping customers with ordering photo accessories."
good,"Walgreens is like Walmart. It is a nice place, but every store is exactly the same. That can be an advantage when you have to work at multiple stores."
good,"Since i join the company in 2008 as an employer, I enjoy working for the company since i was college. They have great benefits far as profit sharing and i enjoy interacting with different people. However their pay is not good especially if its paycheck to paycheck. Overall the company will be good to work for only if you in college."
good,"As a pharmacy technician at Walgreens, I was pleasantly challenged by the the fast-paced and ever-changing daily activities in the pharmacy. Co-workers were helpful and easy to work with. Employees were offered a profit-sharing program and comfortable wages. My only complaint concerns the store manager. This person preached unwavering devotion to company policy, yet would break such policies to prevent unhappy customers. I was reprimanded for questioning the manager's decision to break policy to please a customer, when I was the one who wished to ensure that the rules were being followed! Overall, it was a great job, but the manager seemed to get more fulfillment from power than from properly performing her job."
good,"I worked their for almost 4 years, it is a great company but would be even better if they cared more about their employees and situations that they go through with family."
good,The company is very customer focused. They strive to provide the best service for the customers retail and prescription needs
good,"Walgreens likes to hire candidates who are in general either under- or overqualified for the job to be done. In my case, and in the case of a few others at the stores I worked at, we were overqualified. While the first year or so opens you up to new experiences, unless you advance (which has been difficult since they slowed their growth in favor of restructuring in 2008), you end up doing the same thing every day, like clockwork. Sure, the customers keep things interesting for a while, but it would take an exceptionally good management staff, which is not the typical case, to keep good workers engaged. Everything else is eh."
good,"Walgreen's is a good place to start your career. I've learned a lot about customer service, retail, and pharmacy. I can also say I've worked with some of the best and most understanding managers. I also know that Walgreen's has equipped me with basic job necessities. So I would definitely say it's a good first job but wouldn't recommend long term employment unless your seeking a career as a Store Manager or Pharmacist."
good,"Good company to work for as far as being stable, but there isn't much room for advancement unless your willing to move far away."
good,Walgreens is a nice place to work. They are friendly and caring. The company has great advancement for the employees. The benefits are good. The management works well with the employees.
good,Current situation with ExpressScripts leading to cutbacks and reduced hours for staff. Must be able to perform the role of pharmacist effectively with less pharmacy technician help. Long-term outlook for the company is promising.
good,i think walgreens is a good company to work for good pay and benefits
good,"I learned a wide variety of skills dealing with customer service, photo Center,  stocking, cashier I got took out of my comfort zone and strived to be good and show my skills and talents"
good,Honestly your happiness with the company can change based at store location and management. Overall new hires will mostly work 2nd shift until you move up the totem pole. Your place on that pole is determined by store not by company. Best part of working here is the PTO.
good,"I learned a lot and grew within the company and was compensated well but the corporate demands are heavy and unrealistic. When volume increased, employee hours decreased but expectations remained the same."
good,Walgreens as a company I loved good pay and great benefits but the management was horrible. At least at my location things were always micro managed and no help was ever offered if you needed
good,"I really like the team I work with and the company's values. In retrospect, the pay is really bad, especially for a single source family income. Training vs. real time don't always correlate. Only one 30 minute lunch break with 0 breaks"
good,"Very challenging job , always very busy , pharmacy especially, can get up to good pay . Hours are all over the place depending on what kind of store you work for ."
good,"Worked for company many years. A lot of changes in culture, positions, initiatives. Ongoing amount of changes every day. A lot of big company moves and mergers over the years."
good,"Walgreens is a typical retail location. A decent place of an employment for anyone regardless of age or experience. Learned computer skills. Management gets transferred to different stores frequently enough to rarely gain opinion on them. Hardest part of job is the late hours every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday for replacing sale signs."
good,"The higher ups get benefits the lower employees should. All the glory of the worker bees, so to speak. Need to learn to take care of the workers better."
good,Love my patients and employees. dont feel like there is much advancement with no motivation to. Feel overworked with little budget staffing but high consumer sales all the time!
good,The opportunity to grow is very limited and the chance to get a higher pay or raise is slim to none. There isn’t much motivation to work as hard as they expect and hardly anyone ever gets full time. The healthcare options are okay and some of the employees you work with become life long friends.
good,"Walgreens was a great company to work for. I use to enjoy going to work everyday. But with so many changes over the years it has turned into something not so enjoyable. As a manager you will work hard, unloading trucks sometimes with just one person due to payroll cuts. I would come home exhausted. But overall it’s a decent job. Pay is good but you will work hard for it and insurance is expensive."
good,"Most of the employees were really nice and easy to train/get along with. I did enjoy being a lead tech so I was able to create my own schedule. However, Lead techs did not make more than a regular tech so all the work with little benefits."
good,"It's a good company for the most part. Management is good. Can't control other employees, or the people who work there. Workload is a lot. Wish we could have more hours."
good,Walgreens was my first job and I was a great place to work but was very corporate. The best part of this job was the customers. Getting to meet a lot of people and occasionally becoming friends with some. Also helping customers was great. Management was not the best but they did their best.
good,I don’t have an opinion about this company and I choose not to answer this question. However view someone else opinions may be more useful to you to use .
good,There's a few people here who don't wanna do their jobs and purposely move it over to the next person. There's no clear direction of who's doing what when you come into work because like I said people avoid their jobs. For the pay you can find better jobs without the bs.
good,"I like the people I work with. I'm very lucky to have some really great managers and coworkers."
good,Liked the customers. The computer system is basically good but is hardware has not been updated in years and is showing its age. The constant turnover in pharmacy technicians leads to frequent shortages of help and technicians that are untrained to handle the volume of work required.
good,"In my daily basis at work I learned a lot about customer service, health, medication, deseases, protocols, and the importance of having patients’ medicine on time."
good,"Busy throughout the day, fast pace, team work is a must, time management is probably the hardest part of the job cause you get so many tasks. Workplace culture is great, you meet a ton of people including the customers."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Walgreens! My only regret is that I’m not working there today. There was a fun and friendly atmosphere, and I made fast friends with most of my coworkers."
good,"Walgreens was a good job. It had dependable hours as long as you were considered full time. The benefits weren't the greatest when it came to healthcare, but I did like being to accumulate paid time off."
good,"Walgreens is a decent company. Good culture and values. Excellent training leap program. Typical day at work as a manager you feat with customers complaint, employee, cash handling, merchandise product, work the bay, engaged with team, and occasionally work on resets. Downside, you are required to work all holidays, but will be paid double. During holidays season, nobody is allow to request days off."
good,"Having previously worked for another pharmacy, I was put off by how profitability trumped patient satisfaction as this company (I.e. refusal to order a patient’s preferred brand of  a drug as it was not the one the company had a contract with and therefore meant less profit for the store/company).  I also found that the computer system was FAR more complex than it needs to be and so more time was spent on the computer rather than customer service."
good,"Work can be fun but often times it was inconsistent. My managers were great but once they left the environment instantly shifted. The store is built around who is in charge for sure. I would say that hours there aren't set in stone and they change from week to week, which can easily get annoying. THIS IS A TEMPORARY JOB! Look at it as that and only that."
good,I wouldn't work there again due its environment also die to its lack of help and the amount of stress they put us under. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone but I did stay there because I needed the money for it.
good,It was ok at times. The people in the store is great. The upoer management needs work. They need to het involved with the people who work in the store and not the store managers.
good,"Stock shelves, check out customers, rotate products, pulling expired products, unload truck, photo orders, cleaning shelves and restrooms, doing resets, etc."
good,"The customers were awesome , loved meeting new people everyday and loved seeing the returning customers everyday as well ! They loved me ! My coworkers were cool."
good,"customer service engagement and problem solving, prescription verification and processing, immunization and medication therapy management, consultations."
good,Perfect for what I needed at that time until now. The focus of the company has changed and I need more than what is being offered at this time. Need new experience.
good,fast pace working environment.  The hardest part  about the job is the cosmetic wall reset that only happens once at the beginning of each year. Management was okay.
good,From the moment you start your shift until it is over you are working hard for little money.  The employee discount is great.  I would use Walgreen's as a first job or retirement job but not a career.
good,Solid company but the jobs in management are really tough and have very high expectations with low staff levels. Need to be very detailed and organized to stay on pace here
good,management was very unprofessional working environment unorganized inconsistent felt very pressured all the time lack of training contributed to poor work performance
good,"There's no shortage of work on the retail side of Walgreens. Depending on the schedule, whether you're opening the store or closing for the day, and what you have schedule to do, you can expect to be either busy or occupied far too much. On my end, I saw a rotating schedule where I would come in an hour early to prepare the store or stay up to 45 minutes past closing to prepare for the next day. Typically a shift was 10 hours, but I often stayed well past that. Duties were typical of an Assistant Manager at any retail location."
good,"I liked working there but I worked there as a special ed class group but that not what I want to do, I  wanted to work alone because I didn't wanted people to know that I was special ed."
good,The people you work with is good and the job itself is easy. The only real big down side is that there is no luna Ian y what so ever if you miss a shift for and emergency of any sorts. You’ll get fired your first no call .
good,"this place keeps you busy and certainly on your toes!"
good,"Every year gets a bit tougher on budget cuts; demands to meet metrics stay the same while budget hours are less. On top of typical data review, wellness calls and MTMs are expected of the pharmacist; this can become difficult especially when there are no overlaps between pharmacists. However, completing these calls allows for communication between the clients and pharmacist and can aid in developing strong relationships with cliental. The workplace culture depends more on the team you work with. I've worked in different pharmacies and the culture greatly varies from store to store. The company itself allows for a fair balance between work and home and is open to pharmacists switching shifts if needed, as long as all parties are in agreement."
good,"Walgreens has a long way to go on improving staffing problems, both technicians and pharmacists. Hiring part time pharmacists to work weekends in order to decrease staff and pharmacy manager to work one weekend a month would improve my job satisfaction tremendously. Other companies already do this and Walgreens should follow suit. Also, zero raises for pharmacists in the last theee years needs to change."
good,Been there over 10 years and still feel underpaid $11.68 a hour! Discounts are awesome because company dramatically drops prices then u can use your discount on top of that. Anyways I've been working here part time this long because u can't live with what they pay here! Employees are great until store manager needs supervisors they will promote the laziest employees which sucks. (always behind)
good,Flexible hours to work around your school schedule.  Also a lack of full time. Managers in my location were good. Company itself isn't amazing . Easily move up in position
good,a typical work day that is fast pace and you are required to maintain a certain standard of work ethic. You can not be more than 2 minutes late at any point in time even if you notify them
good,Sometime you just have to find your place . Nobody follows corporate rules . Everyone makes up there own rules and judge you based on so . There is a large work load and not enough employees . A lot of managers  don’t like to train people or tell people the benefits for the company . Me being a leader I always try to train and help the next person advance . They just don’t want to pay someone more money so the less  you know the least they will have to increase your pay by .
good,"I prefer not to say anything at this time but it looks as if I’m going to be forced to say that overall it is a good place to work, especially when it"
good,"Your actual work may vary wildly day to day and depending on what store you work at. At least in my area, your coworkers are very friendly and it's a good work environment. It is retail though, and that means that if you're working full time your hours are likely to change drastically from week to week and it can be hard to make plans outside of work since you don't know for certain what you'll be doing in three weeks. Most store managers have a good grasp on what they're doing and can lead effectively. Benefits are for full time (I believe 35+ hours a week average) employees, but the insurance is actually pretty good. Much better than you're likely to get at a similar retail position. Generally, I would recommend this job if you can handle the hours of full time or as a part-time job."
good,I have work with this company for over 12 years and i just think they do not appreciate us enough. I am a dedicated employee and work very hard but they do not see us like they should.
good,I've been around for a whiles and have noticed a shift in culture and best practices.  Company is re inventing themselves but at the cost of alienating it's core workforce.
good,Working at Walgreens was a great experience for me. It took me at least 6 to 7 years to find a job and once i got this walgreens job i knew then that it would be my home. only left because of relocation. Walgreens very friendly and easy work place. Not too fast and not too slow. Typical day was a good one.
good,"I have been excited about working at Walgreen's since I turned 17 and was able to apply for my first job. I've been familiar with them all my life, and it just seemed like a good place to work, especially for a first job. I thought I could learn a lot working there. So I applied, after achieving my GED. I left high school due to personal family problems, and went on my own to do this. I also took a program through the Salem Vo-Tech at the Community College to prepare me for a job and a career. I want to go to college, but can't at this time due to not being eligible for the financial aid. All I wanted to do was get a job and get started on my goals. I thought Walgreen's would give me this chance. But I received a letter stating I wasn't experienced enough! For what? To be a cashier and help any other way I can? I believe I would be a good asset, as I take pride in everything I do, and I want to learn everything I can. I would be reliable and on-time every day they needed me. But they chose not to give me that opportunity. I don't think this is fair or the signs of a good company that is interested in the young people of their community. I still am interested in working there, because I still think it could be a good place to work, and that I would be a very good employee."
good,"In Walgreens, youre going to expect a lot of work, its true. The shifts its depend on the stores and the manager. Expect working on all hollidays. The pay is average with the industry."
good,"I started off as a cashier, then a DH, and now i’m a pharmacy technician! there’s ups and downs to working at walgreens but they will pay for their employees to move up. Although walgreens is the lowest paying compared to other pharmacy tech jobs"
good,Went from 39 hours a week to around 12. Hours are constantly cut by the company. There’s no discipline. Don’t always seem to care about how employees are doing and what they need.
good,"A typical day at work is filling prescriptions, patient counseling, QA, etc. Unfortunately you won’t have the time to provide consultation to patient as it should. Everything is in a rush!! rush! Quick quick! "
good,It is a good place to work. Schedule is all over the place. If you are new its hard to get a weekend off. Management was ok. Would like to change a lot of things that happen at Walgreens.
good,"Got along with almost every team member"
good,i like where i work because i like the people i work with. that really helps having people there with you all day that you can relate to and get along with. it helps the day go by.
good,It was awesome in the beginning but as time went on they cut my hours drastically. But the management is very felixable very nice people work there but just not enough hours
good,"Corporate management communication with store management not the best, very high employee turn over. It is very hard to get yearly raises in our area."
good,If you’re straight out of high school this is the job for you. You don’t get paid much and hours are scarce. I liked my management team and most people that I worked with. There’s just not enough hours and pay to go around. I would’ve stayed if there was room in my particular store for advancement.
good,Continuing education is possible. Hours are flexible depending on number of hours given. Nice co-workers. Team environment and great opportunity to make lateral move to other stores.
good,"the work atmosphere in store was always pretty relaxed, but management does expect you to earn your keep. You're always busy, and there's always something that need to be worked on. As long as you're able to learn fast, and keep pace, it's a good job."
good,"Walgreens will work with college students. But, hours are no longer stable, as they used to be. Career advancement is a no go, if you're good in your position. They'll find reasons to keep you there, because you help them advance. Favoritism, is rampant. They offer benefits for full time employees. They don't like to give breaks, no matter how long your shift was/is. They are not the worst, but are no longer one of the best."
good,customer service is very important by working with the public everydayi have learned how to give customers the best service so that i can to ensure that they will return because of the great service
good,"Inflexable shifts made it awkward to handle around school, but school was still manageable. Pay was not so great compared to other part time jobs. Overall, you work for more than you earn. I am biased however because my location is not very great."
good,"i worked an 8 hour day, 5 days per week. i ran a cash register, greeted customers. helped them locate products. i would order the cosmetic department once per week, receive the warehouse truck, put away the products. i did displays, resets,price changes.management changed often, so communication was poor.i enjoyed my co-workers and got along with everyone. i did not receive a lot of help with every day tasks. i did love my customers and got a lot of satisfaction in helping them."
good,"It always seems like we are short handed, and corporate keeps cutting our hours. We don't feel appreciated for our hard work; when corporate comes in they always have something to complain about."
good,"Although the area made it a hard place to work, with good employees it was fun. I feel the strength of the employees and their positive attitude had to do with some of the management. It’s a place anyone could work, but not everyone would want to."
good,It was a decent job in and after high school but not a job that could lead into a stable career. Work was boring and often we ran out of things to do since the store was very slow in the evenings. I would recommend it for a first job.
good,"Anyone could do this job, it’s the easiest job ever. It can be boring and repetitive and it’s not a job where you necessarily have fun in unless you like ur coworkers/managers. It pays the bills if ur only in high school or college. I’ve mostly worked the closing shift and I feel that we deserve more pay because we do a lot more tasks closing before getting to leave that openers or mid-day shifts don’t."
good,Over achieved expectations required. Work well as a team ability to lead on very important projects. Has a Great relationship with the customers he goes over and beyond the call of duty if needed. He open several stores  in the Mississippi area very professional and Excellent in Troubleshooting
good,"Each store is its own world, can be fun and exciting. Depends entirely on location and management."
good,"nothing special it was a very easy job for a college student, too busy and not enough employees though with minimum help from the upper management at any location."
good,"I love helping customers. I loved when we were busy the most, but I also loved stocking shelves. The people were great, coworkers and customers. Everyone I worked with was friendly."
good,Walgreens is a fast paced (at times) working environment where detail has to be paid attention to.  It heavily relies of customer service to drive it's purpose.
good,my store was not in the best area so relearning how to best interact with customers was a challenge in a new environment. management was never on the floor but were accessible when needed.
good,Walgreens central services is pretty casual place to work. Unfortunately they do make certain decisions that are not in the best interest of their current employees. There is no quick advancement unless you have prior experience. The pay is on the low end compared to other companies.
good,"I was supposed to work 2 days a week but was called in almost everyday. There were employees that just decided to not show up. Also, the cashiers are more than cashiers but are not paid accordingly. I was also given work with no explanation of how to do it, or what all needed to be done. I don't think it is any one particular persons fault, the system is just a mess. There was little communication about breaks or anything at all."
good,Walgreens is taking away from team members and customers while raising the level of expectations and accountabilities. They ask a lot from the teams in the stores without compensating appropriately
good,"When I started at Walgreens, it was a great place to work.  I learned a lot from management and co-workers regarding sales, customer service, floor planning, product, receiving, and supervision .  It has been a great working environment.  However, with the change from a ""family-oriented"" to ""corporate"" structure, the uniqueness of working here is dissipating.  I'm saddened to say the atmosphere at the corporate level has unfortunately disillusioned and discouraged the management and employees at the store level.  As much as I like working with my co-workers and customers, I feel it is time to move on to a company that takes care of their employees better.  My belief is that employees are most loyal to their workplace when they feel the company is productive ""taking care"" of them."
good,Walgreens is a good place to work it can get difficult at time not having the right management and coworkers not getting along but other than that company is good to work for.
good,I learned a lot about customer service and how important positive and negative feedback is to better team members and to better the company as a while
good,"A typical day at work is spent doing many tasks between processing photo orders, stocking, unloading deliveries,helping customers, and office paperwork. At walgreens I learned to enhance my social skills as well as manage a team. The hardest part about the job is handling situations involving unhappy customers for various reasons on any given day. The most enjoyable part of the job is fulfilling a customers needs and helping them leave happily as a customer."
good,"Walgreens offers good benefits, it’s easy work, flexible hours (don’t apply if you want a 9-5 M-F) but as roles are being cut, employees are stressed."
good,"I recommend taking an internship here while in school. It really prepared me for working retail. It will also let you know if you really need to be working retail. I enjoyed my internship. The pay was good, but the experience on the working world is where it’s at."
good,"They are need of more employees. I feel the full time people have to work extra harder since we don't have enough employees on the sales floor and registers. Instead of us having us work really long hours such as 8 in half hour shifts, they could cut in down to 7 and half hour or eight hour shifts. They could also give us every other weekend off or once a month so we can have a better work life balance and some time off to be with our families and friends. They could be better at giving raises when it comes to performance reviews. They should consider how hard a person works through their attendance and performance and not base everything from a survey because those are based on opinions and not facts and customers and managers don't really get the full protrayal of how hard  their employees work for them. They should take the time to recognize their employees more by giving them  merit increases or raises for an outstanding job performance in their reviews and more Customer Service awards or Employee of the Month awards for their Top-Performing employees."
good,My work day started with making my area was clean and my register was accurate. I was an employee that made everyone laugh and smile. Management is ok
good,I enjoyed getting the training with walgreens. but left this position after becoming assitant manager. customer assalted me over medicaiton. and just needed a change of pace
good,"At least from my experience i learned a lot but that was because my pharmacist/boss was amazing & taught me a lot which helped me into my lpn licensing. Experience with talking to doctors and other health professionals. I would recommend this job for anyone who needs a flexible schedule, the staff became my family. Thing i didn’t like was one bad customer survey would haunt us & have management from the front store on us."
good,"My areas of accountability are identical to that of a manager. A typical day would include organizing the people in my crew do what needs to be accomplished as well as getting myself started on the order of the day."
good,"The job is service oreinted that requires alot of stocking. I learned customer service skills, management skills and prioritization skills. Management is lenient. The culture depends on the store management. Hardest part of the job is being on your feet the entire shift. Most enjoyable part of the job is that you get to do different tasks throughout the day."
good,"Need to offer better wages for longtime employees, considering we have the knowledge and train new hires, even ones hired off the streets in higher positions with ZERO knowledge."
good,Walgreens is a great gateway into the professional world. I learned a lot of skills working there that i could use later in life. The biggest problem i had was the lack of communication between managers and employees.
good,"Never know what you are walking into when you go through the door.  Culture does not support team mentality.  Poor engagement with employees, supervisors are rarely seen on the floor."
good,The job was adequate for being part time. The hours I had allowed me to work and go to school at the same time. I accomplished my goals of saving money for college while I was there and enjoyed my time.
good,"Over all wasn’t too bad. Just some of the people that worked there look so miserable it was crazy. Very bad vibes. People seemed cool, just a little too emo for me"
good,"Greeting Customers and providing Extraordinary Customer Service is number one. Daily tasks, relieving cashier for her break and lunch there is always something that needs to be done. My regular customers were the most enjoyable part of my day. The hardest part of the day was making the time to finish your computer training when it was overdue, due to  not enough staff."
good,"The location that I worked at was super busy, all the time. The whole job was non-stop interruptions. It took forever to complete a task because it was always getting interrupted by something that was higher priority. Extremely frustrating."
good,The company does good as a whole to get the customer service revenue up. It tries to create the best possible place for customer service but sometimes the requests they have the technicians do is out of our hands and it creates a more stressful environment than it already is.
good,Employment at Walgreen's was short.  Walgreen's did improve my Customer Service Skills during short employment. typical day extremely busy.  Work culture great.
good,"Flexible work schedule,"
good,If it was not a job of mostly stocking the shelves and cleaning up after customers it would be an ok job to have. It is not a job for people who like to work hard 100% of the time. It takes a toll on your body.
good,"would stock shelves, help customers find needed products, work both in the beauty and photo departments. great first job and great way to get skills in customer service"
good,"It's a great place to work, can get very hectic around the holidays. The atmosphere is great and it is a easy job. You always stay busy so you don't have to worry about being bored. The management team is great they are willing to work with you on certain things as long as the line of communication is left open."
good,Fix Prince I had to Walgreens was only an internship I did not have much to gain The full experience of employment because the site not have an available position. Coworkers was very helpful and kind
good,"A little over min. wage and no advancement from employees there for over 12 years, not for me. I enjoyed the work but they ask a lot with certifications for the pharmacy and they just don't compensate  for the work."
good,"At my location, everyone I work with is very friendly. If you need help or didn't get a task done, a coworker or manager don't hesitate to help you get it done. It's really nice how they care a lot about taking care of the customer and are very focused on customer service."
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work for students, not really flexible for full time employees.   Does offer opportunists for advancement but not very often."
good,"Take Care Health Clinic was a rather large organization that mostly had policy for everything, but that did not necessarily meet the employees need or situation"
good,"I enjoyed working with Walgreens, both in Louisiana and Wisconsin.  They seemed to care about their employees.  The work atmosphere was somewhat stressful, due to workload, but still relatively professional.  More so in Wisconsin, than Louisiana.  The store manager in Beloit was very supportive of Pharmacy staff. As with many work situations the manager made the difference."
good,Walgreens is a good mid level place for marketing -- new org changes will provide more opportunity. MBA nit required so it is a good place to build your career.
good,"In a typical day at work I learned quite a bit. I would spend about half of my day in the drive through interacting with patients, and the other half of my shift filling prescriptions and assisting the pharmacist. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with all of the information and constantly learning, because there was so much to learn. The best part was also that there was so much to learn and it was fun learning new skills and practices."
good,"Walgreen's is a nationally recognized pharmacy chain that takes pride in its many pharmacies and health products. A typical day consist of the usual work required for storefront work: cleaning the entrance, sweeping, dusting, restocking, and customer assistance. The only issues i had with Walgreen's is the risk of criminal activity such as potential robberies, potential customer outbursts and potential shootings. Overall i think anxiety got the best of me but its gonna be like that with other small stores."
good,i think they could treat their employees a little better. they should payment all member of management a little mire. we do more than what they pay us for
good,Didn’t enjoy working here. Very boring. And didn’t fit my personality. Management wasn’t bad and neither were my coworkers. Just very quiet setting and slow.
good,"So, it's a hard job because you get yelled at all the time.  Just dealing with customers in general it's ""your fault"" their prescription isn't completed on time.  But, if you are good with people and can be understanding and have bed side manners, you will be fine. "
good,"It was a very calm place to work it, some days were pretty slow. The employees were well respected as much as the superiors. It did have it days where some customers were pretty rude but of course the manager would handle with no problem"
good,"It was exciting,fun, learned alot."
good,It's a decent company to work for honestly.  You just have to decide whether you want people who are senior to you to try and take advantage of your lower position or not.  Different areas of the store have different cultures.  It's not for everyone but it's not awful.
good,"Security has attitude problem. Pickers were expected to do a lot, workers would get carpal tunnel. I felt pain too so I slowed down a tiny bit  so I wouldn't hurt myself."
good,"Walgreens is a pretty good store . Customers get outstanding service and they offer a wide variety of products, accessories, and services. They even print photos"
good,"A typical day would consist of ringing out customers, and facing and stocking shelves. The hardest part of the job was the learning curve of finding out where everything was and having to deal with certain customers."
good,A typical day at Walgreens consists of multi-tasking to the nth degree.  Budget cuts decrease technician help but more and more tasks are piled upon the pharmacist. Exceptional customer service is required but again budget constraints make this a catch 22.
good,Walgreens was a good place to work had good people to wor with. The hardest and the enjoyable part of working at Walgreens was working with the public.
good,"The job is what you make it.  Based on your location and the culture of your store, is what will determine your success and happiness at Walgreens.  As an ASM, you could be moved frequently, at any time, for no reason, with no advance notice, regardless of your home location.  There is room for growth and career advancement, but it is worth noting company politics; will always be a factor."
good,It was an alright work place. They like to hire from outside instead of promote from within. If they don't like you they will make your life tough before they make something up to fire you.
good,"A typical work day includes working in your assigned department (i.e. Photo, Cosmetics, Designated Hitter, Cashier etc.,). Everyone (except the cashier in some circumstances) usually works on some project, like ad sets/tags, out-of-date items, stocking/totes. Most days are slow, in my opinion, and the frenzy picks up after 5p and weekends. The store I worked at had severe problems with continuously berating and calling you to come in to work on assigned days off, which was due to employees calling out the day of or the scheduling manager (aka the ASM) making egregious errors during the creation of the schedule. On average, I was called into work 4/7 days per week and I worked the other 3 days..."
good,"The work is very  mundane but the paycheck can be very rewarding. Depending on the store you work in, you can either have managers who are okay with you talking with your co-workers. Other managers expect you to work not talk and just get the job done."
good,"Walgreens is great place to work, unfortunately it depends on which team you are on. Some teams are great and others are messy and unproductive. Walgreens is also a place where a lot of people know each other and they would sometimes open a position and have people applying knowing that they are going to hire a girl someone they know recommended. Management will be on your side only if they know you from the stores or if a colleague knows you.I could go on and on but I do not have that much time."
good,Walgreens is a good place to work at the costumers are friendly and the discounts and sales are amazing benefits are good and they work with your with your
good,Most days when i go into walgreens I am greeted by the store manager if he is in. I have different duties everyday ranging from handling customer orders and stocking to managing inventory of my assigned areas of the store. The challenging days are when there is a large work load and there are a lot of photo orders come in either from the internet or from our kiosks in store. trying to balance between helping customers and getting my work finished doesn't always happen but the customer usually leaves happy.
good,They take to many extra benefits from employees. It was hard some days to go to work and wonder how the security would be like. Typical days always had a work list.
good,"I have been here three years and it’s a decent place to work if you’re just starting your working career, but overall, it’s not the ideal place to work if you don’t like repetitive work days and if you’re not okay with how the company gsbfkes things with its employees"
good,I liked working for Walgreen's. The company offers many good benefits and the customers are cool. i enjoyed my time there and i would recommend working there to anyone.
good,"The job requires you to move around the store a lot. Don't expect just to be behind one counter all day. If you're in the photo department that means you're also the stocker, the janitor, and break filler."
good,"this job is helpful developing customer service."
good,"Walgreens is the type of place that needs fast paced workers.  Depending on the amount of prescriptions you receive, you will need to work effectively with your team to ensure the prescriptions get done in a timely manner."
good,I expected the career growth to be a bit more fast paced as well as the ability to get raises. However this was not the case yet I still have Walgreens a chance. In the end I was not earning enough for my cost of living so I put in my two weeks notice and found another career.
good,I moved up very fast at walgreens and I enjoyed what I did. I learned very fast and spent a lot of time trying to improve everything that I did.  I left because I took a better job that worked better with my school.
good,Walgreens is a good company to work for and is easy to move up in if you desire such a thing. I have found that it is difficult to work at if you have restricted hours or if you have kids/other responsibilities.
good,My store had a great team and was well managed.  However the company as a whole continues to take away benefits as well as raise the starting pay while giving existing employees nothing.
good,"It can be stressful and very fast paced sometimes definitely have to multi-task Have to hang tags every weekend and work every holiday "
good,You had to be very flexible and willing to learn new things to operate throughout the store. There are multiple job opportunities but in a hectic work environment.
good,I do not believe this company pays its employees for the work expected by managers. It should be determined on an individual basis and totally on the performance of the employee.
good,Not enough hours or people to accomplish the lofty goals of the company. Did have the opportunity to get pharmacy certified and the company paid for it.
good,Typical manager duties. Open or close the store. Deal with customers. Close one night and open the next morning was never fun. Employees were nice and made the day more fun especially if everyone is working together and on the same page. Never had any issues with the Store Managers Ive worked with.
good,This experience not only help me grow In the retail business but also help build my customer service skills. Not only getting the experience in retail but learning to assist customers in the right manner.
good,you have to work there to see
good,if you are leaving from high school or just retire from a long career then this is the place to work slow and laid back. if have a busy day and want to work a few a hours
good,I like helping people and Walgreens enabled me to do that. Employee discount was nice. Plus the earned points that can be used as cash are nice as well. Flexible schedule if your not in mgmt.  They recently restructured their mgmt ranks. Cutting many asst. mgr positions for lower paying shift lead positions. Hurt a lot of good people.
good,"The days are long there is never enough hours, management plays favorites, i would not recommend this company to any one who is serious about there career."
good,Room for growth is difficult. Rate of pay is insufficient for the Tampa Bay area. Flexible hours. Extremely fast-paced. Errors can lead to termination. Would recommend as a first-time job. Would not recommend for long-term.
good,"When weather permitted we would have cookouts for out lunch breaks.  I worked in the IV room full time, great communications tools such as electronic board set up in the IV room to allow me status information on clients."
good,"This place is a great place to work at, but will write you up for nothing. Treated one unfair. I loved how it was fast pace work environment, yet they will get after you for doing good."
good,"I learned how to develop film.  That was very enjoyable.  I learned how to work on an old gretag photo developing machine"
good,They need to work harder to make employees feel  they have an opportunity for advancement. They do offer a flexible schedule but the pay is not competitive and you get penalized if you change stores by being dropped down in salary.
good,"It is a very relaxed place to work, time moves slow and alot of time is spent talking or stocking shelves. There is not a whole lot of work to be done. Very easy but very boring."
good,"Overall I enjoyed my tenure at Walgreens."
good,"The employees I worked with were great. Management could be better. I feel that the employees could use more recognition and appreciation. Overall, Walgreens is a great company to work. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help people"
good,Walgreens is a great place to work! The customers are very nice and friendly. But Walgreens also have a lot of theft. You not aloud to touch or run behind any customers.
good,"One thing I can say about Walgreens is that they will pay more than minimum wage and they do give raises. It might be 25 cents an hour, but a raise is a raise. You get plenty of opportunities to earn more money on your check by selling certain items. Scheduling is generally flexible (as most retail jobs are). They give great employee discounts which apply even on sale and clearance items. BUT! It's retail. Management will NOT back you up with customers. That, in itself, is the great bane of retail."
good,Hours were not promsied .Management was easy to talk to for the most part. It was easier to get days of or go back to school beacuse they worked around your schedule.
good,"hard to find hours right now which is the reason employees have to look elsewhere. otherwise great company, great people, great technicians, easy system"
good,Continuous changes within the company. May be considered positive. Not enough time to adjust to major changes. Lots of expectations.  Must be flexible.
good,"Hit the floor running and do not stop, Pharmacy was really not a fun place to work in. Just never seemed like I could catch up with all the stuff that's needed to do everyday and still make the customer happy and fell right."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working closely with customers and the entire store team.  It was a family environment that led to great results and team engagement.
good,"I was made to work at all positions in the warehouse. My health was being affected. After I was trained to drive a lift truck, I was no longer guaranteed a job once I was unable to drive it. They trained me, and then forced me out. In 2 years, I worked for four managers, each with very different styles. Fellow workers were friendly, but management encouraged their political beliefs onto us. I was insulted that my vote was something they wanted."
good,I enjoyed working with my team members. But the biggest joy was the Customers over 8 years you get to know there day to day shoping habits and there ups and downs . Always trying to save them that time by havi g the items ready for them .
good,"As with many larger corporations, it seemed that those in high positions were so far removed from reality that the procedures were unrealistic and illogical."
good,"I enjoy what I do, just not with all of the  pressure of meeting numbers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with management who do not understand what your job entails everyday."
good,I began my pharmacy technician career thanks to Walgreens' training program.  Retail pay is low in general so turnover is high.  Workload is high depending on the location.
good,"Your work environment can vary greatly depending on what store you work at or if you work at the district/corporate offices. There is opportunity for advancement on the store side, but not much on the pharmacy side as there are only technician/senior technician and pharmacist/pharmacy manager positions. There are a lot of corporate initiatives that you have to deal with that usually don't seem to get much accomplished. Relative to other retailers it is an okay place to work but definitely not great."
good,Honestly it depends on what shift you have and who is there cause it is like any other retail which is ring people products up and sell them. The only time it becomes different is the crew you currently have on shift.
good,The company itself has a good mission and intentions. But I've found that the employees can be very two-faced with each other and create cliques within the company.
good,"Walgreens is not the worst place in the world to work, but the current starting pay is only $9 an hour. I would only recommend this company to a high school student who needs a part-time job. The pay is simply not enough to pay rent and bills."
good,"- Long hours turn into long days, and into long weeks."
good,"Management does not follow thru on encouraging a new employee to finish Pharm Tech University. Expect's new employees to know all aspects of the pharmacy, and when you make a mistake, yells at you for not knowing it. No time given to work on the PTU.  Pharmacy manager is great, but weak on communication between employees. Raise is promised after 6 months, but have been there 9 months and no raise. Other pharmacist is bullying, yells at you in front of co-workers and customers."
good,It's retail so the managers won't back you up if they feel it will cost them a sale. But overall it's not the worst job. You do get some benefits.Health insurance and dental and vision. The job can get predictable. It is unlikely you will move up as a CSA it is better to work back in the pharmacy where you have more opportunities.
good,"Very flexible and a great place to start off with.  If you have no connections whatsoever. Walgreens will help boost you that.  I became a Senior Pharmacy Technician within year and a half.  I learned to find quicker solutions because it is a repetitive process.  "
good,"Walgreen's does not pay their technicians well and the job is frustrating, but the people I worked with are the only reason that I stayed as long as I did."
good,It is a great place to work with great customers as well as employees it does have some issues here and there with management but over all a good company
good,"Cooperation and engagement for problem solving are usually required on an average workday. I've learned about a lot of OTC products and pharmaceuticals. Effectiveness for management can improve, however, the culture of the business is still maintained. Working with a team can be the hardest, but the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Typical day at work: Data entry review, DUR's, resolve third party claims, contact prescribers for clarifications and drug interactions, perform consultations on prescription and otc drugs, complete call lists for patients new to therapy and refill reminders, review and formulate plan to resolve drug shortage issues, do all of the above in a timely manner and adhere to federal and state regulations. "
good,A typical day was me not knowing or unable to do something like sell alcohol because of my age and it either took forever for me to find someone who could help or it never actually happened.
good,"Its a very physical job, people come into walgreens thinking it's going to be easy, it's not.  Just show up and do your job, it's a small crew of people so when people call out for silly reasons, it makes for a bad shift"
good,"Anyone that tells you that Wallgreens is a fantastic company to start a career in is over exaggerating. "
good,Since I worked the graveyard shift I only got to work with a couple other people but they were great people regardless. My managers were very understanding about my situation.
good,"productive fun place to work very busy location Iike working withe customers and the photography lab which is new to me, I have great teachers asnd managers are very understanding."
good,Walgreens was a great company for growth. Pay was not the vary best and the hours included a lot of lebor. I would recommend the company granted pay was better.
good,"it was nice, very stressful though night shift is easier than the day shift that's for sure. also the bin thing where we keep prescriptions is very unconventional. but everyone was cool it was definitely a learning experience."
good,"My favorite thing about Walgreen were the customers because they were usually nice people. Day in and day out, the customers kept me going to work with a smile."
good,expect too much from 3 employees on the clock at one time. Unreachable goals as well as huge budget cuts make working at Walgreen's a struggle. Not a very good place to work
good,"The job is nice in the fact that you don’t have to work in a hot or greasy environment. However, the store was not willing to accommodate my schedule with school. They would not offer a shorter shift (say 4-5 hours). I was expected to work a full 8 hour shift after a full day at school, which leaves no time for homework or even an hour of leisure. At my initial hiring interview, I was told that everyone has to work some weekends. However, “some” weekends quickly turned into “all” weekends. Also, being one of the few reliable employees turned out to be a curse because I would get scheduled more and called in more. The managers will also not stand behind you when it comes to upset customers. They tend to give them what they want, which only seems to encourage them to cause more issues in the future. This is a great job if you’re looking to put in the hours, but I would not recommend it to someone who is working on building an education as the store’s schedule is typically not flexible enough."
good,"Multiple tasks given on a daily basis, always running around during the winter time, great store manager makes a big difference in the store. But once summer hits the budget is cut in half for hours so many people leave, still just as busy with not enough staff members. Between pharmacy, photo, sales floor with only 3-4 people on the sales floor between the day and closing shift is nothing given the amount of tasks to get done and to provide great customer service."
good,"Plenty of hours for efficient employees and opportunity to learn new skills, but not enough pay increase for new responsibilities. Most unpleasant part was dealing with violent customers and homeless problem."
good,Competitive workplace to receive customer service experience. There's always work to be done but no room for advancing in any department. The employees were friendly and helpful and the management team was knowledgeable and willing to help.
good,"The job consisted of many of the same tasks, which can become boring. The work is straight forward and not hard to accomplish. It is a partially self managed company."
good,"Great pharmacy manager and good coworkers."
good,"Pay is good, as well as stock options and benefits. No complaints about that. The people I work with in the pharmacy are the best coworkers I’ve ever had. The downside of Walgreens is that it is super corporate. They set goals and numbers for pharmacists to achieve that really put stress on the job. Instead of spending time with a patient, you’re constantly worrying about meeting those marks so you rush and you multi task until your brain hurts."
good,The job was a good starting point to a career. They have made major changes that have brought in lower level managers that will take the jobs of higher paid staff. Once the last Walgreens family member left they cut employee benefits. Would not go back.
good,"had many task worked pharmacy ,ordered product ,photo dept ,balancing 12 drawers in the store ,janitor,security guard ,merchandising this is all I have ."
good,"It was a paycheck plain and simple."
good,"This was my foundation. Fun atmosphere and there was a strong likelihood to make friends there. I loved Walgreens except for the pay. Stress free typing environment, management was balanced, and festive and welcoming work environment."
good,I don't get a break or a lunch. Communication with management and Pharmacy staff is lacking. They claim they have an open door policy with no retaliation. This has proven to be not true.
good,"Expect to constantly be moving, lifting or organizing product."
good,walgreens is probably one of the best companies that i have worked for in many directions. It cares about patients alot and that is why I like this company.
good,Constantly growing company.  Has changed drastically culturally in the time I have worked there and has been challenging keeping up with some of the changes.
good,"My time working at Walgreens while working as a full-time student was difficult. They were very strict in terms of hours. Other than that, the management was okay, and fellow coworkers were never hard to work with."
good,"I loved walgreens when I was part time, but as a full time place to work, I would not recommend it. The pay does not match the work that I put out, and I find myself doing more work than others. The hours are not great, and I don't have a set schedule. My boss is wonderful however. Management was never really the problem it's just a good ""in between"" job."
good,"The hardest part of the job for me was dealing with the unstable hours that changed weekly, along with the rude customers that don't understand the red tape, and the constant expectation to be the best for the least amount of pay. Other than that I liked filling prescriptions, talking to doctor offices and typing in prescriptions."
good,"Worked at walgreens part time for two years. Good pay, great co workers and managers are very helpful, Taking feedback seriously and working on improving department."
good,"It's retail, and has all the issues one expects from that job. However, every week they ask for more work while allowing less time and payroll hours to get it done. A company that sees the writing on the walls that they're going to consistently lose more and more market share to Online retail."
good,"I loved working for Walgreens. That place was like home to me. My biggest complaint was when I moved back into the pharmacy, I never had steady hours. They were constantly changing. It destroyed my sleep pattern, worsened my health that was already on a decline, and some of my coworkers were hard to work with due to bad attitudes."
good,The co workers and management is great. The big ones are the hard ones to please. They expect too much and are very strict. It's a good starting pharmacy job.
good,"this is walgreens and it is a stressful environment, your enjoyment here greatly depends on the town you work in and the particular store you end up working at."
good,"Working at walgreens is the same as working at your typical cubicle-filled office building, with the pressures of upper management and the dress code everyone has to follow. But it has a twist: your work isn't office based, it's customer service based."
good,Productive and fun workplace.. and people is great.i enjoy working with people.special helping seniors and have discounts on Tuesday ones a month..I think is a great job to be.😎
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the relationship between customers experiences and employee. Creating new ways to engage customers and employees.
good,We actually had an amazing manager ..wish the rest of the company ( corporate) was a nice as him..if you wanna work for a company that doesn't care about there employees this is the place you should go too
good,Loved the regular customers and being able to help people with their prescriptions.  Could have done without understaffed stores due to limited budgets.
good,"I found great satisfaction in working as a pharmacy technician. I take pride in assuring that my patients receive the medications they need and are treated with care and respect. I also enjoyed the organizational aspect of the job, putting away daily orders and maintaining inventory. However, the fact the Walgreens is a retail store housing a pharmacy affects the expectations and execution of operations in a way that I think could be improved upon. You find yourself directed by typical corporate expectations under managers who have (or appear to have) very little leverage when it comes to adjusting these general expectations on a store-by-store basis. As a result, turnover is high and the number of skilled employees who contribute to a smooth work experience is minimal. I have had good personal experiences with the people I work with day-to-day, but the environment is generally pretty stressful. It is a great starting point for people interested in becoming certified technicians, as Walgreens holds PTCB certification classes and will reimburse you for your state licensure and national certification. I was able to become a Senior Certified PT within 6 months of starting as a trainee."
good,As a customer service representative at the front end of the store greeting customers is the most boringness job ever. You won’t be able to do anything if you have no customers to ring up.
good,This was my first job and was very easy. Very rarely was the store busy. The worst part is Walgreens is open every day of the year so you have to work some holidays. After about a year it honestly just gets boring.
good,This started as a part-time job. It was an average retail job. Most of the co-workers were easy to get along with. The job was easy but it was sometime difficult to get everything done due to short staffing.
good,"This job is not stop, you often times don't get beaks to even use the restroom customer can be just awful.  Dealing with drug addicts always trying to fill the scripts early is frustrating. There is little communication form corporate and we typically find out about programs after customer."
good,"Retail pharmacy is the collision of healthcare and the retail environment.  It's tough, but rewarding.  Great to take care of patients and you are paid very well to do it.  Plan on having difficulty taking time off as it is limited.  Good, strong company, you'll always have a job."
good,"Not good unless you are in management.  But once you are management, you are stuck between corporate agendas and employee well beings.  Depending on the store location and budget hours, experience will vary.  I worked at a location with over 60k sales a day, imagine that customer counts and workflow with limited budget hours."
good,"I worked at Walgreens for a few years, I enjoyed it until they switched store managers. The manager who is there now is rude, arrogant and doesn't care about her staff or customers at all. She does nothing but sit in the office on the phone and eat all day. We would get reprimanded for everything, which makes for a stressful work environment. This store manager needs to be fired or replaced. Also Walgreens is cutting hours and closing stores constantly, so you don't exactly feel safe."
good,The most part of the day as a senior tech requires dealing with insurance problems and taking care of inventory. Time management and being very efficient is essential to making sure that all the work is done correctly and quickly. There is usually very little down time and things must be done correctly initially so that there is no delay. I learned how to become efficient and be able to multitask. It's very important be able to stay ahead of everything when possible
good,I worked at Walgreens for a summer internship program.  It was fast paced so I didn't really learn alot.  It was a good experience.  I would not go back
good,"I would recommend Walgreens to anyone it is a good fast paced job lots of interaction with customers and get to learn alot of new things , great way to learn for a career"
good,I worked the shift of 3pm till 11pm. I greeted every customer coming in and leaving. I answered the phone and directed the calls according to the department. Stocked tobacco products. Cleaned and zoned. Was uncomfortable when the store manager would squeeze in behind me at register to brush up against me.
good,Everyone at Walgreens tries to work as a team which can be good or bad depending on the people who work there. I believe they are a great company to work for and gave me the experienced I needed to advance into a more robust career.
good,"Working at walgreens was a great experience to get your foot in the door for a career, but the low wage for the job the technitions are doing is unfair and does not support a decent living."
good,"As a service manager , working mostly with customers , helping the store manager run most of the tasks. Management is good but the pay are kind of low."
good,"I loved the vibe from my coworkers, who were wonderful. I enjoyed every minute of dealing with customers, even the rude ones. I mean come-on we all know we use them as funny stories we tell at the bar. My only problem was the management. I suffered with quite a bit, more than i think is fair for any person. I was yelled at over the intercom, because i was cleaning the restroom. Customers were in the store. Then I was yelled at from the backroom so loudly that customers and my coworker at the front counter could hear every word that was said. And its no short distance. That was entirely too much. My manager's approach to handing the situation left a lot to be desired. I was made to verbally confront said person in front of people. As you can imagine it only made it worse. I was hung up on and mistreated continuously and very randomly in front of customers. I'm to the point of believing that this person had a mental thing, like bipolar disorder. However, this was someone who managed shifts when the store manager was not in, they should hold themselves with more dignity and restraint than that. I was an easy target with my happy-go-lucky, everything will work out vibe. I didn't let things stress me out. And Walgreen's was unfortunately a very stressful place to work. I think because I apeared to not be taking things seriously this person would just lose control of their temper. My manager actually looked me eye and told me one time that I shouldn't take them behaving with so much hostility personally because he stresses out the shift leads every single day, on purpose no less."
good,"It really depends on the store.  If you go to a nice store then you will like it but if you go to a bad one then you'll hate it.  Like I said, it really only is good as a temporary job because advancing sucks."
good,it was a great place to work until you get new management. they decide to jump head first in to cold water when they should of went toe first and worked there way in.
good,"Walgreens provides great benefits and opportunity for career advancement. However being a mother and working for them isn't the greatest situation. Managers are required to work late shifts, weekends, and no consistent days off. The only time you can have decent days off is if you actually request it off."
good,"team members work well together. offers chance to learn multiple dept. with on site cafe,. good pay and beanfeasts and has a good chance of overtime opportunists."
good,Very stressful. Must be able to do several things at once and not get upset. Some Pharmacists are not as professional as others and are often not easy to work with on a daily basis.
good,"Walgreens is constantly investing in better tools and programs to help team members grow their talents, perform to their potential, and succeed in reaching their career goals."
good,"You do so much work and get paid so little. You aren't allowed overtime, yet you are expected to get everything done by a specific time. It's stressful."
good,I would describe a typical day at work as smooth. I would help with controlling the business flow of the store or stock. I learned how to cooperate with customers of different ethnicities. The management team could've been better. The job culture is very friendly. The hardest part of the job is having to pick up the slack for others. I worked with a staff with very few male employees. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the creative ideas the staff would create for the holidays.
good,"In the beginning of my years at Walgreen's things were great. It was a  nice learning experience. I went from being a very shy introvert to a happy medium introvert/extrovert. By far  my favorite thing was meeting new people and engaging. "
good,"If you decide to do over night then you have to worry about if you can advance to a different position, if you wanted pharmacy then it’s best not to do the graveyard shift"
good,Everyone gets along with each other. Never hesitate to ask questions if you need help. Very calm and collective environment to work at. Customers are awesome.
good,"The hours were flexible, the manager was nice, I learned how to work a cash register, the turnover rate is rather high, there is usually new people being hired regularly since people leave"
good,Walgreens wasn't a terrible place to work. I think its nice if you are in school or willing to wait for an opening to move up with the company.  The pay wasn't the greatest especially for what i was doing. The hours were flexible. however working holidays was difficult.
good,"The supervisors are always there to help you if you ever need it, the company can get a bit extra when it comes to work attire, and to get PTO is one of the hardest things I've ever seen to get in a job wow, not good at all. but other then that great company to work for and great benefits."
good,"got a lot of skills, passed a lot of tests,  the team in the pharmacy is really great,  the hard part of the job is doing  a few tasks at the same moment."
good,"Almost always Short staffed AND Unorganized"
good,Great first job for a teenager. Also a good summer job or part time job for students and young adults. Pay could be better for the work load. Job you can always fall back on or transfer if need be.
good,"A typical day in my position requires working the register and stocking the shelves from time to time. I learned how to take calls, provide customer service, and how to make orders. The management was good and friendly. The culture in the workplace was great and warm. A lot of diversity and a great understanding between the staff. The hardest part of the job was working during the holiday season because we had a small staff. The most enjoyable part was meeting customers that come from afar."
good,i was able to move up from a customer service associate to be in the pharmacy. the hours were long and the pharmacist were snappy a lot but i was able to learn a lot from them and im grateful for the experience i received.
good,"usually fairly busy"
good,"Working at Walgreen's I learned about the pharmacy, broadening my retail knowledge and capabilities. Unfortunately it was very slow paced and uneventful. I enjoyed working on the floor and interacting with customers, solving their issues and giving them the best shopping experience they could have. My store was understaffed with our management team so it became slightly stressful at times. My store manager was not personable and often inappropriate and unprofessional in how she interacted with other employees."
good,It’s a challenging career. Very stressful at times. It can be unfair at times. But you meet a lot of great people and work with some good people as well.
good,"I was able to learn various jobs at Walgreens, defintly not enough staff, Pharmacy horrible, never enough help, atmosphere terrible, everyone stressed with not enough help."
good,"Low pay, rude people, bad store management company is all about money but dont want to pay their employees what they desrve... need to get back to making. Sure the employees are happy so they can make the customers happy"
good,"just getting the job done for the day, learned how to use the register for gift cards, the work place was very quiet, getting all the work done;seeing smiles."
good,"The work load was okay. Management wasn't always great, but definitely always worked with your schedule and vacation days. Do not regret working here as my second job."
good,"decent place to work. management is kind of helpful. not easy working around family schedule, if you have children and need off it is not easy to just get the day off work."
good,"A busy work setting one must get used to, however it is rewarding and makes the day go by nice and smoothly as long as you enjoy what you do.  Pharmacist and other technicians were verly helpful and worked to serve the needs of others."
good,The company cares about it's employees and the communities each store is based in.  They offer poor pay but great benefits for full time employees.  Every store is different but overall the company tries to make employees happy.
good,I enjoyed my job and everyone I worked with. The most stressful part of the job was printing the MARS at the end of every month as we did not have updated equipment and the equipment would break down alot
good,"A fair place to work where there are opportunities to succeed and grow within the company. It's retail, so there is stress involved but a much better option to work for versus most retail places."
good,"There is too much favoritism and drama involved in working with Walgreens. The managers are fine and pay is substantial, but it may or may not be worth it, depending on you."
good,"Not a horrible place to work, overall. Customers can be difficult and pharmacy can be stressful. Hours and pay are okay. Its a typical retail job. Scan, work out product, repeat."
good,Typical day for me was processing photos. Cashiering and stocking most of the day. I enjoyed working for Walgreens. They provide a lot of staff members in store so you have a lot of help.
good,"Job doesnt pay well at all for the large amounts of work required of you, but this company is a great place for an aspiring pharmacy tech/ future pharmacist to start."
good,"everyone at Walgreens is very accepting and kind, though it can get very slow during the day as everyone in either working or at school so depending on what your articular store is close to, you may have tons of down time."
good,I have a main store I work at and sometimes help out at nearby stores. The location you work out will largely determine and influence your experience here. A slow store will be relatively calmer but will have less work hours available. A busy stores will have plenty of hours but is a much more stressful environment. However at a busy store you will also develop skills such as multi-tasking faster.
good,This place is a good stepping stone to your career. Not a good career. This place pays well but not something you should live off of for the rest of your life.
good,"I started at this company as a liquor clerk.   I worked my way up to bookkeeper, attained my pharmacy technician license, and left the company as a price administrator (inventory).   The only department  that I was not fully trained on was cosmetics, on the store level.  My salary was not conducive to my output.   The co-workers and customers were great.   I just couldn't go anywhere, financially."
good,"A typical day at work was more often stressful then not, i'm sad to say. I didn't particularly learn anything, there was not much communication or effective training. Management was mediocre in my opinion. Work place culture was lackluster. The hardest part of the job was the day in and day out inevitable yet unnecessary stressful work environment. The best part was building customer rapport."
good,"We are overworked, stretched thin and not getting paid for the many different hats me and my former coworkers wore. The Store Manger never would come out to help us with anything. He would also change the rules because he didn't want customers to call Cooperate and complain even though he knew we were doing our job."
good,"A typical day requires splitting time between the pharmacy, sales floor, office and assisting employees and customers.  I learned multi-tasking, time-management and how to train and lead a team."
good,Pharmacist have to do a lot of technician tasks due to hours being cut down more and more every day. Floater pharmacists have to work varied shifts including graveyard.
good,"The music gets old, but otherwise 3rd shift was great there.  Dress code wasn't too prohibitive, my shift lead was very efficient and organized, it was definitely a more relaxed environment for a retail store belonging to a major chain than I would have expected."
good,Walgreen used to be known for taking care of their employees. That has gone away. Roles have changed and not for the better. Job satisfaction and morale in the stores is low.
good,"My pharmacy manager at Walgreens was by far the best manager I have had so far. The staff pharmacists and other technicians became my second family. Walgreens as a company does not staff their pharmacies well enough. The technicians and pharmacists do their best to please each person who comes in but because of how busy it is, many do not leave happy and our image remains damaged."
good,"Walgreens provided me with a lifetime of income and plenty of opportunities for advancement and relocation. As a pharmacist and pharmacy manager, you had to be in the 90th percentile to be reasonably content and stress-free in your position, as technology is used as a reason for extremely tightly budgeted hours, with no oversight from regulatory agencies such as a Board of Pharmacy. At the District Manager level and above, we were given lots of flexibility and autonomy, but still had to be highly competent to report on and create good results. In this capacity, Walgreens is a great career due to the diverse exposure, excellent overall compensation, and positive recognition. Plus, there are locations and districts in which to work literally everywhere."
good,"I feel it was ok, some things needed changed but the store manager was in over her head which made it difficult for the place to operate at its full potential. Great location in napa though"
good,I enjoy working with people. Assisting the elderly as they shop and provide an listening ear with an encouraging smile.To help decide between an expensive or inexpensive brand to give thoughts with pros and cons.
good,"Typical day would be managing the daily flow of the pharmacy, working directly with the pharmacist. Assist with the customer care, insurance, medication refills, register and answering phone. Also, complete the daily activities such as inventory, scheduling, etc."
good,Treat the employees with respect and appreciate the work that they do and give them a pay increase  for those who do there job as they been told. Employees who work hard ate the one should be promoted.
good,"Pay was horrible.  I worked in the pharmacy.  Had to deal with a store manager and a pharmacy manager.  The pharmacy manager was cool, but the store manager would stick his nose where it didn't belong quite often."
good,Not enough pay for the work we did. I was looking for another job after 8 months of being hired and finally got another job that paid a little better.
good,"I loved working for the company, but I didn't get a lot of work/life balance. I was stuck working a lot of weekends and  nights, which caused me to miss out on a lot of important people and events in my life. Was a good job, and got great experience. Just needed something different."
good,"I was a cashier & did some stocking of shelves.  Management never listened and always sent you to the assistant manager who could do nothing without the manager's approval, so it was a vicious circle."
good,"Everyday you show customer service, whether the front sales, photo lab, or cosmetics department. You learn customer service, stocking, helping customers, ect."
good,The day was either very good or very bad. Depend on customers just like any other retail job. Management is only good if the mangers know how to lead.
good,"Walgreens was a very family like company for most of my 29 years. New leadership took iover several years ago where profits are now put ahead of employess. Low moral, not the same company."
good,"I really love working for Wal-Greens but there is no advancement and the pay scale is not competitive."
good,"my review on Walgreens, it's a good starter, or for retirement. Not so much for anyone in between. Petty management made it difficult, but balanced out due to the really amazing people who put their heart into their job."
good,Walgreens overall is a good company to work for.  It can be hard to balance family and work because they are open 365. The pay seemed close to other retailers.
good,"Walgreens is a good company. They have good intentions, but some of the people that were in place as managers and higher were not very welcoming and helpful in their positions. I enjoyed the company, yet some of the environment was not pleasant."
good,"Great coworkers, though low pay and too busy for training. I usually pick up my prescriptions from walgreens which is why I was interested in working there."
good,"Working in a customer service job, will never bring you a stable work environment. The schedule was made the week before which made making plans difficult. Management could have been better, no one was ever disciplined since management was scared the workers would quit on them, so employees ran wild. If you came in as a regular employee the advancement would take a while. Overall the job was ok, it was an interesting experience and I am thankful I did work there. Without that job I would have never realized that retail management was NOT something I was interested in."
good,"Working at walgreens is exactly what you'd expect. Your job satisfaction is dependent on customers and management depending on your location. At the store level, you may find people who are agreeable and genuinely nice that make your day more worthwhile. At the corporate level, you'll find the company making questionable decisions to raise the bottom line, sometimes at your expense."
good,After 18 years of service I was informed that my position was being eliminated and while I would continue to be employed the rate of pay would decrease substantially.
good,The company overall does not care about their employees. I've worked in the pharmacy department for a long time and they could never provide enough help.
good,"This is a great company, as it will expose you to many facets of how to run a business. The workplace culture is for the most part positive, although stress can come with the job at times. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I get to help patients manage their medications and stay healthy. The hardest part of my job would be managing the budget. We can get extremely busy sometimes and not have the budget/man-power to keep up, this leads to customer complaints."
good,"Multiple different levels to grow within the company, but at the cost of retail business and retail hours. No consistent work schedule and required to work most weekends no matter your level within the company. Committed to serving the customer at nearly any cost. Management depended on your level and supervisor per store. Pay and job requirements depend on position."
good,"Walgreens was a great company to work for when I first started. It was like a family oriented environment, they increased starting to pay to higher than most similar companies, had things like employee of the month. We would have pot-lucks and cookouts for holidays or just to boost team morale. It was an enjoyable place to work and they allowed people to move up in the company if you applied yourself. In the past year or so they have continuously cut hours while still expecting high performance marks. The cut in hours has caused the company to lose some top quality employees and I do not see that ending soon as people need hours to get a decent paycheck to survive on. We have some great assistant store managers and department managers. Management at high levels than that leave a lot to be desired and are not great listeners/problem solvers."
good,to much by the book and corporate across the board standards for all size stores. lots of shop lifting and cant do nothing about it. Loss prevention more focused on firing people then the real problem.
good,"I like being a pharmacy technician for Walgreens, but I dislike the constant budget cuts; every year it seems like we have less than we had the year before, even though we're handling more prescriptions and the equipment is the same."
good,"The job pays well for a student with little to no bills starting off but long term it is not worth the annoying managers and the difficult customers. I would recommend leaving within the first 6-12 months there are plenty of other jobs out there they can pay you a lot more, and working 4 to 12:30 at night sucks and takes up most of your day"
good,"Fast paced work environment."
good,"At least in my store, the really squeeze the work out of you when you're working on the floor. The hourly pay was terrible compared to many other jobs available. Management was awful."
good,Walgreens has a flexible schedule to allow time for such things as school or other jobs.  It has a relaxed environment and is a nice place to learn and grow.
good,"It's a great place for customers,but not so great for employees due to the high amount of work load. The managers expect a lot from employees and the pay was low for the amount of work."
good,"I felt secure in my job at Walgreens. I enjoyed the different seasonal items and promotions we would offer to customers. During my time there, however I have been part of many hour cuts. Less workers on the shifts so more are expected of the current employees. I was a Beauty Advisor for a while and they got rid of that position so I went back down to CSA. I had been there 5 years and never felt I had any room to move up. I would like to find a company I feel both secure and like I can grow in."
good,"They helped me with school. "
good,"Corporate. Busy-work, minimum room for advancement and ""competitive"" pay. The benefits (if full-time) are good. No probation period. Takes about a month to know the job like the back of your hand."
good,"my typical work day requires making many phone calls ,taking care of customers, calling insurance company's,and filling prescriptions. i have two managers one is very helpful when we have questions the other makings working there very hard. The hardest part of my day is making sure everyone else's questions are answered in a timely matter. My favorite part of my day is when i get to talk to our regular customers and see how their day is going and try and answer any questions they may have for me."
good,"Walgreen's was a decent company, just don't like how its ran, going in the wrong direction. I started out as a stock guy and was promoted to a shift leader, the district manager doesn't think of us as managers."
good,"If you want your life to be taken from Walgreens then think twice."
good,Over Walgreens is a great company to work for I just wish they had better pay and more  opportunities to grow and move around when needed. But above all that it's a great company to work for if your a teenager
good,"The management is great here. If you utilize the tools you're given to be successful with this company and enjoy working in a retail environment, then this is the place to work."
good,lots of repetition with on the job training management definitely gets the job done overall people don't seem real happy to be there I would say the hardest part of the job would be the repetition and never seeing the sun shine most enjoyable would be quitting time
good,"I actually liked working there, was my first job and easy money. But after management changed they started working me too hard for minimum wage so I had to leave. It's an okay job for anyone 16-21."
good,The pharmacy has more priority than the front end. The prescriptions do take time to fill and the lines get rather long so management tackles them before moving to the front.
good,"Ive been at my store for 11yrs and things happen at my store that doesn't necessarily happen at other stores. As shift lead you will do a lot of work, but thats part of the store leadership role. It can get stressful...its retail. I would recommend this job to younger people that are in high school for the CSA position and college students for the Shift Lead."
good,"I worked for them in Jupiter FL distribution plant, the job wasn't bad but the available shifts were bad unless you been with the company for years. I had only 2 shifts to choose from, midnight or weekend shift from 6AM to 4PM  so choose your punishment. Also look out for video cameras, management watches every move you make"
good,"Always busy from when you walk in, opening duties are to get the drawers for pharmacy check them in and assign them to 3 cash registers. Sign onto computer and scales to start typing and filling prescriptions, answer phones, assist with patients picking up and dropping off."
good,Walgreens focuses on providing extraordinary customer care which includes moving towards being a provider instead of drug dispenser.  They involve pharmacist in medication management and immunizations to care for customers well-being.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to build relationships with your customers.
good,"Fast-paced retail environment.  A consistent focus on filling as many prescriptions as possible in as little time as possible.  Busy store, shifts went by quickly."
good,good place to work for young kids just starting out or an older person just wanting a hobbie. But I need more to support to myself and two small kids.
good,"Job is all around fun. Coworkers make a worker happy to be in the building. When met by the right happy, smiley customers, it really brightens your dad and makes you love your job. The grumpy, loud, and shady characters even it out."
good,"Walgreens employees are typically friendly and hard workers. The job is fairly easy and self explanatory. They only pay min wage for CSA, cashier, beauty, and photo. Fast paced."
good,Im sure things have changed a whole lot since I have worked there in 06 so I really do not know why this is making me do this. in retail things change day to day!! Only thing about Walgreens is they do not like to pay until you have been with them 20 plus years. and as in any job with a Pharmacy Tech you can only go up in advancement so far....
good,Fue una buena experiencia como todo tiene sus altas y bajas pero no fue tan mal
good,It's an alright place to work at. It's a nice environment most times. The only bad thing was the management. The managers in this store took advantage of workers in my opinion. But not too badly
good,"Walgreens is a very customer orientated chain. A typical day consists of helping any customer in need to the best of your ability, and making sure the store is both clean and organized."
good,"a lot of work for very little pay as a customer service associate. being there under a year i was trained at register to face and clean store for closing or opening, to pull bays or redo end stands and given a department all fine. then was told to learn photo and be a photo tech but did not get paid more when i was suppose to get a raise and then they offered to train me for pharmacy but i declined. in NY and was only making 8.50/ hour and a photo teach makes about 10/hour or more."
good,Very easy job and great discounts. Everyone knew their job to do. The only bad part is that the company listens more to the management more than the associates and makes you feel replaceable. But the people you work with in the store makes you feel like part of a family. I miss it.
good,"Overall the job was just really bad. standing at a cash register for 4 hours was horrible, and the customers aren't really that much fun either. The people i was working with, including my managers were very nice though."
good,Been with the company almost 9 years. Things have changed for the worst. Management is stressed and over work. Your family is not important.  But if you can find a good MGT you will enjoy the job.
good,"Walgreens overall was a good experience. Most employees are ok, management could use some improvement. Wish the staffs was not over worked due to lack of hiring replacement employees."
good,"The management and those I worked with were great to be around, but the environment was not fast pace enough for me... I would often stand around and not have anything to do, which is not something i prefer when I am working. It was not worth the minimum wage pay."
good,"Decent place to work, co-workers are nice for the most part. Non union so a lot of inconsistency in rules and procedures. Clean warehouse. Benefit package is expensive and not that great."
good,Good employees and coworkers. If you get the right manager you will enjoy your job. But the company seems to be ignoring all of their employees starting from store managers and going down tot he clerks.
good,"Walgreens is an excellent company to work for but,  just like any other company, who you work with dictated how much was completed that day. I lost 2 excellent pharmacy technicians and the pharmacy began to turn sour. Job training/interest was insufficient despite management's multiple attempts to improve outcomes."
good,Overall Walgreens is an amazing company to work for. My biggest issue was that there was no room for advancement. I had worked there for almost 3 years. During that time there have been 6 Shifts leads who have come and gone. They always hired out of the company even though most of us working there always applied. We didn't even get the interview. Some of the people they hired spent months just following us entry level workers around and having us do all the shift lead things ourselves. I left this company because i had an issue with the person doing the schedules and they were not compromising.
good,I had great superiors so my experiences are mostly pleasant. The pay isn't so great for the amount of work required. It's an excellent starting point.
good,Walgreens used to be a great family oriented company but that has changed for the worse. When ownership changed about a year ago things for ghe company started to go down hill
good,"Walgreens as a company has great values and treats employees wonderfully, but there is high turnover in employees and management. This means that the standards are consistently changing. The most enjoyable part of the job are the sweet customers that appreciate the work you do."
good,"Walgreens involves a lot of customer service and patience to deal with the constant workflow and potentially irritated clientele. The easy part was dealing with the customers and patients, while dealing with the coworkers and the environment seems to be what posed the most challenge. The constant workflow can be stressful, but no more so than the coworkers who seem to not want to do any work or the managers who allow that sort of behavior. Those who work hard are not necessarily rewarded nor recognized, but seem to be reprimanded when their workload suffers even a bit (while those who are content to do very little are seemingly allowed to do so with no consequences). I really enjoyed helping the patients, but dealing with the coworkers and the company creating uncertainty about job security was a bit difficult for me."
good,The job was boring at times which made it difficult to apply myself. Overall good atmosphere and good benefits. Some customers could get a little pensive. I would not recoment working there.
good,"Working there wasn't awful but it didn't pay good. even as a shift manager that worked harder than the assistant manager i made like 12$ while the assistant make double. i worked up in the company pretty fast but once you get a taste of shift lead you are over it. you are over worked and under paid. The company keeps changing "
good,It's an OK company could do a little a lot better   I have really not much to say about Walgreens I'm trying to find a brand-new job things are really changing
good,"Fast paced retail chain store. Good place to work. Hours have been difficult, working mostly nights and weekends. Wonderful customers, most of whom I have grown to know. Very little chance for advancement."
good,"Nothing bad to say about the workers. Management did tend to have a bit of a power issue, but nothing too concerning. The only thing that bothered me about the job is simply having to deal with snotty or angry customers."
good,It was a high paced work environment which included stress. Some of the employees did not like their jobs which made it harder. I enjoyed the work load but some of the people were hard to deal with.
good,I started working has a pharmacy technician. Walgreen's paid for me to get my certification. I learned a lot while working here for years.The manager was great too.But a stressful job to working in pharmacy.
good,Pharmacy staff is overworked and short staffed. Management cares more about quotas then patients/employees. High stress environment. Tech hours are often cut and workload increased.
good,"My input on working at Walgreen's, is Realistic. We are in Desperate need of Security, because of the area, but they are too Cheap and  Inconsiderate of the Employees Well Being."
good,I enjoy what I do. I like challenges. My job involves problem solving every day. I always have to think outside the box. Working with the public has its challenges but it also has its rewards. The only that is tough is schedule. I work all different shifts and that can be a challenge at times.
good,"I worked here for 8 years and I really enjoyed it.  The store manager I started under knew I was interested in sales and figures so he included me when he reviewed them.  There are over 6,000 stores so your experience will most certainly differ.  Corporate was one of the reasons why I quit.  I hated the lack of support and their forced programs.  They provided a lot of cookie-cutter marketing plans that don't work for every store and if you strayed from the plan, you were punished.  I would still be working here if the pay was higher and if corporate would allow the stores to make their own marketing plans."
good,"Great place to work while it lasted. Walgreens has a tendency to buy companies then shut them down so layoffs are common. Their health care benefits stink, but overall was a good place to work."
good,"Any day during work, its fun and challenging to learn new things; management is reasonable and understanding. Workplace culture is equal; the hardest part of the job was getting along with an employee that's not friendly, not willing to help new employees or students in training, not fair to certain employees, gives attitude to those he/she does not want to work with and wants to work solo instead in a team. The most enjoyable part of the job, working as a team while taking care of customers all around either in the front, drive thru or by phone and at the same while communicating with each other for assistance with a certain task."
good,"Working here is a great environment to learn basic work skills such as cashier, sales, retail, and handling money. There is also some possibility of advancement."
good,maybe other store than the one i am at is better but i do not like the favoritism that is going on there. If your relatives work in management position you are treated much better than anyone else. I have to fight for everything i deserve. I am a very hard worker and someone who made enough mistakes to be fired is treated better than me who maybe made couple mistakes at the company. if your mom or dad don't work for walgreens be aware. there might be some very unfair moves from the management.
good,"Had a great 2 years until they promoted my manager and we got someone unqualified and rude to replace him. He slowly drove all the old staff away, and replaced them with people from his old store."
good,"Walgreen's was generally pretty slow, there were many times during a shift when i would have to find something to do other then stand there and wait for customers, which is kind of hard when the get mad at you for leaving the register, even when no one is in the store. I never had a set scedual, and i rarely work the same hours. Some employees weren't very nice but most we're easy to get long with."
good,"Working with such amazing people here really made working in a fast paced environment easier. Working here I became one of the family. There was always someone ready to step in and help whenever I needed it, whether it was stocking shelves or getting something to eat when I got tied up. Schedules were never an issue. Management honored pretty much all requests off and on the occasion that they weren't able to, there was always another employee ready to trade a shift or do whatever they could to help out."
good,"Pay was terrible. Hours were more than full time....always had people calling in, and then they called me in on everyday that I had scheduled off. NOT great management team overall. Pharmacist was not the nicest to have to deal with on a daily basis."
good,"The only real reason I want to leave is because I believe they aren't paying me enough, and there has been a change in management recently that I am not a fan of."
good,"I already wrote a review for walgreens. The store you are working at makes all the difference regarding management, workplace culture, hard and enjoyable part of the job."
good,"flexible hours"
good,"Really, the biggest reason I left was due to the Trucks; They would consistently arrive several hours late, throwing off the manager's plans of scheduling to get the trucks done ASAP. Additionally, whoever is in charge of managing what we receive, be it another coworker, manager, or someone at the corporate level, does not know how to do manage stocks. When I left, there were several things in the photo department that, immediately after Truck Day, simply could not be done due to us not having the necessary components, and we had three full areas of peach tea, with more in the back. Also, it's rather infuriating that, during the final hours, where everyone has to be cleaning something, there are only three people, two of which will be in the very back, and the third may be unable to see the front, leaving it very susceptible to late night shoplifters."
good,"Interesting challenging work, designed for Pharmacy Students and professionals. I have learned many drug names, their benefits and interactions. Good work opportunities for a Pharmacy professional.  The hardest part is complying with the time expected for processing orders."
good,"great I learned multitask like •	Received prescriptions from customers in person, fax and phone"
good,"multiple duties, you never what you are going to do"
good,I gave it 3 out of five stars. Not a bad place to work for a retail job. The benefits are okay but could be better. There is room to grow if you are interested in joining management.
good,It was a job that I didnt know a lot about when i started but my pharmacist was great deal of help as well as the other technicians. The hardest part was getting use to the fast pace work enviroment but once i did it turned out to be a really fun job knowing that I was helping patients and that it was through me helping with filling their perscriptions was helping them.
good,this company has a lot of drama and tends to be the type of place that if you make friends with the right people you go far despite what you can do. the store managers aren't trained well and the employees are dramatic. i was fired just for being in the hospital and they were forced to rehire me because it was illegal. if you can stay professional and not let the drama affect you and deal with emotional co workers then you will be a manager within a year. there is plenty of room to grow at Walgreens if you have a high tolerance for nonsense.
good,Working at Walgreen's definitely aided into my communication skills and taught me how to effectively make sales. Leaving customers with a smile is a personal objective of mines every shift. Co-workers are quite weird but still get there jobs done. Management there is very cool have not even the slightest trouble with them. When it comes to the hardest part of the job it would be just taking out the bail other than that just talking to customers is very enjoyable.
good,"My employment here was enjoyable until the extenuating circumstance which led to my leaving the company. They offer very good benefits and an array of associate perks. The environment is family oriented and while adherence to policies and procedures is not optional as is in any place of business, it is overall laid back and enjoyable to work in."
good,I worked with customers providing them with excellent customer service. I enjoyed the co-workers and felt very comfortable with them.
good,the local management is very helpful and caring. However the company doesn't really care about its employees. the increased the starting wage to $9 per hour which was what i was making but didn't give me a raise even though i had been there for 5 years.
good,Wlagreens taught me how to be a good customer service rep how to come to work with a positive attitude and always keep a smile on my face no matter how my day is going
good,"I enjoy working with people, however this job can be very stressful at times. It is geared toward those who intend to make a career out of customer service or retail."
good,"retail work experience not required, but is a good skill to have when thinking about this type of work... requires you to be able to maintain your cool when dealing with customers."
good,"Mixed group of resources, company gives continuous attention to improvement. Nice cafetaria."
good,"Beauty Advisor shifts are long and consist of frequent customer interactions and sales as well as continuous store tasks. Lots of lifting, standing, and bending is hard on knees and feet. Management styles differ from store to store as does coworker commitment. Customers typically are friendly and can make the day go quickly if you put forth the effort to be courteous and helpful."
good,"A typical day at Walgreen's consist of stocking, cleaning and helping customers with their purchases. I've learned that each day is different and that attitude determines the outcome of your day."
good,"Great job for creative, problem solving leaders who like to wear many hats.  I learned many things, becoming a Pharmacy Tech as part of management training. "
good,this is the first retail job i have ever had and its really fun and Walgreens as a whole has been really good to me. However its not a lucrative and that is an issue.
good,"Loved working for the store manager and other employees. Customer service, merchandising, counting, unloading truck. Upper management not always on same page."
good,"Great job , great people, learned Alot working in management. Great place to grow and meet awesome customers! Great place to start a career."
good,i have worked for Walgreens for a long time now I enjoy it but it's time for a change. I enjoy working with my co workers. Walgreens is a good company but could compensate workers more
good,"I worked for Walgreens for 5 years stayed as an ASMIT the entire time.  I just spoke with another ASM who has worked for Walgreens for 15 years, still an ASM.  No real advancement opportunity."
good,"I really enjoyed this job at first. It was very laid back yet productive, the amount of work was fair for the amount I was getting paid. However, when new management came in it just became very corporate like, my boss was making changes left and right, I got double the amount of work for the exact same pay, when I asked for a raise he would just laugh and make a comment such as ""try uber"" or ""get a side job as a bartender"" which is highly unprofessional. My coworkers were amazing and we all got along great however we were limited on how we could interact with each other due to my boss not wanting us to be normal human beings and instead wanted us to just be robots and have nothing but work on our minds."
good,The job was very physical. My only complaint is the shift differential between working in the morning and graveyard was some like $.50 . The job wasn't for me but it could of been worse
good,"Great place to work , very flexible hours for families or sporting events, properly trained, Management was very helpful & professional.Pay is minimum wage"
good,"A typical day at work is being very busy making sure patient gets there delivery on time."
good,"I was excited when I was going to be joining the Walgreens crew for the Flagship Store in January of 2015. One of the managers was very nice and seemed optimistic. As time passed by, he seemed to have very little patience which discouraged people because he changed his attitude in such a short amount of time. I did not see any ways on how to advance because I was a Beauty Advisor and we already had a Senior Beauty Advisor. Also, I did not feel prepared because I felt like I did not have a lot advice to offer customer's about make-up. Most of our training was online, other than the Boots training which was not a part of our cosmetics section. As a Beauty Advisor, you only get paid $9.25 to help customers select make-up, ring them up, re-stock and clean the disgusting public restroom. The hardest part about this job was directing customer's to certain items because we only knew where our cosmetic items were."
good,"I typically worked a morning shift, the morning was slow and would not pick up until about 2PM. Being in cosmetics and only focusing on a sales goal, I was rarely given a task to do to occupy my time when we were slow. Over my year and a half of working there, I learned other departments, co-workers and managers would come and go in my store. Overall the discount was great, but I never knew what was going to happen in that store considering the location."
good,The store I worked at was in a bad neighborhood. So it was challenging most of the time.But after 18 years you get use to it.
good,Typical day a work is busy dealing with a lot of customers. Have a great crew to work with. Hardest part of the job will be cosmetics. I enjoy working with the customers .
good,"Retail pharmacy is a difficult field in general, a constantly high stress environment. Walgreens is an extremely large corporation, so overall the company doesn't seem to care much about individual employees. However, the most important thing to note is that the management of a store is what makes or breaks it for me. If you have a good, supportive store manager your job will be exponentially easier. This is true of any job, but especially one as high-stress as retail pharmacy. "
good,A typical day at work is good. I have learned how to work majority of the machinery and equipment. My co-workers are great we all work together as a team.
good,Perfect for anyone looking for a quick environment and a love of coffee. From my experience everyone was mostly friendly and there was no real reason to feel like a outcast.
good,Productive and good work environment.  Employees are extremely friendly.  Get to help people manage their medications and their way of life.
good,I do not believe that this company values it's employees enough; they believe in community involvement but they do not show the same care for their employees.
good,Good experience if you healthcare is your field. Good benefits if you for full-time employees. Good work atmosphere with the good management
good,"Job requires typing in scripts, filling medications, calling insurance companies and doctor offices. Requires to be on feet for all of shift minus breaks/lunches. Have to get used to the multiple personalities and different work methods of different pharmacists. Occasionally will get yelled at by a customer for something that wasn't you fault, but you get used to it. Time goes by quick if the store is busy but sometimes that can be tiresome depending on what you are working on. "
good,I enjoyed my time with the Walgreen's corporation with my experiences with my co-workers and management. I would say that the only downside to my employment was the low wage.
good,"Typical day consist of enter, filling and selling prescriptions. It is a very fast pace job, you must be fully focused on what your doing."
good,"I was able to move up in the company fairly quickly. I had many different opportunities to chose from as well. hourly wage is decent for a large company. benefits were reasonable, with options for fsa accounts and profit sharing. Not a family orientated company. They are every day including holidays and you are required to work a certain amount of holidays."
good,"Throughout the years I have noticed that Walgreens is a nice place to work. But also we are undergoing alot of changes. "
good,"Come in, new rules, less freedom."
good,"There is a lot of things we do in 1 day. For a opening manager:"
good,"Long days as it is retail, but getting to deal with people on a day-to-day basis was an extremely beneficial part of the job."
good,Not a bad job once you have decent experience. Learned basics of customer service. Personal development and company growth depends on management and changes from store to store. Coworkers easy to get along with. Hardest part of job is handling difficult customers. Most enjoyable part is helping people with needs.
good,"I was a leader, responsible for either opening or closing the store. Cash management, vendor assistance, warehouse, greeting and solving customers problems, and knowing how to operate in each department (Sells, camera, cosmetics, pharmacy, etc...)"
good,"This position was very helping in helping me gain leadership experience, however at times was very demanding. i think this is great for people who want to grow in the company."
good,Overall a pretty good place to work for. Excellent benefit package and pay. Products  to be shipped in a  timely manner. Co - Workers were team orientated.
good,The job was quite easy just they try to work high school kids till midnight other than that it is a great place to work.The management and coworkers were friendly and helpful.
good,"I started at walgreens as a part time pharmacy technician, but because I was not full time it was difficult to find hours as there were many full time employees. I bounced around stores and the last one I worked as a pharmacy technician at stopped putting me on the schedule when I called up to find out why I wasn't getting any hours the person in charge of scheduling explained that she didn't want me to work in her pharmacy despite my not making any major mistakes. So I switched over to the store part of walgreens where I worked as a cashier for sometime, within a few weeks of that I was able to do everything at the register that a manager could do short of being able to get the permission to do it from the system. When I was finally moved to the floor to stock I improved upon their technique of taking all of a type of product down walking around and then putting everything that didn't go on the shelf back by making a list, which was an innovation for them. While I worked there I never got a raise despite having a good performance review. Some of the managers were hard to work with as they pushed their duties onto the floor people, the co-workers were easy to get along with as well."
good,"A Typical day of work is opening or closing of the store, and putting out the registers or counting them out. I have learned the day to day operations of running a business including  problem solving and customer service. Management is changing often recently. The co-workers are good and hard workers  who support each other through out the day. The hardest part of the job is when co-workers calls-off and don't  pull there weight. The Most enjoyable part of my job is when everyone works together and making a difference in the customers  lives."
good,"A typical day at work was a moderate flow of customers, which usually allowed the employees to complete daily tasks, receive daily shipments, inventory, check dates of perishable foods, and facing items on the shelves for a more desired appearance.  My Walgreens team was very hardworking as well as friendly. We exchanged ideas with each other in order to work toward our common goal. My co-workers and I loved to have fun at work, because it influenced the overall mood of the store's environment. I learned the importance of having fun with customers, engaging in their concerns and question, and making them feel welcome. Store management frequently had conflicting strategies when distributing workloads, thus causing confusion as well as miscommunication. However, because we had such an interactive team, we were always able to assist each other to complete the workloads. The hardest part of the job was being understaffed during customer peak hours, which meant every customer would not have my undivided attention, and not all assigned tasks would be completed. The most enjoyable part of the job was watching the customers leave with a smile, or even full of laughter. because I appreciate that same feeling during my shopping experiences."
good,Walgreens was an enjoyable place. Everyone helped everyone and was friendly. However job security was an issue. Advancement was never an option and the compensation was not great health insurance did not cover much and you had to work forever to get an vacation time built up.
good,"I have worked here 4 months, I love everyone I work with. I feel all my co-workers look out for me when they can. The customers are awesome there is quite a few regulars, and they love us Sometimes there are issues, but what job doesn't ."
good,"Good environment, M-F with regular schedule. Good management who listen to their employees. Benefits are ok but are being decreased for next year (401 K discretionary and disability plans)."
good,"bad management and the team for the most part was helpful, the manager did have her favorites and if you weren't one of them then you were on the bad list daily"
good,"I really love the way that Walgreen's built themselves up over a hundred years to become the company they are today. With that said I fear that the emphasis on excellent customer service, employee benefits, and mentality is quickly draining. Ever since they were acquired by Alliance Boots, (EU) it seems that employees still being paid wages that are not livable without supplementation while job responsibilities are becoming more and more as the company has been quick to release high level, good paying positions and letting the responsibilities trickle down to lower level employees, which would be fine if the paycheck trickled down as well. What us Walgreen employees loved about the company is that they did not have a Wal-mart style operation, and we had freedom and discretion to work but now everything is going S.O.P. and its basically turning the average employee into someone who needs to know very little that simply does the job. The problem with this is that the good, hard working employees are going to fallout while they are being replaced with employees that just ""want a job."" I am predicting that as this loss of employee satisfactions starts to form it will quickly show up in the form of low customer surveys, which means less customers in the store and less satisfied ones who are. Corporate, who seems to be completely disassociated with the day-to-day work environment in store will see only numbers falling which will prompt them to push store managers into hard times, which will trickle down to the base line employee and make the situation even worse. And if it does manage"
good,"A typical day at work is pretty much ""Zoning"" which is pretty much fixing your assigned isles to look presentable. Also i pull the outs and stock shelves, Scan outs which is done on a telxon and calculates and updates the stores inventory"
good,"Working in management for Walgreens is a fast paced environment.  Your focus is primarily in the retail section of the store, though you are expected to learn and work in the pharmacy during peak hours.  Walgreens is a progressive company always looking to improve operations.  I think Walgreens is a good opportunity for those looking to gain management experience.  The company is very task driven when it comes to working in management, which can either be good or bad depending upon your experience."
good,"Hour's aren't all that flexible and there's a lot of drama between coworkers. People openly calling other employees names and making fun of them. "
good,"A typical day at work for me was stressful but fun. Any job you love doing is always going to be fun. Any job you work at is always going to have some kind of stress that comes with it. Filling people's prescriptions, helping them locate a pharmacist preferred over the counter medication was my daily task. Working at a drug store is typically just all about assisting customers/patients with their health care needs. "
good,"The benefits are great, the job atmosphere not bad, but working retail during the holidays is awful, it is easy to get burned out."
good,"I loved my years with Walgreens as a manager. I started as a management trainee, and worked harder than ever to earn my first store. There were training modules almost every single step of the way. In terms of learning, Walgreens is probably the best I've encountered. "
good,"A typical day at work is busy, but I learned to manage my time in an organized and time saving way. My management works for the good of the company, and my co worker would describe as dependable, fast learner and a hard worker employee. The hardest part of the job is most of the people rely on you but at the same time, I also enjoy that part since I like being occupied at work and also to help others in their tasks."
good,I did enjoy getting to know the customers by their first name and know what products they liked.   Learning the overview of ordering and receiving merchandise to put on the shelf. Building the shelves was interesting to see how close we could get to the managers perfection
good,Flexible hours to work and proactive leadership each day brings new challenges. I like being a manager even if it is only an entry level capacity. The pay could be alot better than is is
good,It was a good place to start for experience but I didn't see a future with Walgreens.  They didn't treat their employees well and the pay wasn't good for non-managment.
good,The biggest thing about this company is customer service. Coming in and having to answer customer questions and making sure you have the answers and if not finding ways to get the answer. I learned about being a leader at this job. Management is very hit and miss with this company. My co-workers I had were very nice and willing to help out.The hardest part was being able to move up and the pay. The most enjoyable part was if I needed to relax and get off sales floor I was able to.
good,"great company but is not family friendly. You work lots of hours and the pay is not competitive, they should offer more weekends off."
good,"Fill prescriptions, excellent customer service, communicate with doctor's offices and customers.  This company was nice to work for because I could work at any store whenever help was needed."
good,"a typical day at Walgreen's may not be the most exciting thing, but working alongside people who accept you for who you are makes it worth it"
good,"Was once a great company to work for which cared about all employees, but since its merger wit Boots/Alliance it has become the survival of the fittest with all lower level employees and middle managers fighting for fewer openings"
good,"The staff was a great group of people and very family oriented."
good,"Hard company to work for. Did learn a lot and developed a lot of skills, but not a company that cares about their employees. Company is also not moving in the right direction."
good,"Big struggle with work/life balance.  They expect SM to work 70+ hours per week, and more during the holidays.  Trouble is, since most are on salary, there is not a lot of downtime as there is always a holiday to prepare for.  If the store struggles to hire staff, there isn't a lot of district help or coordinated recruiting efforts to support SM."
good,"Really nothing bad to say about Walgreens, but they're hard to get a full-time position with. Great company overall though and have great employees and management."
good,You have to be very flexible as your day can change because of cancelled and add on patients. Great boss who is right there with you in the trenches. Supportive and will go to bat for you with open door policy.
good,Working in the pharmacy is a fast pace job. It is enjoyable to work at when there is  a set workflow. There is a supportive team that helps one another.
good,I loved my co--workers. We were always having pitch-ins.  We celebrated every holiday together and did outside activities which kept the morale up high.
good,"A typical day at work processing patient's payments, posting, and collections calls. The hardest part of my job is when a patient does not want to pay their bills"
good,"Standard retail work experience. A strange combination of being challenging and not. Working with the public made me learn how to act appropriately for work situations. Management has been a mixture of both encouraging and inspiring role models as well as overbearing and demeaning figures. I have had co workers that have been hard workers like myself that have been great to have by my side, as well as terrible people who have harassed me for years. The hardest part of the job has been working with unreasonable people, but the pay off is when I can help those in need and have them leave the store happy."
good,"Good place to work.  The hardest part of the job is making sure"
good,"I only work at Walgreens for 6 months.  I did enjoy my time here, the staff was great to work with.  I learned a great deal what goes on behind the scenes in retail."
good,"I improved in multitasking and in my customer service skills. Also, I have better communication skills, as well as being able to develop great relationships with my colleagues."
good,A great job! not very exciting long boring days but the pay is decent.  There is a lack of management due to a lot of confusion and constant employee callouts everyday.  The hardest part of the job was just staying up overnight knowing I had to start another full time job right after I clocked out.  The most enjoyable part of the job had to be the customers that came in during the middle of the night.
good,A typical day at work would be opening the store running the front register and working photo. Some days would work back in the pharmacy. I learned a lot from there as a retailer at the time. I got to learn every department and run the store under the manager but without having the name. The co-workers were not to bad everyone was pretty friendly. The hardest part about the job was having to deal with some of the customers back in the pharmacy. The most enjoyable part of the job was that i got in the position as a leader or something at the age of 18.
good,Coworkers were cool but it was boring. Absolutely nothing to do majority of the time. Definitely wouldn't work here again. I'm more of a fast-paced person.
good,Great people and place to work but pay is horrible.  The benefits are on par with other pharmacies but pay is so low the benefits use up most of your paycheck....
good,"Filing prescriptions, answering phones responding to messages and faxes waiting on customers, ringing up sales consulting with patients about their medications or insurance issues"
good,"A typical day at work starts with me being at the register and rining up everyone that is making a purchase. I learned how to deal with people's attitudes and grow tough skin. The management there was amazing, all of the managers was professional and provided a safe workplace for me. My co workers are such a joy to work with, I feel so blessed to have them in my life. The hardest part is dealing with different personalities that walk through the door and the most enjoyable part is being able to help"
good,Walgreens is a very innovative company with a great computer system. I had a hard time with the secrecy surrounding strategy and the layers built in between me and my patients.
good,"There are many things to learn here. Becoming part of the Company's core values can be rewarding. The best experience is working with my co-workers. You learn to be a team and personally develop. A decent amount of red tape and politics, but I guess this is expected of a big company. Take what you learn and make it beneficial as you grow and move on."
good,"A good place to work, clean and always have the customers best of interest in mind. Good benefits. They work with the employee that have personal problems. There are provisions for advancement with in the company. Pay increase is good."
good,"The long hours take a toll on a lot of the managers. Some of us are working between 50-70 hours a week and because we're salary we only get paid for 40!"
good,A typical day of Walgreens is very exciting. There is constant movement. I learned the best way to keep up is to actually keep up.
good,"The most important and most intriguing part of the job is dealing with the customers. With consumers from all walks of life, it allows one to gain experience in customer service that can benefit one in almost any career field. As an assistant manager at one of the busiest stores in the district, the main goal was to get team members to focus on creating and maintaining a customer-friendly work environment that allows for the most productive service."
good,"I had eight hour shifts most days (which I don't mind), but I wish I could have done other tasks besides being a cashier. There wasn't much for me to do in those eight hours besides clean or put up tags (which are easy). Honestly I was standing around bored most days."
good,"Company Change:  slow communication related to company direction.  Mainly due to company change, communication of information didn't flow quickly with respect to keeping various groups of employees in the loop. "
good,"A great place to get familiar with all aspects of pharmacy, being to help all types and ages of people, including their pets."
good,"train employees, use the cash registers, provide excellent customer service, adapt to changes daily, call customers regarding order, meet daily sales goals, make our suggestive sales, talk to management regarding sales, look for better ways to improve the workplace"
good,"It's a very good job to get into, there's a lot to learn and experience."
good,"operate the front of the pharmacy, and enter script information correctly. fill scripts with the corresponding medicine. then help patient with every day living while operating a running pharmacy"
good,"Walgreens is a successful company, but I do not think it is the place for me.  Staff and management both have good personalities and are competent at their jobs.  However, it is a retail environment, and so sales are given a higher priority than patient care in many instances.  I have even been asked by management to push patients to get immunizations that they objectively do not need simply to increase revenue.  My only other complaint is that Walgreens uses a sales-based scheduling system (like other retail businesses) which means employees work a different shift each day on different days each week based on projected sales for each individual day.  This probably serves the company well, but makes life difficult to balance with work."
good,"I have learned alot at Walgreen's, the main thing is Customer Service. I was very quit, but a hard worker. Through the 8 years of working there I have learned to open up, and be a better communicator, with customers and employees. My typical day usually evolves a lot of trucks and checking in. We receive trucks almost every single day including  weekends. Also resets and revisions are another large part of the job. Resets and revisions usually come down every Friday, for the next following week. I have still find myself hard to communicate with head Manager. There are a lot of reasons behind that, but I do still communicate rather well with them. The hardest part of the job is being short handed, its been happening a lot lately, not many people want to work for Walgreen's cause of the pay. That makes my job harder, cause I am stretched into two many directions. The best part of my job is the Customers."
good,"•	Cashier:  Accurate and rapid operation of the computer system and cash handling."
good,"As a former customer service associate, a typical day at work would be going to the manager and asking what tasks need to be completed, such as filling shelves, replacing tags for products, or disposing of expired food. "
good,I learn everyday something new. I learn from customers and co-workers. I see what is right to improve company sales and what is not.
good,"A typical work day goes by very fast.  The enjoyable part of the job is making people happy.  The job can be frustrating at times, but overall, it is okay."
good,"I input rx , counted meds, assisted with over the counter purchases and troubleshot ins issues. It was a fairly easy job and work day not too busy."
good,"walgreens is a great place, could be a lot better, but hey its a job. the advancement is possible but you would have to leave home to get a fighting chance."
good,I currently work at a high volume store. It has helped me work on my multitasking. I really enjoy interacting with the customers.
good,"I had a strong work ethics and strong commitment to my job. However a company restructuring doing the same work for far less than previously has not been helpful to certain employees. Nonetheless I am still committed to the same strong work ethics."
good,The pay was low for what you were required to do. Schedules were often changed without notice the day you worked and you were held accountable if you did not show up at the right time
good,is a shift manager job without the title or pay. Start off at 11.50/hr and take on all responsibility if anything goes wrong. No worse than any other retail job except for the compensation.
good,A typical day at Walgreens consists of a store full of customers. Long lines and high traffic are normal for this 24 hour store. I had to work quickly and efficiently to make sure customers had a pleasant experience. The management was a bit difficult to work with because they had very high expectations. It was hard to maintain job/ life balance. Many of my co-workers made this job easier because they were cooperative and supportive. I had a great time serving the customers. I knew many of them by name and could remember some of the supplies they'd purchase daily.
good,Was kept busy in a supportive role to help all my bosses who where inspiring and encouraging.  I enjoyed helping patients that needed help.  Was very successful in gaining clients for flu clinics off-site and built added revenue.  Hardest part of job was to be everywhere when store was busy.  I was challenged to obtain my certification for pharmacy technician.
good,replenishing drugs on shelves. Keeping area clean. the co-workers are good people and so is management. cycle counting locations.
good,The best part of the job was the customer engagement.  The worst part was realizing the disconnect from upper management to lower management.  I learned that effective communication is the key to success.
good,"There are a few great department managers who understand the stress being put on their team."
good,"I would like to say that this is a great company to work for but it is a little frustrating when your management gives mixed news all the time. No one is on the same page. I have met some really good people while working at the establishment but I definitely wouldn't suggest that retail be your go-to spot. Its a kind of bitter sweet thing. I loved it when I first started, but it can really suck the life out of you."
good,"Customer Service is very important, other daily tasks include stocking, merchandising, inventory and cash resgister"
good,"Typical work day includes opening store, daily cash handling and reporting, assigning tasks to staff, stocking shelves, receiving merchandise, various customer service and loss prevention activities."
good,"A workplace where I did my job for over six years. Management duties consist of teaching, leading and delegating tasks to employee to be completed."
good,"Company currently transitioning to Boots Alliance and cutting hours while increasing workload.  It has it's ups which is the community of individuals you get to work with; however, it lacks in structure and development."
good,"Lately the job has been more about avoiding lawsuits and policing controlled substances than actual patient care.  I'd like to get back to why I started out doing this job.  Most of the time we are doing the job of 2 or more people, and they are still cutting scheduling hours.  So for the last 3 years I have been in a viscous circle of working at 2 or more locations per week just to get the hours that I need.  I've been with the company over 8 years, but since I moved to Los Angeles, I still have yet to work in any close proximity to where I live.  In spite of all the negativity, I've sincerely enjoyed the experience I've gained at Children's Hospital. There it really feels like I'm helping the patient because I actually have the time to devote to them, and I learn something new every day in regard to patient care."
good,working with the public and helping them to get better was a good part of working at walgreens
good,Everyone's experience at Walgreens is different. Like any job it has its pros and cons.
good,Customer oriented environment. Enjoyed working with the public. Insured that all guests experiences were informative and pleasurable. Worked hard to provide efficiency and marketability for company. Had fun relationships with coworkers.
good,It was a great place to work for and definitely job security. Bad thing was that management would take out his frustration out on his technicians. Very busy makes the day go by fast.
good,Under-staffed for demand of job. Corperate continues to cut hours despite growth in stores.
good,"It was an temporary part time job. My co-worker were among many ages and colors. The mangers were easy to get along with, however the hours assigned were crazy and all over the place. Overall, pretty decent place to work!"
good,"Over night shift, learned a lot about time management. The hardest part of the job was staying awake around 4:00am. I enjoyed the co-workers, they worked as a team, always had one another back."
good,"What I enjoyed most about working with Walgreens was my customer-base. As far as the company itself, as a whole, Corporate has a great concept of what they want, but communication is at times incomplete and management teams are often incompetent or at least include a member who drags down the team. Since I left the company, they have changed the dynamic of the ranking structure and dropped pay significantly. Starting for a manager used to be ~$16.50/hr and now caps out around 14. Would honestly recommend as a first job, but not as a career."
good,"A typical day at Walgreens is quite unpredictable only because things change according to the shift you have or the season. More than likely your schedule is inconsistent so some part of the week I would have the morning shift so for the morning shift, if there is no sales tags to hang or totes for stocking, I would work on inventory for the department, meaning scanning the outs for a list and checking stock for missing items, changing the counts in the system. No matter the shift customers come first and we always have to make sure we are using proper verbage, going out our way to encourage them to come back. We promote immunizations always selling the monthly pm's. merchandising and upkeep of my dept."
good,"I've found the systems most challenging.  However, the camaraderie is most inspiring and helped bring out the best in everyone.  The constant changes in our area though has made it difficult to pursue a long-term career."
good,"A typical day at work involves completing administrative tasks such as processing patient insurance claims, resolving insurance rejections, filing paperwork, answering calls, filling prescription medications, inventory management, and selling medications."
good,"Working at Walgreens was great for about a year and a half. Then the company started to make alot of changes, and forgot about their employees. They cut my hours for no reason, switched the whole managment staff and played favors. The work days were not difficult, very easy for me to complete my work, the job was not very hard. The best part about my job were the customersm they really made me enjoy working for walgreens."
good,"I enjoyed working for Walgreens, I was part of the management team and enjoyed training and coaching the staff.   It was great learning the different departments to expand my product knowledge of the store.  The hardest part was when the restructuring of the management staff took place and I had to step down and become a shift lead, with a pay cut."
good,"Overall, good company.  Benefits, profit sharing are very well dispersed amongst the employees.  However, even with working to your optimal potential it is very hard to progress to more challenging roles."
good,"I work in a high volume 24 hour pharmacy where I am the pharmacy manager. On a daily basis, we fill anywhere from 600-800 prescriptions. I have several new technicians and am currently working on training them. I enjoy spending time with patients and educating them on their medications."
good,"A typical day would include typing, filling, processing insurance, interacting with doctors...etc. interacting with patients, managing inventory."
good,"It was a decent place to work. It makes it better when you and the store manager are on the same page."
good,"Nice Walgreens  ""Family""; the co workers are friendly with a nice, established neighborhood vibe to boot.  There tends to be a large work load... for someone getting paid for so little."
good,"Oversaw 5 different stores. Helped mentor the store manager to improve skills. Visited the stores every week. I learned to manage many different types of people with many different skills. The hardest part of the job was that it was very demanding, all the time. i enjoyed working with many different people"
good,It was a nice place to work but I wanted to advance in the medical field so I entered school.
good,"I started as part time cashier and worked my way to Assistant Manager. I really enjoyed working third shift with having a 7 on 7 off schedule. Working with customers can be both a joy and a pain, but that is the fun of retail, never knowing who or what you will be dealing with."
good,I learned about inventory management and the SIMS inventory software
good,overall experience of the company has everything to do which store you work at. i've been with the best store managers and the worst. they say they promote from within but prefer to higher outside the company. the work load is demanding and expectations are very high.
good,"Receiving Inbounds"
good,"Each and every day I learn something new. Whether it's from a customer, co-worker, or even management. I learn what customers likes or dislikes. What can we do as a member of the team to keep our customers happy and to keep coming to shop at the store."
good,"Typical day at work would be as follows: Work with customers at the cash register.  Stock new products and products that were in low supply on the shelf in a timely manner.  Provide excellent customer service by resolving customer questions. "
good,Challenges faced makes you better Pharmacist. It is great company to work for.
good,"A typical day at work is dealing with customers on the phone and inn person. I learned that while you can't make everyone happy, it helps to have a positive attitude when you first walk in, or your entire shift is shot. The management was very courteous and friendly with a good sense of humor, and you feel like you can actually tell them stuff. However, they can also be very rude. The hardest part of the job was meeting all of the requirements of the store manager. There were lists upon lists of things to do, and not enough time in any day to do them. You also don't get paid enough to deal with some of the things that you have to. The most enjoyable part of the job was walking in knowing that I got to work with people I considered to be my friends, my family. It was a very important three years for me."
good,"Certain days were required to do certain tasks. Sundays, for example, were required to run bays. Mondays and Tuesdays were order ins/outs. Wednesdays and Thursdays were truck days. Fridays and Saturdays were tote day. (Putting away new products.)"
good,Retail was pretty busy. Co-workers great to get along with.
good,"For me it is to serve the customers in a proper manner.To givethat extra care when needed but always with a smile."
good,The management is very support and helpful in career development. Walgreen try their best create a positive environment for their employee.
good,"I am currently working as a full time Beauty Specialist, at Walgreens. I have been employed with the Walgreens family for at least over ten years. Here I have gained excellent customer service, communication, cash handling, team player and independent self-work skills."
good,"Walgreens is a great company for pharmacists and job security for other departments but some of the perks of middle management have been cut. You are required to work some holidays, evenings and weekends.  Also the other departments are second fiddle to the pharmacy.  Other than that the people generally want to do their jobs well."
good,A lot is expected of you for little pay. They give a lot of praise when you accomplish goals.
good,"a typical day consisted of Maintaining lab equipment, processing customers requests and scheduling personnel. i learned managerial skills and how to maintain photography equipment. there was nothing particularly difficult about the job but sometimes certain customer requests were challenging. Working with a large diverse staff ensured that every day was fun and enjoyable."
good,"I learned how to process photographs, process orders, how to service the machines, and how as well as what to do when the machine stops working. I also would stock items when necessary and call customers to update them on the orders that were placed."
good,Great place to gain retail experience. The company has bee in existence for over 100 years.
good,Manager was a good person the other lead was not great would not recomed on working there again unless the lead was  not there any more he is very rude
good,It was an ok job and something to put on a resume so as to gain work experience
good,"I am in charge of the Personal Health and Beauty Department at my store. A typical Monday at my job includes opening duties, customer service and assistance including sales, answering telephones, assisting customers happens throughout the whole day. I will work excess inventory and stock, counting excess inventory and then I will put away overstock and scan outs for my entire department and work on the shape of my department. Pricing and signing are a daily process along with my closing duties. I learn everyday from the managers on how to better my department. The management is mostly willing to work with you when it comes to growth except there seems to never be enough time. My co-workers at my store location are very team work oriented witch helps when one of us needs a hand with a customer service issue or more hands in our departments. The hardest part of my job is not having enough time and help for such a big department. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help people find what they need and providing great customer service to them."
good,Your experience may vary depending if you are staff or floating. The hours can become an annoyance depending on your lifestyle. I like the interactions I am able to have with the customers. Also the computer system is pretty good and fool proof
good,"Not a horrible company to work for, just make sure you get a decent manager that will actually take the time to train you and watch out for promises of advancement."
good,"I complete different tasks that are given to me for that shift, while helping customers find what they need, and making sure my customers get the right kind of makeup that will work best for them. I have learned how to complete resets, create mylars, displays, and complete markdowns for our clearance section. Most of my co-workers are very fun to work with and we all get along well to get our tasks done. The hardest part of the job is sometimes being overloaded with difficult tasks and being busy all night helping customers, the tasks had to be put off until all customers were happy. I enjoy helping my customers find what they need and I really love when my customers come back on days I work so I can help them pick out new makeup, they trust my opinion. My management team is made up of really strong members and equally weak members. I enjoy working with the strong members, but when I have to work with the weaker members they tend to put off some of their responsibilities on me."
good,"A typical night on the night shift would consist of waiting on customers, developing film at the photo section/lab, working the stock room and replenishing the store shelves with merchandise."
good,"It was a very fast paced and efficient retail  pharmacy. For my first exxperience in a pharmacy setting, I feel I was trained very well. I also liked how they paid for my certification test, which I appreciated."
good,At one point of time I use to love going to work. I know there are going to be bad days but not everyday. The managers are far too messy. People are always talking down on the next I just want a happy environment without all the negativity.
good,Very busy work days.  Something to do everyday and lots of work all day long.
good,"Learned so much that I can take with me to other places"
good,"I spend the shift getting the store ready for the next day, Plus handling all the cash and management issues on the overnight. I learned more about what a pharmacy needs and more about prescriptions and dealing with insurance."
good,"I love working there, frequent customers feel delighted that I remember them. The customers appreciate my work that I do in the photo department, I love to show customers how to print best quality photos. The only downside is that the pay do not match the work that is done, it isn't sustainable"
good,"Compensation is fine. Coworkers depend on the location. Customers are always right, which is fine in many cases. "
good,A typical work day would consist of me completing customers orders and assisting them with anything they may need. Also to unload two different trucks and stock grocery and dry grocery while still watching photo and relieving front for their lunch. I have learned that customer service is everything i hear so many different stories of how people get treated badly at other places. The management is very orderly and things have to be done a certain way which in some cases can be good. My coworkers are great they are always trying to find new ways to have a employee party and we work good together at solving problems. The hardest part of my job would be having to work 365 days a year even on holidays. The most enjoyable part of my job would be the fact i get to help others with there pictures and i get to see where they went on there trips and get to hear all the different stories they come back with. I enjoy this very much.
good,"Helping customers and providing customer service. Ive learned that patience is key and that the overall goal is to assist custimers as needed. Management varies in proffesionalism , so job security isnt promised. The hardest part of the job is dealing with irrate customers and  security comfortbility. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and being able to assist with customer service needs."
good,"There is no typical work day at Walgreens. My schedule varies throughout the week. Each individual handles different workstations including filling medications, cashiering, and drive-thru transactions. Tasks can include resolving insurance issues, maintaining correspondence with doctor offices, and filling medications."
good,"Way too much paperwork - no time to manage"
good,Horrible management and no advancemet for good work.If upper management didnt like you it wasnt fun to work but the most enjoyable part of the job was my co workers and customers.
good,always busy with many tasks to complete while multi-tasking
good,I liked management in California and I always enjoyed my co-workers. I didn't like the crazy hours.
good,"The most enjoyable part of work is that we never ran out of work! Stayed busy all day every day.The hardest part of our day was training temps, every week new temps. It is very hard to find good people that WANT to work! I learned a lot here. How to manage a group of people and how to be an efficient multi-tasker."
good,Excellent retailer to work for with great benefits.  Schedule was not conducive with small children.
good,"stressful work loads"
good,"It is an OK Job, hours have been lacking lately. It is a typical Retail Pharmacy..Enjoy my co-workers & most customers."
good,I would go to work in the morning and go through the to dos list the store manager left.  I would go through the store and restock the shelves and relieve the cashiers for break.  I would arrive early in the morning sometimes late to unload the truck and sort it after ward. The co workers there were fun and easy to be around with. The holidays were the funnest.  I love seeing the decorations.  The hardest part was cleaning the seasonal ale every night
good,"A typical day at work is running the front of the store. This requires answering phones, assisting customers, and collecting revenue. At Walgreens I have learned a great deal of customer service and patience. Anytime your in a job that requires you to be attentive to another person;patience is needed as well as showing care to solve the customers problem. My management staff is helpful and understanding, as of right now they are training me for management. My co-workers are awesome we definitely work as a team. I have not really found anything to hard about the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is solving a customers problem. They are pleased which makes you feel accomplished."
good,"I worked for Walgreens as an Assistant Store Manager.  This is a good company if you want to get into retail management.  The work life balance is not good, but that is the norm for retail.  I had good experiences with the management at Walgreens, and they have a good promotion program."
good,"I was always on time in my 6.5 years and took very few sick days.I set up the lab and maintained the machines.I paid close attention to the needs of my customers.When I was not busy in photo,I worked in other areas of the store.I was employed there for 6.5 years at.Wallgreens ."
good,Day starts off with opening cash register and taking care of customers in anyway that satisfies them.
good,"A typical day at work includes stocking shelves, organizing the back room and front store. It includes of many customers and many of them angry for one reason or another. I have learned to always calm these people down and assess each situation differently. I know that if my employee has made a mistake, it is a great way to retrain and learn from it. My employees love learning from me because I am so patient and I can explain things slow enough so it is understood. They learn from me that I do not take any back lash or tolerate yelling. If you work with me, I gladly work with you. The hardest part of the job for me is that the company requires you to write people up and document ROD's for every employee. These employees do not respond well. They take it so negatively and its about learning not punishment. The most enjoyable part is when I have helped someone either learn something new, or find something they couldn't find. This includes using my recourses at some points and ordering items, calling stores or tracking and order on the computer."
good,"we are only open 5 days a week Monday through Friday, and fill on average 800 scripts per day. definitely the busiest pharmacy in Kansas city. located in the county hospital, so we deal with all types of patients, including some from behavioral health patients. specializing in transplant, aids/hiv and oral oncology. friendly environment. 340b authorized pharmacy. the hardest part of my job is not being able to help those in need, that can't afford their medication  because of a deductible or spend down not being met. i've learned how to rely on my team members more instead of trying to do it all on my own. management is great, but they are limited in what they can offer, the most enjoyable part of my job is how thankful the customers are."
good,"- Ring up customers to be checked out"
good,No two days are ever the same. Good staff of employees. Most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers and being able to be the one my team comes to for answers on any and all situations.
good,"The work wasn't very hard or more so enjoyable, but the people at there try to create a very stressful place by drama and trying to back stab. Seem management didn't know how to handle the real trouble makers."
good,The only thing I loved about Walgreen's was that I had learned so much about the medical field.
good,"Company is cutting back on vacation and sick time"
good,I love working for Walgreens but make sure you getting plenty of sleep and eat a healthy breakfast. You will earn every dime.
good,"I was in-charge of my department.  Ordering and stocking merchandise.  Creating displays, waiting on customers.  I really enjoyed the interaction with customers"
good,"As an assistant manager, I oversaw store operations under the store manager and accomplish tasks that the store manager wants done as well as try to reach the quotas set by the district. The level of productivity depends solely on the store manager and the rest of the crew. I've been with really good store managers that know how to get things done and I've been with store managers that does not seem to have a clear understanding of what is going on and what needs to be done."
good,"Wal-greens is an ok first job exsperience for basic learing on how to stock, unload, and team work"
good,"deliver medical equipment,learning to be on good terms with customers,management did what they thought they had to do,co-workers were good,lifting lox tanks up &down steps was hardest part of job,having good relations with customers. was best part of job"
good,"Long days, great co-workers, hardest part is standing all day."
good,Between managing vendors and delegating daily tasks in a fast paced environment the amount of training and leadership earned is excellent.  The hours will vary week to week and company policy's change every few months.
good,"As a member of Walgreen's management, I am in charge of everything from ringing up Mr. Johnson's daily newspaper to pharmacy operations. It is my duty to reach certain sales goals, while maintaining customer satisfaction. This is achieved through proper leadership and daily direction from our corporate headquarters."
good,Proper social interactions were encouraged. The best part of the job was interacting with different people that shopped at the store.
good,"Responsible for product selection, counting,  measuring  and labeling medications"
good,"I was happy here when i first started, but it slowly starting to become a place that no longer cares for its employees or your longevity there. The people i worked with were great and you started to feel like family there. Advancement opportunities are now being given to people off the street with degrees who have no knowledge of Walgreens or its customers."
good,"Constant moving and assisting customers. Make sure we provide the best customer service, recommend some items and tell them about new products. Every day you see different faces, however you have your regular customers that come in often. You can build relationship with these customers by just talking."
good,"As a ASM the Team members report directly to me. I organize the tasks that need to be done, proiritize the tasks that need to be done first, then assign them to the Team Members. I also train, coach and discipline Team Member when needed. I take care of any customer concerns or complaints the come up."
good,"Basic morning task, Store walks cash handling customer service, stocking planning and team engagement"
good,"A typical day at work is stocking medicines on shelves, typing prescriptions, and filling prescriptions in a timely manner.  I learned that you have to be very alert and you have to know how to multi task working in a fast paced environment.  The hardest part of the job is keeping sick people happy.  I enjoyed my job when I would make a very sick person feel like we care for them and making them happy."
good,"Great co-workers, learned a lot about Walgreens. Also about film development"
good,Walgreens have great benefits and they work with your school schedule.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you encounter. All the lives you come into. Your customers are your family. The cons is that at my job the management was awful. There was no room for advancement if you were not the managers pet in which you had to be to move up. The benefits were good except expensive. And your work and outside life balanced great. we were an 8am-10pm store.
good," Every employee working and giving great customer service."
good,"walgreens is a good company to gain exerience & a good to have as a part time only. at walgreens you work very hard for very little pay. management sucks though, so does the people above them."
good,"Good place to work for, but know room for advancement"
good,ok promotion are hard to come by unless u kiss butt.customer are rude.mgt is lazy
good,I rotated positions in the pharmacy. I was trained to do everything. I helped maintain inventory. I learned how to manage and create a schedule for the staff. My co-workers were an extended family. The most difficult part of work was dealing with angry customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people
good,"multi-tasking is a must, customer service experience comes in handy also. If you are not a people person this job is not for you. The members of management in the store as well as the pharmacy are wonderful. "
good,"Cash handling. Daily checks on coolers , food dates, and back door receiving. Total sales and marketing plan to increases sales. I learned how to build and motivate employee."
good,"Co-workers have changed over the years from the first year of my employment till present time. Sometimes a little hard to understand why the less stressful parts of workflow are difficult for others when rush hour kicks in. A typical day at work is company policy, wait times, and customer service. There is no hard part of the job. I learned at my job that take care of your own customers and question every prescription. Job is serious if the smallest tablet is in the wrong bottle. Check, Check again, then review."
good,Hours varied wildly form 10 to 40 in one week. Company policies were strange and computer systems were often down or broken.
good,"Learned customer service skills and working as a team to make the pharmacy run as smooth as possible. My manager was all about helping the customer as fast and safe as possible. I've enjoyed getting to know the customers that come in on a daily/weekly bases. The hardest part of the job is learning you cant please everyone, if not at all, at the exact moment they want something. One can only do as much as the company allows them to do. "
good,"I only worked there for a month.  It was my Internship."
good,"Decent company to work for in retail. Treatment of employees across the board is decent but varies store to store. Only way to advance it seems is if you are buddy buddy with someone in management. "
good,"Working as part of the service desk for Walgreens can be great if you are made an employee of Walgreens. The company uses a lot of contractors for these roles, which can be unstable when considering the amount of work that can be not available to the service desk. The hours can vary for a service desk employee based upon time with the company. An employee may need to work unusual hours--as late as 12AM--but is offset by working 10 hour shifts for 4 days a week. Everyone seems to be quite friendly and helpful to each other. Some supervisors are more hands-off than others; some like to look over your shoulder. There also seems to be a lack of communication from supervisors and upper management with the employees."
good,"Currently going through store level management restructuring, communications are lacking in what is expected to advance."
good,I have nothing bad to say about my company. I am just looking for a career switch.
good,An environment that encourages growth and advancement from within.
good,Typically I spend my day running a busy touch-screen cash register and restocking three busy aisles of merchandise. Must greet each customer as they arrive even if working with customer at the register. Job requires that you be on your feet for eight hours at a time. Management is not closely involved with activity on the floor and management communication to staff members is sketchy at best. Coworkers are pleasant and usually work with me as a team. Hardest part of the job is the physical demands and a limited meal break. Most enjoyable are my regular customers and social interaction throughout the day.
good,"the most stressfuljob EVER!!! Has great benifits, but as far as the job it's super stressful!"
good,"Working for Walgreens was a great to learn about customer service, the operations of retail, and a great learning experience. I would like to further my education in a more rewarding career."
good,I greatly enjoyed working with the customers that came into our store and it was a great job while working my way through school.
good,Clean up the front and make sure it is safe for the customers. I learned to listen and watch for cues from all of those that were around myself. Management was a little confusing because they multiple Assistant Managers with each giving different orders. My co-workers were great. They always helped out if you were falling behind while working the front register by yourself. Taking vacation days was impossible and they would tell you cannot have them. I loved the customers that came in and working with everyone there.
good,"Very comfortable place to work, advancement looked questionable."
good,On a typical day i'll try to work my hardest and be a good worker enjoying my work.
good,"Walgreens has a great set of management that are responsive to employee's needs and concerns. I'm generally on the front register and interact with customers. That's the best part of the job, helping people check out, suggested selling to them and making them smile."
good,but it was a good one. it was a night position.... and yet again their was cleaning to do. but over all I like the job!
good,"lifting up to 50 pounds by myself, managing employees, helping customers with needs, filling prescriptions, counting money"
good,Working at Walgreens pharmacy is challenging yet rewarding. The days are hetic at a busy location and during the night customer flow is random. Managers work hard and ensure the best out of workers while the customers that frequent the store look to bond and make connections with the employees they see on a regular basis.
good,"A typical day at work as an Assistant Manager- First is going over with the store manager what the plan of action is for the day and what work I will be delegating out to my staff. After that it's busy, busy, busy, with costumer calls, returns, money pickups, receiving, etc.. I'm definitely not complaining. Being busy makes the day go by much faster. My co-workers are a joy to work and be around with. But being an Assistant Manager could sometimes get tough when you actually have to put your foot down and let the a member of the staff know when they did something wrong, or when they haven't met expectations. But they are very understanding when that happens. My staff make it easy to be in my position. I've learned that the Costumers are always right and when you take care of them they actually take care of you. Many costumers are regulars and they know some personal things in my life as well as I in theirs. I have some costumers who will bring baked goods for Christmas or even my birthday! I will definitely miss my staff and the friendly faces of costumers when I do leave."
good,It's a fast paced kind of job. You must have a good personality as well as a good sense of humor to get throughout the day.
good,"photo lab, cashier, stock shelves, most of the employees are nice"
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work,i love my co-workers and especially my customers. My customers are apart of the reason i'm still thier. When i first moved to dallas a little over 4 yrs now Walgreens was my first and only job and i have been apart of the family 4 yrs now. I started off as a service clerk,a photo clerk,a floor clerk and finaly my resting place is management so as you can read Walgreens has been a blessing."
good,"Walgreens overall is a good company as far as the benefits and employees are concerned. The employees are wonderful and so are some the management team. A typical day would be a lot of ripping and running assisting customers in which I loved every minute of it. But when it came down to an employee being injured, they treated that employee very badly with no understanding. I understand that Walgreen's is a business and they had to look at the business point of view, but when you have an employee that shows up to work every day pain or no pain, that employee should be shown the utmost respect because they are showing loyalty to the company as well as their team mates. They assist the management with no question and go beyond the call of duty or what's required of them. The hardest part is working with the third parties trying to get approval for certain medications and constantly receiving rejections for it. If a patient pays their premium every month like they suppose to they should not have problems getting their prescriptions. I enjoy my customers because they are such a delight. They appreciate good service and they keep on coming back and they bring other members in their family with them."
good,"Walgreens is a great company to always work at for starters. I would say most of the managers are friendly and helpful. Just recently they've had budget cuts especially on hours, hiring, promoting, and pay cuts. Working in the pharmacy dept. is hectic depending on the location, there is a high volume of prescriptions and customers."
good,work varied from day to day and from employee changes which were occuring more often than i would like. i feel walgreens helped me to learn a lot about the pharmacy world and enjoy meeting and caring about the customers that i helped. i am great with people and enjoy helping them.
good,i enjoyed working here part of the management team was absolutly great and the other part were scared to death to do the right thing cause they were afraid that they were going to be fired! the hardest part of my job there was having to clean up messes in the incoming trailers where the drivers had been careless and spilled the product!
good,A typical day a work was productive.
good,"Prepare to work non stop from the time you clock in, until you clock out.There is always something to be done, which is a good thing for those of us who do not like to be idle."
good,Six years ago the company would of received all stars from me in every aspect how ever as the culture and strategic management structure changes the company is loosing the people who make this company what it is...
good,"A typical day would include customer service, balancing the budget, checking the floor for out of stocks and making sure things are properly labeled. Daily huddles with the employees to ensure everyone is focused and communication between levels is enabled."
good,Enjoyed working with pharmacy staff and customers were repeat shoppers and mostly friendly. Would have changed the work schedule to allow for one RPh to work longer shifts to allow for the same person to be present during the open hours on that particular day.
good,This job has great benefits. The most difficult part of the job is the constant standing. No training.. Some of the managers are extremely wonderful and some are not. Typical day is fast paced..hold on and be ready if not you will not make it.
good,i really love the people i work with except management they need to better train them.
good,A typical day at work was very busy but yet fun to keep entertained. I learned how to communicate with people and how to work a cash register. The management were okay. The co-workers were so-so. The hardest part of the job was sometimes keeping up without complaints and being the only one on register. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers who were cool and calm.
good,I work a set schedule doing inventory and making sure certain tasks are successful. I oversee the photo department and perishable food products.
good,"I was a cashier, stock person, unload trucks, label all items that needed new labels, great and help all customers."
good,There are no typical days at Walgreens. I welcomed all challenges. My co workers and I always worked together to get tasks accomplished. I didn't find anything difficult about any of my job titles while at Walgreens. I enjoyed being able to work with so many good people from different backgrounds. My favorite part of the job was helping customers.
good,"First I go through my department to see what needs to be done and write a list. I then see if my manager have any more important jobs to be done and go forward from there. My job consists of customer service, placing displays, cashiering, resets, helping to unload truck and stocking shelves. In management I supervise one other co-worker by writing lists for he or she to complete when I am not there and make sure that they have followed through the next day."
good,"ok, but not for a long term career. Good for someone just getting started."
good,"Everyday was a different day in retail seasons and day to day living are always changing. I would say the most enjoyable part of my job was to help the customers and see that they were happy to get the help. My co-workers were a great team. I learned from this job that people are really great in this world, all they want is a little kindness."
good,cleaning and maintaing store daily operations
good,"I worked the front cashier most days ,other times I worked the sales floor satisfying customers needs"
good,Great team to work for but everyone tends discuss everyone weakness and problems with everyone else besides the person that needs to know what there doing wrong..other than that its an okay company.
good,Walgreens has always been caring and helpful toward their patients and wanting to make sure that they take full care of all the needs of their patients.
good,"I worked as a cashier and store stock associate. Helped customers, stocked shelves, handled money. Management was decent, but job wasnt for me."
good,Really busy very engaged with customers if working register.
good,Is a ok place to work I was at the busyest one in Jacksonville
good,pleasant environment
good,"While I learned a lot on how to pull expired medications, fill medications, use a weight pill counter, due to the fact that i was not an actual employee of the store, i was not allowed to interact with the customers with the exception of telling them someone would be with them in a moment. i loved the people I worked with and wished i could have learned more on the computer. However, i left the externship with confidence of knowing what i was doing for the most part."
good,"good company,allow internal developement ang growth,good compensation."
good,Walgreens recently released plans to change their management system that does not include my current position. The company is a still a strong place to work. I enjoy dealing with different customers and being able to train new and current employees on the standards of the company.
good,Stressful environment being in one of two 24 hour pharmacies and dealing with people
good,I have been with Walgreens for 2 1/2 years and I really enjoy going to work. The customers are the best.
good,"I have nothing negative to say regarding my professional management experience with Walgreens. I have only gained superior knowledge and experience, in many different aspects working for Walgreens including; inventory management, money management, listening to and solving customer issues under the pressure of time while delivering customer satisfaction in a professional manner, maintaining business relationships with current vendors, while building new business relationships, and scheduling labor distribution among a staff of 50+ employees, while recognizing the cultural diversities of my staff, and adhering to their differences in needs. As an Assistant Manager with Walgreens, part of the job requirement was being transferred to multiple locations for different periods of time. Movement from one store to another brought great challenges to the job. For example, each store manager ran his/her store a bit differently, and it was required to learn and adapt to these changes in protocol. Geographical change meant change in clientele. Learning to know your customers and differences in needs was a challenge. Store Security. Not every store had onsite law enforcement, so protecting your store, inventory, and most important, honest customers, from criminal activity was a challenge, meanwhile executing your expected job duties at hand. These job challenges however, only strengthened my professional skills and attributes, as well as, influenced my personal character in a strong, positive way. I have only gained from these experiences. The best part of the job was the sense of ""family"""
good,"What I enjoyed most about working at Walgreens is the opportunity to meet all kinds of people. I liked interacting with the customers and my co-workers. I learned how to operate a cash register, how to display merchandise, how to mark down sale items, how to stock shelves, maintain an area of the stock room and prepare the store for the next day. The hardest part of the job was the 9 and 10 hour shifts that I was required to work, standing the whole time except for a 30 minute lunch break and maybe a 15 minute break and the fact that Walgreens is open 365 days a year so you have to work on the holidays. There was not a lot of training so most of my training was on the job."
good,"Walgreens is a job where you have to have a routine. Every morning I write daily notes for my staff to complete, followed by me checking email from my supervisor to see if any other projects need to be started and/or completed. I have learned different ways to manage employees based on their needs and their learning ways and abilities. The most difficult thing that I have to deal with are the irrate customers. When the customer cant get solutions from my staff I am the problem solver. Depending on the customer, some situations are more complex than others. On the flip side, I love to be able to put a smile on my customers' face by any means...helping them find an item to special ordering products and picking them up from other locations."
good,"Typical day would consist of straightening the store, cashing customers out, assisting incoming calls and directing, receiving warehouse on a weekly basis and price changes for weekly sales."
good,For the most part it was a really neat job....I liked my co-workers. I wish the some managers were a little more professional.
good,"horrible hours , staff lazy and doing other things besides working, pay roll always was messed up and the management was never there when needed"
good,"Walgreens is currently restructuring to look like many other big box retail stores. There may be more room for advancement in the next couple of years, but there are little to none right now."
good,"I started out as a cashier, then got promoted to Photo Lab and got a .20 raise. I started out at minimum wage or $7.25 got my 6 month raise. My final per hour wage is $8.80. I applied for the assistant manager, but because I was a current employee, I would get another 20 cent raise, however if I was another employee other than Walgreen and applied for this position, I would have gotten $10/hr. My duties would include opening/closing, count end of day money and deposit the money in safe. I love my Photo Lab Department"
good,I am afraid I really couldn't recommend working there. The stress level is so high in almost all departments that the pay and benefits just don't seem to be enough.
good,"This company has job positions that barely break routine which means you can easily apply yourself to the work, and create some opportunities for advancement. The hard work you put in sometimes feel as if your not be noticed and will probably never get a promotion."
good,"The company as a whole is making extreme changes, creating a more competitive workplace. Unfortunately, because of the current economic situation there have been job cuts. I am currently working toward a degree, the company has been very flexible with my schedule."
good,Summer internship gave me management experience as well as retail experience.
good,"Within less than 2 years, I was offered a promotion and would of been promoted again in less than 2 additional years. The company was growing at record speed during that time."
good,"Overall walgreens is a great place to work, the company focuses on customer service, and personalizing experiences with customers to set them apart from places like rite aid, walmart, cvs, etc"
good,I enjoyed my time there. Most of the people I worked with were nice and it was a pretty easy job that paid well.
good,"Benefits are great, especially if you have a family. Profit sharing is excellent, something you would definitely want to invest in. Many people that I worked with had been with the company for many years, learning and building relationships comes very easily. And they have excellent on the job training."
good,"Walgreen's at a store level is a great place to work for those looking to start working in a retail format. The environment in the store depends on your location, the store that I worked at was the one of my home town, so it worked out great for me. The pay, however is minimal to those at the same position in other companies and has had been changing healthcare every year since I have been working there. Also, hours are hard, this is due to the store being open late all year around and on holidays. Also, since I have been working with the company advancement has been being reduced. This is because stores have not been opening as much in recent years, so there is not room to promote employees. The job is secure at this point though. Overall, Walgreen's is a great place to work if you are looking for a good starting management job to gain experience and can wait for promotions as long as candidates do not mind working late hours and holidays."
good,"For a first time job it's definitely pretty good, doesn't require a lot of skill and definitely has a lot of opportunity for advancement. Unfortunately after a while it just becomes a lot of doing the same thing everyday, so the job as a whole can become pretty boring."
good,Me ayudo a desenvolverme en el ámbito de farmacia.
good,Work is similar to any pharmacy. Counting and cashing out prescriptions is the main job. The company itself doesn't want to use too many hours resulting in under-staffing and people not getting hours unless full time
good,"I enjoyed my time at Walgreens, but we were always understaffed and SO busy. We weren’t given enough budget hours. Also, corporate has all these tasks that have to be completed every day, and it’s almost impossible with the normal workload we already have to deal with- not to mention helping 30 customers every 35 minutes. Workflow is not carried out properly and I would get stuck at one station for over half my shift while others would stay in the back filling scripts (avoiding customers)"
good,"a typical day at work includes either working in the photo department for most of the day or checking out customers. Depending on which shift is given, Pulling ad tags, garbage, and restocking along with straightening the shelves are key things to be done. The ability to multi-task is a must. Overall, I recommend this job for students in college since they have many locations nationwide, and they consider the fact that you are a college student and always attempt to work with your schedule."
good,Lots of opportunity for growth if you are willing to put in the effort. Gaining experience and certifications in the pharmacy will set you apart from other employees for advancement.
good,Very family Centered  job. I’ve always have flexible hours and understanding managers pay needs to be a little bit better getting promote it needs to be more involved.
good,"In the beginning everything was well all of my associates were welcoming and kind, but as time went on my managers began to take advantage of my kindness. Also, after I graduated high school and went on to start college classes they began to schedule me times when I wasn’t available and that is why unfortunately I wasn’t able to further my future with the company!"
good,My time at Walgreens everything was well all of my associates were welcoming and kind. After I graduated high school and went on to start college classes they began to schedule me times when I wasn’t available and that is why unfortunately I wasn’t able to further my future with the company!
good,"Been with the company a while, unfortunately this job title doesn’t have very flexible hours, not great for students. Being a beauty consultant also comes with a lot of rules and restrictions that other employees do not have. You’ll receive amazing trainings. A very sales driven job, along with free makeovers to customers."
good,"I loved working there when I started. Great atmosphere, advancement opportunities, among many other things. Over the years budget cuts have factored into a lot of difficulties. I still enjoy working there, but workload has gotten out of balance."
good,"Standing the entire day makes it a little tiring, I learned many technical skills, management was nice for the most part, workplace culture was good, hardest part of the job is truck shipments, most enjoyable part of the job are events such as pot lucks and employee get togethers"
good,They need to be more understanding when it comes to things like a srock. Other than that it was a great company to work for and the people were great.
good,"A lot of ways to move up in the company. But theres only one way up when you are a manager, hat is training to be a store manager or district manager.  As assistant manager work life balance is really hard. Great company to work for if you don't have a family. Required to work 44 hours as assistant manager. As ASM, you do get moved around to different stores often. Store is open on holidays."
good,It could treat employees better and have better incentives. Bonuses for more than just the store manager employee appreciation. Better decision making how stretching the company so thin without financial gain
good,"Management and assistants are replaced/moved around to different stores often, which makes the rest of the employees have to get used to a new way of doing things. Interns and other school related students are placed under certain staff and need hands on experience."
good,Just need better communication and better pay. The workers are really nice and they became like another family. I do have my favorites that I worked with.
good,Walgreens was a great company to work for when I started 13 years ago. Since then they have changed so many things reflecting the happiness of all it's employees.
good,I was working at the Walgreens for one of my high school class. So I wasn’t getting paid so I can’t really give a good rates on there pay. It was good working experience though.
good,its just a job that paid the bills that it is have nothing else to say managers are harsh and robotic. sorry did not have a good experience here have no idea what to say
good,"Walgreens was a good company.  Our team however did not have a clearly defined goal, tools or a product to sell.  We were hired to test the market and it was finally determined there was not an interest with large employers for our relationships."
good,"Walgreens is a good college job and has potential to be a career, but lots of issues in corporate make things difficult and the pay is getting unreasonable.  Work/Life balance is decent if you have a good manager, and there can be drama.  Also, there are lots of good life/work experiences here...useful in all aspects since this is a Fortune 500 Company (for now).  Lots of employers hire you just because you have Walgreens training."
good,I wouldn’t recommend this for a long term job but very flexible and creative environmentA great learning tool for beginners in the corporate world and great opportunity to be certified in the pharmacy to be able to move on to better opportunity
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work if you the time to wait and move up. However, you only get 1 raise a year and it is not worth all the things you go through on a day to day basis."
good,"I don’t know if there under new management but the managers that did work there were really rude , the workers were really nice and everyone is a team player"
good,"5 or so years ago, the company was growing rapidly and quite a wonderful opportunity, and this was even more so true 20 years ago when my manager started. Nowadays the budgets are slashed, workload has increased considerably and compensation has decreased."
good,"Its was okay, not the best management depending on which shift lead you worked with. Co-workers were really nice, made time pass quick. Made lost of friends."
good,Is such a great experience working in Walgreens. A day at work is pretty hard because people don't help you much but everything you have to do is to have a positive vibe about it.
good,"The pay is ok, the corporate management is ok most of the time, the benefits are good, you can advance in the store pretty easily but once you're in pharmacy the only way to move up is to become a pharmacist."
good,"A good review includes enough detail to give others a feel for what happened. Explain which factors contributed to your positive, negative or just so-so experience. You might also offer your view on what the company is doing well, and how they can improve. But keep things friendly and courteous!"
good,"work life balance was good, however company is going through restructuring. So, jobs are not secure.  Direct supervisor was really good, worked with team and was accessible."
good,"My review would be that you have to have patience with customers, particularly if they are angry and insistent. That is one hard aspect of the job. The second would be prepared to work holidays, nights and weekends. The management staff is definitely the best."
good,"It is a hard job to work in the pharmacy. There is a lot that you have to put up with and you truly have to be a people person to do a retail job every day. You have to be able to multitask and run around without feeling like you're over-stressed and underpaid (which you most likely are), not to mention having to deal with customers who yell at you for mistakes that aren't the pharmacy's fault."
good,"I liked my time at Walgreens, my co workers were great, little town of Kuna. We were fairly busy all the time, nice pay, nice hours. The worst thing about it was Candi... The general manager.... Shes a nightmare! Didn't care about her employees, she would single someone out for the silliest things, DEFINITELY had her favorite employees. Walgreens as a whole is wonderful, they should have better taste in who they promote."
good,"There is no one that that's close to being God,  that is what the MANAGER thinks he's at the store I worked  at !!! I disagree with his statement😐😑."
good,Its was an ok job. I learn a-lot of thing about customer service and stocking.  The management was a little bit weird but i gotten pretty used it. easy
good,"Typical day at work begins and ends with facing the store, making sure everything is clean. Greeting customers and meeting their needs. The most enjoyable part for me was working in cosmetics and meeting sales for bonuses."
good,"My experience at Walgreens has been great, although not the best work environment that I have been in previously. Very flexible hours, understanding and supportive coworkers, birthday parties every month to show that management cares about employees."
good,"put out the news paper,"
good,"Being in retail pharmacy is difficult at times and nearly always very busy. You must be able to practice patience with patients, because they can become frustrated easily when it concerns their healthcare. The most difficult part of the job is customer service, due to it being retail. However, the most enjoyable part of the job is working with amazing people that become long-term friends."
good,My only real problem with this company is it's productivity is barely reachable and the company expects too much out of its employees. Other then that it is an okay place to work.
good,"Being a pharmacist technician can be hard due to the average consumers lack of knowledge of how their health insurance works. Customers often lash out on pharmacy technicians when their insurance won't cover a medication or when they have to wait for a prior authorization to come through. That being said your pharmacist and co workers make this job a great place to work or a horrible place, i was lucky to have great co workers and a pharmacist that would not tolerate customer abuse of the technicians."
good,"There were no set positions available; you could work a cashier shift to a stocking/pushing shift, to beauty to photo. When we got a new assistant manager, the work environment negatively shifted."
good,"If you like getting your soul sucked out of your body daily for bad pay, you’ll like it. I honestly loved all my co-workers at Walgreens but that is pretty situational"
good,"No fixed schedule, you get one 15 minute break and 1 thirty minute unpaid lunch break, you usually work 8 hour shift depending on your position. If you are managment you don't  get breaks you eat on the go.."
good,"Walgreens in general is a good place to work at if they wouldn’t be cutting hours all the time. Depending the managers, they might make you do more than what you were hired for. Making me feel like I’m not getting paid enough for what I do."
good,"Overall I enjoy the atmosphere of my workplace and the people i work with, but the lack of communication with management and a functioning work central makes certain aspects very hard to accomplish."
good,"Some days are full of problems, and other days it run's smoothly. The best days are when a good technician is scheduled. The worst days are when you are down a tech or left alone with no technician and no back up at all. Good luck going to the bathroom on those days! Luckily, those bad days happen less than the good days."
good,Provided a good learning experience while still a student.  Recommendation is to work at least 2-3 days a week to properly get a handle of day to day operations.
good,good work place if you can handle being busy for your whole shift. I enjoy working with the customers though. It feels good knowing that I am part of the reason they continue to use our store.
good,"Typical day involves checking in to manager and asking what needs to be done which range from stocking, filling, or scanning outs. Same thing every day."
good,"It was a pretty good team that I was working with on a daily basis. After I got accustomed to their norma and how to correctly do my assignments, the culture seemed to slightly fray."
good,Walgreens is an ok place to work if that is what you want to do with your life but it is very boring if you are not interested in doing that kind of work
good,Providing Customer Service at all times was necessary at all times.  At times it could be a challenge due to customers requests.  Thankfully there were several options we offered to our customers.
good,"Depends on the store, but management does vary both in a good way and bad way. Hard labor job with taking in a truck of merchandise to assisting customers all at the same time."
good,It's a job but management is horrible and they are always under staffed. Scheduling is good but walgreens policies are horrible.If you need a decent job this is it.
good,Its a good first job but it is not a place to stay. It is minimum wage and it limits growth. Nonetheless it is an easy job and the hours CAN be flexible and the coworkers are typically nice.
good,"It is not something to do as a career, but it is good for a part-time job. Pay is about as expected for the job and it is just like any other retail job. Not too good, not too bad"
good,"Very good place to work, especially if you’re a student. They work with your school schedule as long as you give them notice. Pretty decent work invorenment, but of course you have you’re terrible managers and customers."
good,"Walgreens could do better at treating it's employees better. Walgreens could do better at relaying messages to the employees."
good,This Walgreens was warehouse/headquarters. you worked hard from start to finish. I Started here in 2001. The pay was $10. in my opinion they could have payed a little more. one 30 min lunch 2 15 min breaks. 10 hour shifts.
good,"Long hours of work when scheduled, PTO (paid time off) is offered. Easy training classes. Walgreens offers employees an opportunity to move up to the pharmacy, providing classes and proper training."
good,"I worked in the pharmacy, so it is very fast paced, I learned quite a bit at this company, It has been years since I've worked here so it's hard for me to review them."
good,"If you aren't in management, more than likely you will not get full time hours. The hours are cut frequently. Be prepared to work your butt off because that's what it will take to keep the store running properly and looking decent. Tags and truck are never ending. Good luck."
good,"There is never a moment when you are not on the phone or talking to a patient. You must be able to multitask, trying to help patients and complete management responsibilities simultaneously. You will always have nice customers and angry customers everyday. How you feel about your job every day can depend on who you work with."
good,"For such a large corporation, this company is so focused on money and not enough on employee-relations and patient care.  However, they have wonderful job advancements, offer pretty good benefits, plus profit-sharing.  Overall I'd say its a good place to work if you can overlook the big corp politics."
good,walgreens was understaffed. they never had enough employees to handle the work load. also they refused to hire more help! we were always fighting to get orders done as well as what doctors sent in!
good,"Bottom line is above everything. If you have strong ethics and strive to adhere to evidence based medicine, you will struggle working in this environment.  Patients will complain and you will be reprimanded for adhering to your ethics and belief in EBM.  EBM does not sit well with a lot of laypersons who have spent a lifetime being misinformed, overtreated and coddled by a weak healthcare system."
good,"good place to gain experience, very helpful staff and good management. need to pay more for the employees. good work life balance. great team to work with"
good,A typical day at work is assisting customers with their needs and ensuring the store is well stocked and neat. I learned quite a bit about customer service and how to work efficiently.
good,"My issues with Walgreens is that the company requires a lot, but then won't let their employees actually do what is required. I'm tired of being told not to do out dates or stocking."
good,"Everyone in the pharmacy got along. Most of the techs were around the same age so it was easy. The patients were horrible. It was a major factor why I left. Since everyone got along though, it made the work bearable. I learned how to interact with customers and how to be an effective mutlitasker."
good,"Chaotic, confusion, uncertainty, stressful. Pretty much how retail works. Would not recommend to those seeking a meaningful career. Perfect for goal oriented mountain climbers."
good,Good at employing a variety of people. My manager is not good at making a set schedule ahead of time. Last minute requests to work at one of the stores to get hours.
good,I had many days in which I felt great teamwork and sense of worth within this position. It was very challenging and had many tasks in which you can rotate so that it doesn't feel monotonous or mundane. Great place to work.
good,I've worked with this company for years and an obvious change has happened. They no longer care for their employees and they are constantly trying to find ways to save money.
good,"Work was enjoyable but very busy at first. As years passed by, the company turned for the worst in my opinion. One thing that I was not fond was that as employee, we don't have much say in company matter. Pharmacy Supervisor moved staffs to different store without discussion."
good,I was a manager for two years and had good experience working. All the employees were helpul and I learned a lot. The reason I had to leave the job necause I had gotten into Graduate school.
good,Great place to work at and they are always willing to work with you. Morale seems to be a little low as they sometimes expect to keep a high level of customer service while cutting hours
good,"I only been working there 2 years and since day 1 I been learning new skills. The atmosphere was good, customers friendly and funny. The head pharmacist was cool teaching was strict but overall good. Some of the employees weren’t very welcoming acted childish at times but that’s life I guess."
good,Only work here if you need a job or are in high school. There isn't enough for me to say about working here for me to write one hundred and fifty characters.
good,I enjoy my job with the exception of the constant stream of store managers in and out of the store.  The inconsistency of standards set by these managers and by the district manager makes it hard to run the retail side.
good,"I worked at a specific location as a pharmacy intern for many years. It is quite an rewarding experience and opportunity to grow in terms of community and cashier functions. However, not so much in a clinical sense (which is to be expected). There are quite several instances where patient care comes into play with patients asking about OTC products, but that is about it. Hours are not flexible and hours given have been very limited. Staff is very over-worked in my opinion and needs more hands during store hours. Quality of life drops in these instances and more benefits need to be considered seriously. But overall I had a great staff and team behind me at the time and welcome the experience for all students to try."
good,"the saying ""A bad manager can ruin a great employee"" fits here. the changing of store managers happens so much the cant get settled and then bad managers try to tell seasoned employees how to do their jobs"
good,"The people that work there were the main reason i stayed so long. Some times did not get breaks or lunches. Fast paced and short staffed, high turn over."
good,"I worked at five different stores and each store had it's pros and cons. Regardless of them, the store vibe itself was always dependent on the store manager and their relationships with employees. "
good,"During my time working at Walgreens I was also a student. I came in  when I could and the management was good about working around my schedule. I did a lot of different things on the job. They train you pretty much everywhere in the store, which I see as becoming very well-rounded and gave me the ability to do whatever I was asked. I normally worked in the photo department, which meant customer service, dealing with the printers and printing software, as well as building photo items themselves. Overall, I loved the atmosphere and the workplace as a whole."
good,"As a Pharm Tech everyday was fast paced and hectic. I learned a lot along the way. Ex: How insurance work, What each drug does, What a controlled substance is, how to resolve issues with doctors and medicine etc. The hardest  part was dealing with patients everyday that needed drugs. The biggest quality i took away from the job was how to remain calm and productive in a stressful environment."
good,This is a job that you have to take for what it is. Your just a number to them and they will work you and expect your life to revolve around them. You will be well compensated for your time though with a good salary and great benefits. At least in management positions. Can’t speak for other positions
good,Was a good place to work but it was stressful that you were always worried about the pharmacy getting robbed. And that you filled the prescription was filled with the right medication.
good,I don't have too many complaints about this job. There were great advancement opportunities and lots of available hours. Sometimes the managers wouldn't honor days that you had requested off.
good,"Walgreens continuously adds more to do while cutting hours and giving less time to do the job.   Very low pay but good benefits.  They are constantly trying to help employees be more ""engaged"" when in reality all we want is fair pay."
good,Our management is fair to the workers. They will work with you for family members with time off. Understand when you can't make it in being a single parent   And all the workers get together.
good,"Depending on management, working as a CSA can be very stressful at some times. I do enjoy working there on most days, but there are some days that are not as pleasurable to work there."
good,Over all there was too much work for the amount of staff. There where also patients that complained frequently about the time it took us to complete the work. The only positive thing was the people I worked with were kind and understanding.
good,It's a good place to work overall and I got good pay.  Some of the other employees were very good.  There was some injustice that led to my termination.
good,"I had opportunity to grow, started out as part time & eventually became an ASM. Follow their rules & policies or you will lose your job. Be aware of their rules & policies."
good,"My first 5 plus years there were great. I was able to grow my career and expand my skillset under terrific management."
good,"Opening a Walgreen store requires being the first one there, counting the bank, putting out cash registers, receive merchandise and put it up on the floors, changing sale items tags and managing staff. I learn how to manage many departments under one umbrella. The culture was based on young staff that were mostly unreliable. The hardest part of my job was receiving merchandise when there went a male figure to help. The most enjoyable part of this job is reaching the projected sales of the day and week."
good,"I love being a pharmacy technician, but in such a small workplace like this you have to love and get along with everyone that you work with since you are constantly having to communicate with one another. Love working here, but some of the rules that corporate tries to push forward are completely unrealistic."
good,"Greeting customers, taking scripts , filling them, insurance, telephone experiencs, making the customer first ! Treating customers the way I would want to be treated."
good,"I really enjoy my coworkers in the pharmacy, the management could definitely use some work. There is no clear line of communication. In this area the customers are difficult."
good,"Managers need help. It us hard to handle customers, pharmacy, and unruly associates when you have 3, 2 , and sometimes 1 associates to work with. Other than that, it was okay"
good,"I worked at Walgreens for 2 ½ years. I genuinely enjoyed my time there. The hours are flexible, the people I worked with were easy to get along with, though I am told, that is not the case everywhere. My main issue with the company is that even though they employee adults, they do not offer full time. This is beyond troubling because as someone that has rent, car payments etc, I don’t want to fight for hours when I’m considered full time. Full time for Walgreens is 30+ hours, which is not full time. You are not allowed to even hit 40 hours, you would be forced to leave early on the final day of the pay period. Even store leadership is not given full time. (Only the Assistant Store Manager and Store Manager)"
good,"good place to work, fun, lots to learn, friendly customer service, on the other hand, too much drama goes on. overall, lots of experience and plenty of hours"
good,"It used to be nice to work there but the culture changed. More profit centered, more push for cuts all the time from pay cuts, benefits, staffing and inventory etc. The drive for more profits before was through increased sales and excellent customer service not paying employee less."
good,here all i did was fill scripts as part of a intern so i cant really say on the overall work place. but everyone seemed to work so hard to make it a productive work place.
good,I had an emergency happen within my family so I had to take a leave of absence and ended up having to quit.  The staff were all very understanding of my situation.
good,"I enjoyed doing endstands , promotion aisle and resets.  Doing customer service make sure store was clean. Managing store when manager was gone. Doing cash reports."
good,Loved working for them I worked there for two years. My store manager was AMAZING. I learned a lot. I was able to receive my license for pharmacy tech as a shift lead.
good,Working at walgreens was a pretty nice and easy going job. It teaches you how to interact with people on a daily basis and teaches unique problem solving skills.
good,The enjoyable part about the job is interacting with other customers and getting to know other people. Putting new product on the shelve and learning new things with resets.
good,This is a fast paced job. It is very stressful. If you are considering this job you will probably want to have prior experience as there is little time to train new employees correctly.
good,My first pharmacy technician job. Walgreens was a decent place to work the staff at my location were very varying in degrees of skills making it seem like some of the staff does much more work than the other members which can be annoying. Full time status only guarantees 30 hours which I found quite odd. Walgreens corporate doesn't ever seem to acknowledge store success rather decides to increase the target of metric or change metrics entirely when the goal has been accomplished. Overall and okay experience just not very far to go up from a pharmacy technician position.
good,"A solid job that pays above the competition. Typical day of work includes completing cash systems, delegating work, walking store for opportunities, fixing payroll issues, creating schedules, and other front-end optimization that occurs within stores."
good,"The atmosphere has a lot to do with whether or not walgreen's will be a nice, stress-free job, or a stressful and frustrating place of work. The store I worked at was one of the busiest in the area, but we were lucky to have a great store manager, and staff that actively engaged in appropriate, friendly work relationships. As a company, walgreen's does not pay its employees what they are worth. Over the course of three year i had only made a 56 cent increase in pay, a coworker had only made a cent increase in the course of a year."
good,"had to work hard and fast. you have to help the customers while putting up stock, cleaning the store, and helping the managers with other tacks assigned."
good,"Perfect place to work if under 16-18 or middle aged. Fast and efficient work environment, really busy. Have a set schedule before addressing availability."
good,Always understaffed and high expectations. I have learned how to use my time wisely to satisfy customers. Everyday is always busy because there is always something to do. The hardest part of the job is to satisfy everyone with limited amount of resources.
good,Fun and relaxed most of the time. Some people skills are needed. The customers can be hard to deal with. The coworkers willing to teach new skills and explore new areas. The management is very helpful. I learned a lot about medicine and insurances working there. Long hours and different shifts every week.
good,"During overnight shifts there was plenty to do to keep my cashier and I busy all night long. Our first goal each night was to complete store condition; tasks included in that would be: cleaning bathrooms, taking out garbage, putting all product back in its place, straightening every aisle of store, filling empty spaces with product from stockroom, filling cooler and freezer, checking food dairy product out-dates, checking monthly product out-dates. Once through store condition there could be any number of goals to accomplish, from processing a truck delivery, to putting out new sale tags, building displays, pulling overstock carts etc. The most enjoyable part of the Overnight Shift Lead was being able to complete a lot of tasks and have the time to do each one well. The most difficult part of the job was also completing all of the tasks and doing them each well. Sometimes the workload could seem daunting, but working the overnight shift taught me how to delegate and prioritize better."
good,"I liked my coworkers and managers but this is a highly stressful job. Many customers are great but the company tends to allow the awful ones abuse their employees. Also, I don't believe that the company does enough to protect employees from robbers. They will pay you to earn your tech permit as well as your national certification which makes it worth the trouble. Don't ever pay a college to earn your permit."
good,Walgreens was a good place to work until we had a new district manager. He was the worst district manager ever. Engaged in favoritism. You had the ability to train and coach employees and manage your store.
good,"Working at Walgreen's is a good experience's where you can become intimate with your workers. I like the team I worked with because we helped, laughed and looked out for one another. There are some pits. Walgreen's is just what it is a local store with a Pharmacy and as a Pharmacy Technician there is no room for growth and they tend to do there way. Hate being the new kid (lol) because you are mainly what it seems to be stuck filling. Overall good place depending on location."
good,Its a good company to work for..but it doesn't always give the right resources to get the job or tasks giving to be completed in a timely manner.And not enough hrs weekly
good,We always started with a meeting and took our positions filling prescriptions or handing out medications. We always worked closely with the client with exceptional customer service.
good,"its a typical retail job, hard work, constantly on your feet, always something to do, but if you worked hard and did what you were suppose to do the management would let you do your own thing as long as the job got done"
good,"Management had the backbone to handle customers, worked with my school schedule, and pay was reasonable for a cashier position. Upper management decisions typically had little to no impact on entry levels roles other than when they expanded the beauty department. All-in-all was not a bad place to work."
good,"Relaxed atmosphere. Many classes and training are available to take. Near downtown and great food and shopping near by. "
good,A typical day at work is helping customers cleaning the stores and making sure that the aisles are stocked. I learned how to deal with people and be professional in a customer service environment Management was helpful and encouraging. The hardest part of the job was the late hours you sometimes had to work. The most enjoyable part was the discounts.
good,Great job if you are in the right store. Some managers are sloppy and do not care for their employees while others are absolutely amazing. They paid well with opportunities to grow if wanted. Really just depends on what store and what manager/ assistant manager you are working with. In 3 years I had 2 different managers and 6 different assistant managers.
good,"Walgreens does not pay their employees competative rates and asks way too much of them...Department heads get paid as much as cashiers with 5x the responsibility."
good,I work hard to help customers and get work done but there is a lack of team work. People do not seem to care and help each other out and not helping customers out. I love to help people but I get tired to always working doing what I am suppose to be doing while my team members ldo not hardly do any work and just talk all day. The managers do not care and there is favortism at my store. I am tired of it.
good,Fast pace job.
good,"Poor management but overall a good place. A typical day was very easy and I could balance my school and work life. The pay is good, but they started to cut my hours."
good,"For the most part I enjoy working here, and like the members of management. However, there are no set schedules and my schedule is all over the place. As well as the fact that I applied for full time, and as of yet they have failed to schedule me enough in one week to constitute that job title. Benefits kick in after 60 days on the job, however I will not be able to access these benefits because you must average 30 hours a week to qualify, and with my current schedule I won't. This is customer service job that will require you to clean bathrooms/ sweep floors and those are job duties I do not wish to preform any longer."
good,"Walgreens employs a wide array of people. I made a ton of friends and had a lot of fun working with them. The work was easy, but it could get hectic. It was not fun when the store was busy."
good,Very productive and repetitive routines on a daily bases. Hardest part being nothing really at all. Enjoying the team members working as a unit to get the job done in a timely manner.
good,"I've leaned so much from working at Walgreens and was able to interact with so many people from all different walks of life. The typical day at work is generally greeting customers making sure your section is clean and faced. Their main focus is really customer experience and surveys.  As far as beauty, unfortunately there's no place for advancement besides being a part of store management. There's not a lot of communication between cooperate and beauty as far as brands, and brand support. I was lucky enough to have a store manager that was on board and understood beauty, so i really didn't have issues with management. I would really recommend this job to anyone starting out in the beginning of their beauty career but there's absolutely no growth or development for Beauty Advisors"
good,overall it is a good job. The job work is easy and there is not a lot of customers so there is a lot of free time. There is a 50% employee discount that helps when buying items from the store. The job security is low quality. The management is great. The overall job culture is great because the manager and the other employees help create a family-like culture.
good,"Fast paced job without a lot of training time,"
good,"My coworkers and the customers for the most part are great!  Management is always switching out and the way corporate treats employees is something to be desired, but overall it's a steady job."
good,"Walgreens is your typical retail job comparable to working at any other major retailer such as Walmart, Target, etc. The main difference is everything is on a slightly smaller scale. The store itself is not as large as some other retailers but contains all the parts that the competitors do. Besides the size of the location the main difference between Walgreens and its competitor is its staff, being a smaller store you do not need as many bodies running the store so this means that employees must be proficient at multitasking and keeping on task."
good,"Very quick paced environment and a lot of privacy and health laws to follow. Management is well trained. Very interesting to learn the pharmacology aspect of the job, however the customers can hard to deal with at times."
good,Fast paced and stressful place. Teaches leadership and encourages development social intelligence. Requires emotional intelligence. Management continually gives feedback on progress.
good,"Cut hours, meaningless legislation, ect. from corporate which has a huge disconnect with their employees."
good,"It's a retail job, so there are no holidays off and the work hours fluctuate. They work with the employees schedules. There are very little raises and management positions can be stressful."
good,"Put back items from the front left by customers."
good,"This was an excellent first job, and allowed me to gain confidence in myself and my ability to solve problems among coworkers and customers. I enjoyed working with my coworkers to create displays and other projects around the store."
good,Good company to work for and gain valuable work experience. Overall it is fairly good. There is sometimes a difference in values between upper management and non-management team members.
good,Normally Walgreens is a busy store which keeps yu active and moving as cashier far as answering the phone and ring up customers. I learned how to multitask. Management was good some were understanding. It’s a good place to work as long as you have a positive mindset and good with customers . There was no hard part and I enjoyed learning different skills.
good,Counting the safe when you get to the store do your daily task and then start taking down drawers for the day before you close and have to do a deposit and count the safe again.
good,"very angry customers "
good,"I'm a people person, had no trouble communicating with my customer, making sure they leave the store well satisfied, knowing that they will return was rewarding to me."
good,"As a Beauty Advisor, my role in Walgreens was to meet sales goals, offer personalized customer service based on my customer needs and maintaining long-lasting relationships with customers. Other roles included handling all cash and credit cards transactions and balance and organize draw at the end of the shift."
good,"On your feet a lot, unless you are driving equipment."
good,"A typical day is to make sure the store is set for customers and that product is always available. Ensure prices are correct. Help customers locate items,& help in pharmacy whenever needed. "
good,Lack of pay is a deterrent but the benefits and discounts make up for it in a way. Management usually has a good understanding of how to get things done and are usually pretty understanding of personal situations.
good,"There are some decent managers in the company but the overall environment is very cut-throat.  Also, there is no longer any guarantee of long term employent wth this company."
good,In all I enjoyed my time working at Walgreens. I met many amazing regular customers and learned thier first names. I especially liked that I was able to assist elderly customers at times. I even became friends with my fellow co-workers and shift leaders.  I did find stalking isles challenging at times due to the heavy weight and specific spots every product had. Some of the most valuable skills I gained was cash handling and recording and what to do when confronted by a robber.
good,"Always another project / program with little or no help/ hours/ employees "
good,"It was a short term part time job. It is nothing spectacular, just your average retail work. The customers varied from nice to not so nice, as did some other employees and management. Not the hardest part time job in the world, but definitely not worth staying there forever unless you want to some day become a store owner."
good,when you first start they will work with you on the days and hours that you want to work. and then once you have been there for a little while they come to you and want you to change your hours and days
good,The job is challenging and the pay is not quite enough for a single income family. The team was wonderful to work with. The managers are fair and helpful.
good,The worst part about working at Walgreens is the fact that the store managers aren't always willing to help out with closing shifts when managers are ill
good,Wouldn't recommend- poor management and scheduling is always messed up..Plenty of odd workers and everyone talks trash. I wouldn't waste your breathe here.
good,"Easy part of my day was driving from point a to point b and back."
good,no comment because every should experience it for themselves. I enjoyed my time there and ready to pursue a new chapter in my career in a different industry.
good,On a typical day at Walgreens your never know what expect with the volume or hours. The work I a lot on your body as a woman because your loading 50lbs
good,"I have work at 2 other Walgreens in 6 years reason I moved and last one reallocated do to hurrican Harvey and up to this point was very happy with stores, management and staff until this store and had no plans on leaving Walgreens but I am now"
good,Walgreen's is a nice retail store to work for because there is typically less volume and you are not pressured as much. The benefits provided by Walgreen's are top notch.
good,"I enjoyed Wal greens, I think It is a wonderful job if you're needing to gain skills and keep money in your pockets through school. It is not hard work, The managers were very helpful. Getting help from older employees was the worst part, especially around the holidays."
good,I learned so many different areas of the pharmacy retail store. Had great leaders and many great years of experience with Walgreens. Great team members made the store and the job amazing.
good,I would recommend working for Walgreens if you enjoy a fast paced competitive workplace. Opportunities for advancement are available and is recommended.
good,Walgreens is a good company to work for and the benefits are good. It is a fast paced environment and occasionally there are not as many technicians as needed.
good,I did not enjoy working at Walgreens because I thought it was boring and it just was not my cup of tea. Most of the time I would stand behind the counter with nothing to do.
good,"Fast paced, busy.."
good,"Walgreens is not a good place to work .There is lack of growing opportunities ,lack of support from management ,short brakes and in general terms a very stressful workplace."
good,"Worked at Walgreens for over a year and a half. Was a good place to work since most of the time management was lax. However; towards the end, a new assistant manager came to our store. She was micromanaging everything and at this location, we were all used to having the ability to independently work on projects. She also was very hostile towards homosexual associates. Several times as well she made racist comments about customers saying things along the lines of ""make sure to watch those customers, they tend to steal""."
good,Working at a 24 hour store is competitive and busy majority of the time. You have to learn how to be balance because more than likely you'll be in multiple departments.
good,"All in all, Walgreens is not a horrible provider as far as career paths go. That being said, it's not somewhere I would intend to work indefinitely."
good,Worked very minimal hours with no consistency in scheduling. Small team so cooperation is a MUST if you wish to succeed. Pay is above minimum wage so it is acceptable for the position.
good,A typical day at work involves looking at reports and planning out notes for the employees to complete then moving on to helping where needed whether on the front end or pharmacy. Then spending any additional time growing your employees.
good,"i liked Walgreens because my co workers were cool, the store i worked in was laid back but my managers sucked. they didn't wanna do any work and soon as someone from corporate come in they ask you to do everything under the dun too cover how lazy they are. i hated doing the truck, unloading new merch"
good,"Working at Walgreens is what most would expect. It is usually slow paced and easy work, but the hours go slow as it doesn't get too busy. Overall it is a great starter job."
good,To much drama. Nobody takes responsibility for the store. Everyone does their own thing and we work long hours with little pay. And my boss is rude to everyone.
good,"Management is A-ok, love them. Downside is, ""Full time"" means above 20 hours and under 30 in their book. Pick up shifts if you can. Overall 3/5 stars. If you're a highschool student, perfect for you. Also allows tattoos. Prepare to get sick sometimes, it's a pharmacy after all."
good,"I was wrongfully terminated as a result of my association with another employee. I did nothing wrong, However the company itself was a great place to work. I loved my supervisor as he was fair and played by the book. He was not cut-throat but he did address and acknowledge any errors and provided an action of correction plan. I would still be with this employer had I not associated myself with an individual in which another supervisor failed to accept."
good,"Walgreens team members always set goals for every store and district. Walgreens make sure that every store is satisfying their customers. Walgreens team member make sure that they have enough items in stock to sale, have customer to do receipt survey, making sure medication are ready on time, ect. Basically everyday Walgreens team members come up with better ideas to improve customer services."
good,Definitely a fast paced and stressful environment. Lots of technology and room for growth. Difficult to balance if you do not have multi tasking as part of your skill set. Definitely an experience.
good,"Walgrees is fine depending on what manager you get, there are only two kinds there, the nice ones who do well becuase their staff are happy and want to be succsessful and the ones that are mean, vindictive and only have a sucssesful store because they work people to the extream with threat of termination and break them down completley"
good,"The store I worked at was a pilot store, so new programs that were introduced by the company were often tested at that location. Management responsibility restructuring changed what shift leads can and cannot do, and also meant a pay cut for them. The amount of work, in some ways, increased, but the pay wasn't worth it. The employees would attempt to take on extra tasks, but if things weren't done according to what management saw as ""their way,"" the employee was made to do it the way management wanted. It was made to seemed like the employees' way was wrong."
good,"A typical day for me at Walgreen's started at 5pm after I get out of school. I would usually work with my favorite manager and favorite coworker. I worked in the beauty department helping out costumers with any beauty advice, makeup that they needed to find and sometimes applying the makeup on them correctly."
good,"Fast paced, so the day goes by fluently. Not enough coverage of shifts by management. Unruly customers due to this. Wonderful people to work with as far as co-workers."
good,This company i loved it until i ran into the manager at the fair park location...  U will have fun u will like the job it is wonderful. It has great benefits but job advancement is beyond slow.
good,"This was a fantastic job 10 years ago, but unfortunately like many other companies in recent years, the almighty dollar is more important than the person."
good,I enjoyed working here but unfortunately i can't afford to work there anymore. i needed a better job with a better cost of living. The management was okay and everyone was friendly
good,I loved working there but the management is not very good. It was very easy job to do so it sometimes got boring. No room for advancement. It was a decent first job
good,"Good if you're starting out because pay isn't that great. Management constantly changes, which can be hard to get used to. Coworkers were the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Walgreens is a high volume, fast paced pharmacy. Great start for entry level Pharmacy Technicians. There are multiple shifts and they are more than willing to work around student schedules."
good,"good store to work at, lots of people there to help you all the time, great place to gain experience, a great job for maintaing stability in your life, you learn a lot from Walgreens!"
good,It was a great place to intern. I learned a lot on how to manage employees while running and managing a business/store. Management was great at the location I interned and let me know I had what it takes to manage in the near future.
good,I come to work with a smile on my face and greet my employees as well as my customers. I've learned how to maintain my a good count on the merchandise within the store
good,"Maintained accurate records of past due customer account activity"
good,It was a good company to work for but they cut my hours and I had to go store to store to get my hours somewhere else to make up for my 40 hours but it was hard because some stores didn't have the hours so I had to find something else
good,"I have worked in 5 different roles since I have been employed with Walgreens. I have in Pharmacy, Cosmetics, the Camera Department, Cashiering, and Cosmetics."
good,"Here you always have to stay on your toes. You have good days and bad days depending on location of store. The hardest part of my job being particular to my role was organizing the store while tending to customers at the register whilst also playing the role of security. Truthfully my most enjoyable parts of the job was knowing that i helped somebody that day and they left happy,if i accomplished that one task it was a win for the day."
good,Walgreens is a great company to work for if you don't have a family. The work life balance can be a strain with the different work times and mandatory holiday hours. Other than that its a great place to work. Management cares about you as person and if willing you can learn a lot about running a business and what it takes to be successful. Walgreens tries to teach all their employees how to be self sufficient and think on their own without a manager always telling you what to do. You really have to be a all around person and self starter to work there.
good,Walgreens used to be a company that moved managers up on a fast track. However working at the store level requires a large amount of physical labor more so than managerial duties.
good,"I was a Assistant Manager and the job was very fast paced. You manage multiple departments and have to be proficient as possible in each. Some of the daily tasks are very tedious but important, Overtime is something that sadly is frowned upon."
good,"Pretty easy job and company to work for. However, management can tend to be pretty petty, and not really want to work with you. They tend to bag about little things, and overlook major issues happening within the company"
good,"Corporate limits hours and makes it difficult to accommodate customers in the pharmacy. Additionally, store managers get too involved in pharmacy which they have no business being in."
good,Walgreens a fun job that allow you to bud your career up.You get pto and health benifits. they act like a team and help you when you need hrlp the most.
good,It's a good job to start out and they give you many opportunities to move up with in the company. They offer good discounts and pretty good health insurance
good,Management and most of the co-workers were great. It was a fairly enjoyable work experience where you knew what to expect most days. Occasionally there would be miscommunication between management and employees.
good,I was always learning something during the day. Very busy and great people I worked for in pharmacy. The hardest part of the job is learning to be very multi tasks with things
good,I usually work in the photo department.  But occasionally I will work the front cashier. I unload the truck once a week for the store. I really enjoy working with the staff and customers.
good,This pharmacy has a fast paced culture dominated by the technicians moods. There is little time to think as a professional as the focus is on numbers. The work hours were ok if you were hourly. Salaried workers were expected to work after shifts ended.
good,"It's an okay company to work for, the benefits aren't terrible but it's nothing spectacular. They work with my school schedule and I get paid holidays and PTO so I stay because I want the experience. There is room for advancement but only so far and then it gets really hard to move up anywhere. Wouldn't plan on staying with the company to build a career. Good enough for now."
good,This company used to be great to work for until they switched hours and focused more on the company and less on its employees. Be prepared to work long hours and get told you're easily replaceable often.
good,A typical day is slow. I have learned to be patient and also find humor in my work. The culture is pretty relaxed. The hardest part of the job is getting everyone to do their work. The most enjoyable part of the job is leaving.
good,"Retail is a good place to work at, which gives you an opportunity to communicate with patients to provide consultations. Its a busy day from the start of your shift to the end and the hardest part of it, is when working short handed which makes the job a little hard and challenging.  I enjoy what I do in the pharmacy, so no matter how busy it is, at the end of the day I am content on what I accomplished."
good,"My manager and assistant manager are very caring and easy to work with. Some days are very busy and stressful while others are not. Good company to work for, except wages. I am a sales associate / cashier."
good,"The main thing I have enjoyed is all of the great people I have worked with. It is a fast paced job so your days go by really quickly which is nice. If your management is good, then the job is wonderful. But if they let their personal issues get in the way(like mine do) then it becomes an issue."
good,"Even after multiple promotions to Assistant Manager still work the majority of my shifts on nights and weekends. "
good,"Coworkers are a pleasure to work with and help whenever possible, but with hours being cut at each store, it gets difficult to perform as effectively."
good,"Very clean environment. Even though I was a stocker, I did multiple duties around the store. Such as cashier, cleaning detail. Doesn't offer overtime ."
good,Long hrs of work! Always want you to exceed 100% picking and stocking rate. They only wana favor cetain team members. They need to start training new team members better and longer!!!
good,If you want to get management experience then being a shift lead is a good foot in the door.  If you just want to be a cashier this is not the best place. Management may make ok money above the shift lead level. Benefits were ok.
good,Depending on your position it can be stressful at times. Job security at this time is not good. Management is okay but at times are set in there ways and are not open to suggestions.
good,What I enjoy most about walgreens are the people I work with. That is the main reason I've stuck with walgreens for 10 years. Over those tens years I've seen changes and not for the good unless you're a share holder. Many employees are underpaid and overworked and the benefits are slowly on the decline.
good,The store i worked at was wonderful.  it was a family atmosphere which i feel made it so much more enjoyable.  Not only the co workers but the customers as well.  You dont feel the appreciation from the company itself but the individual people you do.
good,Management has extreme favoritism and  will make it very difficult if you don't turn a blind eye. The job itself is good but you have to be willing to work hard and without breaks if you are management or RX staff.
good,Walgreens was a good place to work. The people there took the time to get to know me and allowed me to excel at my job. The pharmacy was often busy and could get backed up at times but everyone did well at staying on task and helping each other out.
good,"El trabajo para los asistentes cada vez es mas dificil por que eliminaron posiciones de menor rango en la corporacion , incrementaron la carga de trabajo al Asistant manager"
good,"I consider it a stable job but not what I love, it works with my school schedule as a manager but I am looking forward to other opportunities. Most of my co-workers are great but the job itself is draining and the drama from store to store is ridiculous."
good,Walgreens was my first serious job and it was a wonderful job to experience in the real world. I worked cashier in the front end but also in the beauty section and also stocked the aisles.
good,"It's a good company to work for. But, there is a lot of favoritism in the stores and managers with ulterior motives. This company is heavily based on who you know, and who likes you."
good,Walgreens is a fast paced environment They have high expectations for their team members. I really enjoyed my time with Walgreens. They ensure that no customer waits longer than a couple of minutes in line to check out. They were like my second family.
good,"Be advised that it's not as easy as it may seem, especially sitting down for such long periods of time with back-to-back calls. Relatively small workspaces and a lot of information that has to be understood and reviewed daily as sales and promotions shift."
good,"Management needs improving and the store needs to care about there employees/ Other than a typical day at "
good,"They weren't fair about the hours they gave out. Had bad attitudes, not fun to work with. Had short breaks not enough time. Didn't like the workplace culture period."
good,"It's a typical retail environment that treats employees like numbered workhorses. Nothing special there. There is chance for advancement, and I even attempted to apply for a position in the pharmacy but after awhile, I felt like I was being held back in favor of other, more popular employees getting those job hours. Coworkers were alright, but our store was in a bad side of town and we had a lot of thieves and crazy people come in every day. Working on the night crew quickly became the worst, not because of the work (that was fine) but because of how many sleaze bags I had to put up with constantly. I would only suggest working a job here if you really needed a quick buck. On average hours weren't bad and pay was consistent.  But other then that, don't do it for the sake of your sanity."
good,"I enjoyed working there,just the hours just didn't work out and i needed more pay .good for part time job ,they need to be  fair about job position with the one's that work within the company instead hiring someone with no experience <"
good,"Good customer service. Company's number one goal is to have satisfied customers. To Walgreens, 98% of the time, the customer is right. Work environment is good depending on the store and the people who manage it."
good,Walgreens taught me how to get task accomplished with limited associates. Which also taught me the proper work ethic while being in management. The hardest part of the job was having to meet goals in deadlines while sometimes being understaffed. The most enjoyable part of the job is building a close relationship which east employee.
good,Day to Day as a beauty consultant with Walgreens is a good a pace on than it can be slow. This something new that the company has where get the everyday drug store cosmetics buyers to feel comfortable with something they see every day at other stores. pushing new lines of make up. i enjoy meeting new people and helping people that walking into my cosmetic department.
good,"I think the hardest part is being the liaison between the public and pharmacy, patient interaction is what makes or breaks a person's day; management was very flexible. The easiest part of the job is dispening medications to patients."
good,"Too much passing the buck.  Moral is extremely  low to where you walk into work you feel like it's sucking life out of you.  I love my job, but feel like they keep packing more on us when we don't even have enough staffing due to them cutting hours.  So basically, Walgreens expects employees to do more work load, give great customer service on frwer hours and less man power."
good,I must admit Walgreens is a very easy and nice place to work! My coworkers are all nice and I enjoy helping the customers. The Downside is the area our store is located in has a lot of theft. Also there is a budget on hours so I never get a full forty hours a week.
good,"Slow moving advancement. really cool people. have to work holidays. No overtime."
good,awesome benefits and financial stability with growth. advanced in retail technology and dispensary equipment. Full staff was difficult to maintain with high turnover.
good,If you're a hard worker and don't have a growing family; work here. I was constantly working with no time for family. There is a great opportunity for growth it just takes a while to get there.
good,Working for Walgreens is everything you'd expect. Simple tasks and simple pleasures. You'll get to know your regulars and share stories with them. You'll have your occasional shifty individuals appearing but they're harmless overall. The only stressful time are truck days and Superbowl Sunday.
good,"At the beginning, I was an assistant manager with no management experience. I learned and grew as the company grew, but ideas started to change, and working for them was no longer enjoyable."
good,Hard work and fast paced every day.  Job is highly physical but there are opportunities for advancement and to become more engaged.  The environment is fast paced and you have to be willing to work with coworkers with disabilities such as the hearing impaired.
good,The job is okay if the management is good. They give out training but responsibilities come too quickly. They want more from you and give you the minimum. It was a minimum wage level job that has hard working involved.
good,You basically stand at he register all shift selling candy and other items. No sense of accomplishment or moving up in the company. Very repetitive job.
good,"For minimum wage, this is a great job. There isn't really anything bad to say about the management. On the other hand, the only negative thing I would have to say is that dealing with the public isn't always that great. But this is still a really good job."
good,"Their review with me it's not a good work place at all because they change store managers like clockwork, and this particular  person that they have going around claiming she's the clean up woman is actually a joke because she firing the wrong people she released me and my other co-worker from our employment accusing us of stealing when the actual people that where , was still employed."
good,"Working on cash register, stocking, inputting data into the system in the pharmacy. Management was very inconsiderate. Nothing about the job was hard and the most enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
good,"If you want to advance within this company, you have to be willing to relocate to a differrent store, sometimes miles away from where you. live. Small group of co-workers and easily adaptable."
good,Walgreens provide wide range of opportunities. Pharmacist job is fast paced with alot of multitasking. Help is minimal and training is not as good and thorough as it used to be. The work flow and computer system is overdue for an update. Compensation can be more competitive.
good,"I've worked with the company for almost 4 years now, and I've seen many things change in that time. It's not a bad company in terms of the fact that it's a big national corperation , so you know there not going anywhere and your jobs safe. and it makes it easy to move for example I moved from Jersey to Florida and I worked up until 2 days before the move and started again the day after I arrived. The only thing to remember and I'm sure this is with any company of this size. You will always just be an employee number in the whole scheme of things."
good,Every month we had a meeting and there were times when we had lots of damage due to mishandling the products. Job productivity was dependent on the person before you because it was like a assemble line.
good,"My primary job was to shadow the upper level managers as a Community Management Intern. It was an extremely beneficial learning experience, I am very proud to say that I was able to work for this company."
good,As an assistant manager you had to take care of everyday customer concerns and employee issues that would come up. Because of the nature of drug store retail there is always new changes to store set ups depending on seasons. Walgreens new to California and almost all store managers moved here to open up the stores which was sometimes fun because what is popular back East is not here example Christmas lights. Back east the big outdoor lights were the hot item and out here it was the small ice lights. Working at a 24 hour store as the night manager you worked 7 days on and 7 days off.
good,Cutting edge management style that filters to all team members. This organization has many long term tenured team members - expectations of company are very high.
good,"Walgreens is a great first job, it teaches you the fundamentals of a work environment. The hardest part of this job would be the guaranteed hours and most enjoyable would be the co-workers."
good,"Everyone was nice and got along with everyone. Managers were great as well. The managers were very supportive and always have your back. Unfortunately, the company was becoming too corporate."
good,"It probably is not really fair or accurate for me to submit a review for a job that I had over 20 years ago, as a lot has changed since then.  I was glad to have a job fresh out of pharmacy school, and there was an abundance of work.  There was also an abundance of travel, but I gained a lot of experience in working different stores and in different areas.  The main reason why I left Walgreens was due to a relocation on my part with no nearby Walgreens store with a pharmacist position available."
good,"as an assistant manager your job is to make sure both front end and pharmacy are running smoothly. it is a highly stressful environment, it seems like you always have so many tasks that need to get done before you even begin any project."
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Option Care but I believe it is time to move on to a new opportunity. It is a very nice working environment, but I do not see an opportunity for growth."
good,"A place to be employed, been a great experience. Knowledgeable and efficient of job description. Looking for a wider range of experience and growth."
good,I worked at different Walgreens locations. One in Colorado and two in California. The company is not the same wherever you go. The one in CO was the best job I've ever had. And the ones in CA made me miserable. The only thing all three of them have in common other than the name is they all provide excellent training.
good,"I work with the public every day to help over-satisfy their needs at the store. I stock shelves and handle money transactions daily. I have learned how to work well with the public. I have four supervisors, and each one brings a unique perspective to the workplace and different situations when they come about. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I have met great people during my time, both employees and customers."
good,Not good management. A lot of work and not good benefits. Clean environment. Great opportunities to grow professionally and to make new friends. excellent job security.
good,"not a bad place, just need to find a better way to grow with a company and be more of a team, then just not caring for there workers.  ///////////////"
good,Good place to work if you like customer service.  Upper management shows no recognition for good work.  Stressful work place due to lack of budget hours for technicians.
good,"Serving customers and patients from minute one to sometimes half an hour after can be tough.  Finding a few moments a day for a quick breather can be challenging in the busy Holliday months, and sometimes breaks just don't happen.  Speaking of breaks, a paid 15 minute break just doesn't seem to happen any time, though I was told that is was required.  As a non-manager, you don't get the big bucks, but nor do customer complaints (legitimate or not)  end up in your hands at the end of the day.  You can turn the crank and punch the clock here to get a paycheck, but advancing your life happens outside of the store walls."
good,Good workplace. Managers will usually work with you on your schedule. Lot of work and you have to work with customers who have medical needs so it can be a challenge and doesn't seem like you are payed enough.
good,"Working for Walgreens while I earned a degree was a great experience. I enjoyed my work and my coworkers. Though there was a lack of communication between upper management and the employees at the sales level, I think it was a great springboard for future career."
good,Great management team. Fun place to work in. Co-workers exceptional team work. The hours of employment not enough. Only offer prt-time employment.
good,"To be honest, the job was not difficult to do or too stressful to accomplish. However; at times the managers would take their stress out on their workers."
good,I enjoyed working for this company but continued my education and went on to find something better suited for my family.  I still have great friends there and still use the pharmacy.
good,"I  like the company. The pay is good and the benefit package is fine. I just don't like the drive-through.  Also,  I don't agree with the management model that the front end managers can override pharmacists' decisions."
good,"A typical day would be the tech running around constantly having something to do."
good,"always something new to learn, always do the right thing..treat everyone equally ...work schedule always changes...hard to spend time with family, life and work schedule balance doesn't work"
good,This was a great paying job. You do have a lot of work however I have a few of the most amazing coworkers. Management personal does move around from store to store but this can be career for a person willing to work really hard.
good,"A very fast paced job. Must think quickly and multi task several things at once. Answer phones, check refills, make calls to patients/doctors, sell prescriptions, refer questions to pharmacist, and do paper work for flu shots."
good,"I moved up very quickly at Walgreens and enjoyed working here for the most part. The pay was well compensated however, the constant flipping of days and nights literally from day to day made it impossible to live a normal life or get proper rest, make appointments, etc."
good,Good company just very mythological approach to infrastructure and security technology. Doesn't apply a lot of cross-functional thinking costing the company time and money.
good,Walgreens does have a lot of benefits and will work with your scheduling. They are really into a lot of charity and helping people but knowing Walgreen sales and informing every one of both can be very chaotic. But it is a very decent job.
good,"The pay, and benefits are competitive, but the work environment is far more stressful than similar jobs.  There is never enough staff to do all that is expected of you."
good,"Fast paced must be awesome at multitasking,can be overwhelming at times. Strong relationships with your co-workers go a long way to help is awesome. The hardest part is watching for potential thief and trying to prevent it before it happens. The most enjoyable part is looking at happy guest while I'm checking them out."
good,This company provides allot of flexibility and benefits for both full-time and part-time employees. Would recommend this company to peers who seek sales and customer service experience.
good,Walgreens can be rewarding at certain locations. Excellent management at those locations causes a productive and fun atmosphere for all team members. Some locations are in horrible places with horrible customers that can make a job a nightmare on top of the work load that is required.
good,"Typical day at work is okay. A lot of customer interactions, which is important to the company. You will definitely learn a lot of things about running a business."
good,It was just work for me I need to put up a review for when I haven't even had a chance to get the application and stuff to see if I can even get the job in the first place
good,"A typical day at work would usually consist of me taking care of customers needs. For example; solving third party rejections, prescription entry into database, providing affordable options, and etc. But early in the shift I would help with inventory duties as in ordering, expires, and keeping count. There is no hard part of the job. Its a fairly easy job to handle and that's because with the cooperation of me and my co-workers, we make the job much easier for each other because we work as team."
good,"Depending on your store and manager, working for Walgreens can be an enjoyable- or miserable- experience. Before choosing your store, be aware of the hours of operation, and general attitude and disposition of employees. This will give some insight into what you will see when employed there."
good,"It was fun getting to know the employees and the customers, the managers and the work was not up to part like it should have been. They had a different manager everyday and had multiple people doin the same and different jobs all at once."
good,The typical workday is filled with running around doing tasks. The tasks can range from being a cashier to stocking shelves. The environment is fast paced as there are a lot of people who come in. The store also gets a lot of tourists so it is nice to see the different cultures that come in.
good,"While working at Walgreens, you really get a hands on approach to customer service.  What I mean by that is that there really is no standard Walgreens customer, you're really exposed to a variety of customers from ethnicity to abilities.  At Walgreens you also learn teamwork by learning how to depend on one another to successfully do business."
good,"A typical day at work filling patients' prescriptions and faxing doctors. I have learned how to help assist patients and guests that are new to the pharmacy. I also learned how to stock and package items back to correct spots on the shelves. Management was all about maintaining an organized and clean environment. My co-workers were very friendly and helpful when I was still learning through the internship. For everything I done, they always demonstrate how to perform the task and shadow me when I helped the patients. The most difficult task of the job was dealing with patients' insurance plans for medical coverage because there health insurances that have different policies on how they work. The most enjoyable part of the job was filling prescriptions because I was a fast filler as an intern. Overall, it was a wonderful experience since I realized how work was like compared to school and how much I've comprehend from the internship."
good,"I loved working in customer service business. I enjoyed going to my job everyday. I enjoyed working, my co-workers, customers and every day went by fast. The only thing I did not like about my job was the way we got treated by upper management and random hours all the time. Never got to have a set schedule."
good,Work with many different individuals who know their own sets of skills. Gained experience in how ordering and shipment is handles as well as many general procedures that apply to any running business.
good,"Fast paced and fun place to work, greeting and working with customers on a daily basis. I have worked retail before so I am very familiar with the day to day workings.  Management is very professional and friendly. I really enjoy my co-workers. We all get along exceptionally well.  The hardest part of the job would be standing on my feet all day, pretty much in one place. I try to move around as much as possible, but cannot venture too far from the front. The most enjoyable part of the day is any time spent with co-workers. We have a really good time working with and helping each other."
good,"I worked overnight and its usually you and one other person working. Stock the store, cash handle, and help customers. I learned about inventory, receiving vendors, how to promote sales, and reset the store."
good,"Great work environment with general staff, promotes on the job training experiences, and advancements in excellent customer service."
good,"A typical day at work includes assisting customers, receiving vendor/warehouse orders and handling money. I have learned a lot here about how the company functions as well as different skills required for leadership. Management is ok. Although it is a big company, each store's staff is relatively small and that can sometimes create problems. Co-workers are nice, but because of the staff size slacking off is definitely felt. The hardest part of the job is that management tends to think that Walgreens is supposed to be your life and it is reflected in the schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you get to meet and the customers that are seriously grateful for the help that you give them."
good,Overall good company..just different districts have bad people.under managed.i mean the atlanta district lol don't know anything about the company..it never closes...even I'm on Christmas but it suppose to be a family business...other people family they don't care about the employees
good,I recently transferred to a location closer to home. I felt extremely stressed at my former location. Pay is decent and you can move up easily but is the extra work worth? This job is good for college students but I personally would not want a career with this company.
good,Walgreens provide great benefits and great team building moments.  They promote great customer service.  I have learned to coach and guide a valuable team
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work with great people."
good,"Great company, people are great and knowledgeable.  Technology outdated and working with outsource company is very challenging."
good,"No place for advancement for employees who have been there for years. Overall good company, just need more positions for people that deserve it."
good,"I loved this job until new management came in, took away everyone's hours and was very rude to all the staff. I worked there for 8 months and averaged out around 25-35 hours a week and so did the rest of my coworkers, when new management came in we all averaged around 10-15 hours a week. 5 people quit and pursued better jobs because we were done with the harassment and terrible hours."
good,"On a typical morning at Walgreens, I would stock the cigarettes behind the front counter. I would also ring up customers, answer the phone, face the aisles, do light cleaning, put up the items that came in the truck, merchandise products, and do suggestive sell.  If I was in the Cosmetics department I would also take inventory of the whole cosmetics department.  The hardest job at Walgreens for me was unloading the truck.  There was just so much of it to be done in between ringing up customers.  Other than that it wasn't too hard.  Anyways, I always thought that the management at Walgreens was very nice.  I felt like if I had a problem I could go to them.  As for my co-workers, they were pretty good, but there were a few flaky ones."
good,Customers are up and down when dealing with. I have learned through my years of employment. Co workers can be pleasant just be mindful its work and not social event and you will do fine.
good,pay is ok if you are upper level management. the work piles up if you dont have a great team. i learned alot through walgreens.
good,"Although the company has changed, and many of the aspects that have kept me loyal have gone, I've found myself willing to give extra effort to both my superiors and co-workers alike. I've worked in different locations, and worked with a variety of costumers who range from caring and considerate to ignorant and aggravating. Yet, through the company's culture methods, I've bettered as a person, and have learned to stay professional under many circumstances."
good,"I enjoyed helping customers, and it was interesting working in the photo department. They have really good health benefits, but I wouldn't want to work there again."
good,"Working at Walgreens since 2006, I've been able to progress and not be limited to growth. It's been a good experience so far."
good,"great coworkers, low pay but not terrible pay, some advancement possibilities, low stress environment, good beginning skills"
good,"I was a student pharmacist at Walgreens pharmacy and enjoyed the experience. The staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and easy to interact with. Corporation-wise, the Walgreens experience is less than ideal with annoying mandates and requirements that impedes workflow."
good,A typical day at work would be greeting customers that walk in an cashing them out as well as saying farewell. Stocking shelves and helping customers.
good,Review photo orders make sure they are all complete. Take passport photos. Order any supplies that are in need. Help customers with their needs in the store. Co-workers are friendly and always helpful great work environment.
good,"If the upper management would leave the managing of each store to the managers they hired to do the work, it would be a great place still.  But there is to much micromanaging from upper management that has no idea how the public in any given area might be different than their cookie cutter ideas,"
good,"Most of the assignments were designed for nightly management to pick up the pieces on duty alone with a couple of cashiers. The majority of the staff was assigned to day shift having more coverage & better trained employees because there were usually the department people. More of an abundance of work left behind from days for the night shift when the stores are at there peak with customers."
good,"I love working in the photo lab, creating projects (all aspects of a dry lab), helping my customers create, relating to their needs and helping them in their crisis!  They have always shown their respect for my  abilities to troubleshoot their inability to work on internet,kiosk, phone related situations and keep them happy.  I feel I have been an asset to Walgreen's company for the last 10 years but find myself a little bit unchallenged anymore.  I find there is no caring going on with the Walgreen's companies as it used to be shown in the past."
good,"Walgreens clerk- Easy-going environment"
good,"I am grateful for the opportunities Walgreens has presented me. I am a manager and have grown immensely because of my day to day work life. A typical day involves much cash handling, customer service to our guests, prioritizing tasks, and working efficiently on stocking merchandise. We must meet daily goals of inventory percentage, out of stock percentage, customer delight scores, and sales. I have learned to lead my staff respectively and efficiently. The hardest part of the job is being able to accomplish projects all while assisting customers and employees with whatever they may need, whenever they need it. Being able to multi-task efficiently is crucial. Also, being able to lead your staff and having mutual respect is key to accomplishing these projects as well. This job has allowed me to master those skills. The most enjoyable part of this job is coming in everyday and seeing my co-workers and balancing a friendship and professional relationship."
good,"overall a good company to work for. Not very family oriented since they are opened 365 days a year, so never get holidays off to spend with your family"
good,"There is a lot to do and it is energy consuming but the work atmosphere makes it pleasant and enjoyable. Not only co-workers but also customers. Everyone is hard worker and is very professional. The hardest, part is just that you  walk a lot but you with time you get use to it."
good,When i first started working for walgreens it seemed like a great company to work for but through my nine plus years with the company i have noticed the company is paying more attention to the upper levels of the company.
good,"While working at Walgreens, it was not so much as working per hour, but by working per truck. Every night was different as in some nights we had half a truck to work on, while others were about two full trucks. It was never a dull moment working there."
good,"Enjoyed working in the pharmacy field, got along great with just about all the employees. Never a quiet moment. While the store managers were wonderful and treated us like family and friends,  Omaha District Managers were completely opposite. Most would agree."
good,"Walgreen's will keep you busy, regardless of what area you work in. It's perfect for a part-time job for a student, or full time if you land a position in pharmacy or leadership. However, if your store manager isn't good, you will have a bad time. Oftentimes, the manager can and will take advantage of your goodwill, deny requests for days off, schedule you for terrible shifts, etc."
good,I have love working there and love the people. I have other interest other then retail looking for new challenges in electrical field
good,"I was hired at Walgreens back in March of 2014. Originally I applied to work on the floor as a sales representative, but the manager offered me a job as a Shift Manager, which was a much better position with more pay. I had never worked in retail before, but after meeting my coworkers, managers, and pharmacy staff, I felt very welcome and knew it would be a good fit for me. I was responsible for making the store run smoothly, giving tasks to the other employees, greeting customers, and giving great customer service. I also handled all money and deposits, as well as always keeping the cash drawers with the right amount of money and change. I would say the hardest part of the job for me was making sure all the money from the cash drawers matched up with what we were supposed to have, and also trying to keep all the customers happy. The best part of the job was working with amazing people, meeting new people, and helping out in the Cosmetic Department."
good,"A typical work day would be greeting customers, making sure their needs are met first, while doing daily projects throughout the store. The most enjoyable part about my job is helping customers and making sure they leave the store sastisfied. The hardest part about my job is running out of things to do."
good,pay is decent if you're in the right area and are half-way competent. corporate will consistently cut hours and keep your store at less than a skeleton  crew no matter how well the store is doing.
good,Walgreens is a good place to start out and develop skills. It allows people room for mistakes early on and learn from them to become better professionals. There is a lot of room for advancement to those who try for it.
good,"I was fortunate enough to be hired at Walgreens because it has helped me sharpen the skills I need to be an effective employee. The management has always been as flexible as they can be with my school schedule. The people I work with were always so nice, and were so willing to teach me when I first started. "
good,Normally you can get job done at work. Good coworkers. Most are friendly and willing to help. Sometimes you may switch to other role you are interested in.
good,They job itself was good but the store management and corporate sucked. Didn't give us enough tech hours and kept expecting unreasonable things with the amount of people they gave us. Didn't listen to our concerns or issues just cared about getting the most done while spending the least amount of their money.
good,Walgreens is a good company to work for short term. They have great benefits. The managers I worked with were great. It have to move up with the company its all in who you know
good,"Very high stress job, and more staff daily is needed to provide the right customer service. They do pay well so it is hard to leave even with the high stress environment. In the high stress and understaffed environment it is hard for everyone to stay positive employees, customers, everyone is on edge always going and working on tooooo many things at once, and that can cause mistakes which is not good in medicine. I am sure this is just a retail corporate pharmacy atmosphere though."
good,"Over the past 12 years, I have seen this company undergo several changes, both implemented within and outside of the stores.  There are several resources available for professional development and plenty of advancement opportunities, more so now than before.  Bottom line, it is about the numbers and the employees feel underappreciated as they get the feeling as though everyone is replaceable.  Walgreens is a company that strives to stay ahead of the game and set themselves apart by providing innovative ways of getting into communities and implementing high expectations regarding the customer experience.  Over the past few years, these expectations have continued to grow as our budget and available help have declined making it a constant battle to achieve desired results while still maintaining a work-life balance.  For example, our prescription count has increased steadily over the past year and we struggle to provide the level of service that our patients deserve.  Our technicians feel the stress on a daily basis, yet strive to provide quality care.  Our pharmacy budget hasn't increased to support this increased patient count because it will increase profits to maintain our budget.  The pay scale has also drastically changed over the past 4 years, with our starting rates dropping and less candidates being interested in applying, which in turn creates hiring obstacles to keep our store staffed at all times.  The company continues to cut back, yet expect more and it creates a very stressful and challenging workplace."
good,"Compared to other Pharmacies, Walgreens compensate its workers the least. Too many responsibilities for the pay. Maybe if they paid more, I would have stayed."
good,"Being a store employee you try to work every second, but the compensation is far less than what you do. An entry level employee cannot even pay his bills with this amount."
good,"It is a complete joy to come to work each day and see my co-workers, this makes me want to be a better leader. I take pride in my title as Assistant LookBoutique Manager because they and the LookBoutique depend on me to make our workplace function with success. A bit of a disconnect with upper management and store level, however this can happen when there are big changes in corporate. The best part of my job is my customers. Putting together regimens and having them come back so we can both look at their progress. It is the greatest feeling to give someone confidence based on my professional observation and recommendation. Showing my customers to put on makeup that makes them stand out as well showing them the new trends."
good,"A typical day at work for me is normally not too busy because I worked mostly in the morning along with the Head store manger, Head photo specialist, and Head Cos. personnel. I've learned a lot working with the team because they taught me things they usually don't show other co workers. I basically felt like another manger when I worked there. Their wasn't really a hard part in working in Walgreens but if i would give one it would be when I first started. only reason is because Walgreens was my first ever job."
good,fun as a temporary job. Could never end up working full time for the rest of my life. Fun coworkers and great staff. Never had a problem with the manager
good,I am responsible for billions of dollars when negotiating pricing and I feel like the tools are not complete the oversight is lacking and sometimes we are just going with which way the wind blows. People are pretty unhappy here.
good,"Walgreens is a good company to work for, especially starting out of college. Very fast paced environment. Multi-tasking is key. Co-workers are friendly and team players. Hardest part of the job is dealing with unsatisfied customers and fulfilling work load with sometimes minimal help. The most enjoyable part is helping patients, answering their questions, making recommendations, and giving immunizations."
good,This a great work place but it could really use better organization skills a lot of things are just shoved in to the crates during truck day and it is on the works to get through that task
good,As long you work your butt off you can advance. If their is conflict they have a fair procedure to ensure that everyone's side is heard.
good,Gained good exposure to the retail domain. Learned how a typical Retail store works. Experienced working with multi-teams.
good,"Fun and challenging work place with supportive management. As an assistant manager, I carried the responsibility of the store and the employees when the store manager is absence, I open the store at the morning and close the store at night, in between I manage the cash flows on the register in order to operate correctly, I also make sure each employees take their breaks and lunches, lastly I check our floor items are stock. The experience helped me improved organizing skills and to make more careful decisions at work and in my personal life because the store depends on me. The most enjoyable part of the job was able to help my colleagues and customers when they needed my assistant and learning from my colleagues to be a best worker I can be. The hardest part is walgreen  the shift schedule, you have to work different shift within the week."
good,"I got this job after moving out of my parents house and looking for my own apartment. The environment is ok so long as you're able to get along with your co-workers, and I got some cool people to hang out with. The scheduling was my only real issue. Working two jobs with one static night shift each week and a fluctuating day/night shift was difficult. And having three managers writing a schedule each different week was hard because they each made the schedule to their own liking without considering requests which made things difficult for me if one of my shifts overlapped with my other job."
good,"Can be good or bad job depending on co-workers, management and location store wise. Typical over worked management without enough pay. corporate will demand unreachable goals to meet."
good,Friendly team members and management. Overall didn't agree with the changes the company was making. Appreciated benefits and compensation
good,Its a great starter job with the management willing to be flexible with work hours. The Hardest part of the job is Holidays and last minute shoppers.
good,Enjoyed my short time in the photo department. Was nice to see the other side and find a greater appreciation for cashiers
good,"long hours when you are on salary, holidays are even longer. There are many task that has to be done without the help of the store manager."
good,loved working for Walgreens. They have a great compensation program. Due the company cutback it's hard for the employee to advance.
good,"The typical day can be pretty demanding. I am responsible or having a certain percentage of 'red zone' merchandise rung up while at the same time performing all of the daily tasks assigned to me efficiently. I have learned many things about management and sales, customer service, and how to handle corporate managers who do not have the best interest of their hourly employees in mind. The management is difficult and usually inefficient and in more cases than not, under qualified. The hardest part of this job would be maintaining a good work ethic even when hours are cut, you are required to work some holidays but do not get overtime and regular overtime is forbidden."
good,"I was a cashier and I would handle money all the time. Being my first job I learned so much on how to speak up, and learn what customers wanted"
good,"While being at one of the busiest pharmacies on the west coast, you have to have a certain way to handle it. While everyone as coworkers have fun, we learn a lot and stick together as one. The management is another story. They just want us to not say anything to customers that would be a joke if we knew them well enough. If a person was to steal, we cannot do anything about it, but let them and then let them get caught up front."
good,The company is an ok company to work for. I've been with the company for quite a long time.  You have to have a lot a patience to work for this company!!
good,"Company is great to work for, but not the easiest place to get promoted even with hard work. Highly stressful at times, but fast paced"
good,"A typical day at work is mainly customer based. I also develop photos as well. I have learned many different ways to handle customers concerns and problems. I really do appreciate my co-workers, but as a company Walgreens isn't ideal. Currently i don't find many things at my job challenging."
good,Great co-workers that are more like family.  I can't imagine working with a better group of people than I have at Walgreens.
good,I had learned a lot at Walgreens that I would had never knew that I could do like being in charge of a store and I stepped outside of my comfort zone.  Walgreens could be fun and they had taught me a lot on how to be a successful manager.
good,Not a bad place to work. Customers appreciate you. Mostly friendly job culture. If you put in enough work and scratched the right people's backs the is definite advancement.
good,"Customer service is a MUST. Basically we have lists planned out for us if we don't have anything to work on when we're not helping out customers. I definitely learned to be more confident because this was my first job out of high school. I love most of my coworkers because they are a big part of why I look forward to coming to work. Most members of management are great to work with and they don't harass you about getting your work done if they trust that you know what you're doing throughout the day. The hardest part I'd say is keeping up with the red zone percentages especially when business is slow some days, or customers just don't come back to the beauty department. The company has changed a lot since the time I started working there. They expect a lot out of you for little pay. The worst part was losing so many hours. I'm supposed to be 'full-time' but my hours have 'part-time' written all over them."
good,"New leadership is top notch.  The current middle management needs to learn from the new leadership.  Treat your employees fair, honest, and respect them.  The make the company.  They engage with your customers - your revenue life line.  Give them opportunities to learn, develop and feel apart of the company and maybe you will see the transformation that you have been looking for - exceptional customer service and execution."
good,"I worked for Walgreens for 10 years.  I started right out of high school from a cashier and worked my way up into management.  The store managers are good people for the most part but the corporate office started making changes.  They eliminated positions, and created new ones and cut the payrate down more than $10,000.  The company stopped caring about the customers and employees and only focused on the bottom line.  On a typical day I would assign tasks to employees, set goals for suggestive selling, and handle cash reports.  Throughout the day I would receive vendors, merchandise the store to maximize sales and helpl customers with any questions, concerns or product issues.  I really enjoyed the experience of meeting and working with all kinds of people.  The hardest part of the job was how corporate kept changing policies and freezing promotions and reducing pay raises.  The best part was the ability to change a stores dynamics in order to increase sales and seeing the results and goals come to fruition."
good,The 24 hour store.  The mix of the fast pace and great technicians made it possible to truly care for the patients. What I learned? Set your own safety limits and do not break those for any one prescription.
good,Unload truck. Prepare store for daily task(cash handling). Assist customers as well as associates. Management was nice. Co-workers were friendly. The hardest part was trying to get a break through the day. Though the best part was stayed busy the entire day so time went by very quickly.
good,"Answering phone calls daily"
good,I enjoyed my experience at Walgreens. It was a great work experience you learn a lot over the years you work there. Starting wages in at $8 an hour. Customers are great
good,I have worked retail before but Walgreen's really takes care of its employees treating then fairly and helps them learn and grow.
good,I have been with this company for 10 years and make 10.20 per hour. I work hard to the point i am in pain when i come home. I am very knowledgeable and friendly. This company have its favorites. This is a teenager job or someone who is old. otherwise be prepared to struggle. looks better than what it is.
good,All of staff was very nice and supportive. Throughout the day they would try to make it fun. The store was very busy. I was an intern so the hardest part was putting in the prescription while dealing with the customers. Every other aspect was manageable.
good,walgreens its ok to work has a lot of benefits but the scheduling rotations sucks .sometimes you even have to work holidays and weekends ..the pay its also not that good .management its very understandable when it comes to been sick or having an emergency .
good,Started day early checked store condition and made work list for the night crew . Learn inventory control for multiple store's had very good management staff as training in the beginning of my career many of my coworkers were a pleasure to work with . Hardest part of  job was not enough hours in the day . Most enjoyable part of the job was making the best possible gross profit with the tools provided.
good,"As a sales associate I was either working a cash register, helping customers that were having trouble with anything, or stocking and maintaining the shelves. I liked everything about working at Walgreens except for the manager. The manager of my store played favorites and no matter how hard you worked or how focused you were, if you weren't one of the managers favorites you didn't get to learn anything and progress further up the chain."
good,"They were good, but as there are located in Haiti, then different country, different culture. Both were governmental job. The management and the culture are linked to the social, political and economical environment of the country. ."
good,the work place was fun and interactive but the pharmacy was under staffed and over whelmed. the promotions came quickly but the pay was acceptable at best
good,"Days at Walgreens are pretty much normal just like all retail store. I learn how to become a better sale associate and a beauty advisor. All my co -workers were pleasant to work with . The hardest part of the day is cleaning restroom after customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping and encouraged, sharing ideas that help shape the look of the department and my customer interactions."
good,"While I have fun in many of the aspects of my job here, the hours are incredibly long (10.5 hour shifts, eight days straight - 1 day shift, 7 night shifts - with six days off between rotations). Making minimum wage, however, makes it incredibly difficult to survive, and trying to find a secondary job is difficult as well because of the weird shift hours."
good,I cross-trained in different departments which was a great experience for me. From the cash office to the receiving department and a few in between.
good,customer service also processing and developing photographs attending to customer’s needs and maintaining a clean store
good,"If you are going to work for minimum wage then Walgreens is a good place to work. They will give you benefits, a retirement plan, generous discount on products and have a good open door policy."
good,"I have gained a lot of knowledge and experience working with the Walgreens company. Not one day is the same working there. If I open the store, I have different duties than if I was to close the store. But each shift entails managing a staff of 3, and making sure tasks assigned are completed in a timely and efficient manner. I enjoy working with my current staff and management. We are all hard working individuals. Sometimes it is a bit difficult to motivate someone to work to full potential all the while having to complete my own duties, but I manager to accomplish most of my goals for my shift, if not all. I am a hard worker, and keeping busy is what makes my job easy and enjoyable."
good,I learned and gained so much useful information that helped me grow and become more confident in the pharmacy setting and enjoyed working with my fellow co workers as well as my customers that I helped all the time. I was very happy with my job. I will be willing to answer questions for any employer in a interview.
good,It's a good place for starting your career...not always the best benefits which is surprising.  I would recommend this place to start your career but not much after that
good,"Flexible to work, if attending school. Manager is a great person to work with, some days fast paced. Willing to learn and listen."
good,This is a nice place to work at but sometimes the customer you have to deal with are a lot tougher than most retail jobs. I learned to keep things to myself because words travel quickly. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the idea that there is almost no room for growth within the company. The most enjoyable part would be the discounts.
good,A typical day involved just staying behind the counter and helping the companies.
good,The workday here was mostly afternoon shifts and was more geared towards one on one customer interaction. I learned how to engage customers and make sure that they were satisfied with the quality of service and product. Management was really good do to the hands on and teaching atmosphere.My co-workers were also good teachers and often wanted to help. The hardest part of the job was learning about the photo equipment while having to assist the customers. Most enjoyable part about the job was the learning and training environment.
good,"Not bad for someone looking for first retail job, but hours are just too much, without enough budget."
good,"The typical work day consisted of filling 500-700 prescriptions in addition to < 30 vaccinations from 8:00 am to closing at 10:00 pm. I began working with Walgreens close to the new year when patients changed and renewed their insurance policies, making the job an accelerated learning experience. "
good,"Walgreen's puts their customers needs above all else. The best part of my day is helping customers find products to help them feel better.  Walgreen's has many repeat customers and it is great building rapport. Helping customers with their medical needs, photo needs and beauty needs."
good,"A typical day at work is typing prescriptions, checking in and out patient, assisting Pharmacists, and filling prescriptions. I've learned that working as a team and communication are the two keys to having a successful day at work and to get through the busiest hours. The hardest part of the job is probably when a co-worker calls out and there is no coverage. Over all I enjoy being a technician, and I hope to grow and become a lead tech sometime in the near future."
good,"Although the work might seem a bit intimidating at first, everything is very simple. They allow mistakes as long as you show productivity and work is basically repetitive."
good,It would be a well run store if everyone communicated better with one another as far as management. Also holding those accountable for their actions. It is a good place to work if you are willing to learn and want to advance quickly.
good,"Not the best paying job around, but you do have room to move up."
good,A perfect place to test your building skills and learn how to operate machinery
good,"The job here was okay.  I liked most of my coworkers and a few of the regular customers.  I really hated resetting the aisles for all the different holidays."
good,"Overall walgreens isnt a bad place to work, its just that i dont feel like they really care much for there employees. Ive been there for over 2 years now and only have gotten maybe 15 cents raise over that span and others who are barely beginning to work there are starting out at the price i make an hour"
good,"This place of employment is very fast paced, there are many things to learn and memorize. The employees are friendly and work as a team. I enjoyed working at this company."
good,"Strict timeliness and deliverables"
good,"For the most part, I really enjoyed working at Walgreens.  It was a great place to work for when the company wasn't so greedy (about 3 years a go).  But after working there for 7 years, I don't feel that I was getting noticed enough for my hard effort."
good,I like the people I work with and friendly environment. I enjoy going to work to see my Walgreens family.
good,"The experience to unload and load truck, building projects, work cashier, and getting along with others."
good,"Fun fast paced work flow, positive atmosphere. Great perks and discounts. My favorite part of the day is being able to resolve third party rejections and being able to help the customers. Hardest part is answering incoming calls and balancing the work load during a rush. but is manageable but sometimes can be tough when there is only you and the pharmacist during the rush. We work as a strong team together almost like a family."
good,While working in Florida I found Walgreens a wonderful place to work because of the customers and employees being very friendly and loving life.  Our work place was like one big family and our customers became part of our family.  I worked in a snowbird area where our customers stayed 6 to 9 months and would return to the home area during the summer months.  It was nice to hear of their adventures when traveling back and forth and being part of their on the road family.
good,"At my location, everybody is like family. The best part of my job is my co-workers. But, it just seems like I do the same thing every day. There is nothing new to working here."
good,"The pharmacy was an awesome learning experience. Other than the poor leadership exhibited by one of the newer pharmacist, the job was a great learning experience. The upper management were insightful and encouraging. I enjoyed working for this company. I only left because of how I was being treated by one younger pharmacist. I should have stood my ground and stuck it out!"
good,"A typical day at Walgreens ranged from running the cash register, to stocking shelves, cleaning, helping in the photo, beauty or pharmacy departments, helping with inventory and keeping the store organized and clean."
good,"At Walgreens I was decently satisfied, as for pay it was starting at $8.00 an hour. I enjoyed it, but hours wise they didn't satisfy my need's. I was working full time with no benefits as an employee. They underrated us, we had to do three times the work to maybe get a raise. I left due to school, but if I stayed there any linger I would have already left. I loved my co-workers, and my management was alright as well. The only thing I disliked for the most part was the fact that both the GM and the assistant would open the back door to smoke, so when we would need a manager to help  on floor they were no where to be found. Me and my co-workers had our own way of doing things we had to solve more than we should as employees. But Sometimes it happens and that's life. It helps us learn."
good,Great exposure to gain customer service interaction skills.
good,"Good place to work. However, little opportunities for advancement."
good,My typical day was counting and dispensing medication to patients as well as dealing with insurance issues and assisting the pharmacist with other upkeeping tasks. I learned a lot about certain medications and their incompatibilities when mixed. My coworkers were mostly helpful and supportive. The hardest part of the job was having patience for unnecessary insurance companies. The most enjoyable part of the job was customer/patient care.
good,"performed all daily duties from typing  to drug product review to consulting patients to resolving insurance issues and ringing up on registers. there was no scheduled break during the day, enjoyed assisting customers, co-workers friendly and eager to assist , some management support, learned about internal controls to improve productivity and profits"
good,Oversaw many employees with many different aspects to cover for the store.
good,"I was with Walgreens for 8 years. In that time my co-workers became an extended family to me. My favorite part of my day was seeing the people I worked with and talking with my customers."
good,"The store I work at is very busy, Most Walgreens pharmacies are. Multi-tasking is a MUST. You have to remember that the people that are coming to you, are not feeling well and will most likely be crabby, or hard to get along with. You must find a balance between empathy and how fast your team works when telling people waiting times, and pick up times. Calling Insurances, and Dr's are a daily thing. Dr's are always in a rush and they will not write something they need too. Filling, and filling fast with accuracy is critical in this job. Yes, the Pharmacist does the final check, but they are human, they can miss things also. Making sure the correct medication is going to the correct patient is extremely important for their health, and it is your biggest responsibility. The people are work with are great, working as a team is great, especially when you know how someone works, and they are always ready to help you out, and have your back. The hardest part of the job, is telling people that a medication that they really need is not covered by their insurance, or that the co-pay is high. You will get yelled at, but again, you have to remember that they are upset for a reason and it's not at you, it's the situation. The most enjoyable part of the job, is helping people out. Taking that extra 5-10 minutes to call their doctor, to fix their insurance, or get a medication faster than the wait time promised is a great thing."
good,"Worked here for 13 years, the distribution center is closing and everyone is being laid off."
good,"work late hours ,customers good, management was good. no employees on floor to help customers."
good,"if you work at walgreens, that means you are going to be working in every part of the store possible. though its a nice job with decent hours, it can be hectic if your coworkers don't put in a team effort."
good,"Must handle all aspects of day to day store operations. ie returns/exchanges cash handling, vendorsm inventory, stocking"
good,Great opportunity and had a lucky situation with pharmacy manager
good,"I love some of the co-worker we work well together, Walgreen is a place for that need not to retired there"
good,"For the amount of work assigned to you on a daily basis, the pay is pretty low, very difficult to recieve benefits from the company, management will forget to use sick days or pay days which would then interfere with pay. etc."
good,Each shift is full of multitasking and quality customer interactions. There is never a dull moment and plenty of work to be done that keeps me busy. I have learned the ins and outs of retail since starting my job with Walgreens. The management is effective in ensuring that the work culture is a positive and productive one. My co-workers are hard working and a great team that make each new employee feel welcome. The hardest part of the job is the low rate of pay but the most enjoyable part is the quality moments that I have with my customers ensuring that they have a wonderful experience.
good,The coworks were fun to work with. Like any job you have good days and bad days but overall it's a good place to work.
good,"Customer service"
good,"Walgreens offers a unique experience for the new professional. You will be able to develop and hone your management skills in areas of hiring, training, and marketing."
good,"Great place to work. Scheduled breaks, plenty of crew members, great management. The pay isn't all that great but for the type of work you do, it is enough. Must have great customer service."
good,"Did a lot of projects in addition to your specific job as a cashier. You need to run anywhere in the store, it could be in photo, or cosmetics, even your assignment is at the front register. "
good,It is a good place to get that all important start in a career path
good,"A typical day at work will be to Number 1 Make Sales. The Store Manager likes for us to be to top ranking in sales. Making sure products are full on the shelf, if a truck has brought in new products to fill the shelves and put them out. Make sure all of the weekly/ monthly ad tags are viewable for customers to see. If a reset or rivision comes in which the manager asks you to do for your department, it has to be done. Returns are also sent over to my department in Cosmetics so that is taken care of."
good,"Throughout my time with Walgreens, the one thing I enjoy most is actually helping the people.  Many people come into Walgreens for various items among prescription drugs.  Being in the photo department, I enjoy making sure people are always satisfied with the quality of their photos, and I love to show them new things pertaining to various media and modern technological devices.  Therefore in the aspect of being a great service to community members that's a plus, however the pay is horrible for a man with a wife and 5 children so as much as I like it I just have to take my customer service experience to a higher level, even if it's not exactly customer service I believe my experience thus far has made me a valuable asset that could adapt to any work environment."
good,"This experience was much like that of CVS Pharmacy except that CVS had more updated technology, paid more, and took relationships with their customers in a higher regard."
good,customer service is number one. Developed my customer service skills here. Management will go above and beyond to satisfy the customer. Co workers need structure and leadership to complete tasks. Simultaneasly working on multiple projects but still having to provide exceptional customer service. The most enjoyable is everyday is different than the last. 
good,"Love the job, but it gets frustrsting at times. Wish for more hours, but that time will come."
good,"A typical day at work includes stocking , cashiering, and maintenance. I learned how to cashier here. Management is a toss up here seeing that you do deal with them much besides them telling you what they need you to do. Average co-workers."
good,"Being the one to walk into the pharmacy with an effective goal in mindset each day puts my manager/staff pharmacist at ease. I complete designated tasks each day to keep the pharmacy work flow under control. I am the one who completes the inventory on medications, deleting old prescriptions, filling new prescriptions, receiving inbound calls, assisting with the cash register and so much more. The hardest part of my job is overcoming barriers that may set back our work flow. Over the years, I have learned how to resolve problems quickly, thinking outside the box, and putting myself in a customers' shoes so that I can provide them with excellent service. I   take my job very seriously and my assertiveness keeps everything aligned, I am an essential part of the company I work for and I make it a goal everyday to be exceptional at every task. "
good,I love working for Walgreen's. The rush that you would get from helping customers was great to me. I have a passion for helping someone in anyway. 
good,"a typical day at work was Very -fast paced. Dealt with over a 1,000 customers daily in store operations and pharmacy.  Learned a great deal about customer service, time -management, and flexibility. The hardest part of the job was working Holidays. The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexibility in work hours."
good,Solid company.  A lot of change occurring.  A lot of hiring from outside the company.  Company needs to work on career advancement opportunities in some areas.
good,"Walk through the store and monitor managers, employee's, and customers."
good,The hours are what I have a problem with. I don't get to spend a lot of time with family because of my hrs.
good,"Walgreens has gotten me through college and paid a lot of my bills. It is a great stepping stone. The pace is quick, you learn a lot, and the company's ethics are great. I would recommend anyone who wants to work for Walgreens to love people and love business. Perform at a high level and expect great results. I just don't have a passion for it and the environment is still under construction as far as employee morale goes. You work a lot as well and odd hours. "
good,learned more about the supply chain industry along with pharmacy regulations. pretty easy job with little stress as well as proper procedures are followed.
good,"my best paying job to date however it was very time consuming and the district manager was inept. i loved working with my staff and hiring new people to join us was great. learned a great deal about retail, my store's yearly sales were well over a million dollars and i was happy that i was a big part of that"
good,"Come into work after school and stay at cash register and check customers out. When no customers are in sight, I must stock and straighten the candy isle as well as the front isle. This process repeats until either I am allowed to leave or it is time to lock the store. On ""truck day"" I help to unload all of the stock from the truck, place it into its designated area and to then later stock the shelves that are in need of the product. I have learned to be more meticulous on some things, such as straightening and stocking. I have also learned that no challenge is too much to handle. My co-workers were wonderful individuals that seemed to enjoy their jobs and the people they worked with. The hardest part of the job was the sheer boredom for hours at a time. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting employee discounts on all items."
good,"When I started here at Walgreens Home Care, it was just starting to establish patients and get into the homecare and DME business. My duties were to answer phones, filing patient charts, routing drivers, scheduled appointments, did reports, payroll, banking and many other duties."
good,great pay and benefits in management position. the company is making lots of changes.Everyday is different with new experiences.I loved the merchandising end and helping the customer best part of the job.
good,"This job required long days and a changing schedule, but was a very stable place of employment."
good,"No two days were the same and I really liked this. I was running from the time I walked through the door until I walked out. I might start covering photo department until the department was opened but the workers in the department then going to Pharmacy to fill scripts, enter them or take calls from doctors or guest. Unloading a truck with an average of 1300 pieces was a weekly thing. Making sure our truck was to the fall within 24 hours so this caused a great team and setting priorities."
good,Suggestively sell product to support company sales and facilitate growth.
good,"Being a manager at Walgreens will allow you to develop into a well rounded manager. Developing and training employees, being cross trained in all departments within the store, and understanding customer needs/wants are all apart of the job. The hardest part of the job is being able to maintain efficient production with limit hours for employees due to company budget cuts. On the other hand, the most enjoyable part of the job is working with co-workers that are team players and maintaining customer clientele while gaining new ones."
good,"From the time I started with this company to the time I quit, management changed drastically, and not in a good way. Once they let their CEO go from a pharmacist to a business major the company in my opinion started to go down hill for its employees."
good,"My typical day at work begins the moment i walk into the pharmacy. It's always busy, processing insurance, presciptions, and generating sales. Management is good. My coworkers try to work together to get the work done but the work load can be overwhelming at times. The hardest part about the job is the work load, it just never ends! But it does help pass the time by and in the end everything will get done. The thing i enjoyed most about this job is making people feel appreciated and i felt accomplished when i could help them solve any or some of their problems."
good,"Job securtiy if your f/t. Management is ok. If your in to having to push flu shots, suggestive sales, prescription transfers, and the other million things they want you to push at the register then this is right for you. If your tired of people stealing, throwing their money, telling you your rude, they dont know the difference between credit or debit, red or green, zip code or area code then apply for stock. Cause it working with general public that has no clue. Once a year raises with caps. Unrealistic deductable."
good,"My typical day at work is making sure my department sales are up. Our goal is to keep our cosmetic sales above 35% while also stocking, unloading truck, removing old tags, putting up new tags, and keeping our department clean and organized. I have learned to multitask and motivate fellow coworkers. I have learned to have a positive attitude, and to focus my attention and time on our much appreciated customers."
good,Walgreens offers management the opportunity to learn all aspects of the store. I liked the fast pace of the average workday and the support of my team members. I enjoyed working with the public and preforming conflict resolutions. The hardest part of the job was being crossed trained in so many areas at one time. I enjoyed the knowledge that I did gain in this position and the feeling of accomplishment at the end of the day. My favorite part of working in retail is being able to assist and interact with the public.
good,"fill prescriptions that are due right away in the morning, Call doctors on prescriptions that require clarification, verification, and those that are not covered or require a prior authorization."
good,Co workers were great. Management was fair. Pretty easy job.
good,Face paced work. Enjoyed working and helping customers. Co-worker are helpful and easy to work with. No ego's all about the customers. Can be stressful during the peak hours.
good,"A typical day at work consists of typing, filling, and selling of prescriptions. Doing morning filing, call list, deletes and smart count. Checking in cardinal, posting interstores, removing out of stocks and partial fills. Assisting customers getting refills, answering questions and phone calls, and helping them find merchandise. Before leaving i order cardinal, filing paperwork, sanitize the counters, take out garbage, and vacuum as needed, ect. My managers and co-workers are pleasant to work with, easy going, and very helpful! The lack of budget hours and staff i would say is the most difficult part of my job. Being the only technician in the pharmacy can be a little overwheling at times. With the constant cutting of hours sometimes it seems like there's not enough time do complete everything, so teamwork is essencial! . But the best part of my job is the customers, I try to remember names of our regulars, most of our cutsomers at this location are elderly; so i try to make conversation. There's also something to learn from them; over the years i've learned patience; understanding, and how to handle even the most difficult customers, and that a smile and a kind gesture can go a long way."
good,Walgreens is very repetative you can get burned out easily.
good,A place where you need to learn every position in the store. There is a lot of customer interaction. Management is very hands on and helps the associates with all tasks in the store.
good,I moved up pretty fast within the Walgreens store. I went from being a cashier to being trained in the pharmacy.
good,"great pay, inconsistent schedule,depend on which location your working at will rate your experience. Managersget transfered a lot."
good,"Typical day, Open store, review opening reports for any error in cash or any loss prevention issues that need to be addressed. Write notes for the day, delegate duties to employees. Check up on them throughout day."
good,"A typical day at work is very busy especially around the first of the month. I have learned a lot about marketing, multi-tasking, and communicating. The management team can be understanding and fair at times, however, when they have a heavy work load it is taken out on the employees. The hardest part of the job is meeting project deadlines while providing excellent customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people on a daily basis."
good,"over all, i have a good store, and some good managers who works with me."
good,great company to transfer if your a military Wife. But since ive worked there in 2009 ive been knocked out of the system 3 times even taking the time off when my niece and nepew passed away
good,"My opinions Id rather keep to myself. Like alot of long term employees, I made the decision to leave at an appropriate time. The values changed when the Walgreens family left the Company."
good,"I worked at Walgreens pharmacy as a technician for five years. I learned a lot about medicines and treatments, considering it was my first step into healthcare. Work was always hectic. Walgreens consistantly had budget and hour cuts, so a full staff was never guaranteed on a daily basis. Management was always reliable, however co-workers weren't, only because most of them were full-time pharmacy students. The hardest part of the job would probably be the customers. There were usually language barriers in the multiple stores I worked in, but it was eventually manageable. The most enjoyable part of the job was developing such close relationships with my long-time co-workers and managers."
good,"Walgreens can be an enjoyable place to work; but, the company benefits and compensation are not very desirable. A typical day for me is working with company cash and different aspects of the cash register. Some of the managers are very professional; but, others need to be taught how to act in a business setting. My co-workers are pleasant and easy to work with. For me there are no hard parts of this position. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to interact with the many customers I encounter on the days I am scheduled to work."
good,A typical day provided quality customer service in a fast friendly environment
good,"Fun, flexible, has great benefits, pay rate is alright but the management I was under made it difficult for me working there."
good,I had fun working at this job even though there were some stressful times.
good,I work here on the overnights for 8 days straight a week. The hardest part of the job is getting through the 10hrs a night for 8 straight nights.
good,"Numbers, numbers, numbers... at Walgreen's Central Pharmacy of Operations all quotas begin with A: ""average handle time"", ""adherence"" and ""achieved rate"" aka micro-management. If you're able to function properly in that manner than this place is for you."
good,If you keep your ears open you can learn a lot in this job. I have done just that and I am able to help not only others with common problems but my own family in many situations. The management is generally pleasant to work with. My current store manager is a really nice guy. I feel we have a good working relationship. My coworkers are also my friends. We can talk and guide each other in life situations and we also sometimes meet outside the workplace for entertainment purposes. The hardest part of the job I would have to say is taking the flack from the customers when there is nothing that can be done to please them. The most enjoyable part is getting to know the regulars and catching up on their lives.
good,"I worked with a group of great people at Walgren's. Even as a consultant, I can work one day out of 5 from home. No time cards puching, no one watching your clock, no one was abusing it. The management is like any other company, shorthanded for budget and human resource. Making it hard to do the right thing even if you have a full heart of ambitions. Poor benefits according to full time employees. The company is a old grandma/grandpa shop, so the pace is slow and every department runs their own process and procedures, a lot of wasted time and efforts. Great room for ITIL implementations (if with proper funding and man power.)"
good,"It's a good company to work for. There are alot of great manager working for the company, who cares about there employees."
good,Walgreens is an ok company to work for. If you don't mind working alot of nights then it is the management place for you.
good,"It's a good job. Too much strees about job security, All the storemanagers are great love working for them. But the corporation needs to rethink some of there decisions."
good,I liked my job. I worked midnight for about seven years.Unfortunately I had to resigh becasue I could no longer handle the hours.
good,"If you don't want steady and consistent hours it is great. The schedule changes every week and they do not guarantee anyone hours, including people that are full time. The people are pretty friendly and the benefits are good."
good,I do not recall it was 5 years ago. i do know it took some time for me to understand the register but this was my first job. It was a good starting  job and i learned everything fast enough that i got moved to photo to do more
good,"As a Seasonal Stocker over at Walgreen's, my shifts were mostly spent stocking shelves and organizing them.  Even though I was a Seasonal Stocker, I helped out pretty much all over the store.  Management can be a little strict on employees using phones.  The co workers i was with are actually pretty good people. I feel like I learned a good amount in the retail world.  But i'm always looking for more experiences and knowledge."
good,"As with any job, the people you work with make or break the entire experience, and my management team was amazing, as were my coworkers. Other than that, outside of the pharmacy, its a retail job, with all the ups and downs that come with the territory."
good,"The Job is easy and the job can be fun. Though it can be a little to stressful for what its worth. Sometimes management doesn't seem to care and you have to work every holidays. However, if you are in a real crisses Walgreens will help you out without having to pay back."
good,It has taught me so many different things. I have been trained by the best pharmacist. They really care about the customer. Also about the employees. And company morale
good,It was a pretty cool job very fast pace you deal with the community a lot especially if you are working in the pharmacy area or the pharmacy drive thru
good,"The company is not willing to give bonuses at years end to employees who work hard, this is because they believe theft is ok because they are insured.  If they had full time security personnel then that would make shrinkage a lot low and overall maybe employees would get a year end bonus like $50 in points or a $50 gift card!!"
good,"I understand timing played a role (tough fiscal Q4), but my hire and release (lay off) experience was confusing and frustrating.  My hope is that the WBA leadership aligns it's overall growth strategy going forward and are clear on the human capital and support required to move Walgreens to a more competitive and sustainable position in the marketplace."
good,"I used to love starting work here because I had excelled at my initial responsibility, which was solely a data entry position. Unfortunately, that role was stripped from me and many of my co-workers when we were told that we were entering a customer service position with very little warning. I was also told I would only perform roles of that position for a few hours per shift, but it turns out most of my scheduled shifts are dominated by this. I would advise you to be careful applying here."
good,"A typical work day includes filling at least 1,000 prescriptions per day, customer service, handling insurance issues, answering phones, and training new employees."
good,Can Be fun . Stressful if understaffed. Unfortunately open on Christmas Day.  Employee discounts were nice. Insurance options could be better for a big company.
good,It has it good days and bad days which comes with any job. I miss all my coworkers and my customers as well. It helped me learned to be patient with people. Coworkers do care about you and you make great friends. I don't hang out with coworkers. But it was a fun time. Great place for advancements. I never took in their benefits program so I cant give a review on that.
good,The benefits are great but the work environment is borderline toxic. Staff is overworked with little recognition for what is actually accomplished within a work day.
good,Advancement is largely determined by who you know and very little on how much you do.  The upper management is really knowledgeable when it comes to the business side of things but on the personal side of things they really don't get to know employees and helping them achieve to their highest level.
good,There is nothing truly exciting or new or different about working at Walgreens. Like most corporations its higher ups are out of touch and the employees can be overworked and underpaid. The only real reason to work for Walgreens would be for the pharmacy.
good,"typical day of work is helping customers with certain questions, restocking the shelves of items that need to be placed there, overall a good environment for any college or high school student who needs a job with flexible hours"
good,"Typical work day was dependent on how the previous night was closed, and how the morning was managed. The store I worked at was amazing compared to others I had filled in for. The staff knew how to communicate effectively and that made the workflow better for everyone, staff & customers."
good,"Overall my experience with Walgreens wasn't too bad. "
good,It would seem time has slow down when am not working. probably should work harder to not stand in on space too long.i like the overall experience very fun.
good,Working for Walgreens when I first started was a wonderful company. The management was kind and compassionate. But is was very stressful. We couldn't provide excellent customer service with all the other things they wanted us to do.
good,"Working at Walgreens has been like a rollercoaster. When I first started working here their were 5 other CSA and the hours and scheduling was more fair, however we ended up getting a new store manager and everything changed we hired lots of new people."
good,"Busy retail pharmacy, good benefits as far as insurance, helpful training and e-learning's, management is good, just wish they would be more employee-based."
good,Walgreens is a good company if you’re looking for something to move up in. It’s also easy to accommodate to. There’s a lot of different things you can do.
good,Walgreens will definitely work with you and your schedule. They offer the option of floating to pick up shifts all over. Typically a lot of communicate in the region.
good,"Was a good crew I worked with family workplace. Good discounts, but the scheduling was crazy not enough hours. You will get attached to your team so many nice people I met there was the only upside"
good,"Walgreens was ok to work at ,I got to helped the customers with their needs "
good,"It was a goo experience, learned a lot about retail businesses. Very simple task such as stocking, customer service, organizing the shelves for a neat presentation etc."
good,"Awesome coworkers and supervisors. Flexibility with scheduling. Not enough time to do everything that needs to be done (especially when you're on a budgeted time schedule), budget cuts mean you might not get scheduled your regular shifts."
good,"I worked 2 years as a shift leader then elected to work third shift.  After 1 year I wanted back on days, a new manager came to the store and slowly brought his people with him.  I chose a different job"
good,"Sometimes I'll have near full time hours, but my schedule will be all over the place.  One day I'm closing and the next day they want me to open.  Other times the store will barely have enough hours to give everyone a fair share.  Management was always apologetic about it but corporate simply doesn't care."
good,"Although I worked here for only a couple of months, I thought that this was a great experience to grow in personal skills like communication and leadership. I was not prepared for a very fast paced environment. At the location I worked at, was rated the busiest in the state. We always had so many people come in and one error I saw from the company is that there was never enough staff to help out. This was so frustrating for everyone to have to do double the work just because management was cutting back hours. Also employees were not reliable and would call in all the time. Sales associates had to leave their station and come help us when needed."
good,"start by putting registers in open door..get morning paper work done  ex price changes,markdowns..cash reports, start resers of pulling stock out of the stockroom,fill shelves...check in vendors in"
good,"photo tech, cos, cashier, cleaning, taking inside and outside trash out, counting money, taking care of customers, puttings tags up, taking tags down, and doing resets."
good,"Working as a beauty consultant , Walgreens does teach you how to sell based on the customers needs. It’s not an aggressive selling environment . There is often poor communication from upper management. The job started off as focusing on beauty consultations and “beauty” related customer service but you end up playing pharmacist , manager, sometimes an actual beauty Consultant , but expect to just cashier all day even though there is a designated main check out. Walgreens is becoming more understaffed which makes it hard to do the duties of a beauty consultant. Coworkers are fun but when it comes to store engagement , most people don’t participate."
good,"my roles were poorly explained when i started and so much drama. Never recognized for your hard work, they even made me come in right after i was in a car accident."
good,Working here was pretty easy. I learned how to deal with customers and coworkers while still completing my assigned work. Management was very good and was always willing to work with my school schedule.
good,"The part of the job then ' was when another company bought into Walgreens Drugs' The Hours where taken away from Workers' positions where also taken away' The Corporates office was doing the schedules for workers !! workers that had a lot of sonority ' in the company, weren't treated fairly. The management was poorly .work was a lot Drama ."
good,A typical day at Walgreens was very busy always something to do.  I learned a lot while working there. Management was very understanding and would work with you if needed. The hardest part of the job was the physical labor. Most enjoyable were the people I worked with.  I would still be there if they paid better.
good,Always worked on holidays since open 365. No work life balance. Not good enough pay to be there during rush hour or winter season. Customers come in sick and are rude
good,"They are cutting hours again to meet their projected expectations, while maintaining a great customer service atmosphere while keeping a clean and orderly store with a highly engaged staff. This company has been driving away top talent for years and now they struggle. We have leadership in our stores that shouldn’t be leaders because they are just thrown into the roll with little or no management experience. They have no loyalty"
good,"Walgreens taught me a lot , unfortunately for pharmacy there’s not much room for growth and expansion, the job can be stressful at times when management does not listen to the concerns of others"
good,"A typical day at work involves me clocking in, checking the schedule to see where i should be. then i ether go to the register or floor. On the floor if it's a truck day ,  I unload totes. The job is very relaxed and not stressful at all."
good,"On a typical day, you man the register while performing stocking duties, facing, or pricing in close proximity, offering world class customer service and resolving regular questions, concerns, and/or threats over coupon policies.  "
good,"Work hours started at 8 hours a day, 5 days a week.  Later changed to 10 hours a day, 4 days a week.  I learned the general atmosphere of warehouse work.  Management varied, strict a bit of the time.  Workplace culture placed emphasis constant and repetitive movement.  Most challenging part of the job was keeping up with the increase in productivity and working overtime.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the pay and benefits."
good,"Overall Walgreens is a good place to work."
good,with overnight there was less foot traffic and had more opportunity to move at your own pace to accomplish a task. I did have to do a lot of heavy lifted because that is when inventory came in but it was not too bad.
good,Walgreens use to be a great place to work at. When I first started with the company they were very family oriented and showed appreciation for their employees. Overtime they lost sight of that and became very driven by metrics. They started significantly reducing incintives for employees. Theybdo offer great benefits and a good discount. Career advancement is very high and likely.
good,I loved m Co-Workers and the management at my store. Others on staff seemed to genuinely care about me. The store manager was awesome and really did his best to work with my school schedule.
good,"If you haven't worked retail before, this is a great start to get experience in that field. It is very team oriented and has great structure when followed. You have an actual opportunity to grow with the company and learn so much that not only you can apply to your professional life, but personal as well."
good,"Not terrible for retail. Helping customers in the photo department could be pretty fun.  Some of the job is very repetitive, same things day in and out sometimes."
good,"- Great place to work, coworkers are like family"
good,"I have learned so much in my 6 years at this company and used to thoroughly enjoy coming to work. However,  the past couple years changes have been made and the overall feel is this company no longer cares about the employees"
good,"Store managers are working with less support/budget hours each week but are still responsible for supporting the pharmacy operations.  Each store must maintain the ""one store"" atmosphere but work with cost cutting from the support center.  Frontier and weekly pulse meetings have good intentions if the hourly budget could support the time needed to get an engaged team.  "
good,"Typical workday starts at 8 am and ends at 4:30-5 pm. "
good,I feel like Walgreen's is a starter job for techs. After being here for 3 years I'm ready to move forward and expand my career in the pharmaceutical world.
good,I liked the job when I was 16 but as I got older I was not receiving the hours I needed I wanted to full time but was never given the hours or cut right below what is considered full time. But loved the people and the job at hand just was not being paid enough and getting Enough hours
good,"have to keep up with patients coming in, getting prescriptions filled, entering prescription in data system, insurance billing, making phone calls to patients, doctor's offices, insurance companies, keeping track of the inventory, maintaining a safe and clean environment"
good,Working for Walgreen's really gives an insight as to how we are the secondary care for our customers/patients. Even though it is a stressful job it also very rewarding.
good,very productive environment. lots of opportunities' to grow with the company. Team is very engage with each other. stable place to work in. very clean environment.
good,A typical day consists of processing pharmacy prescriptions for customers at local walgreens pharmacies. The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to work from home
good,"fast pace company"
good,welcoming working environment. there are incentives given as well as recognition for quarterly performance. I would recommend this company for someone just starting their professional career.
good,It's good for someone who wants to start their career. The people I work with are fun but there is too many metrics. they are actually against workflow. They take away our time to help customers.
good,Short staffing problems. Was a fun place before management changed hands. We were left without a manager for 1 year. Store suffered a lot along with employees.
good,I worked as a beauty advisor and loved it. I really enjoyed my co-workers and the work environment in general. I enjoyed selling the products and getting to know the customers.
good,"Task are pretty much laid out on a day to day. The higher tier store the more employees and hours. So long as you put in the effort and are vocal with advancement, it's possible. Very flexible with scheduling and respectively easy."
good,Everyone is great to be around! If you do your job everyone is quite pleasant. They reward you for doing well and give you a raise every year. Benefits are great too. They take care of there FULL TIME employees. If your there part time your days are numbered from the start but they are loyal and they want u to work for them it’ll just be on and off and switching store.
good,"good pay, Good management easy to talk to. Employees were nice and helpful. the hours are flexible with notice. Drawbacks short lunches long hours on your feet."
good,"My work day begins with reviewing anything which was left over from the day before. I check in with my supervisor and inquire about any new patients and any projects in which he needs me to start. Once that is completed I start my computer work. Which consists of opening my computer programs which I have about 6 different programs to check on. Once I have checked all programs I can begin calling my patients. I check on their medications and also check to see if they have had any problems with in the last month. I have about 200 patients and I must keep track of all medications as well and their financial needs. Once I have completed my phone calls I then document all contacts and ready the medications for shipment. I also fill all prescriptions for my patients. My patients have certain disease states, HIV CF,MS, Cancer patients. I have learned a lot about the different medications for each disease state, "
good,"Employee benefits cld be better "
good,"Walgreens was my 1st real job I ever had. I worked their for 14 years. I loved it when I first started working there, but things changed through the years and corporate was making our jobs harder on us with less staff & not giving good raises. I Customers would yell at me & it would take forever for management to come & resolve the problem. After being their for 9 years, it was really stressful & not fun. It became just a job."
good,"Sure, a morning shift can be quiet, yet still busy in the wee hours. Also, the security guards I've worked alongside were all satisfactory. Sometimes, management could be irritable now, but not like back when I was first working there. The most enjoyable part of working there, honestly, is the Floorwork portion. Keeping everything in order is probably the most difficult, however. What I've learned is to always keep your eyes and ears open, even through a misunderstanding."
good,"It was a good job for college students, flexibility with classes and pay was okay for being  a college student. hours can be difficult as  our store closed at 1 am, so with classes most started around the 5- 1 am shift. There is also the ability to move up the walgreens fairly easily with a hard work and good managers."
good,I used to enjoy the challenge of merchandising to increase sales.  Now every store is the same and not orientated to the customers they have in the neighborhood
good,It was very biased and not everyone was treated fairly.   The management was not good. It was very unorganized. The hours were lengthy. I would not recommend this place.
good,Need to remember businesses are made because of customers service.  Good company prior to them trying to take from the lower levels to hit their bottom line.
good,I somewhat enjoy working at Walgreens. Their attendance policies are very strict. The personal allotted time for using bathroom etc is very strict. The benefits and vacation accurral are above par.
good,Coming to work every day allows me to affect peoples pharmaceutical therapies and suggest any changes i see may be needed.   Also I help keep them up-to-date on immunizations.
good,Decent company to work for. Enjoy working for them. Could inform the employees better. Should communicate more since transitioning is taking place. Rite aid transition to Walgreens could be smoother
good,"Productive but it needs to care more about it's employees.sometimes the customer is not always right and even though the manager knows it, they do not uphold their workers so sometimes we have to rely on HR."
good,you work as a team. train employees and coach them. Do the schedule and work directly with the store manager to achieve the store goals. follow up on the metrics weekly and make plans to hit the goals.
good,"It's a part-time job. In many ways like a fast-food job, but cleaner. Training is fragmentary. Many things you are expected to learn on the job, though some employees are fired for making costly mistakes."
good,Management does their job well. Team work is essential. New tasks every week and new strategies every week. Fun working environment for fast learners.
good,"As a company, Walgreens has excellent benefits and job advancement opportunities. Working on the front end is pretty basic cashier work, and the photo lab is very fun to work in. "
good,Very rewarding employment because it allows you to build relationships with loyal customers.  There are great benefits for employment including discounts on almost all items on sale at the store.
good,"Crazy busy all the time, not enough people that want to work. Pharmacy is insane. Great manager at the store I worked at, did not get the support from corporate that he needed."
good,"New to therapy and late to refill calls conducted daily, maintaining accurate inventory, mandatory counseling implementation. Drug utilization review and product verification. Physician contacted for new prescriptions and interventions. Transferring prescriptions and conducting third party authorizations. The most enjoyable part of working was a supportive staff."
good,"A typical day at work depends on what department you work in. Working on the floor deals with a lot of customer interactions and inventory/stocks. Sometimes there's heavy lifting required, depending on how much you can handle. Working on the floor also means you need to communicate with other locations to see if they have something your store does not. Online ordering is also something you are responsible for. Walgreens also has a photo department, so a lot of service are available there. Those services include assembling calendars, magnets, photo books, canvas prints, wooden panels, and just printing regular pictures. The cashier is responsible for handling all customer transactions, returns, and taking all the phone calls. In the pharmacy the responsibilities are different. We handle counting medication, taking in prescriptions, ringing out patients for their prescriptions, calling doctors, handling insurance issues, and we also offer vaccinations which the pharmacist administers."
good,A typical day at work is coming in and helping people that are at the counter dropping off or picking up prescriptions. Help fill medications. Restock medications.
good,"Walgreens is a fast pace pharmacy with stressful expectations from corporate. A typical day at work calls for hundreds of prescriptions, providing customer care and quick and effective service. I was given walgreens as an extern placement for my college course."
good,"If you like fast paced work enviroment, this is for you, loved the rush hours, hated sundays (slow day), great relationship with the other co-workers."
good,"Its a great place to work. Management was great, the work place culture was ok, the hardest part is understanding my position and the different things that comes with it."
good,"Average drug store enviorment, occasionally the work could pliie on but usually a calm enviorment. Sales associates usually keep the isles clean and swept also while working the cash register. As well as completing daily task like helping customers, facing isles and setting tags."
good,"typical day at work is running around the store on the floor, the registers, pharmacy, photo, etc. Store manager is great but the assistant managers tend to be stricter. With the right management the store can be a great place to work, Very rewarding when you are able to help a customer with something like photo or pharmacy"
good,What I liked about this job is that I was always busy. I loved the community life and that Walgreens is located in an urban area. The hardest part of the job CAN sometimes be dealing with customers. Some are impatient but overall my team and I did our best to have them out quickly
good,It's a fast paced place to work for the hardest part of the job is working in a stressful environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is making our customers happy.
good,"After clocking in to work, I immediately begin taking care of incoming community patients who are dropping off and picking up prescriptions. The line of customers in the store for pick up and drop offs are very long and I have learned to ring out patients at the cash register, type up prescriptions, process different insurances for prescriptions, fill needed prescriptions, and file prescriptions in their appropriate bins, all the while maintaining professionalism in the working environment. The hardest part about the job is not having enough employees available to assist with certain pharmacy responsibilities. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people get the medication they need to live happy and healthy lives."
good,I liked the job but when I requested a day off they wouldn't work with me even when given a month advance. Overall the job was easy and a good establishment to work at.
good,"As a cashier things were constanly changing, sometimes management wanted this or that. But whatever, just give me a list of what you want and Ill do it. "
good,"The company is great with good benefits. Very busy environment with not enough staff, or hours to staff employees. They do help with getting certification and do help to schedule around schooling."
good,"I worked at 5 different stores in a permanent position and 3 or 4 other stores as temporary help, filling in for a day. Each store is ran slightly differently with a solid baseline of rules to follow through the policy and procedures that Walgreen's lays down in addition to any rules or regulations we must follow according to legislation. Every store has it's own atmosphere, and it's own ability to succeed through it's people. Walgreen's is a great place to work if you like a challenge and a fast paced environment. I spent years training staff, moving to other stores continuously, and building up the employees as I went. Many employees still ask about me, or remain in contact with me to this day."
good,"Can work long hours (if under staffed). Depending on your relationship with your store, everyone can be friendly and helpful. It's like a family. It is also easy to move up. As long as you are consistent, work hard, and show up to work; you're more eligible to be promoted."
good,"There were not enough people on staff. we worked fast paced all day. not enough cashiers, stock people, or photo techs. We multitask all day and some nights closing."
good,Day to day lot of things to be done. Very fast paced atmosphere must be able to multitask and work under stress. Company rolling out many new initiatives and programs to keep things new and innovative.
good,"Walgreens overall was a great experience to work. Never really had a problem with the job's policy or what they asked us to do overnight. During the overnight shift, we mainly stocked, greet the late night customers, cleaned the store, and if any questions was asked about the sales or pharmacy, we would give them an answer to the best of our knowledge."
good,"I was a seasonal associate at Walgreens so I did not have any benefits, I was only there for a few months.  It was a good place to work.  The management was good with the staff"
good,I was a stocker at Walgreens and I enjoy interacting with people helping them find products that they needed also Walgreens is a good company to work for and a very nice team to work for too.
good,"Just another basic retail job. The workload itself wasn't difficult, but the difficulties came on many other forms on the job. For example, some customers can take being rude and entitled to an unimaginable level. When not dealing with rude customers, then you have incompetent management. Believe it or not, the store is ran by under-qualified people who just faked it til they made it and kissed the right amount of butt. Most management do not care about you, but really care about saving their own butts. Working there for a long time you will see different employees come and go because this is a retail job, and in my opinion not for long term. You would drive yourself crazy working there if you're a person who takes their work seriously. But like I said, it isn't a difficult job, just the politics of it all is not worth it."
good,"this is a demanding fast paced job with limitations in staffing that makes the job particularly stressful when the safety and accuracy of medications that can affect people's lives are at stake.  this will undoubtedly be the most stressful part of the job.  other than that there is a sense of accomplishment and rewarding feeling when serving the community that is unique to the work of pharmacists.  there will always be a sense of balancing customer service, patient safety, and business objectives that makes the job both challenging/rewarding and stressful/frustrating.  a great deal of patience is required to deal with the demands of customers, patients, and other health care providers that often occurs simultaneously and can be overwhelming.  you will deal with irate customers and very kind customers as well.  be prepared for the ups and downs that is typical in the daily life of retail operations."
good,Corporate is located in Chicago with offices across the United States.  The Regional Leadership is great to work with but the coordination and support of software to support job expectations is limited at best.
good,"When I started in 2004, Walgreens was an excellent company to work for-employees had a fair workload because there were plenty of them and the pay was generous. When I left in 2017, stores were working with a skeleton crew, workloads were impossible to keep up with, and spirits were down. In 2010, 3/4 of the assistant managers lost their titles-and around $4/hr-and were demoted to ""shift leaders"", a new title corporate came up with for the exact same job as an assistant manager. Some of them had been with the company for more than 20 years. It was terribly unfair. Store employees had hours cut and days of truck deliveries no longer had all hands on deck. "
good,"Observed and documented patient status and reported patient complaints to the pharmacist. Completed and submitted clinical documentation in accordance with agency guidelines."
good,"I enjoyed working there.  I do feel that things have changed over the years and not all in a good direction.  Too many new policy changes and responsibilities/role changes that you just can't keep up with them all as well as discrimination issues throughout the company  They will terminate for any reason without notice or warning at times, depending on your role.  The expectations are too high and not attainable but they have no problem holding you accountable for them, whether they are in your control or not.  Used to be a great place to work, but now it is so result driven and the standards so high that you feel you are set up to fail."
good,Running the register was a typical day at work. I would usually work from 5 p.m.to close at 10 p.m. the work environment was slow but the customers of Walgreens was not good.
good,Physical with little support. People were extremely nice. Managers were great although demanded too much of their assistants. Salary was not high but still not bad. Consistant with other type jobs.
good,"walgreens is a very relaxed workplace, the people are ok, at times it's stressful, the pay is low, the benefits are ok, good job if you don't have one"
good,"Walgreens had Walgreens people at CEO for years.  When Walgreens was bought by Boots Alliance, I was pushed out after twenty-eight years with the company, most of them in management."
good,A typical work day consists of customer service and focusing on working fast paced and ready for different challenge everyday.  Most enjoyable part of the job is when team members are  all engaged and ready to strive for the best of business.
good,"My days at work are usually interesting. there is always something new to learn, Walgreens is a place where you learn to work as a team, Managers are very friendly and caring with their employees, the hardest part of my job is to make sure employees finish the goals i have set for the day. the best part of my job is working and winning together as a team."
good,"most places are very fast pace, with the right staff working everything can be done, however, we tend to lose a lot of good staff due to their low salary."
good,I was an assistant manager at Walgreens. There was not much advancement availability for store management positions. I do not think outstanding work performance is as compensated as it should be. Assistant managers should make more starting out.
good,"Its not a terrible place to work, I just got sick of the place after 10 years. You can get promoted easily if you can prove yourself competent enough to do the job. The benefits are pretty good."
good,"It really depends on what Walgreens you choose to work at. The slower stores can bore you to tears, the higher volume stores usually don't have enough staff and the work load can be overwhelming, especially during the holidays."
good,I enjoyed working at Walgreens most of the time.  I enjoyed in interaction with the customers and the accomplishment of doing my job to the best of my ability.  I could always find something to do during the slow moments of my shifts.
good,"a typical day at work going so fast because a lot of work , a lot of patient and everybody is in hurry. People do not communicate a lot, because busy schedule. The hardest part of job: multitask, the most enjoyable part of the job: time flies really fast."
good,"Walgreens I feel wanted a bunch of ""yes"" men to simply only follow what management requested.  No forward thinking or allowing their pharmacists to think on their own and make decisions for tailored for their patients."
good,"In the pharmacy it can get very hectic as patients line up all at the same time, or all right before closing. Some days, there are an abundance of prescriptions to fill as soon as you open, or it's pretty balance throughout the day. Positions seem to constantly change with technicians coming in and out of the store, and new managers being assigned to various stores. Honestly, if you end up at a solid location with a good pharmacy manager the job is pretty great."
good,"Very fast paced, got lunch breaks. Great store manager,  very tough working drive through. computer system not very user friendly. no user manual or cheat sheet. there was computer lessons to work through that were to train you. I never had enough time to get through all of them and some of the lessons were on machines and equipment that we so not have in our store"
good,"between dealing with customers & duties that your given, it can be a pretty stressful job. especially knowing that you get a paid very little. the advancement in the company doesn't have many options."
good,"the job is very physical...you are basically babysitting a half million dollars worth of merchandise...most days are spent moving the merch around, pricing it, repricing it, stocking it...not quite enough customer time, which is the best part; if you are ambitious and can play the copr game, you can go up the ladder at this company since they do promote from within, the store culture is different in each location and relies heavily on the influence of that store's management. Because of that people often transfer between stores looking for a better fit."
good,I learned a lot and was given lots of opportunities to advance.  The constant pleasing of customers was the only major problem. People get upset when they can't get the medication that the doctor has yet to approve.
good,not enough employee to work and expect management to do it all. working almost all holidays ad they don't appreciate your hard work and dedication ...
good,"I regularly work up front at the register at my store.  Overall, I enjoy my job. My coworkers make the atmosphere very pleasant and are always sweet. However, Walgreens seems to promote ""the customer is always right"" culture. Often times when customers were difficult, and the store wasn't in the wrong, management would just feed into customer tantrums rather than sometimes standing up for their cashiers. It made me feel like my job or more so to be a doormat for customers rather than helping them find products and checkout."
good,It's a good place but the schedule is not the best. I have to be in the pharmacy a lot and we don't get a lot of help sometimes. A lot is expected from me which I don't mind but I don't think it's completely fair
good,"Great company to grow with! Unfortunately, I was the youngest working there. Maybe for an adult older than I am, possibly in their 30s. The most enjoyable part of the job was scanning the products into the register and learning more about their register (which was different than other registers). I thought it was great helping customers and also scanning the products. The hardest part of the job was that there was no sort of communication. They were a'lot older. I left to find a better group of co-workers to work with."
good,Walgreens expects quite a lot from their employees with very low pay. When you work in that type of atmosphere you will not get the quality of employees that you would like working with.
good,manager given the ability to make decision and able to change store for sales. the most enjoyable part of the job was that all managers in district were close and felt like friends.
good,If you work in the front of the store its fine and fun but once you work in the pharmacy and if your store is open 24 hours can get really busy fast..
good,Walgreens is a high stress environment. It has truly shown me what I am capable of. I have acquired the skills of multitasking while simultaneously being detailed oriented.  I believe I would be able to handle any pharmacy from this experience.
good,I left for a reason...the work environment changed a lot in the almost 10 years I worked there.  It is a typical retail environment.  My staff was excellent.
good,"At Walgreens, I worked as an intern in the pharmacy. I would print prescriptions, find the correct medication, count out the correct amount of medication if needed, and fill them to be reviewed and checked over by the pharmacist."
good,"I was a trainee, and everything about the pharmacy was cool. The coworkers were always helpful. Even though they would talk about their personal lives while customer were waiting bothered me, but it was a real good place to work."
good,"Working at Walgreens can be very fun. A typical day is stocking shelves, attending to customers needs and cleaning. I've learned how to cashier, how to meet customers needs and how to keep the store outdate free, and clean. Management is nice, everyone is easy to get along with. The hardest part is probably dealing with customers complaints, blaming the cashiers for the things we have no control over. The most enjoyable part is that all the employees get along, making it a stress free workplace."
good,"You need a lot of patience for a job here.  You meet a lot of different people, and you will be taught a lot of different aspects of what the company provides."
good,"I feel that I am a overrated cashier at times.  I have my pharmacy tech license, but working in the general public can kill your spirit.  If you enjoy working with the general public, answer phones, reading chicken scratch handwriting from doctors, and waiting on hold with nurses and insurance companies, then this is the job for you."
good,They have friendly customers and the environment is calm. It is a beautiful place to work all the way around. I learned how to improve my customer service.
good,"Okay company to work for overall. They pay you better than minimum wage to do very minimal work. Offered me advancement. Management is not always the brightest, but they're nice people."
good,"I loved seeing our members each day and listening to their stories. It was hard however, when a loved one passed away and we had to help them when our hearts were breaking for them."
good,"Raises stop at a certain cap. Then no more raises. Which is why I am looking for a new job. I can't support my family on the same wage every year, especially with the cost of living going up."
good,"I love working for the Walgreens store in Mount Juliet, Tennessee, but feel that for the amount of work that I do that I am extremely under paid. The amount of pay the pharmacy technician's receive in the pharmacy is nothing compared to the amount of stress and responsibility that we handle every single day."
good,"This job is great for people hoping for advancement, especially for aspiring pharmacy technicians. They'll give the hours. It's very busy and time sure does go by fast."
good,"7 to 8 hour work day"
good,"The job was fine, but if you're working at the front then it is incredibly boring. Honestly there isn't enough to do. Management was mostly okay. Its good for a first job."
good,"I worked at Walgreens for over a year and was told that I would be working days or nights, which is fine. I worked practically all midshifts (10-8, 11-7). I was in school full time plus working here full time and my schedule was terrible because of the midshifts. Most (I stress most) of the managers were wonderful and helpful. I met some great people here."
good,"Competitive pay"
good,I love helping customers. But they messed up positions pay. designated hitter and beauty consultants are making more money than leaders.RIDICULOUS! i DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE COMPANY
good,I have worked at a store where management was horrible and I was miserable and at a store where management was decent and I am somewhat happier. The store only cares about customer happiness no matter what customers claim against yourself. Be prepared to  sound like a robot and be expected to smile like a Cheshire cat.
good,Hard to maintain a work life balance but provides many resources to be succesful. Very customer based with also a strong emphasis on employee development
good,I worked there part time and was making 9.15 an hour. I learned about from the other employees about money and how to deal with customers
good,"Great place for any responsible aged person to work. Employees get a discount, pharmacy offers training program, room to advance."
good,The hardest part of the job was being understaffed and having to receive truck alone on occasion having to separate and distribute all items to their designated areas without much/any help
good,"this place has really nice co-workers but don't like how the management run it, I feel like they are nice working environment with fun and loving customers."
good,Good place to work. Nice people had. equipment problems had different food vendor.flexible work schedule they paid great gave raises on regular baises
good,"Good team members and bosses. Hours were flexible . Work was easy, and helped me build job skills. I had a supportive work schedule to my personal life"
good,"filled 300+ Rx's per day. At my own cost, I had a coffee Service for my customers while waiting for their Rx's.  "
good,"leadership does not communicate with NPs, working independently is good but mostly you are by yourself doing all the coding, checking in pt, triage, and management money transactions, and cleaning"
good,"While attending walgreens, I would work a daily schedule that consist of checking out customers, stocking items on shelf, Maintain store, and giving customer service to anyone that needs help. Management was great considering it was just me and the manager working. The hardest part about working for walgreens was staying up hours of the night at first, but adjusted the longer I worked there. The most enjoyable part about working at walgreens was meeting new people and helping anyone of service."
good,The co-workers were great to work with.  The only thing is some of the customers were always upset no matter how much you'd help them.
good,As a company I am very sure walgreens can be a great place to work at; however i believe that the company really shoould allow the shift manager the opportunity to discipline the employees and shift the accountability from ASM only to all leaders the store would run more smoothly. plus pay shift managers more we really run the stores.
good,"The raise system in the company suck, if you either a shift leader or an ASM then you basically working just to pay your bills. Not a career job unless u like dealing with ppl on an everyday basics while standing for 8 hours."
good,"I currently work at Walgreens as a Beauty Advisor. I really enjoy the work environment and the people I get to meet with my job. I provide help for customers who are looking for products as well as maintaining the cosmetics department for customers. I like the management everyone is very open specifically when yo are in need of help. The stock room is kinda messy and the store itself tends to be a bit unorganized at times; however, we have just started a new program called frontiers which is a movement that allows the worker to get together and discuss needs of the store and customers."
good,Good job if you have good management. No set schedules makes life difficult for finding a baby sitter but management usually open to work with students to accommodate classes.
good,"As long as you can handle retail and you are good with customer service, you can handle Walgreens. The benefits are awesome and pay is coming into line with competing companies. The only issue is budget hours for some stores and the attitude of your DM."
good,"Coworkers are amazing, lunch breaks are about 45 mins to an 1 hour. Only real drawback are some customers, they can be a real handful and can cause stress."
good,really it's a simple job with decent pay. nothing to really complain about for the place itself. maybe a manager or 2 can be annoying but thats most jobs
good,I have been working at Walgreens for 2 years now. i have learned so many things and acquired new skills.I started of as a simple cashier and have moved my way to every department including back in the pharmacy.I'm a fast learner and open minded to my job site.
good,Working at Walgreens was a fun part time job that helped me better my communication and socializing skills. I enjoyed working there but I out grew the sow paced work flow.
good,"A typical day at work was being able to give great customer service and assist the pharmacist with handling Dr. calls, pilling medications, customer calls, pulling medications, ringing up customers, and advertising."
good,"Typically a very swift day including much help with the patients needs (insurance, costs). Requires full attention set all day. Juggling dozens of sets of patients valuable information with a strong sense of importance and prioritization of needs to each individual patient. Multitasking is a MUST."
good,"A typical day at work was either working on registers or stocking shelves. Most days were not rigorous and very slow paced. Occasional poor communication with management, but nice, friendly environment. Worked more on registers and not as a beauty adviser that I applied for."
good,I liked working with the public and meeting all kinds of people. and enjoyed the challenging work and every day was something different .
good,"Numbers and meeting requirements and sales expectations and important, Friendly environment, mangers could be more consistent in relaying information to new employees."
good,"Hardest part of the job is not having management to help you when you need it because the pharmacy comes first."
good,"Overall a very good place to work for with great benefits."
good,"If i was a costumer i would go to Walgreens to fill my Rx"
good,I was given the tasks of restocking the shelves with low products. Reorganizing and receiving goods that did not sell and seasonal items as well.
good,Good first job out of high school. i enjoyed working at walgreens and it is a great company. I am a hard worker and this is one company anyone can move up in.
good,I helped pharmacists fill prescriptions. It was rewarding to learn about the medications and help out patients.There was flexibility in scheduling.
good,I worked there for about a year and was in the same position. I had no complains from my managers about my work. Always did my stuff on time. They did give me a .20 cent raise.
good,"Working as a Customer Service Rep for this company can be very flexible when it comes to the hours you can work which can facilitate you to focus on something else while you are making some money on the side. However, their pay is too low for what you do and the importance of the position itself."
good,This is a great company to work for. Being employed with them for 12+ years has given me lots of opportunities and experiences.
good,"On overnights we ordered pizza often. We worked hard but it was fun.I  stocked, did photo orders, register, and police reports occasionally. I usually worked with two people on a full Night. Manager and cashier. I dealt with both dangerous and difficult customers from 4:00pm till 11:00pm- 11:30pm until 7:00am. From shoplifters to Heroin shooters, I delt with it all."
good,A normal day working was mostly at the front register. Ringing up sales for the customers. Assisting customers find what they were looking for.
good,"Being a pharmacy manager I have to multi-task everything that goes on in the pharmacy. That includes balancing work flow, efficiency in filling prescriptions, ensuring our patients are satisfied with our customer services. Educate my staff on various changes or modifications done at the corporate and put into practice .Delegate tasks to my co-workers and fellow pharmacists and ensure things get done in a timely manner"
good,A typical day at this job is very similar to the review I wrote about Rite Aid. A pharmacy is a pharmacy. I always manage to get a long with my co-workers and work as a team. The hardest part of my job is work in a high stress busy environment. Challenges are always staying calm and patient in this type of environment.
good,Good place to work if you are not there full time. Would be more enjoyable if corporate weren't what you always expect a corporate to be.
good,"Walgreens was my first job as I returned home from college. The store was hiring qualified workers for the Photo department. "
good,"Great company to work for. Very laid back environment. I loved my manager as well. Some of the upper management ws a bit snobby, but overall I say it's a nice company"
good,"Worked for the company for more than 9yrs, and I've learned a few things when trying to move up in the company; It all depends on who you work for."
good,"-Great Customer Service"
good,Management is a bit on the horrible side. It great place for pharmacy tech advancement. Employees doesn't do much to work together or help each other out.
good,I liked my job because everyday is different and routine at the same time which is my perfect balance. The company restructures a lot which makes it difficult for the common employee. Especially the full time employees
good,great place to work but the pay is very low end and they are open 365 days a year so just about every holiday you have to work.
good,Good Place To Work But I Would Like To Be In A Place Where I Can Advance And Move Up. My Coworkers were great motivational people.I Learned A lot Work For This Company.
good,"I loved coming to work everyday interacting with customers and my employees. I really enjoyed molding the employees and making them feel like they were a part of team by doing a variety of tasks that to some, were challenging."
good,"I'm a photo specialist and I really enjoy it. I like teaching the customer how to use our kiosk stand and showing them creative things we can do with their photos. While making sure photo is running smoothly I also do numerous of other thing like making sure I meet every customer needs. I also have some floor duties like, stocking the shelves, making sure the product counts match our system counts. I really enjoy working their because I love to multitask and my position requires a lot of multitasking but I'm a Registered Medical Assistant and I would like to find a job in my field."
good,"A typical day at work was very busy from the moment I would walk in. I would review emails, say hi to my employees, take notes on what needed to be completed before the end of the day. I learned how to work in a fast paced environment from delegating tasks to assisting customers, answering phone calls and etc. the store manager was always supportive and clear on what needed to be done. My co-workers were very helpful when I had questions or concerns. The hardest part about this job was working crazy hours during the week and during holidays. Although I enjoyed the luncheons we would have with the employees and managers in the store during the holiday season."
good,working for walgreens was like being in school..Every day I was being trained on some other task or taking a test. Actually this is why I remained employed with the company.I enjoyed the customers and employees..I will use my skills and talent to advance with your company and within my professional career.
good,"Walgreens is one of the largest drugs retailing chain in the U.S. It has its headquarters in Deerfield and operates more than 9000+ stores across US. This project is to provide 2nd level and 3rd level support for development, test and production environments for all the projects in Walgreens. "
good,Nice place to work and friendly people. You're on your feet alot so you need to get good shoes. I learned that keeping up a good work ethic and smile on your face helps the customers to feel more welcomed. Some customers are truly rude and impatient but you need to be able to be respectful no matter what. Some days were really long having to work nights (10:30pm)and then wake up to open (7:00am) is horrible and makes the employees feel stressed. That would be only only con. I signed up for part-time but ended up working full time. Some days you may feel stretchered.
good,"A typical day varies, sometimes its busy sometimes its slow, just depending on the season. Walgreens gave me the best experience there is to be the  type of manager I am today. I have grown so much from my first day and developed so many lasting relationships that have built my character to be what it is today. The managers do their best to coach, teach and develop you for career advancements when you prove yourself.My co-workers are like family, and like family we bicker, make up, support and care for each other. It is a very tight-knit culture in the stores.The hardest part of the job is the cutomers, you meet so many different personalities and you try your best to adapt to each one and strive to deliver the best customer service possible. The most enjoyable part of my job is just coming into work and embrace whatever challenge awaits me for that day."
good,I work with some of the most competent and fun people I've ever met. We really work together well and we are quick and efficient. Pharmacy management is great but the front of the store leaves a lot to be desired. Forget about assistance from the front of the store you are not getting it. I also work at a very high volume store so the stress level is ridiculously high. It isn't all bad but having to deal with Store Management is a headache and sometimes can really take away from the value of the job.
good,"Days were pretty easy (Stocking and facing food), I learned to work with people who were VERY different than me, Management was great! Loved co-workers, they were friendly and helpful, hardest part of job was learning the ins and outs of job, most enjoyable part was gaining new skills!"
good,"Overall, I love my job and the environment of the pharmacy because it is related to my study field which is Biochemistry."
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work with great health benefits. There is always a positive environment in the store, and helping customers with their daily essentials is a pleasure."
good,I think working at walgreens is ok but theres always that person that ruins it. but you learn to get over it and keep a smile for the people that are trying to brighten your day. some people were cool to work with there but there was a lot of people that weren't but I still respected them. but I loved the customers that came through that's what got me through the days.
good,"A typical day at Walgreens would involve customer relations, cashier, stocking shelves, making shelves presentable for the next day, cashing my till, and light custodial work. "
good,"It is a good company just not for me."
good,I enjoyed the fast pace of the location i was at and the people i worked with. The pharmacy manager and the store manager were both very skilled and knowledgable.
good,"Walgreens can be the best and worst place to work, but I liked it there. the hardest part was being around a lot of sick people all the time. the managers are very friendly and consider you a part of the family."
good,"The store itself is very busy, and demanding. However, the team our store had made work more enjoyable. Together we tried to make our shifts as fun and productive as possible."
good,"Nice place to work for a young student. I moved up quickly in the company, but the workload does not match the compensation, for any employee. Very demanding job daily from the customers, store condition, maintaining employees, to management. The most enjoyable was finding friendships in coworkers, it was easy for everyone to get along because its always a team effort to complete the day. I love managing people and running a store, just would appreciate more recognition for it."
good,"Helped customers with questions or concerns, stocked shelves, directed employees what to do, counted drawers, checked in vendors. I learned management skills as well as how to handle customers who were angry. Also how to read cash reports. The managers were all very capable and understanding. My co-workers were very nice hard working individuals. The hardest part of the job was dealing with dissatisfied customers. It was most enjoyable when a customer told me how much help i had been for them."
good,"A typical day at work is counting money, building end-stands, side- panels, and merchandising the promotional aisle, checking in vendors, taking control over the store when the store manager is not there, giving employees tasks to do while working, paper work, loss prevention, always moving on my feet, helping and greeting customers, ringing up on registers, printing photos, posters, canvas, calendars, etc. Making signs for the end-stands, side-panels, and merchandising the store, putting up sale price sale signs, filling prescriptions, filing prescriptions, and working in the pharmacy when it is busy."
good,"managers give to do lists daily"
good,"Striven to get everyday duties done, while helping with customer service. I learned new work duties every day,in order to challenge myself, and progress in my department. Most of the management were great, understanding, and willing to work with employees specific needs."
good,The pay does not equal the work or abuse we incur from the patients. There is little help from upper management.
good,I love the people that I work with. My schedule is flexible  Unfortunately there is little room for advancement and the compensation is poor.
good,"Company looks out for employees but if in management you are expected to forget any life you had before being a manager. The company has to be everything you eat, sleep, and breath."
good,It is a fun place to work you actually get to know a lot of people. at a typical day of work you spend time with around 200 customers. Managers are very strictly and expect you to give a 110%. Coworkers are the best part you will make them your 2nd family. The hardest part of the job is on warehouse days because you need to find time to put all new products stuff on shelf plus attend the cash register and never forget about customers. What i enjoy most was to speak and meet new people or the ones you see everyday coming to your store.
good,"typical retail environment"
good,"Typically uneventful, occasional need to cover shifts, but helped me learn about several different jobs"
good,"A typical day of work at Walgreen's would be starting off stocking the items that need to be refilled from previous day. I would cover each department's fifteen minute and thirty minute breaks throughout the day. I may have to pull inner store items, so that they could be delivered to other Walgreen's location. Some days I have to do resets and revisions to different areas in the store.  I have to multitask everyday. If I am working on something, I may have to stop several times to help a customer.  Once a week I have to complete inventory counts and order items that are out in my assigned area.  I get along with all of my co-workers including the management staff.  I've learned to have more patience when dealing with consumers that are irate.  I love working with the customers.  They are the reason that I enjoy my job.  It makes me happy to know that many of our customers appreciate that fact that I still work for Walgreen's."
good,"Your day is never the same as a shift leader. The hours and days always vary. You never have the same schedule. I learned that I pushed myself so much to get where I am at now and I know more than most shift leaders do. My management team communicates with each other on a daily basis, if not on an hourly basis. We always know what's going on at the store. My co-workers are some of the best I have ever worked with. The hardest part of my job is not being able to spend time with my family whenever I would like to, especially on holidays. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I am always learning something new and I am training myself if I ever do get promoted to the next level."
good,"Supported customers in all areas of need.  Maintain good rapport with managers and co- workers, and customers.  Recognized by the local Walgreens district as “Customer Service Champ.”"
good,"•	Janitorial work: utilizing cleaning products"
good,"develop customer orders within the hour, stocking, and assisting checkout."
good,"A Typical Day of work consists of Opening and Closing the store, scheduling, maintaining stock, keeping up with employees, helping out where help is needed."
good,"Pharmacist with added manager responsibilities."
good,"Only been working here a month and a half but my co-workers are all great people, we've become good friends in the short time ive been there.  Managers are always there to help with anything, i've never worked with such a great collective group of people in any job i've had."
good,"start the day doing my daily task. Helping customers find what they need. Either by getting from another store, online, or order it for them when next truck delivery. work with vendors, key holder, help other staff by making sure they understand their daily task. Keeping the store clean. Helping with different areas , cash handling, learn management duties. work under store managers. work on rests, Helped out in the pharmacy when needed. Try to have creative ideas to help keep customers coming back in different departments. Hardest part is to try and manage the store when you are short staffed. when its only you and one other employee that is running the store and both of us are trying to be in several places to help customers."
good,The job was excellent but I would rather work out of my own house as my first real job.
good,My job is consisted of helping patients and providing a safe and comfortable environment where customers receive their prescriptions and are well enough to know we're here and always lending a helping hand whenever they need.
good,"A typical day is you go in talking to the previous photo tech and seeing what is going on with the photo lab; being as though sometimes the lab is out of order or dirty I focus on that then I can get to actually doing any orders that is in the system. Also being a photo tech plus customer service associate, you are in charge of the cooler and floor as well so multi-tasking those three things can be pretty stressful and tiring but it is apart of the job. The most enjoyable part of working there is that you get to talk and meet people from different cultures and nationalities it let you know the success and broadness of the company."
good,"Work is varied and challenging but workload can become unbearable for people with responsibilities outside of work. Management is intelligent but unfocused leading you down paths that separate you from your core responsibilities, which are ultimately what you are graded on for performance. Opportunity to learn and grow but management has deaf ears when it comes to realistic goal setting and true process improvements."
good,To start off a typical day I would come in and get all the money and registers ready for opening. After that I will write a list of activities that need to be completed for the day. This list will be delegated out to our customer service associates and other management that I have there. Once the store is open I fix any issues that arise. I take care of customers. If I need to make a new schedule I will do that early in the morning.I do ordering for the store. My manager is hardly ever at the store because of the title he/she holds which is Community Leader. So that leaves me running day to day operations. I take care of invoices that we receive from vendors and I handle our ledgers to make sure everyone was paid. Hardest part of my job is hiring. Its hard to find a good customer service associate for the salary we pay them. The most enjoyable part of my job is working in the pharmacy. I love the fast pace and the challenges of billing insurance and getting prescriptions to patients in a timely manner.
good,This is a great place to work great work force very family like
good,"Overall it's a good company to work for i would definitely recommend it. I've learned how to manage employees, my work ethic has become a lot stronger over the last 3 years because of this company. The hardest part about the job was being in a position where no matter what happened and who did or didn't show up to work my job had to be done with no excuses."
good,"Typical day was working hard and dealing with angry customers the proper and respectful way. I learned that I have patience with a lot of things. The management and I got along and was nice, but when it was time to work it was time to work hard. The co-workers were full of joy and some were dramatic but you learned to deal with it and work in that type of environment. The hardest part of the job was dealing with loud customers but I got used to it and did my job. The most enjoyable part of the job was bringing in money."
good,A typical day at Walgreens is very busy. Especially in the pharmacy. The company must not be doing too well because of cut backs in hours. Management is nice but can't seem to find time to allow me to complete computer training even though I have been there for 2 months. Co-workers are awesome and the job isn't very difficult.
good,Is a big company that you learn new things. I enyoy help people. That make a difference.
good,Good potential for movement in the company but still suffers a high turnover rate for most departments except the highest levels of Management.
good,Great place to start. Managers move frequently so one must be able to adapt quickly to various management styles.  Manager are fillers and extremely hands on more so than supervisors.  Hard to create a balance between personal life and work.
good,"Trying to complete work on time when too many tasks are in hand, customer service was sort of lost"
good,Great management team and very interesting and rewarding work
good,"handeling customers all day long and stocking shelves"
good,Typical day at work always have something to do. Learning new things on a regular basis to be more of an asset to the company. Management is very supportive in helping you to reach your goals in the company. Co-workers help each other out when needed.
good,"Often feel it is babysitting, customers and employees. Retail sucks no two bones about it. Company has lofty goals and preach ideals that are admirable, but hard to have engaged employees in a retail environment. Work/Life balance is poor, there is always more to do and always some reason you are not doing enough."
good,"The work days there were busy, we always had something to do which I loved.  The only thing was getting the rest of the staff on the same page!  Other than the Pharmacists, some of the techs were distracted by everything else but work sometimes and retail pharmacy is a steady business so all details are just as important as hospital.  Management was with us all the time because we the pharmacies were pretty small.  I enjoyed seeing my customers happy because they received their meds, but I hated when insurance would not cover something for them I know they needed but could afford."
good,"A typical work day at Walgreen's provide great customer service to each customer, Organize our products and keep everything neat. The hardest part of the job may have been dealing with angry customers in person. The most enjoyable part of working there was meeting different customers and helping them meet their needs."
good,"a typical work day involves answering the phone to take Rx refills, answer customer questions. Filling of rx medication to e reviewed by the pharmacist. Customer service."
good,"My typical night at work, because I work overnight, is that I work on the cash register, make sure everything in the front of the store is cleaned and organized.  I didn't really learn anything that I already  knew because of my past experience at my other retail job. My most enjoyable part of the job is that since it's overnight I can be able to get all my task done because there aren't that many customers that come at night."
good,"Some walgreen's stuff are too expensive, they store brand are good, i love their delish brand"
good,Walgreens is a growing company. It is very easy to grow within the company.
good,"Walgreens was a very fun environment, I made friendships there that hopefully last a lifetime. I worked the overnight shift and I must say, that was the hardest part of this job, but at the same time the most enjoyable. I was able to learn the store very fast and gain a lot of new skills. "
good,"Walgreen's is a great place to get your foot in the door to work in the line of pharmaceuticals. The pay is decent, and the employees in general are all relatively great. The only problem i have with the place is the management. Not the store level management, but the higher up regional type of management. Problems always arise and there is usually enough time to handle the problems. But they never get fixed, and then come all the way down the ladder to the pharmacy techs and we get hit with all the consequences. Treatment of employees range from good to bad. Biggest issue is why i am leaving. New employee was rude and obnoxious in general. Goes head to head with our Sr. Tech who has been with walgreens for 8 years, and the management backs the new girl agreeing that the tech was at fault. Never did they ask other employees what was wrong, or what happened, but just took the word of the new girl. Our Sr. Tech quit, as well as the new girl. Just a mess. Learn to treat there upper employees with any sort of dignity."
good,Great company but they are making changes that are affecting many people
good,"A typical day in the pharmacy at Walgreens consists of basic receiving of prescriptions, inputting those prescriptions into the computer, entering data, filling the prescription, and then selling it to the patient. "
good,"Walgreens is a good place to work. If you are motivated you can advance. The staff is very friendly and trained to provide customers with the best experience possible. A typical day for myself would start wit paperwork, checking the payroll information and dealing with an vendor orders. After I would check the stockroom condition and walk the store with a telxon and check the sales and productivity of all side panels and displays.  After making changes to displays that were underperforming I would start my daily tasks. Every day I would train a specific person on new policies and procedures, sales goals and talk with them about any ideas they may have, this was one of my favorite parts of the day. I think that the hardest part of my job was being able to go home. I hate to leave things unresolved or unfinished, and sometimes you have no choice but to walk away or let fresh eyes or a fresh perspective into the mix. A typical day at Walgreens would have me bouncing between helping the customers, the pharmacy, completing projects and mentoring. I enjoyed working with everyone there, including the store manager and the other assistant, as well as the pharmacy support staff."
good,it was an okay job that offered heath benefits for both part time and full time employees
good,"I really enjoyed working with most of the employees.  And most of the customers.  "
good,I worked a few years and enjoyed it. Every store is different how the work experience is going to be.
good,Excellent place to work. Great place to gain experience in the field of pharmacy.
good,"A typical day at work here can vary between exciting and ready to go home. The things that makes this job difficult is when you run into insurance issues. The customers like to think we ""are"" the insurance when we only bill the insurance and charge the co-pays. I do like that everyone there are actually friends and not just co-workers."
good,"customer service, cash handling, Execute management, train new hires"
good,"Smiles, greating customers, my co workers and managers where fun to work with. The hardest thing about work is unloading trucks and taking care of the customer at the same time but we still got the job done. I enjoyed taking people pictures"
good,"A typical day at work, is entering prescriptions, answering phone calls, calling doctors and insurance companies. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers. The most enjoyable part is helping people, and knowing they appreciated it."
good,Working for Walgreens helped me develop my skill in the management field and operations.
good,Walgreens is a great place to work. The relationships I have built with my co-workers and patients will last a lifetime.
good,"Working there was pretty slow and boring at times. Not all co-workers spoke to one another so it was lonely for me even trying to converse with other co-workers, but I always made sure I got my part of the job done."
good,"This was a temporary job, and it worked out for what it was. I could sometimes get lonely when no one was in the store, and other times it was stressful (like during Halloween and back-to-store)."
good,very hectic throughout the day. learned how to deal with different type of costumers. They didn't have a very strong management team.
good,"Good hours to work, not alot of stress. Very laid back job. Management is kinda strict, but pleasant to be around. A typical day at work would be greeting customers, stocking shelfs, assisting customers, and doing cashier. My most emjoyable part of the job is seeing the customers smile."
good,no one care for about whats going with you. if you have a problem. they dont really care. still wants to to preform work in a stressful placce
good,"Everyone gives a helping hand and team work helps us get through the day. Co-workers are like family and one will step in a situation when the one needs assistance. Hardest part of the job is that it can get pretty overwhelming and stressful. Although its difficult at times, fixing problems and helping costumers with a situation is worthy."
good,Lack of communication between mtg. Double work due to unmotivated workers. Salary cap low.
good,A typical day is just like any other day when dealing with customers.Some days great and some not so much.I got into retail pharmacy on a whim.The training has been great.The managment can a little overbearing at times.My coworkers have been awsome.The hardest part is dealing with tough customers but thats anywhere you may work.The most enjoyable part is when a customer is grateful for the job well done.
good,"I really enjoyed my time at walgreens and the coworkers are still my friends. The hardest part had to be the irate customers, but that is in any work place. I enjoyed the time spent with the team I worked with."
good,"I have to process photo orders, management and co-workers are helpful and polite. I enjoy the working atmosphere."
good,"Everyday started with a list of things that needed to be done. The list included everything from building displays to stocking shelves to organizing an event. I learned how to organize my time and delegate my work so more could get done. Management varies depending on area the store is located. A high volume store, management is in it's toes demanding work gets done. A lower volume store management is more concerned about other factors such as customer service. Just like managers, employees vary from store to store. Hardest part of the job was managing non-store factors. One example would be, one store where I worked had a major influx of homeless people panhandling outside the store. Everyday I would find myself either calling the police to remove them or removing them myself. Customers would complain and demand that something be done to stop the problem even though nothing could really be done. The most enjoyable part was being able to use my creativity to create and organize sales events. At one store the Burger King next door was having their Spongebob Saturdays. An employee was dressed up as Spongebob and parents were encouraged to bring their cameras to have their photos taken with Spongebob. The same weekend the store's photo department was having a magazine cover sales competition and a monthly photo package competition. To add on to our sales I arranged with the Burger King manager to display samples of our magazine covers and photo packages in the Burger King while we handed out flyers promoting Burger King's Spongebob Saturday."
good,"Everyday there are tasks that need to be performed, get those done and find something else to do. Sometimes you develop great relationships, sometimes they are horrible and make you hate your job. Don't expect to advance anytime soon, they keep changing junk around."
good,"I liked the people I worked with, but the customer service began to get bad because the area i worked in was filled with angry consumers. The company is going through a lot of changes and I was there for 5 years and didnt see an opportunity of advancment."
good,"As an employee I learn the most about the struggles of everyday retail as it is seen from a lower level employee up to a supervisor. Its workplace environment depends on the coworkers. My time here as an employee has taught me skills in project management, marketing, sales, leadership, and most importantly customer service. A typical day for an assistant manager at Walgreens varies. Here, an assistant manager has to know how to operate and locate every product or service in the store. In a weeks time I may have to work in the photo department for a day, pharmacy filling, typing, filing, and checking out customers, and also maintain 6 departments. In all working for Walgreens has been a learning experience but because of company set backs their isn't room for advancement for management. The most enjoyable part of my day is when my regular customers come in to tell me randomly about their day."
good,this is a great company to work for the pay is nice just depends on the area the benifits are great in the work place can be a little stressful but enjoyable i really miss working here. they work wonderful with students in you can alays go to another location to get more hours
good,Walgreens made sure I was on my toes with my knowledge of different drugs and made sure i kept up with my certification.
good,meet some good customer and some with there own kind of way of being them self.
good,"I love my job at Walgreens, but sometimes its hard to communicate to my superiors. My schedule sometimes has between my child and being there on time. "
good,Hard to feel accomplished and appreciated with budget cuts. Tasks and expectations are hard to reach without the needed support. Challenging to keep up team morale.
good,Need to provide better training for new staff and properly staff each shift. Need to devote time to ensure employees are happy and healthy instead of just worrying about customers. Happy employees provide exceptional service
good,"I love the manager of my store, and the one I had before that. I also think that the shift leads and the pharmacists are very nice people. The job itself is pretty stressful, but I've been able to stick with it for longer than one might expect because I have great co-workers. The manager is really good at honoring time-off requests for all of the employees, unlike previous managers I've had who would deny them or try to strongarm you into putting your retail job above your life."
good,"I enjoy working a Walgreens."
good,"Walgreens is a good place to work. The pay is well, I survived off of it more than any other job. Management could be way better, workload was a lot somedays and we had to hurry to have it finished by a certain time and have the basement cleaned by a certain time also."
good,"They give you hours, but they cut them so they can have more for the rest of the crew you are working with. If they cant balance out the hours then they cut them."
good,"Good company to work with great with benefits, paid time off, and room for growth or advancement. Some pros are not having enough hours at the company resulting in sending you to other locations to work. But overall great company to work for I loved it so will you."
good,"cashier clerk for first three weeks, lack of team support. learned working a general store, placed on photo/tech area w/o training. lack of management role. lack of communication amongst team."
good,"Hard and hectic work but helped having truly great technicians, they are the backbone of the organization."
good,This is my second time working at Walgreens it’s pretty easy to get promoted if your a good worker I got promoted to a shift lead after 6 months I love it here the employees are nice I’m not afraid to ask for help the only problem I have is the customers make the job stressful at times.
good,"The pay is ok, but the amount of task that technicians have to take care of is insane, I wouldn't recommend working there if you're a full-time student."
good,"Walgreens has change there corporation so much that they are forgetting about their indians . They cutting hours don't have enough worker to operate the store, that makes customers service hard to do."
good,"Walgreens had ALOT of benefits! I was able to become a pharmacy technician there, when I came in as a regular customer service representative. There were some days where I questioned if I wanted to be there, but I met ALOT of great people!"
good,"A typical day as the front end cashier is to greet each customer and run the register. One negative thing about being a cashier is management lack of understanding. For example, a manager might have me run the register as well as stock the shelves and expect it to be done by the end of my shift. A lot of times it's hard to do both.  Our store is a busy store so it becomes overwhelming. To be completely honest, some of the tasks managements have the front end doing should be done by them. "
good,Very corporate business. Lots of changes. We didn't have great communication within the store. Not very consistent which is hard to do deal.  A lot of customer interaction. I did a lot of the business side as well.
good,Walgreens has a mix of good and bad like any where. I lost my dad and bestfriend/coworker during the 7 years working there and the management were supportive  giving me options .. I also was in a domestic violent situation and a  manager pulled me in back and even Through all the excuses he told me there is hope and told me that we can set up help (as in me and I I think) and that was kind. Ut at the end I switched her stored and and that store was all goddip
good,"Overall, it's not that bad of a job to have. The coworkers are great and the managers are nice and amazing. The downfall is the amount of hours worked because of how understaffed we are and also customers can either be very rude or you experience people with severe mental illness that may worry you about your safety. However, it's a very good company to work for and they make sure that you are trained properly to handle your duties."
good,"There was definatly options to move forward "
good,"Would have been nice to have BOLO for the men who did an aggravated robbery to 6 other Walgreens and then our own store, gave me PTSD... while they post BOLOs of coupon scammers.  they should pay for my PTSD therapy and me having to possibly have the subpoena to testify in court because of this.  HR dept is trash"
good,I loved working at Walgreen’s you couldn’t get bored customers brighten up your day with fun and laughter the only thing is they don’t pay enough money they have programs that you can take to work in the pharmacy or management
good,"A typical day at Walgreen's was usually pretty calm until 6:00 PM When we would typically have a increase in customers and be occupied until about 8:00 PM. During the slow hours we spent time making sure smaller jobs were done around the store such as stocking and tags and during the busy hours we strictly helped costumers and kept the store operating. I learned to multitask a lot more efficiently after working at Walgreen's and deal with costumer needs due to the constant activity in the store. The management was knowledgeable and friendly, I wasn't afraid to ask them any questions regarding work related tasks and they made sure the store was operating efficiently. The workplace was usually very busy in the location I worked because it was near a populated lake and we had a constant flow of customers especially on days with nice weather. The hardest part of the job is that sometimes things would go wrong in the store such as the cooler would stop working or renovations messed up the usual flow of the store and we would have to adapt to the changes and improvise to keep customers happy. The most enjoyable part of the job was the coworkers were always friendly and inviting and things that needed to be done got done."
good,It really depends on the are that you are in. In my store it was very fast-paced so you're constantly moving. If your store is short staffed then you are probably going to have a hard time.
good,I was very appreciative to have had the experience working with Walgreens as this was where my career began. I enjoyed working with my coworkers but the company as a whole seemed more business oriented than customer oriented.
good,"1. Very highly organized and professional structure"
good,Managers and other team leads are a good resource and are willing to help an employee be sufficient at there jobs and tasks. They are willing to work with hours needed revolving around family and medical needs.
good,"This is a fine job for a high schooler. Sometimes they forget your 10 minute break, but it was a very consistent job and they tried their best to work with your schedule."
good,"Very fast pace when picking products for stores. Learned how to pick products, management was fair, hardest part of job always walking on concrete and heavy lifting."
good,"Retail pharmacy is not the ideal work environment, but Walgreens presented technicians with opportunity for advancement and certification. Retail pharmacy is too inherently corporate-driven, however."
good,Walgreens is great for young adults working towards a better career opportunity. the pay wasn't that great when I was there. The hours are based on how long you been there which is unfair sometimes
good,I enjoyed working with the public. Work environment was very friendly. worked well as a team.  Work environment was fast paced and gratifying to help others.
good,Company has many inside favortism and Managers are really hard workers but some just dont help enough workers are never written up for slacking on the job and being a shift lead does not give you rights to supervise or write anyone up because you need a managers approval pay is no good the culture is not followed even by assistant managers good starting company but no growth only its who you know and how much you suck up to your boss to get a position . Would recommend
good,"This is an overall great place to work for a short time while, going to school or finding better opportunities. Would not consider staying otherwise. Great benefits."
good,This company really does pride themselves in taking care of there staff as well as there customers. They always have training courses available for there staff to take. Everyone is willing to be a part of one big giant team to help make the store run as smoothly as possible
good,"A typical work day at Walgreens mainly consist of unloading totes, stocking the aisles, working the register or helping a customer out. While working there I learned how to work with different kind of people and how to handle various situations. The management at Walgreens was good, any time there was a problem the manager on duty would be sure to help fix things. I wouldn't consider having a hard part of  working there because things we're ran smooth. The most enjoyable part of working there was when everyone would be in a great mood and all get along."
good,A typical day at work is to make the customers happy and make sure they are taken care of. Can be family oriented at times. Management are there to make sure you do your job properly and praise you when you do good. I've learned to put customers first and make sure they are happy because I would like for someone to go out of my way to make sure I'm happy and make me come back to the place of business.
good,"This was my first job and it honestly wasn't bad as a first job, but definitely not something I'd want long term. The management system is pretty relaxed and the job is easy to learn and perform, but they don't pay much more than they have to and even being with the company for 3 years and working in a position with higher pay than entry level, I am still not payed a livable wage for the area I am in. Store level management is always helpful and kind, but corporate doesn't care about you or your customers."
good,The days can vary depending on the tasks to complete. Overall very pleasant staff to work with but again this can vary from store to store. The hardest part of the job can be the pace - have to be able to multitask. The most pleasant part is the customers - we deal with many different types of people
good,"Walgreens has taught me proper customer engagement as well as how to accurately trouble shoot problems that arise.  My schedule fluctuates and therefor when I start my day, I need to be prepared for any situation that I enter.  A hard day would be that the pharmacy is short staffed that day or because of sheer volume of customers that come in and the pharmacy ends up being behind.  Management is consistently willing to interact with coworkers and show concern, as well as help and be a ""pinch hitter"" when we need them.  It can often be difficult at times, especially when dealing with insurance companies for a customer.  But the best part is when you help the customer to the fullest, they recognize it and you can see the gratitude through the best smiles."
good,Walgreens is sales based. When I started long ago the company actually cared about its employees.  Since a shift in ownership a few years ago the company moved away from caring about employees to only caring about profit. There are more and more hourly budget cuts and employees are forced to try and handle huge workloads without help. We went from having 5-6 employees a shift to only having 3 per shift. The district and regional managers still expect the same workload with only have the team to complete it. It's sometimes extremely stressful. And the company actually punishes employees for doing what's right. It is no longer important to investigate customer complaints. And instead of getting the side of the employee the company automatically sides with the customer complaints no matter how ridiculous or false it may be. There are very minimal raises once a year based on annual reviews and the company now hires outside candidates because they can pay them substantially less than those hired from within.
good,"I really liked working for this company, when the bug got out of changing pay I got nervous and decided to get other jobs, this was by far a great company to work for when it was just Walgreens and not the buy out company"
good,"My experience within the store and management up to the Store Manager himself was overall positive. Team leadership showed concern for the employees and regularly offered to talk about what would improve the situation or what would make our jobs easier (within reason)."
good,"I wont speak for Walgreens as a whole, but at the store I work at, we are frequently understaffed, especially in the pharmacy. We're often expected to run around like headless chickens to get stuff done. The staff is great though. I like everybody I work with. They all care about each other."
good,"I used to enjoy my job greatly. Recently, every six months about, the ASMs are moved to different stores in the district, creating stress on learning a new store and team. That stress is also on top of recent dramatically cut budget hours making it hard to run an efficient business and properly train a team of employees. "
good,"This place is very challenging because you meet different kinds of costumers. You don’t know how  they’re going to be towards you especially if they didn’t meet their expectations of the product. Sometimes you meet nice costumers and sometimes nice but, you still have to be professional to them no matter how they treat you."
good,"Walgreens is a great place to start a career or restart a career if you are coming back in the work force. You can have the opportunity to learn many aspects of the business from customer service, dealing with vendors, sales, management, and working in the pharmacy if you have the education. The hardest part of the job though is handling difficult customers, which there are many."
good,Walgreens is one of those places that’s been around for years. I worked there and got bored pretty quickly. It was almost Silent some days. I feel like it’s as equivalent as having four kids and you didn’t have enough hands.
good,"As a pharmacy manager, there is a lot of red tape that must always be followed, metrics that must be met and corporate continues to cut hours with every passing day. If you are looking for a very stressful work environment and little compensation for excelling, then Walgreens is the place for you!"
good,"Over the course of thirty+ years, continual training and development in an ever changing retail environment. Focus on customer's well-beings and satisfaction. A desire to educate and explain the benefits of doctor recommended drug therapy and the need to make sure patients and customers understand the reasons for the need to stick to the regimens set forth by the medical professional who prescribed them. Unable to request time off during the busiest retail periods. A company that has been around since 1901, job security due to an ever changing retail concept, following market trends and customer direction."
good,Walgreens is a friendly company that cares about the advancement of its employees. The company is always looking for ways to reach the community and better itself as a whole.
good,"You get to work by yourself which is nice, but you must be able to work fast. The co-workers are super helpful. Management is nice. Lunch breaks are long."
good,"I feel like the starting pay should be higher for a pharmacy tech ($12.50). I get to pick out my schedule, management is laid back. Good environment, I get a lot of hours."
good,"Various start times, workplace culture was an experience, glad to have learned the skills offered to me.  The hardest part of the job was the constant steps taken to advance, being offered but never materializing advancement.  Working seven days straight often without being offered a permanent Full-Time benefit position."
good,The company can be very cold and not considerate of its employees. The company comes first in everything regardless of employee concerns. Many changes that make the job more difficult.
good,"More stability would be great meaning the lack of hours per week that is given. Other than that the people I work with are awesome, they are such hard workers. I really appreciate them."
good,Move up quick. Fun people to work with. Great benefits Staffing is difficult at times lack of management no follow-through some people have a hard time grasping the concept of having to work weekends and holidays
good,Nice place to work for part time position.This company has a limited budget and often the working hours are cut off. There are no options for growing up.
good,It is hard to balance all the tasks that are expected of you and dealing with all the patients that we see throughout the day.  I have learned to have patients with people who need help.
good,They need more help up front. There were many nights that I was left by myself doing it all. Overall just not enough help in the majority of their stores.
good,"I personally did not have the best experience working at this establishment, but it did show me that hard work pays off. it allowed me to move up in the company at a younger  age than most individuals. your hard work does not go unnoticed"
good,"Very busy most of the time.  I learned how to be a Pharmacy Technician mostly at Walgreen's.  Started out with great management. But, ended up not very good with judging people. "
good,good computer system. nice people to work with. the jobs are not hard but the customers maybe some times hard to please. the manager is friendly and care about the employees.
good,"The people were great, the job is very fast paced. Can be stressful, I do not think the money is great for the work done. But good company, employee oriented."
good,when i first began working there it was good i had such a good time me management and customers. After i was there a couple months everything started to just get boring and repetitive and the company as a whole started to cut hours from employees so i decided to leave.
good,it was fun job but they never gave me a raise and they kept promoting everyone else but me and i kept asking why im not getting any of that and they said it was bc evryonelse has been working there longer than me.
good,I didn't really like the job my manager was not willing to work with my schedule there were some unfair treatment and on-the-job gossiping between manager and employees it was just very unprofessional but I needed the job at this time
good,"How ever I do not like when the managers let the position go to their head, we all should be treated equal and not like we are in competition with one another."
good,"Walgreens was a steady working environment. There was always something to do and different to learn. Like inventory managing and about beauty products. Managers and co-workers were friendly and always willing to lend a helping hand if you needed it, The hardest part of the job was probably dealing with loss prevention. The most enjoyable part of working at Walgreens was having a positive impact on customers."
good,"There is alot of turnover in the district I work in. Often times young employees without work ethic or respect. Paid poorly for the job performed but as long as you need a job, there is job security. I have been here three years now, and I get a lot of PTO but make less than 15/hr as a manager."
good,"When I began with Walgreens, it wasn't intended to be in pharmacy. I stepped up the ladder to that position. My manager introduced me to the pharmacy location and I loved what I'd seen. I took all of the training and began working as a technician, learning processes of prescription handling, start to finish. After eighteen months, I was finally given the opportunity to become nationally certified and I did with flying colors. I then had the ability to not just provide medications for processing, but to actually handle the drugs on my own. As time had progressed, I was taking prescriptions, processing insurance claims, filling the drugs, and finally selling them. (I'm greatly abbreviating the duties)."
good,Store was great. Learned a lot and enjoyed building a team around me to work with. Upper level management is deceitful and will manipulate things to ensure they survive and you don't if need be.
good,This job is great for high school students. They have flexible hours and pays minimum wage and is a great first job. Management wasn't the best but not the worst.
good,"Although I enjoyed the staff, this was a very stressful place to work. They expect their employees to fill too many roles and the pay isn't reflective of the work load. Due to a lack of security, it wasn't a comfortable place to work. We were constantly expected to handle situations that should have been tasked to a professional guard"
good,"Walgeens is a great company to work for. I love the fact that the managers care about your school schedule, and religious observations. The typical day of work is stocking,cash handling, and greeting every customer. I have three managers, all of them were easy to get along with, they want you to succeed The hardest part about the job was the lack of training. I honestly had NO idea what I was doing the first day. Besides the training manual online, it is hardly any hands on training. I did not know how to clock in or clock out, how to set up direct deposit or anything. While the manager did not mind helping you with questions, sometimes it as a hassle to ask cause you are, 'expected' to know. However the most enjoyable part was the atmosphere, love the music that is played doing store hours and some customers are very friendly."
good,Walgreens was a great atmosphere for myself and the employees and management team were great to work with. This is a great company to work for especially if you have never worked before.
good,"This job is super easy and fun. Everyone got along good,  but the hours were not working for me. I needed full time and only ever got 20 to 25 hours a week."
good,Retail pharmacy is very stressful and fast pace. The store manager I worked with was great and respected my position as the pharmacist so I never had an issue with her. Technicians were respectful and we worked as a team.
good,"Having worked many years with another leading pharmacy, it was beyond stressful to have 160 hours/week to run a store. With Walgreens, they have payroll hours and folks that come to work!"
good,"Management is tough, hours are wishy washy, benefits are hard to come by, workers can be lazy. A lot of competition for donations and suggestive sales. Very tough on standards and procedures."
good,Walgreens management is not as great as they are led up to be. They feel that they are better and smarter than their employees and do n o t have to work. The benefits are excellant and pay invoices promtly.  The rate of pay is very fair with raises every year until you max out.
good,"The people that work for Walgreen's are committed to their jobs, they care about the patients and the work they do. Walgreen's works within the community to educate people about healthcare options including immunizations and well check clinics. Management is different at each store some have cared some do not. The best part at the end of each day is that hug you get from a patient when you help them understand their medication or are able to help the obtain what they need in medication to get better."
good,A typical day was crazy busy from the moment I walked in the door to the time I would leave. I was fortunate to have great co workers that were dedicated to their job .
good,Management is decent. Must be proactive and a good communicator because most team members are located in the HQ in IL. Appreciate the work and life balance.
good,Good Company but not enough pay. Need better management. Great benefits in the company. The hardest part about working for Walgreens is that we have to take the slack for working harder because short of employees because of no hours to give.
good,I worked for various pharmacies throughout the metro area. I worked for the company for 17 years. The benefits were really good as well as stocks but the hours and schedule were not. The pharmacies I worked didn't give an lunches. Job security is good.
good,"Very busy long lines.Learned how to read upc's, do resets of the walls, learned a lot about makeup as well. Management was somewhat rude didn't take job seriously. hardest part was stocking shelf's. Most enjoyable was being around my team members."
good,"My review is based on a lot of areas. I started out as an intern, progressed to a part-time and then full time position, then part time again, and finally went on to become a pharmacy technician."
good,I loved working for this company the down fall was the shift I have kids. if it was 9-5 I proably would retire for the company great people and place to work
good,"Pharmacy technicians work with pharmacists to help prepare and give out prescription medication. ... They take prescriptions over the phone and in person, work with health professionals and customers, help mix medicines, count pills, measure medication, label and give instructions for medicine, and help take payments."
good,Despite the area the place is in. Its a great place to work with room for advancement and benefits. They teach you a lot and try to make you a better person and use positive
good,I'm  frustrated.  I'm full time but I now have part time hours because we keep losing hours. I can't survive this way. I don't  make enough to pay the bills and if I try to get a part time job to supplement I'm  cut even more hours because my availability  won't be open.I'm just getting deeper in debt with no hope in sight.
good,This was my first job after high school and it supported me all the way through college. It allowed me to live comfortably while I am in school and it was not the best job but i remained loyal and moved up to stock room manager.
good,"great pay for managers but not enough for associates, they ask for a lot even off the clock to do them favors, If you ask for vacation and the the store manager is on vacation at the same time, you're going to have to cancel your plans."
good,Good learning environment. Co-workers are good at teaching and pleasant to work with. They have great learning tools to follow and many programs they offer.
good,"Working for  Walgreens every day was different. Greeting and meeting different people with different reasons for entering the store but all would leave out happy and felt welcomed. Apart of the culture at Walgreens was to greet each and every customer, walking them to the product that was requested but also trying to upsell an item that may be of use. The most enjoyable part of the day is knowing that in some way you've made a difference in someone's day, by either teaching the employees something or just helping and having a conversation with a customer. The management team that I was apart of worked with the employees , side by side but also allowing them to learn from their mistakes. Once I put the time into training the employees, their knowledge was based off of what they could teach the next person, which made them feel good about their work. I empowered them to make decisions for themselves to help customers, teaching them to be independent but if needed they could always come to management for assistance."
good,"Working there 2 years, can be a fun, place to be. Always busy and moving, decent stepping stone employment and good career. Management can be easy to get along with, also teammates."
good,Every store has there own policy going on.  The store I previously worked at was awesome.  Management was there for you.  Majority of the time understood you.
good,jobs great for a first job and students if you are trying to turn it into a career then come in as management typical duties are come in keep work station clean and customers smiling the pay is basic minimum wage and they amount of hours they offer are terrible
good,A typical day at work is having good customer service. What I've learned is always make the customer happy. The workplace culture was alright. The hardest part of the job was standing for long periods of time. The most enjoyable part of the job was putting smile on a customers face.
good,"Management needed improvement - a lot of people came and went. Working at Walgreen's was alright but after working there for two years, I only got a 25¢ raise and I did a lot of work for them that wasn't in my job title as a Cashier."
good,"I worked at a good 5 stores during my time working for this company, and all i can say is it depends on the store manager on which way the flow is going to go."
good,As a minimum wage job with steady hours that's really easy work this is where you should go to. Management works around your school hours but you do end up working weekends most of the time.
good,Productive and friendly. I learned to be patient with customers. I also learned to be empathetic and more open-minded.
good,"The environment is comfortable and great to work in. The management is good, they help answer every question. The benefits are good. The customers are cheerful."
good,"Fun creative teams who also have a high regard for their work. The company focuses a lot on the strengths of the busines e.g. photo, pharma and in-store experiences."
good,this job is a great place to work management is understanding and they offer many oppurtunities to advance and excel at every turn of the journey
good,Very friendly environment. It is also very rewarding. You have to be quick on your feet and upbeat and friendly. We work together to help each other. Standing for long hours is part of the job so anyone who can stand long may need to do something else.
good,internship program was a great way to enter into management. good pay. a company worth looking into. reputable and reliable company
good,"I have worked for Walgreens 11 years in management and really love my job.  I have a family with kids and would love spending more time with them.  Working nights, weekends, and holidays prevent me to do just that. I don't mind working nights and weekends occasionally to meet deadlines or goals, but would prefer not to. "
good,"It was very unorganized and it wasn't a safe environment. There would sometimes be security there but not all the time, and the people would only behave when corporate people came to visit. The break room was very disgusting and unhealthy. But the hours were flexible even though I traveled from Southwest, Philadelphia to Germantown Avenue. As far as management, they were nice people and were there when you needed them but sometimes you couldn't get in contact with them and would have to waiting outside until they opened up the door for my morning shifts."
good,"Walgreens has been a great opportunity for me to learn a lot about the pharmacy field. It has taught me how to type prescriptions at a very fast pace, get patients in and out of the pharmacy at a good pace. I've learned how to restock and order inventory for the pharmacy to keep it running, how to work as a team in regards of helping patients out. It's overall a great experience to start out at, as well as good pay. I would recommend any incoming technicians to choose Walgreens."
good,"When I left the Marine Corps, it was a struggle to find a job for a while. When I was hired at Walgreens, it was a relief to finally start working again. It wasn't my ideal position to be honest, but it was a good job with great benefits, and I was happy to be working."
good,"A great place to move up in. Retail, pharmacy, beauty, photo opportunities. Flexible to part time employees who are in school, have kids, or have a second job."
good,a day at walgreens is working with the customer to help them find the wright item that best fit there needs and handling the cash register by counting the money at the end of the night once the store is slow we used that time to restock good and put up sales.
good,Walgreens was a very nice place to work but the pay wasn't what I expected at first. They did help (and paid) to get me certified though but the health benefits weren't great
good,Fun work place with great management also good benefits. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with some of my colleagues but the company don't pay enough money.
good,"I enjoy working at Walgreens because they provide great opportunities for those willing to move up in the company. I've learned how to mold other employees into becoming better workers and potential leaders. My coworkers I enjoy working with, they work hard, loves their customers and are open to helping  me when needed and vice versa. The hardest part about working with Walgreens is the lack of training I receive, having to learn day by day things that I should have already known. I enjoy working with the team of Walgreens because we know how to work hard and get the job done all while having fun with each other and the customers."
good,I would restock shelves and help customers out with what they need and make sure the store was clean Walgreens is a great working experience
good,"i would show up to work and warm up the machines. then i would run my report of any photos that needed to be printed. if there wasnt a lot, i would start to clean and prepare the station for the day ahead. start stocking or organizing if need be. i learned that retail is tough and you really have to enjoy peoples company. my co workers were very nice and professional, would joke around from time to time. the hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers, and lazy ones. the enjoyable part was the people that i could talk to on a daily basis."
good,"I've gained valuable knowledge and skills as a Senior pharmacy tech for Walgreens for the past 7 years. A good amount on knowldge in regards to medication management for patients, insurance billing matters, including prior authorizations, HIPPA and privacy laws, inventory management and policies and proceedures for the pharmacy. Medication uses, how vital teamwork and communication are in the pharmacy environment. What i enjoy most about my job is making the patients happy. It still surprises me how excited they are that i know them by name, that small detail has even won over some difficult patients, it softens them and makes for great patient relationships. One of the hardest parts of the job is having situations with some patients, where there isn't much if anything that i can do to help the, (feeling helpless). IE: older patients who have diffculty rememberimg and understaing the issues that can sometimes arise."
good,Fun place to work with extremely supportive management and staff. Never a dull moment with the many different events Walgreens sponsors.
good,Very easy job low payand nice work enviorment.Oppurtunity to move up if you want to.Sometimes work on holidays but you rotate.Pretty good company overall to work for.
good,"not enough staff"
good,"The company is pretty well organized. Some of the smaller stores seems a little more hectic. I had some scheduling conflicts and there were times where the scheduling was completely off. Does work okay with school schedules, but flexibility is key here."
good,"I was given tasks to complete during my shift and I made sure to complete them. Learned every job, from pharmacy to register to photo to cosmetics. My co-workers were friendly. The hardest part of the job was the schedules that were not set, but were at different times. I loved learning what I learned."
good,"Pay isnt the best, but much better company and well organised than CVS. I loved working at walgreens. Management and rotation system is fantastic."
good,Good work environment and easy to deal with the managers. They are also willing to work with your school schedule. I only worked for them for a short period of time.
good,Walgreens has a great name but like any large corporation they can not keep track of everything. To many restructuring of management and not enough people higher up watching the people who were supposed to be in charge.
good,"Walgreens was an excellent part-time position for me.  I learned how to multi-task, and to counsel patients about their medication regimens to prevent medication errors.  My technicians were wonderful and assisted me whenever needed to accomplish the tasks of the day.  The hardest part was the answering of the telephones and the opportunity to have a lunch break.  The work experience was a good one."
good,"Typical day at work- generating reports on loss prevention, sales and ordering supplies. Constant interaction with the public. I learned how to operate new machines in producing photos, how to manage a department and keeping the customer happy. Management at the location I worked at was very friendly and turned over the department for me to run and train new employees on the OSHA guidelines of handling hazardous materials and proper disposal. The hardest part of this position was unloading trucks on delivery day but that soon became a snap with team efforts. The most enjoyable part of the job was to see the customers reaction to the finished product"
good,"A typical day consist of helping customers, completing any additional task. Stocking, cleaning your area and doing suggestive selling. You learn how to greet and treat customers, and use the register. Management is ok, co workers are ok. The hardest part of the job is completing your task on top of helping needy customers. The good part is they are flexible"
good,"Walgreens was my first job experience and my 2 days working there was alright. Nobody really had a smile on their face, and didn't make the store look lively."
good,"A typical day at work would be arriving at 9am and immediately doing inventory of empty and ad items. I then fill as much as the customer demands allow. I will continue to do misc. daily tasks. I will close the day with cleaning (straightening/mopping etc.) the whole store. I've learned how to delegate tasks that will enable me to get the most work done possible in the fastest possible time while staying organized. My co-workers are very helpful, friendly, and productive team members that love working as a team. Ive learned that treating your co-workers as equal as possible to yourself is the best way to show them that you care. The hardest part of my job is providing every customer with as even experience as the next customer; this is difficult because it's simply impossible to be in two places at once. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the smiles on the customers face for being so helpful, and from the employees for showing them respect which they in turn show to me."
good,"ive learned alot for working with this company, from customer service to be a very professional certified technician, they needed to communicate better when it came to certain things but overall i loved it"
good,"A typical day of work with Walgreens consisted of helping customers find products, stocking and re-stocking products, creating product displays, putting in orders for new products, using the cash register to ring up customers, and keeping the shelves tidy and neat. "
good,"A typical day at work, for the most part, includes constant work. This work is not just busy work, it includes tasks that are vital to the up-keeping of the store & the customers' happiness. I've learned how to work a Telxon and of course, how to better deal with customers. My store manager has let me know since the beginning that he was always here to teach me anything I wanted to know, and listen if I ever needed to talk. The hardest part of the job is finding a balance. If you're like me, that isn't too hard. But if you've never dealt with customers & having a big work load, this could be a challenge in the beginning. I mainly enjoy just staying busy throuhgout the day & laughing with and enjoying my coworkers."
good,I learned how to maintain different work responsibilities
good,"A typical day at work started at 9pm.  It was a 11 hour shift.  For the first hour, there were 2 technicians that I supervised and they helped considerably with the work load.  I worked alone most of the night providing pharmaceutical care to a town of 100,000 people.  The 3 emergency rooms provided a constant flow of patients through most of the night.  I learned to operate and maintain the Yuyama dispensing machine that Walgreens used nationwide.  The management was typical of a large corporation but was approachable whenever needed.  The co-workers were great.  With the very fast pace of the business, laziness was not afforded.  The hardest part of the job was the continual jet lag suffered by working the midnight shift.  The most enjoyable part of the job was having the time to attend to the needs and questions of the patients"
good,"good place to work, lots of room to move up and had fun at work everyday."
good,"a typical day at work I start at 8am I am a front clerk , I meet and greet every one who come. I answer most all calls and redirect them to either management, photo or pharmacy. I call for all receiving. cover breaks at the end of my shift I clean and clear my area put all go backs. Hardest part of my job is when we are out of something, the customer always. thinks we should always have everything .The most enjoyable part of my job is everyday seeing all the customer who know me and smile when they see me 5 years we all have gotten know one another"
good,"The management is good and the people in general are better.  The store is very clean and well kept.  The pay starts slightly above minimum wage.  But it is just a retail job.  You still have to help the occasional overly entitled jerk.  The work is very communal, so if someone drags their feet it can easily make you look a bit worse.  It is not bad for what it is."
good,"I feel as though there was not a good process for communication amongst employees, managers or corporate."
good,Always felt like I had job security.  Good profit sharing program.
good,"A typical day at work was just coming in and setting up your work station. When the store opened we were given a list of things that needed done throughout the store along with our daily job duties. Management was great. I loved all of my coworkers, some were very rude to me and customers. The hardest part of the job was making sure everything in the store was stocked and straightened for the next day. It's a simple job. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and seeing customers happy with their product."
good,"I enjoyed my time at walgreens, especially since i was a beauty adviser. I was a  student at the time so pay was decent started me out with $10.00 an hr and this was in 2008. Could i live off it now..no but for a seasonal job to make cash over my summer break it was great."
good,"A typical day at work would be coming in making sure all overnight associates are ok and walking the store to see how the night crew worked.  After inspecting everything, I would prepare daily notes for my day shift outlining what needs to be done in order of importance.  I would conduct a morning meeting with my associates to see how they are doing and give direction, ask question, and provide recognition.  Wouldn't say the job had a hard part, just meeting the expectations of my manager and ensuring what was expected of me.  The most enjoyable part is providing extraordinary customer service to every customer that enters the store."
good,"My position is assistant manager. My daily responzabilidades plan is to organize the work and times of rest. Receipt sellers customer service I got your areas with no employees. I realize marketing the company appointed for different seasons."
good,"Friendly coworkers, the mos enjoyable party of my job was talk with the costumer"
good,I loved working at Walgreens because of the people. I was a pharmacy major at the time and this job was a stepping stone.
good,Wallgreens is a good company. I like it but there are not enough hours in a week to work.
good,"I work in areas of customer service, sales, advertisements and reporting, workflow management, cash handling, staff training, supervision, and problem resolutions for my dept. It's pretty hectic and demanding."
good,"Fun workplace, i learned how to easily deal with the public even when they were angry. The most import part of dealing with the public is keeping calm and collective when there is a disgruntled customer. The management and coworkers were nice and easy to work with. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping people in the photo department when they did not understand how the machines worked"
good,"typical day starts off in taking over the safe, filling out the task sheets for my closing or opening crew depends on my shift, relaying the 5 min meeting so were all on the same page. getting customer service calls like refunds,exchanges, questions throught out my shift, receiving, merchandising, claims, pushing freight, helping customers, running photo when needed,running cosmetics when needed, helping and translating Spanish in pharmacy and through out the store, answer phones, transfer calls, count down registers, make deposits, these are some of my many duties. Ive learned patience is very important, Ive learned to be a leader, hardest part is running the store short handed without all my staff. The employees are the best part of my job and most of my customers, well at least my regulars. love to help and put smiles on everyones face every chance i get."
good,I started off as a service clerk and because management seen that I was interested in learning the other positions I am now trained to cover almost any position in the front of the store. Everyone is very welcoming and friendly and makes the work day go by. There are a lot of customers who prefer to take the extra five minute drive just to come shop at our store than the Walgreens down the street.
good,Restock all fresh and frozen fruit for juices. Make juices and smoothies upon customer request. I love what I do!
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work, especially for a student. Management is ok. A typical day would be just trying to keep yourself busy whether it cleaning from top to bottom or checking customers. There is nothing hard about working for Walgreens. I have great Co-Workers that really knows how to work together. I would Say the hardest part of my job would be the fear of maybe getting robbed at my register, and my most enjoyable moments at Walgreens will always be my awesome customers that keep my spirits up!"
good,Fun place to work no job security I been there for 13 years I transfer from west palm beach FL to Raleigh NC
good,"The work day starts by checking your department to makesure everything looks presentable to your customers, and all through the day you makesure their needs are being met. Throughout the years I have learned that a simple thing like showing a customer where cough medicine is, can make their day. The hardest part of my job, is when I have to watch someone who is trying to steal. The thing that I like the most is my relationship with my co-workers, we listen to each other and are always willing to help each other."
good,"Could be challenging at times and very stressful. Customers would get upset with Pharmacy staff due to their insurance not covering meds, etc. People could be very inpatient at times too! Very good job to have if going into medical field, I stopped working at Walgreens after 6 years to go into nursing school, really HELPED A LOT when came to pharmacology in nursing school. Management and co-workers overall got along pretty well and helped one another. Hardest part of the job was dealing with insurance!!! Most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers and get the appreciation deserved."
good,Walgreens provides a work environment where you can go as far as you want to go.
good,• Cashier and Pharmacy Duties
good,The scheduling was hectic. They changed hours at last minute.
good,i think walgreens is a good place for students to work. I think that If you are depending on a certain amount of money unless you are alreday a manager you will not get it all the time. The schedule rotates alot.
good,"I usually advertised make-up,i did inventory on items that were selling out ,of course, through out the months that i've been working here i have learned quit a bit.Employees were kind and respectful.This job had its difficult moments but overall it was simple and easy.What i loved about this job was discounts and meeting new people."
good,Great for students or others who need a part-time position that would work with their schedule.
good,Maintain the photo lab and sometime run the main cash register.
good,"I do love my job, i am able to do everything at the comapny. I have learned multiple tasks, customer service, sales, photo, hallmark, beauty. Managers are good, but there is to much drama at my work place with all the co workers, and schedualing is not fair. im looking for a 9- 5 monday thew friday type of job. The hardest part of my job is taking in truck and un loading it, and even that isnt to hard. The most enjoyable part of my job, is getting to know all the customes."
good,"The work is very steady lots of stocking, re advertising products weekly and customers daily interaction within store and co-workers have been fun to work with past and present co-workers."
good,"The staff was great, very friendly and caring. The management team was excellent."
good,There are fewer openings now then there were 6-7 years ago. As time has gone on hours for managers along with salaries have decreased.
good,I enjoyed working for this company. I was hired into a new store so I was able to focus on helping my customers. I also ran a blood pressure clinic and was about to start diabetic education training when I had to leave my position.
good,"Manage shifts, team members, tasks to be completed as well as administration of projects and execution of projects. Constant projects and customer service."
good,"I have been working at Walgreens since I was 16. 5 Years later, I find that Walgreens has been very flexible and accommodating with giving me hours both at home during breaks and while I am in school in a different city. Walgreens is very understanding of my school needs as well."
good,I enjoyed working for the walgreens company however the locations I worked at In Illinois had HORRIBLE store manger and district manager. I had many issues with bad treatment from both of them.
good,Working at Walgreens was an experience. Sometimes I was excited to be there but other days I was not happy. Some of the managment was somewhat too tense. I felt that they expected way too much from us to do in a short amount of time. Other than that I found the job very fun to do.
good,"Good place to work, good benefit, good staff, but needs more help"
good,I've worked at two locations since being with the company and I've enjoyed my time there so far. My coworkers and managers are better than ones I've had in the past and they really work with your schedule and appreciate the work you do. My managers always says thank you and that they appreciates us. which I've never had a manager do before so that's nice. It can be a bit overwhelming with new tasks and assignments everyday on top of taking care of the customers and answering calls. So you're almost always going to be interrupted from your work but the customers are first. Security isn't the best or nonexistent unless the pharmacy gets robbed at gun point but even then the security don't make you feel any safer. It has it's ups and downs like any job does but I really appreciate it.
good,I enjoy working at Walgreens. I have worked for wonderful managers. Walgreens itself could care more for their employee's and take better care of them. But other than that I love working for the company. My schudeule has been greatly accommodated for what I need in my personal life. Pto is wonderful.
good,"Great wok enviroment, fast paced but with the team members that I had we effectively helped ad solved our patient problems. Management staff was great very nice family oriented yet very professional great overall experience."
good,Working for Walgreen Co. is a great place to start your entrance into the work force. It is fast paced teaches how to be part of a team and to give exceptional customer service. All of which are traits that can help a person to progress in their career.
good,This was a great job I just wish it was easier to transfer between store locations. Management was very nice and helped in every way possible. The work was tough at times but still rewarding.
good,"A typical day is a balancing act between ECC i.e. excellent customer care, engaging employees and preforming individual tasks. My biggest take away was learning how to manage and engage employees in a way that provided incentives for them to work hard and adjusting management techniques on an individual basis. Management varied quite widely between stores, on a whole i would say it was largely positive but certainly not always consistent within company guidelines. The culture is very customer forward and hardworking. Any disputes between employees could prove difficult, the pharmacy counter  in particular provided some difficult customer service scenarios if there were any difficulties in filling a prescription. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely training employees and watching their personal growth."
good,The difficulty with conducting my job is the lack of security with theft and threats. Several occasions have occurred in which the presence of security could have been prevented or deescalated the situations.
good,It's chill good people bice products. Overall thumbs up in cleanliness. Very professional atmosphere as well as kick back items that lead to small bonuses and it's very rewsrding
good,"It was a good job to have as my first job. My first job was a good experience, I would recommend this job to anyone who needs one especially as a first job"
good,"Walgreens is a stepping stone to company! What I mean by that is, ya learned the skills of how to multitask as far as being on a job that requires you to be a cashier, face, customer service, count the money, work closely with the management team and get promoted if they feel you're the right person for the job! When you start, you won't make a whole lot of money and struggle to get by financially! But you will be multifaceted in all the areas of any job! Once you apply to other jobs, companies will say,""Oh you worked for Walgreens? We can use you! Welcome aboard and when can you start""? Once you leave Walgreens, you might be eligible for a Management position within  a year! You'll pay a lot of dues working for Walgreens! Number one thing in dealing with a company like Walgreens is Patience! If you got that, it's the perfect company for you to grow with! Nuff Said!"
good,the hardest part of the job was the constant walking and the having to get up and down to face the shelves. management can be a little hard to communicate with
good,"It's an ok company not the same as it used to be. I enjoyed working there in my specific department but sometimes we would be loaded with lots of work and have no help. The wages were another downfall, you're loaded with so many responsibilities for a low pay."
good,this was a job not available anymore due to the changes in healthcare and profits.  we need to get back to the personal effects of pharmacy with patients
good,Always have to find yourself with something to do. Have to be alert to things that have to be clean and or replaced. Overall a calm workplace to be in.
good,"They are great  people... very friendly and nice, at times you might feel left out but that only because everyone else has been there for so long and they all love each other."
good,"A typical day at work, I learn that everyone tries to make newcomers happy and feel like home. Employees always make customers feel wanted. The management is a nice pace."
good,"When I worked I had a lot of slow days and there wasn't much to do and when there was, it was mainly busy work or me picking up someone else's workload. I also stood for long periods of time and was never allowed to sit even if I was on my feet for 6 hours straight. Hours were easy to work with my manager and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Just a boring job that had no real benefits for me in the future."
good,Good place to wrok for someone who just graduating high school.  There benefits are great and the managment is fair.   They provided over time if you wanted.
good,"The job can offer health insurance, dental, as well as getting a discount on many of the items available in the store. You'll need to be comfortable dealing with customers and interacting with others if you'd want to work here."
good,It’s an well-round fair job. It has great people and decent pay. They try to help when it’s needed. They have lunches on certain holidays and even reward lunches as well
good,I really loved working at Walgreens but I was getting older and had to take on more responsibilities which means more money had to start coming coming in.
good,"The people I've worked with have really made this job special. Things can get a bit stressful during the holidays, but there's never a time where you feel you cannot handle your tasks."
good,Pros: 
good,"It has been years since I worked for Walgreens but at the time, Walgreens was set up extremely well to achieve optimal production rates but struggled with customer service."
good,"Helps shape character and provides a learning place for new skills and customer service. Friendly environment and good experience overall, you will always feel welcomed."
good,Very busy all the time and very under staffed at the location that I worked at. I enjoyed my co workers I just did not enjoy having to work long hours and having to rush to eat my lunch.
good,Store managers can dictate how good of a job this can be. Some managers are awesome while others do not know how to tell employees of changing polices. Others will make this job terrible and stressful for no reason. Some managers will also allow the team members to gain to much power and it feels like the store is being run by them and not management. And team members do not get paid enough for the amount of work require.
good,"It's ok for who wants to develop in retail career. It is very stressful, but the staff is so wonderful, kind and friendly, as well as always helps a new employee. It owns a special culture of this company. You can ask every employer whenever you need supports."
good,"If the manager tells you in the interview that the customers are tough to deal with and that the store is considered one of the hardest to work for in the district, believe them. Never been called so many names, had so much foul language said to me, or had so many petty complaints in my life. Ruined me on ever working in healthcare again."
good,"It’s a great job. Fun place to work. Great benefits, stock options, and discounts. The only problem was over worked and underpaid. Not enough staff and no shift rotations"
good,I was setting up a Pharmacy Technician program at Anoka Ramsey Community College and this was a good way to get current experience as a pharmacy technician to bring back to my classes.
good,"The location I worked at was always busy so there was never a dull moment, but the work is monotonous. Co-workers were great and was always open to helping each other when asked."
good,Learned valuable customer service skills that can be used in future job experiences. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful with learning tasks and other essential skills.
good,"I got a family feel at this company, I really enjoyed management and coworkers. They were willing to work with my schedule and gave hours when they were available. The only downside was that we tended to be short staffed on crucial days, and this was a very fast paced store. I got raises every year and occasional bonuses and they do pay for your certification. There is also a great employee discount."
good,Very nice organized company to work with . Had a great experience and career development and plenty of opportunities. Competitive pay rates and other benefits are provided.
good,"My coworkers all got along with me, and we would finish tasks together very quickly.  I liked the busy days at Walgreens because the time would fly as we would be occupied all day.  I would recommend it to my friends as a solid job to have."
good,"Walgreens was a job I was alright with. If you want a job that always gave a good amount of hours, a steady stream of customers, and flexible scheduling, then go for Walgreens. Unfortunately the store I worked at is currently closed for future renovations of Highway 146, I would say I enjoyed working there. As a former cashier/photo tech, the job was moderately demanding. Other than the holidays, the stream of customers was pretty bearable. A good clock in, clock out job. Management was great with morale and worked with everyone with flexible scheduling. The only thing I would say is that the job was pretty monotonous. As a cashier, I did the same thing everyday, checking people out until my shift ended. Next thing I knew, I was there for three years. It's a very safe job with great benefits, good hours, and great management. I just wanted a job that fulfilled more than that."
good,"A typical day at work at Walgreens can range from busy to laid back depending on the tasks for the day that need to be completed. At Walgreens, there isn't ever a time where employees don't have anything to do, even if they have completed their task list. Manager at Walgreens encourage employees to ask for help if it is ever needed. One of the biggest things Walgreens has taught me is team work and communication. The hardest part pf my job is actually dealing with some of my coworkers. Some aren't as easy to work with than others, but working at Walgreens has really helped me out with my people skills. The most enjoyable part about my job is the family oriented environment that they strive for everyday."
good,"I was burnt out after 3 months of working here. You sit for 8 hours doing data Entry. This job needs to be parttime, 40 hours of this job had my mind shot, I couldn’t think outside of work. I was mentally exhausted. You do receive two breaks and a lunch daily. No down time, everything is monitored, including bathroom breaks. Your speed, errors, amount of scripts  and scripts sent back are all monitored. There is literally no room to be human. No communication physically, you must read your emails, which you barely have time for, because when you’re at your cubicle you need to be logged into the active scripts application which keeps tract of your time per script. Definitely not for everyone. Low pay as well. Very friendly and helpful staff, but keeping to yourself seems to be encouraged there. People walk down the halls plugged into whatever they are listening to and not making eye contact with anyone. Very weird environment. Errors are made, pharmacist try to catch all the errors, but what they don’t catch they have other people calling the actual store to fix, lol. Seems like this could be drastically reduced if they didn’t demand 30 seconds or less per script from the data entry Specialist who really don’t know what they’re doing. More time equals less errors."
good,My career began with the mgt team and then progressed to recruitment and then onto supervision.   I was provided many opportunities and no intentions of leaving except when budget cuts were made my position was 1 of 38 eliminated company wide.
good,its a slow paced super easy job. have plenty of time through the day to get your chores done. just way to slow for someone like me. slow and boring but some people like that
good,Wlagreens has a great culture and is goof company but for the type of work you do is not worth the pay. Too much duties for one person and the program they use is very dated.
good,"the lake cook store was always a busy environment, but the people who work their are pleasant, and the store doesn't have the awful cook county sales tax. good for part time work"
good,"You can learn a lot from working in retail. I've been working for Walgreens for 2 years and I already know how the company works. My favorite part about working is having a relationship with my co workers. They are very awesome and I don't think I would be working for the company this long if it weren't for my co workers. Working for the company is okay. If you work front end it's a lot to handle but working in pharmacy I find it better. The benefits are good there but I heard for medical insurance they pay a low percentage but you're still paying more out of your pocket. Being a pharmacy technician helps me learn more about medicines since my major is in Nursing so that helps me when I go to school.  Working in front end can be a hassle because when you first start your shift you already got a task list of what you need to get done. Then you have to deal with customers in your department. Also, when it's truck day you gotta restock all the items on the shelf."
good,"A typical day in the pharmacy is answering calls from prescribers, patients, and insurance companies. In my experience, which has been about 2 years, I have learned to have an unlimited amount of patience and I will NEVER know everything there is to know. Store management is good, could be more communication with pharmacy technicians."
good,"Worked here for a while and overall it was quite positive. Ended up resigning due to a medical issue, but HR was very helpful and looked out for me so that I'm eligible to return if I should ever choose to. Hours are generally as posted unless it's rush or holiday time, but not too bad."
good,Walgreens is a good company to work for its easy to move up in the company u r acknowledge for your work and the pay and hours are good . I started as a stocker to a backroom manger doing everything that was required and more
good,It was cool.  I enjoyed the people I worked with they were really friendly. But the work was slow pace and id rather have fast pace.But in all it was a good experience.
good,"Working for Walgreen's as a SFL is great, they teach you a lot to move up and into the company.  Taking in invoices, posting truck, managing employees are some the the requirements for the position."
good,I enjoy working at Walgreens because of our staff. They really make the shifts go by fast and work as a team to get projects accomplished. The hardest part of my job is dealing with unruly customers but after a bad one always comes a great one and it turns the shift back around.
good,"Very clean, very supportive everyone was nice and the managers were friendly along with the employees. It was a very welcoming place and everyone is on task"
good,"I've learned how to manage teams working here. I've also picked up administrative skills, customer service skills which includes dealing with difficult customers or problems. I've also learned store management operations and how to think quick on my feet to resolve issues."
good,"From the time I arrive, its constant engagement with customers and employees.  I learned how to motivate and drive sales.  Managing day to day operations was challenging but I enjoyed every moment.  Training and mentoring employees on daily basis, building a culture that above average. Diverse group of talent.  Working long hours, staying until the work is done.  When my customers and smiling and I've told thank you and well."
good,"Everybody is very respectful of one another, my time at Walgreens was enjoyable, only con would be working until really late at night."
good,"•	Assisted customers and processed sales transactions"
good,"Working at Walgreens was a good experience. I learned much working here. Within 4 months of working with the company, I was offered a promotion to SFL. However I felt that the workload I was given in comparison to the pay did not match up and eventually found something better. This is the case with most jobs now-a-days though. Overall, a good company to work for."
good,A typical work day consist of me working from a worklist of patient referrals that I have to make calls on. I also take inbound calls from patients that want to place orders for their medication. I will call doctor offices aswell as manufactures for assistance when needed .
good,"Typically the customers were some of the easiest I've ever worked with. However, you do get the occasional, extremely rude one. Working in the photo lab was excellent. I enjoyed the work and it usually kept me learning and  working. The general work, however was dull, repetitive and sometimes physically painful. Coworkers were typically good people and workers (minus the occasional high-schooler who didn't take the job too seriously)"
good,I have loved working for this company just looking to try something different and eager to learn more and expand my knowledge.
good,"There was always something to be done. Productive and friendly workplace, Management was okay. Receiving stock was the hardest part. Cashier was the easiest. Training was very extensive, well executed."
good,it was a good environment to work and company  I work there for over 3 years I liked my team and managers just needed a better job with better pay on a typical day I would come in do all my skill that were assigned for the day
good,"Love children, love learning, loved the environment etc... I was momma bird, everyone loved me and were sad on my days off; It was such a great learning experience for the children and for me as well especially being that I am going to school for nursing and psychology it helped me a lot."
good,"A place were you can improve and develop different skills, They are always trying to help the staff to promote at different levels even though is job based on targets."
good,"Good company to work for. Not a career unless wanting to become a pharmacist, otherwise good job. Good training and benefits."
good,This is a very stressful enviornment for working. Usually not given enough support staff and very highly regulated. Other benefits and salary are good.
good,The organization is very proactive in its approach regarding growth and how to bring on new blood into the organization.
good,A great workplace for benefits. The pay was pretty good as well as the people. Everyone looked out for each other and wvwryone had great work ethics.
good,"people were nice, managers were nice, warehouse was clean and climate controlled. Pay was good and location of warehouse is good."
good,Good company with an average benefit package. Good work environment with a heavy work load. Opportunity for advancement is a slow process
good,"I just recently started at Walgreens in early November, 2015. So far it has been a great experience but the pay is not covering all of my bills."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Walgreen, each store has its own special atmosphere, and the benefits are quite nice. Work at night is very busy and consistent."
good,"room to advance"
good,"Felt like a slave, no recognition for hard work even though not being paid, barely learned anything, employees ignored me but the pharmacy manager was nice"
good,Everything you do at walgreens is in a task list. It's nice to know what you have to do everyday but can get really annoying. Walgreens overall is a very great company. Having great people to work with and great benefits with it is nice.
good,"Walgreens is not a terrible place to work, but there area lot of problems. Top management is not very proactive when handling employees. They also expect wayyy too much from eight dollar an hour employees."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at walgreens. The work load is manageable, the company was great but the pay was not the best given the amount of work, and sometimes pressure, put on each employee. On a daily basis you have your daily tasks on top of other tasks depending on the day. Management is great, yet, they can be very pushy about certain sells. Co-workers were great! The job is not hard itself but the hours were sometimes hard to deal with (5pm-1:30 am). I did not think the job was hard but it was tiring. The most enjoyable thing is meeting new people everyday and making friendships with co-workers."
good,"-A day in the life of a Walgreens employee includes assisting customers with their shopping needs, product inquiries, checking food items for out-dates, providing superior customer service, straightening the store, inventory, filling outs, doing counts."
good,"Walgreens was a good company to work for. I enjoyed all the people I worked with over the years, and I am friends to this day with a lot of them."
good,"As a manager, I have learned that every customer wants the best of the best, and coming into the store to shop with us is telling me we are doing something right. "
good,"prescriptions, doctors phone calls, customer assistance."
good,the hardest part of the job was stocking the cooler/freezer. My coworkers were really nice.
good,"As an extern, I was able to learn and work with the dispensing of prescription medication, and touch the surface of the pharmacy software. There is much more to be learned, which will happen in due time when employed by a prospective pharmacy/hospital/healthcare organization."
good,"work overnights with customers and management on stocking shelves, reset and revision, and inventory"
good,"Walgreens is very fast paced and you have to be ready to change at all times. Flexability is a must, because things can change from hour to hour and you have to do what they are calling you too do at that moment. Notes change constanty, because what was important to do in the morning, might change at 10am."
good,"i was a general warehouse anytime someone  call off or needed help that was when they assign me to work that job and i did everything i loaded trucks,pick,pack,forklift driver,janitor,materal handler and was there to be productive . loading the trucks was hard when i first started but i dont give up easy .the begining is always the hardest.i love going to work best part of my job was being there."
good,"typical work day, supervising floor team and completing tasks to improve overall store success."
good,A typical day would be helping Customer's and Writing a daily work list for the employee's. What I usually do is assign my co workers the list I wrote and make sure they are doing the job right. I learned how to manage the store without the store manager being present. My hardest Part of my job is dealing with difficult customers and dealing with difficult vendors. The most enjoyable part of my job is going to work and help customers.
good,"I've never worked anywhere else before. Walgreens is the first and only job I've ever had. "
good,Some days are busy and some are slow. You never know what your day will be like and who you may upset/make happy. Its a typical retail store. I loved working in the pharmacy just didn't like the whole insurance part. We have great staff at my store. We all get along like adults that we are and get our work done.
good,Great management but opportunities to move up in the company is very difficult.
good,"I love working Walgreens and it's a great place to start, but when I was interview, I was told that I could either take the 1st/2nd Shift for $7.25 or I can take the 3rd shift for $8.50. Obviously, I took the 3rd shift obviously. Its a good shift, I work 9 hours for 7 days only. So I'm work 63hrs/ 2 weeks. But little did I know, I recently signed into my account to link my employee discount and my pay rate was $7.50. Now somebody owes me some money. I don't care if its a $63 difference throughout the week. I got bills to pay just like everybody else. I feel as if the management could improve. Since I work the 3rd shift, I'm suppose to get an extra bonus or pay rate just for working night."
good,"Typical retail management position, micro managed in every aspect from numerous managers."
good,"It's not as much retail as I expected, the job is more physically demanding especially for females."
good,"A typical day at Walgreens consist of assisting customers with items in store, awnsering phone calls, entering data in system, and making sure my duties were complete in a timely manner. I learned persistance. If there is a problem keep striving until customer is satisfied. Working with management was nice. They are were respectful, listened attentively, and took care of all my needs. Co-workers were a pleasure to work with. I had the opportunity to work with hard workers, willing to do what need to be done and was encouraging. The hardest part of the job was trying to please each and every customer. Everyone will not be happy, my job was to make sure each customer I came in contat with was well assisted and was coming back. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I had a great team to come into everyday. We did our job, but we also had fun."
good,Put the store together..worked graveyard... put merchandise on the shelves.. Helped customers
good,If you love working with a public in a fast paced enviornment then this is the place for you!
good,"It was a great place to work for, I enjoyed seeing daily customers."
good,"Dont get me wrong, I have learned ALOT from working here and ive met some amazing and wonderful people. its been great learning about the different ways to manage a dept. and how to really tend to customers. ive also enjoyed my experience in the pharmaceutical field and it has really made me want to make it a part of my future career-wise. the hardest part is probably working the amount of hours worked with such low pay. also with the many different levels of management it is suprisingly difficult to move up in the company."
good,"-Reviewed and filled prescriptions, provided customers with information and counseling regarding prescriptions and other medications."
good,"Working at the cash register, management is nice, co-workers were cool, hardest part of the job was when it was busy ringing up customers. most enjoyable was stocking merchandise."
good,my co-workers were helping me with stuff i didnt no how to do?
good,"This is a great company to work for, a typical day consist of managing your time as well and as efficiently as possible, you must learn how the store operates and must rely on personal skills and customer service to assist and perform to you maximum level"
good,"It's a good place to work at, have many benefits, and the pay its really good"
good,I worked at all positions except pharmacist at Walgreens and liked my coworkers and assisting customers on a daily basis. The jobs was pretty good with decent management. I would definitely give Walgreens a pretty good rating for students or management.
good,Great fast paced work environment. Room to move up in the business and grow. Most exciting part of the job is interacting with customers. Every shift has different tasks will always be busy.
good,"The typical work day, is a 10 hour shift with 2 breaks. The job itself is not hard if you're willing to learn it. You might struggle, but the mentors are good at their job and will make sure you get it down right."
good,This company has been successful to work for and they have taken care of their employees. The management structure has changed for the company and isn't of the same quality as it was when I started.
good,"When I went to work at Walgreens I found the environment very mundane. I would go to work, watch videos, stock shelves, and work the cash register. All the other employees were very nice, retail is just not the job environment I like."
good,"I learned many things about working at Walgreens how  I'd should always help out a customer no matter what."
good,"If you want to move up in your career in retail, Walgreens is a great place to work. The benefits Walgreens offers are amazing and some of the best out there in my opinion."
good,"walgreens cut my hours "
good,"I actually liked working at Walgreens, because it became like a second family.  The only think I didn't like was working nights and weekends, because I had a young son at the time."
good,GOOD EMPLOYER OVERALL. They were very flexible with my schedule while I was in school and pregnant. Relaxed work atmosphere. Organization follows a model but also backs their employees.
good,"You are expected to work the front register, the drive thru, and answer the phone while attending to your regular duties. You are expected not to make any errors. Management will throw you under the bus in the event that a customer is difficult."
good,When I worked as a pharmacy technician at walgreens I felt like I was working a fast food retail store all over again. I hardly put into practice any of the skills I learned as a pharmacy technician. They didn't rotate cashiers/drive-thru pharmacy technicians enough.
good,"Walgreens has a lot of good perks about the company, but now they don't have enough people working there. Company has lessened the about of workers and took away some of the positions that used to be available."
good,"A typical day of work would include restocking from our truck, working the cash register, organizing shelves, and assisting customers with anything they needed. The management is fairly laid back and fun but also hardworking. The atmosphere of the company was very fast-paced but at times was more relaxed when there was less customers. Working with the customers was sometimes difficult because they do not always have patience with us and may lash out. The employees are easy to work with, the managers are nice and overall, the company was a nice environment."
good,"you meet a lot of interesting people daily, The only thing i didnt like is nothing new happens its a consecutive day everyday. The manager is a very understanding person"
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work , it can be stressful at times. but the customer and employee are wonderful. There is room for advancement. I would recommend Walgreens to any one looking for a job."
good,"but I really liked working at Walgreens when I was much younger, talking about High School days. I would recommend to someone in that type of situation."
good,"I like working there it's a great retail job especially for young people who want part time work, not too fast paced and not too stressful to work out good checks"
good,It was a great place to be. you see a ton of customers a day and you work around the most amazing people ever. Every day is different and you learn something new each day.
good,"Typical day at work= CRANKY PATIENTS!!!"
good,"Walgreen's is a great job with great benefits. They're pretty flexible when it comes to taking off and availability changes. Lots of regular customers, you'll start to feel at home."
good,The co-workers and (most) of the managers were great. The customers could be a test of patience at times. It is a great place if you enjoy customer service and if you get the right manager it is a great place to work.
good,"I think that Walgreens is a good work environment to gain experience in the healthcare field. There was always room for growth, and got to work along side friendly staff."
good,The job is overall enjoyable to come and assist customers. Very fast paces and great place to learn different skill sets. Come and with postive attitude and redady to work becausr there is always something to do
good,"I spent my days at Walgreens selling product, helping people find or try new products, assisting other employees, keeping my aisles and the restrooms neat and clean. I would have stayed if not for the management (6 other people also left due to the same people), I would work for them again if it was for a different location. I loved interacting with the customers and even acquired regulars over time."
good,Walgreens was a great job to get an idea of what working retail is like. I learned a lot about diversity and how to handle theft.
good,"I love working at Walgreens. The management really sets the tone for each store, and I was blessed by great management!  This would be a great place to work for those who are looking to advance into management roles within the company.  The extremely low wages for entry and lower management levels make it necessary to have government support for living expenses to those that have a family to care for.  I feel that corporate makes a lot of red tape.  You will not be able to get work verification done by the store manager, and this has cost me a great deal of headache and lost out on some very much needed benefits for my children.  I would give this chain a better rating if the store manager had control over the starting wage.  Even with previous experience, I still had to start out at minimum wage.  I was trained first at the cash register, then at photo and in cosmetics.  I loved building rapport both with our regular and our other customers.  The hardest part of the job was the lack of income and not having the company be a help to a single mom, like me, to get the paperwork completed for health and welfare."
good,overall volunteer experience was good as it was busy so has chance to learn more. The work environment and manager was awesome. They treat me like their family member.
good,If you love retail this is the job for you.  I have  learned to build great relationships with other healthcare providers.
good,the most enjoyable is when the rush our crowd comes in to the store and makes the shift go a bit faster.... but I work my Tail off and I get paid poorly
good,"It average for me.  On the job, benefits, job security is excellent on the job."
good,"great work environment,,excellent customer service. Knowledgeable learning experience."
good,over seen task that needed to be done. managed employees. cleaniless of store. customer service top priority.just love working with people.
good,"Opening or closing store , counting money, dealing with upset employees or customers, changing advertise and posting new label and signs, trying to encourage employees to work and be safe, learn how to approach upset people and continue to become that good manager. The hardest part are the hours many people call in and managers have to cover shifts and work can be stressful if managers decide to leave when they want too. I would love a steady schedule so I can proceed with schooling and become better management.  I do enjoy the customers even if someone upset because its my job to make sure they are satisfied people."
good,"Oversaw store operations.	"
good,"Normally the store runs with the minimum amount of employees possible, so customer service tends to be slow and frustrating for the customer. Didn't learn anything specific other than what is to be in a working environment, it is a position that requires null skills. The management is varied, overall it was ok, although not many of them actually cared for the customer but rather of their pay. Co-workers tended to be mostly relaxed, but there was no feeling of team work. The hardest part of this job is dealing with the managers and the costumers which get frustrated for the lack of costumer service. The most enjoyable part is when everything finally came together and worked out wonderfully. "
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is that; while we don't have many employees per store, I've been able to make some great lifelong friends. The hardest part is that we don't have enough business in our small town to justify more hours or employees, therefore putting additional strain and stress on the current employees."
good,Great place to work if your single and have no children. I would work from 3-11pm to be at work the next day at 7am- 3pm. Great learning experience though. Pharmacy is the best place to work.
good,"High call volume environment, easy people to get along with"
good,"A typical day of work is making sure your work area is clean, help customers as needed, and stock the shelves as needed. Also, completeing a list of tasks that was given to you be a manager on your shift."
good,cahier with many of the same faces returning day after day.Similiar to bartending without the alchohol. Customers began to trust me with thier needs.
good,Ilearned alout about customer service .Ialso made many new friends
good,"A typical work day for me would be for me to go to work get prepared for my daily task, that has to be done within an eight hour work day. Stay focus and excel to the best of my ablity at what I do."
good,I would say the hardest part of the job is trying to do other people job plus yours. Multitasking for me is very easy but when you’re ringing up customers and you’re coworker would rather smoke a cigarette it’s pretty hard
good,"I have worked for Walgreens for 11 years and knew the culture and operations extremely well. While the employee culture was positive, the customer base is challenging to handle."
good,I enjoyed the pharmacist and techs I worked with. The front of the store was also friendly and helpful. Store management was friendly and helpful and I learned a lot as a pharmacy technician from this store.
good,i learned how to organize and find expiration dates on foods and the best methods to do everything efficiently. my manager was super kind and understanding and the other workers were all amazing helping me grow and understand.
good,I was pleased working for Walgreens but the Manager and I had issues on how he ran the store. After I put my 2 week notice in and resigned he was then terminated from his position. I do not like favoritism in a work place. The manager and an associate were having an affair.
good,"it was fun meeting different people"
good,Great experience working at walgreen there Isabella careers to chose from and friendly people to work with .The customer as the key and help the store stay brighten .without them we will be nothing
good,It’s was a productive fun Environment place  to  explore & get out to talk to others keeping kids off the streets helping them become a better person to they self & others
good,"When I arrive at work it's always a great morning, I learn something new every day. Dealing with TPRs and  ordering OOS. The pharmacy manager was always there to answer a question and always willing to show me something new from calling third party exceptions to solving DURs"
good,Walgreens was a nice place to work guy or me as a high school student.The company is flexible with your hours. You get vacation and holiday time.You work with many different people.
good,"Walgreens was a pretty fast paced environment. I enjoyed the employees, and the customers. Everyday was a day of excitement when working at Walgreens."
good,"This was my first job as a pharmacy manager.  I ran a fast paced, high volume store.  I had exceptional pharmacists and pharmacy technicians who have become life-long family.  I loved the workflow policies of Walgreens.  I had an excellent computer system and robot.  The pharmacy manager was independent of the store manager."
good,Working for Walgreens was a great learning experience. The only thing is they underpay their employees even though they are the biggest and most profitable pharmacy in America.
good,Advancement opportunities. Pay raise every six months. Paid holidays. Promotional money added to your pay for upselling nerchandise
good,"I do not work much but I am a Customer Service Associate and I work the front register. I have learned that whenever problems are encountered you must empathize with the customer. This helps to deescalate the situation. Moreover, abiding by the brand mantra and ensuring that every customer is completely satisfied is the main mission."
good,"It's a great job , everyone is always nice. Very flexible with the schedules. You must be able to multi task in order to work at thus job."
good,Everyday I would walk the floor and I would start to do my safety walk help out and greet every customer and ask them if they needed any help
good,"I thought this job was very challenging. It was always busy. You had to be very fast and active because there was always patients in drive thru, inside, and dropping off."
good,"My typical work day at Walgreen's would be very long and calm. I learned a lot when I was working here. I learned great communication and customer service skills. My management was ok , I had a little problem with them only cause I felt like he was treating me fairly with the schedule. My co-workers there was marvelous, i loved them all , got along with all of them and everything. I would say the hardest part of this job was nothing. I understood everything they ever needed me to do . The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with the customers and putting smiles on their faces, making sure I performed excellent customer service."
good,"It was great working with the company. No regrets"
good,enjoyed externship here customer and employees were awesome and very nice
good,I loved working at Walgreens... I stayed busy & there was lots of things to do. I loved my customers and people that loved me!
good,This is not  a complicated position (customer service representative) the most enjoyable part of the job is that everyone is friendly patient and very understanding .
good,During my externship I enjoyed being at Walgreens. The women and men who worked there where very nice and well educated. They taught me many things. Most importantly they showed me appreciation for being there helping them out as I learned.
good,"The company is great to work for.  However, it can be very demanding & stressful like any job.  The company seems to go through a lot of changes.  Some good & some not so good.  I have been there pretty much most of my life and I had to learn to adapt to the changes quickly."
good,"I loved I got to help pick the right products that best fits them. Its cool to interact with the customers and get to know them, so next time they come in I know what they want."
good,"Fast paced work environment. Hands on learning. Learned the basics of pharmacy flow. Filling, selling, refilling prescriptions. Inventory ordering, stocking, and returning. My favorite part is the customers! I love interacting with people. The hardest part is learning quickly and efficiently with management expectations of grasping the componants of the Pharmacy duties in a short period of time."
good,The job was good. Walgreens is a very high pace and stressful work place. It's very important to stay focused in the workplace. This can wear on a person after awhile. So having great coworkers is a must.
good,"Customer Service, time management, good co-worker, learn new things everyday, a typical day at work is when it gets busy during rush hour, the hardest part of the job is when we do not have enough people to help run the store, the most enjoyable part is when you see a happy satisfying customer."
good,I love working there and I learn how to respect and act well to customers. The management is a wonderful person. The work place culture is that they hate shouting anyhow
good,A typical work day was from 7am to 5pm.  As store manager my job was to oversee the entire operations of the facility. The hardest part of the job was employee management.
good,"I realize that acquiring and maintaining loyal repeat business, as well as spreading the word of a business through loyal patrons, is of the upmost importance to every successful company. I was a hard worker and excellent trainer to my fellow beauty advisors. The hardest part was motivating my team to be self-driven and to achieve the company's sales goals daily as a team."
good,"easy going, co-workers are friendly, management are reasonable. there is nothing hard about my job. the most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help the customers."
good,it was good met lots of great people and interact with others also gave me better work experience also made me know how it  feels to have a job and it was a great experience
good,"Working at Walgreen's was a great learning experience. Training was easy to grasp, and my coworkers were extremely friendly. I learned how to better serve the store customers. The job duties included stocking shelves, cashier and organizing incoming store products."
good,"I have 19 years experience as a pharmacy technician in retail and hospital (inpatient and outpatient).  Experience in all aspects of pharmacy including IV mixture, drug compounding, bubble packing, pyxis, automated cell systems, ins billing/troubleshooting, drug ordering/stocking, daily reports, nursing home bubble packing/delivery, mail order, pt acct charges/credits, filing, & hospital indigent program prescription billing.  I have a very strong work ethic and detail oriented especially involving patient care in quality service, safety, and satisfaction."
good,"If you let on that you're willing to work hard, everyone will give you their jobs in addition to your own. The playlist will drive you insane, and management will tell the police that it is all your fault if you get a stalker from work."
good,"Currently enrolled in a pharmacy technician program, part of the program is to work in a real pharmacy as a technician in training."
good,I felt that I was in the dark the whole  time I was there.  I didn’t even know who my managers name was. When a employee had a break or lunch there was only one person at a time in the lunch room. So there goes your so social skills.
good,Only certain employees were allowed to fulfill all job duties required. No encouragement or support to exceed position requirements. Scarce hours available to work.
good,I honestly didn’t feel safe working there. Their lack of security is alarming as well as over worked and under payed. Over all it wasn’t worth risking myself for the pay I received and all the work I had to do.
good,"The management love to sit down in the office and micro manage they love to find ways to fire employees   "
good,"I thought I would do great working at Walgreens, considering I had 13 yrs in retail  "
good,I am looking to be a Pharm Tech At a different location due to management problems going on. I have been working for Walgreens for 4 years. I am 1 of two of their senior pharm techs and I’m in charge of everything in the pharmacy and I would like to work somewhere where the work load is evened out and fair for all.
good,working at walgreens is stressful because many ppl will put more on you than anybody else and you still get paid the same as people to do close to nothing
good,can be very busy you can work alot. with really know time for your family. I worked nights most of the time which made it hard for my family. But I did like what I was doing because i am a people person and love to help in any way I can
good,Walgreens Is a great place to work at with the right manager. It’s an easy job and they have good benefits. I was with the company for 3 years until I got a new manager and I had to leave. It’s true what they say “bad managers make good employees leave”
good,Both fellow employees and most customers made this job enjoyable. Not a stressful environment & mostly slow paced. The best 6 months of my life. However I can’t live of 12 hour weeks.
good,The jobs is not a bad job if it’s your first job. Some of the managers do a very poor job at managing. You will always leave work with a headache because of all the drama
good,Most of the managers only sit in their offices and don't help train you or anything and assistant manager and up are the only people who receive bonuses. If you need to change your schedule at all your hours get cut drastically.
good,"My managers weren’t very motivated or uplifting so for me, working at Walgreens wasn’t very tolerable. All stores are bound to be different & probably all have different work environments."
good,There is a serious lack of communication between the managers and employees. There is also a really big problem with mixing personal issues with work. I would still work there again. My fellow co-workers were great people but I do believe that the communication is the biggest problem. And no Place is Perfect but we get closer by working on issues. But overall i enjoyed my experience was good.
good,"The best part of working at Walgreens was the opportunity to help other people.  The customers were wonderful, for the most part, but management was incompetent  at best."
good,I loved my job and going to work until management and people changed. I use to suggest working for Walgreens but I don't anymore. Management is like you have to brown nose to get anywhere in the company.
good,"Management was rude, took frequent smoke breaks, and had favorite employees that could hang out in the office or take longer breaks. Other employees were very kind and inclusive."
good,"Managers being made to manage more than one store."
good,"A typical day at Walgreens would be described as very productive beginning with the moment you clock in all the way until you clock out. Always challenging and there was always new things to learn. I learned how to suggestive sell and rotate stock, as well as markdowns and promotional. Organizing the front area of the store which has some quick products customers may need to pick up. Also, refill refrigerators and shelves making sure we write down on items that are not in stock to be ordered. On weekends being in charge of putting up ads which are created using a special software the store has available. The ads would be placed on Saturday and last about a week some of them are called monthly ads which last all month. I learned at this job how to deal with different kinds of customers even tourist and learning different kinds of languages when communicating with them and making sure to find all the products that may be needed for them if not finding an alternative or a solution. The management definitely hard to deal with and get along well. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with reaching suggestive sale goals on a slow day. The most enjoyable part of work is helping the customers walk out with a smile on there face."
good,"Walgreens is a great company and I love shopping here.  However, working for them is a little different.  It's okay.  They do not offer full time work to regular staff, so that they do not have to offer benefits. They expect too much of you for a minimum wage job."
good,"A typical day will start off slow to full lines by noon"
good,"I worked at three store for Walgreens, the first two I enjoyed very much, the managers of the first two store understood the importance of how to treat people.  The manager I currently work for doesn't know what the word integrity means, he is not a leader or motivator.  Atypical day at work, first trying to figure out what type of mood the manager is in, the figuring out if I was the Assistant manager for the day or a stock clerk.  So it was not a very fun place to work and the store was not meeting corporate goals.  The other people I worked with just needed someone to say thanks for your efforts you did a good job, that is the role I tried to fill.  The hardest part of the job was working with the manager, the other employees and customers were very easy to get a long with.  In the first two store the people worked very well together they worked hard but had fun."
good,"A typical day at Walgreens is me working by myself when its suppose to be team work , I have too lear eveything on my own free will , Managment is not helpful at all , They through things at you with out showing you how they are suppose to be done.My Co-workers are not helpful at all. Most of them dont know the meanning of team work . The Hardest part of my job is my protending to be happy there and Im not , The most enjoyable part is when its time to go home ,"
good,"In my experience in being with this company i can say that it is a good opportunity to get your foot in the door however, it is very difficult to find advancement opportunities with this company due to all the constant changes happening with its structure. although change is it also halts the others when the system is changed because of the readjustment factor."
good,"El ambiente laboral no es el mejor, ya que la mayoría de veces no hay suficientes empleados."
good,"A typical day at work, was me cashiering and having to take over the photo department. Often worked alone. Had multiple job requirements and did many different jobs."
good,"Things I've learned from working there are comparing merchandise invoices to items actually received to ensure that shipments are correct. I would design and set up advertising signs and displays of merchandise on shelves, counters or tables to attract customers and promote sales."
good,"Productive, easy work place with workers very open minded. Also,able to be learn something new every day just to satisfy people needs. Managers are always very helpful and with positive attitude."
good,Walgreens was one of the companies that new graduates look forward to working for. That notion has changed probably mission/goals have also changed. Walgreens went from customer oriented to money oriented and have lost the focus/goal. It's all about the numbers. No longer takes care of their own whom in turn takes care of the patients
good,Overall a good place of employment just not much room for advancement and no job security...does not have good raises. Nice coworkers minus management.
good,"I worked at Walgreens for a little over a year. What can I say, I gave it my best. The poor management and ever changing rules and procedures finally prompted me to seek a career elsewhere."
good,"I been here for two years i've learned alot."
good,"I loved my job at the location in denver, the company itself isnt a bad company to be a part of. The benefits werent great but they werre flexible with the hours and good people to work with."
good,"If you have a good Pharmacy team to work with, it's smooth sailing. If not, it's a living nightmare. However the position did provide me with the best customer service training. The compensation was horrible though. Techs were paid very differently due to years with the company, even if they were horrible at their jobs."
good,"I really didn't like working at Walgreens. Yes a job is a job, but when you are doing more than the job that you interviewed for, there is a problem. I would not have mind running around the way I did, if i was getting paid the right amount of money for the work I was dishing."
good,not a place i was happy to be at all the time and coworks are always talking about you behind your back always worried about what you are doing and what is going on with you and not there own job management is not good at all very mean and not understanding when it comes to family problems etc...
good,Secure but never home lots of waiting around unload by hand not to bad last min call
good,I enjoyed this job liked my co-workers and manager. Unloading the truck had to be the hardest part of the job. Most enjoyable part was helping costumers.
good,"Productive, good co workers, excellent customer and fun place to work"
good,I worked in the cosmetic's department. The management was not professional at the branch I transferred to and I ended up resigning. I do have my prescriptions refilled there and the store is one of my highest stores I do business with as it is very customer service oriented.
good,"Clock in, get money drawer, go to register, straighten work area, answer phone, forward calls to appropriate extension, go to aisle you are responsible & look for out-of-date products, greet customers & ensure they have a positive experience."
good,Management would say one thing and make promises then change their mind. Staffing played favorites often making it harder to succeed. Also there is a pay cap and after that amount you have to move out of the pharmacy to make more.
good,"A typical day at walgreens was very stressful. however, the customers were very friendly. I made sure that customers was satisfied with their visit and that made me very happy."
good,Walgreens is a very laid-back job. I would recommend if you're looking for part-time hours do not try to build a career. The management team is very knowledgeable it's a small store and they're very family-oriented.
good,"I had a very wonderful manager until she retired, then the new manager did not seem to care for me.  I had heard that she was not very nice to a lot of employees.  But I enjoyed the work and the other co workers there very much."
good,"A day for me is I go in early in the morning clock in and there is usually a list for employees and shift leads from the store manger and if pharmacy calls i go back to assist. I've learned how to stock properly, do scan out and also working back in pharmacy. Management use to be pretty decent but now we have a new crew of people and they don't know how things run and refuse to learn or acknowledge other employees suggestions about what works for the store."
good,There are more and more hour cuts and so you are doing the same amount of work with less help. It seems that the company is making it hard to over come internal struggles.
good,"Not saying all Walgreen's are bad, just the store I'm currently at could use some work. The management isn't the best, the store is messy and hard to take care of, and we need people to be in charge of certain sections (i.e. photo, cosmetics)"
good,"A typical day at work includes two different shifts, either at the front end ( Cahier ) or on floor meaning that you do OSA and resets when they drop. Since I am a DH I mainly work on Floor / in pharmacy when needed. It's not stressful what so ever, though they push a lot of hours all in one day and on weekends. Most management doesn't allow requested time off and won't help with you if needed time off for family. Though being able to work with the costumers is an enjoyable thing to do. Walgreens mainly has older people come in for their prescriptions and I enjoy hearing there stories and allowing them to smile while greeting them by there names."
good,"I worked hard for this establishment for quite some time. I believe that cleaning house of mostly management would be best and most helpful. If you work here, just know you will be more disappointed than any other job."
good,This job was fun and had great incentives in house. I loved working from home doing order entry. My job was eliminated due to losing a bid for Medicare Part B
good,Walgreens has a business model that revolved around explosive expansion until the recession hit.  Now there is little room for advancement and it will only get worse as margins get slimmer in the pharmacy business.
good,"The only thing I didn't like was the fact that I was deemed unreliable after ending up in the hospital for double pneumonia during the summer from working in the cooler and freezer for so many hours. It is required that you work any hours they need, and there is no regular or posted schedule. Otherwise I really enjoyed the job. I would work it again if I ever just need additional income."
good,Fun to work there but they can only afford to pay minimum payments due to the company size and the number of employees it require. The good thing is that their is no pressure what's so ever.
good,"For my time at Walgreens, i came to learn that corporate as a whole instills rules that show a law of awareness. I had a hand full of emergencies and was basically given an ultimatum between my emergency and my job."
good,"maintain register, help customers, set up product table, unload truck, put the product on the shelves, update sales tags, maintain knowledge of products, clean the store, clean the restrooms"
good,I've been working for Walgreens for a year and six months. It was a decent work experience for me. I learned a lot about customer service skills and how to handle/ resolve customer's problems.
good,"Quotas for sales had to be met on a daily basis. Hours were continuously cut and pay was not raised more than 25 cents a year."
good,This was not a great place to work. The pharmacy manager distributed hours based on friendship and not on work ethic. If you desire climbing the ladder in this company it probably will not happen. Customers were mostly friendly and delightful
good,"This not place to work if you have children or want to have a life outside of work. "
good,"Walgreens is a nice place to work. Most of my co-workers are nice and friendly. "
good,Walgreen's was a fun environment each day goals were set in a team oriented atmosphere.  Management here needs work though
good,"Overall, I enjoyed working the photo department at Walgreens. I loved helping customers with their photo needs and doing the best job I could for them so they would come back and continue to do business with us. I also enjoyed the people I worked with. It's nearly impossible to work with people so closely and not develop good friendships with them, and I'm grateful that I did."
good,"The Company as a whole is strong and not going anywhere. However, they are in a constant state of chaos and change. They are making many decisions that make the health of the patients and customers in jeopardy."
good,"I balanced all cash registers, entered invoices on the computer, balanced coupons and made reports. I was also a cashier, and in charge of processing photo film, developing film, printing photos and cd's, and refilling ink cartridges."
good,"Very busy life, you could always expect something different everyday. You must be a very patient person in order to deal with sick customers."
good,"This was the second job I ever had. Again, basic retail pay and responsibilities but I exceeded expectations and even was named 7th best beauty advisor in the district for sales."
good,This job was my first job i had ever worked since graduating high school. Being new at having a job there were many difficult times at this position. I was a pharmacy Tech here and it was a very fast pace position for me to have at 18. I caught on quick though and I did enjoy being able to work with people on a daily basis. I liked that I was depended on to get prescriptions right. I was trusted by the people shopping there that I would take care of them. My co-workers initially were not always understanding in the beginning but with time everyone got better with patience. The hardest part for me was the fast pace it had initially because I was not use to it. The easiset part was talking with the customers and being able to help the time go by a little faster for them while their prescription was being filled. 
good,Fast paced and busy environment. They are growing by leaps and bounds. 
good,"Walgreens was a ok job. The job security was not the best, but I was able to learn some values by working there."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the people (customers) who come into the store. The hardest part of the job is co-workers not working together as a team and management not allowing us to work as a team and management not working as a team with us. A typical day or night in my case (I close all the time) would be talking and helping customers, ringing out and bagging their merchandise, gathering shopping carts from outside, face and straightening merchandise on sales floor, filling and stocking shelves with merchandise."
good,"I enjoyed assisting in the pharmacy. I learned a lot and I got to work hands on with customers, and extern was exciting. I got to fill prescriptions and help with inventory."
good,"Walgreen's is a fun place to work, and you gain great customer service experience. But there are little chances of moving up, you start at minimum wage ($7.75 per hour) and you must deal with store hours being cut. Also there are no hours guaranteed. This is a great job for teenagers that don't have bills to pay."
good,"It was a decent  work experience  manager was alright, definitely a place where favorites are played. More so a job for people  17-28 I guess advancement takes forever."
good,I worked at 2 different walgreens and it was cool at first but after you get to know management you realize it’s horrible. Before I was pregnant I was getting all the hours and after I gave birth they only give me 2 days out the week.
good,Promoted from within was helpful to further my career when I wasn’t aware such opportunities were possible. Even provided for training in the advancement opportunity.
good,I would have loved to work for Walgreens if I wouldn’t have gotten laid off only two months of working there. Definitely put me and my family in a bad position.
good,"Management was horrible at my store. Absolutely NO communication and everything was always unorganized and a mess. The shift leads never wanted to do anything or help when we got a line. They were never fair with hours, unless your the managers friend, of course . Co workers were okay. Mostly girls so there was always drama. Everytime there was a problem between two girls and was brought to management, they never did anything , lack of communication. Change schedules without letting you know. Even if you had a set schedule , they would change it without telling you. I got paid pretty well. I liked being productive. And I had a loyal customer base. Work was great , but the management and lack of communication was stressful and unnecessary."
good,Lots of nice people work here. Could be a good first job for some but only if you are made for retail. Some people won't like working here but I liked meeting all different kinds of people.
good,the one thing i hated was promised a day shift and then gave me a graveyard shift that was 7 days 11hr shifts got to a year and never replaced me to work days hired for days .
good,"Hires in outsiders before promoting insiders"
good,"Walgreens is an okay company but I didn't get the perfect experience there. I grew a lot and defiantly learned a lot of different things, but the management was not the nicest or understanding."
good,I worked at Walgreens while in High School and they were very flexible with my school schedule. The pay rate wasn't great but it wasn't terrible either. The store manager didn't really do anything and left everything for the other managers to do.
good,"Day at walgreens was faceing shelves, and greeting costumers. Hard part of the job you cant stop a person from stealing and had to clean up after people who left there mess at there station be for leaveing or you get in trouble for there mess. Walgreens a good place to work if you want slow pace job"
good,We all had to start as customer service sales associates to apply for any other position which would take another 3 years beyond you can actually apply for a better position. The schedule was fixed for those hours and it has to be your uttermost priority. I had fun building relationships with the customers and learning their names. It always made the feel important and cared for.
good,"It was a pleasure working at walgreens. Really simple tasks nothing out the norm of retail, dealt with alot of attidudes and personalities but that comes with the beauty of the job"
good,Managers would tell you to do something one way one day and jump on you for doing it that way the next. they would blame failures on their part on something you did to distract them and would ask employees to spy on each other.
good,A typical day at work the front shift runs the register and deals with customers as well as stocks the seasonal/battery and candy isles. Quite a few rude customers.
good,its a good job to work at. some managers thier are racist but other than that its a good job! and if i could i would work there again. tyhey pay decent.
good,"Walgreens was once a great place to work, but as the economy declined, so did Walgreens culture. They once took care of their employees, offered overtime and great benefits, but that declined as well. I still appreciate all that I learned from that company in the 12 years I worked for them as a manager."
good,Low wages make it impossible to make your living expenses. Traditionally a job for students who still live at their parents home. Living in a competitive city like nyc this career choice barely helped me make ends meet.
good,"Unfortunately Walgreens no longer hires their store managers or assistant store managers internally.  There are outliers who are hired, but they are few and far between.  If you are hired in as a shift lead, you will most likely not be hired as an ASM-T.  You might if you have a decent manager who understands the system.  However, many managers are old school and still score by the old system (""Nobody deserves a high score unless they..."""
good,Days go by fast cause it’s such a fast pace environment. Management need to be more involved in employee personal life when necessary. Pay raises for pharmacy due to work volume and stress are extremely necessary.
good,Walgreen can be a great place to work all depending on your management team and your wok area. your work area plays a part because of the customers you will encounter.
good,"I learned a lot in this opportunity. It all comes down to management. If you have a good manager, he/she will be able to guide so that you be promoted. This company has a lot of great benefits, if you work hard you can receive these opportunities. However if you have a manager that hard to communicate with, it could cause you to lose moral to want to be there."
good,"Management was friendly and helpful, and always willing to help train and teach employees. The work was easy and efficient. This was a good starter job to have."
good,She was wonderful in the beginning and then when policies started to change she never let anyone know so when I did something wrong she fired me and then told me it was company policy and I didn't even know because it was a new policy.
good,A typical day at work was checking people out at the cash wrap and cleaning and facing in between customers. There was a lot of free time to clean and help customers find what they were looking for.
good,"I rang up customers' purchases. Helped customers find merchandise. Answered general questions. Stocked cigarettes, alcohol and candy. I learned that retail employees often don't get the recognition they deserve from customers or employers. The hardest part of the job was the varied schedule and working holidays. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping, talking to and seeing customers regularly."
good,It was a training job with no pay and very busy store that handles hundreds of prescription each day. Spectrum of workers that impacted positively on me and I learned a lot from them.
good,"The company is great to work for but sometimes you have ot and other times you barely have enough hours to sustain the job. "
good,"Walgreens sales associates may perform a wide variety of duties during a shift. Sales associates at Walgreens assist customers in a variety of departments, including photo development, grocery, pharmacy, and health and beauty sections. Walgreens sales associates may also operate cash registers, stock shelves, and perform cleaning duties while at work. Cleaning performed by sales associates with Walgreens may include light mopping, dusting, and bathroom tidying. Sales associates work with Walgreens managers to keep customers satisfied and ready to return."
good,"The main problem with this company is, in house promotions are almost impossible. They love to hire older workers, and as you should know, they require much more out of the work place and can not get out of their house in poor weather. This is just a very quick review based off of my experience there."
good,"I needed to have knee surgery and during that time the health insurance fought to pay them after all that they terminated me , I lost my job. The positions were very competitive from each employee."
good,"Great job for gaining experience. Also, a job that gives flexible hours especially for students. Ability to move up in this company is not hard once you've learned policies."
good,"Not very friendly store manager/ managers."
good,Walgreens can be great to work for if you are willing to do everything that is asked of you. The company offers a multitude of positions that allow for a large amount of career development in many different areas.
good,"A typical day involves a plethora of things depending on the station you are assigned which can be anywhere as you are trained for everything. That could be standing at the register helping customers or being a floor associate or stocking or even the photo lab. The hardest part of the job was the lack of training. Although I do know that personal training is part of the equation, here it was all of it. If you didn't know something, it was very difficult to motivate others to help you or teach you. Management was not very attentive on the floor preferring to be in the office."
good,Fast pace pharmacy like. Allows you to learn great multi tasking skills. Great benefits are offered to you. Hours can very but management is usually good working with you.
good,"Hire up manager is new and will take time too get used to. The environment is great since in Downtown Boston, get to meet a lot of tourist and get to see the night life in Boston. Hours depend on employee but flexible."
good,Exciting company but weak management at the store level. Extremely busy and fast paced work environment with very energetic and passionate coworkers. I learned a lot the most being how to handle difficult situations while working at extremely high pressure. Management at the store level is somewhat weak and I don't like the way sensitive issues are being managed. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping those patients who are really in need of urgent help.
good,"Great place to work , difficult to provided one on one customer service because it is also a store that is not specifically geared to beauty, but also sells food, beverages"
good,Helped patrons in and out or the store without any problems. Kept front end nice and neat for everyone could have a good first impression on the store. Greeted everyone as they came and and out of the store.
good,I  wouldn't want my experience at Walgreens hinder someone from applying here. I think I had a bad experience solely based on this specific Walgreens and where it was located. Management didn't care about employees and most of the customer were very disrespectful. I do appreciate that I received great experience at the pharmacy and the pharmacist was very knowledgable and friendly.
good,"It's hard working in a place where there isn't enough hours for everyone,  but there are managers taking up company time playing games on their phone during company hours. Open door policy is awful too."
good,Stressful days in the pharmacy with very few breaks/lunches.  Great time getting to know the customers and understanding their needs.  Feels great to help people get better.  You learn alot
good,"its a nice job, no raises but nice; since becoming walgreens a lot has changed in the work; lots of lay offs and new management of how things are being processed now"
good,"Average work place. Strange guidelines and not very good health insurance. Everything is operated by computers. You don't get to have a personal relationship with your boss, no personality."
good,"Management is horrible - do not know how to separate outside, personal feelings from being professional in the work environment."
good,I enjoy the people and customers I incounter everyday. There is always something to do or someone to help. I have learned most positions in the store and find them all intresting.
good,A typical day at work was pretty laid back as long as you completed assigned tasks and assisted customers. I  learned excellent customer service skills. The management was nice along with the co workers. The hardest part of the job was the fact that it was in a bad area and I didn't always feel safe.
good,"A typical  day at work was always challenging and there was always new things to learn. I learned how to suggestive sell and rotate stock, as well as markdowns and promotional adds. Management was definitely a struggle to get along with. There was little to no communication and very little team work between them all. The hardest part of my job was most likely trying to make the cosmetics sales goal of the day even if it was slow that day. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and helping my customers walk out with  a smile as well as the family orientated atmosphere between me and a few co-workers."
good,"Everyone contributed the same, roles would change on a daily basis regardless of title... it was difficult to take pride in one's work as projects were handed off mid-completion."
good,The best about working at Walgreens is the customers. They loves sales and smiles. Its like building your own clientele. And you become really close. If you like people that is. As for co-workers and team leaders you do become a strong team and family.
good,"I really enjoyed working at walgreens, I felt I was able to make a difference with everyone I came into contact with.  I love to help customers! The people I worked with were more like family than just co-workers."
good,"Worked 70 + hours in one week. Work a week then have a week off. Loved all the customers. Had a lot of issues with some co-workers. The hardest part of my job was working so many hours in a week. I learned numerous things while employed at walgreens, such as learnng how to run photo lab."
good,I had no issues with working at Walgreens except the fact that the management hired people that he liked and then would favor those employees but forget about the employees that actually worked for him or been there long. There are days I would work a split shift to get coverage for the store so it was not the cashier and management for the evening. The thing about working at Walgreens is that I was always was learning something new in the store to do my job better or to see about going up in the store.
good,"Good training"
good,"I worked a retail position. People say customers are the worst part of retail, given that the area is very good. I've never been one who has big problems with customers. My main problem was advancement: I had nowhere to go, if I try my best I am a service clerk, so its a good job to get your feet wet with working, but not a good job for a meaningful career with the skills I have. (I am more of a technical guy so my technical side never gets a chance to shine when there's no software to develop.)"
good,Walgreens is a good starting job entry level. Management needs a lot of improvement.
good,"Being a intern here at Walgreens was pleasing, it was easy and lots of customers to greet. They also had me organizing there stock room, filling in empty spaces on the shelf, and taking care of whatever a customer needed. The co-workers were extremely nice, I love them all. Everyone here was always working hard at their job and always appreciate the help as I floated around the store. I enjoyed interning with all the co-workers here!!"
good,this is a typical retail job.  no opportunity for advancement.  The job was fun and most of the customers were awesome
good,"Walgreens is a good place to work and get experience, but they do not value they're employees. Walgreens teaches you to have patience and to work well to others.  The part is your co-workers because they all help each other out.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the customers when we don't have a product instock and they become argumentative."
good,"Typical day at this job was picking products from the warehouse to complete orders for individual stores."
good,my time there was well spent and do not regret the experience learned alot.
good,"I enjoyed my co-workers, the management team was a little hard to deal with. We filled close to 700 prescriptions on a daily basis and at times did not get your breaks or lunch. This was my first experience working in a pharmacy and the individual that was showing me how the pharmacy ran, did an excellent job."
good,"Every day at work is a different day, from punch-in to punch-out. Daily changes include staff, policies, procedures, and patients. I try to learn something new on a daily basis that I can pass on to fellow co-workers. Having been at the same location for as long as I have, I am on a first name basis with the majority of our patients- I have literally watched their children go off to college and Grandparents become Great-Grandparents. I absolutely love my patients and co-workers. The most difficult part of my position is the work/life balance I can't seem to find."
good,-developed film for some interesting poeple
good,"greeting customers and promoting products. i've learned alot of overall qualities customer service,resets/revisions and balanced currency, cash and checks in cash drawer at end of each shift.fr"
good,"Good job for teenagers' first jobs, part time. Does not pay well, but gives good experience. Run the cash register, restock shelves, and other basic retail activities."
good,"Careful if you are a floating pharmacist. They do not guarantee the hours, and you may have to drive way too far to work. The twelve hour shift has been replaced with an eight hour shift."
good,"Loved my position and what i was supposed to be doing but was never given the opportunity to do my actual job description. Was told that there wasn't time for me to train and do what i was supposed to, so they only let the senior techs fill my role and kept me at cashing out prescriptions instead."
good,"Management was terrible. Too much favoritism."
good,We don’t live in a very large town so patient/pharmacy relationship is very sound patients trust us and are able to speak with us one on one if needed with anything they may need from a new prescription to over the counter drugs
good,"A typical day at work would consist of greeting customers upon entry, asking customers if they need assistance. Working the front end and all other departments in rotation depending on the staffing. Assisting in shipment of products. Maintaining inventory and completing store resets. Hardest part of the job is working with limited staff. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you get to help to open a new store (which is rare but very fun)."
good,must be able to work under pressure and in a  fast paced environment or not stress easily or else it will be very difficult. being able to handle multiple tasks at once and be able to focus on attention to detail with prescriptions coming in while helping customers and answering phone calls
good,Walgreens is fun to work at. I get to meet new people and interact with coworkers. Sometimes the hours aren’t enough for the Walgreens I am at therefore it’s hard to stay somewhere where I am unable to get the money I need
good,"I liked working there. it was a great summer job. I was working there full-time and the pay was good. I learned a lot at Walgreens, such as how to deal with customers."
good,"The interview process was very easy. Once the drug test and background check go through, your first day is mostly all training on the computer and then on a computer. The days are easy at Walgreens. Each day of the week is scheduled where you know for the most part what you are going to be doing. Depends on the management how you will like working there."
good,Walgreens had a fantastic middle level management team who kept a positive working environment.  however large call centers more gossip.  Jealousy over in house promotions drove down moral.
good,"This job is moreso for the people who feel that they might enjoy working in retail for a very long duration because if you are not willing to work long term and extremely flexible hours, then expect to get no shifts because to work at Walgreens comstantly, your availability has to be absurd"
good,"the location i was at was busy as heck, but not too busy to where i did not pick up information. a great pharmacy for customers and employees. they like their set team though."
good,"I start my day with preparing the classroom for the new hire training. I mean I put the agenda on the white board of the materials we will be covering that day. I instruct the class for 8 hours, check for understanding,  I fill out daily reports for my training class attendance, computer issues, time card issue for the class."
good,Walgreen's was a wonderful company to work for at one point.  It just got the point where it was sucking the happy out of me.  Definitely not a great place to be if your management cannot hear a word you say.
good,"We always had sothing to do. There wasnt an moment were there was free time. We as employees made the the job fun and with team work. Quick pace, alot of remodeling and restocking."
good,Walgreens once really cared about their employees on a corporate level. Not any more. They are losing their best workers at an alarming rate due to poor management and antiquated policies.
good,"A typical day at work consists of either working a cash register, the photo counter, beauty department, or putting away stock on the floor. There is always work to be done, and there tends to not be enough time in between customers to complete all delegated work."
good,An easy job to do but can get stressful at times. Management was not great; favoritism held them back from taking disciplinary action towards certain employees. Most enjoyable part of the job was talking with nice customers.
good,Working at Walgreens heloed me learn how to work well with a team of associates and serve customers at the point of sale as well as on the sales floor.
good,"start out with checking for deliveries, handle customers, drive to different and multiple health care facilities to fill prescriptions for discharging patients. followed by filling prescriptions through insurance and delivering in a timely manor"
good,You never knew what was expected each day of you. There was a great deal of favoritism from management. Though occasionally your personal circumstances would be taken into account in general you had to figure it out yourself if it would affect your schedule. The hours varied so much you could not plan anything and often cant see your family. Management does not back up their employees even with the worst customers. There was no promise of how many hours you would get each week. You could work full time one week and only have ten the next.
good,The rude customers are what makes Walgreens difficult to work at. The management were not as strict as they should have been on other workers. Workers got away with many different things.
good,"Very fast paced in the pharmacy. Things constantly go wrong, customers are unhappy due to wait times. Not enough people working during the day making it stressful and having to do a lot of work."
good,Working here was a great experience learning how to work around the Kiva system robots. I would recommend this company to anybody who is interested in getting experienced with robots and package handling.
good,"The management staff at my Walgreens, could be better. It’s a lot of petty things that they do the CSA’s and a lot of unfair treatment going on plus they play  favorites. It’s not really  a friendly or comfortable working environment. But the overall company is a great place to work, with a lot of great benefits and perks."
good,With hours being reduced it made home life difficult to balance. I was hired full time but was receiving part time hours because of the budget cuts. Unfortunately I had to resign because my hours weren't helping sustain a balanced home life.
good,"this was a good working environment.  Need to employee more on the floor and less assistant managers. "
good,"Typical: day at work, clock in, do the work, clock out"
good,"I worked for a Walgreens in my hometown for over half a year and it was the best work experience I ever had. I felt appreciated and included and my coworkers quickly became like family to me. When I had to transfer to a different store in a different state, I didn't imagine I would have as many problems as I did when I started working for the new store. Boy was I wrong. For another 7 months, I constantly struggled with scheduling mishaps and just overall a terribly degrading experience."
good,Working at Walgreens requires a person how is willing eat sleep Walgreens. Fast pace atmosphere with lot of work. One must be a multi-tasker for raises and promotions are based performance/
good,"Hardest Part Of The Job Is Nights & Coming In & Putting Up With The BS .. Its Always Something Happening With The Belts Breaking ,, The Equipments Old & Staffing Is Low .. Management Is Terrible"
good,"Walgreens is not for everyone, you depending on your initial position thy may not move you even if you don't like where you are at. Be careful, it is not an easy one"
good,"I would usually help the customers at check-out, stock the shelves, and keep the counters clean and uncluttered. Brought in buggies and took out the trash."
good,The staff is wonderful. Most of the managers I've worked with were very good. The company is changing and most employees feel that it's not for the best.
good,"I had no real problems just didn't like the way they set up my work hours. "
good,"Very limited chance for advancement. Management was not organized and there was no communication between shifts. Very demanding. Many very rude customers and scammers trying to pass fake bills.Most customers however, were very nice people. I was laid off due to store no longer being open 24 hours. I miss working with the public very much."
good,"Working at  Walgreens has its fast paced moments where everything seems to be happing at once and times when the store is practically deserted. Working the cash register and also being responsible for straightening out the shelves and filling the beverage coolers all at the same time was hectic and couldn't be completed efficiently."
good,"Working at this store was challenging because files were not standardized as they are across the Walgreens Co.  Lots of turnover, both in pharmacy and up front"
good,They need to make sure everyone knows how to work on the same page. Management isn't very concerned with how they are running their business. Meet lots sweet patients.
good,Walgreens is a very busy place to work on some days and some days it is very relaxed to work at. The manager is very demanding but fair. Overall. I would recommend someone to work there.
good,"Worked in cosmetics department, inventory, made sure all isles were neat, collected payment, rang clients items up in a timely manner, other miscellaneous duties"
good,Everyone I work with is amazing. They are great people that deserve a lot. But this company hasn't taken me very far. Even after 6 years of being there I haven't been able to achieve what I wanted to with the company. I've tried very hard and was patient but kept getting put in the corner. I have potiental extreme potential. But I can't show it there.
good,"the company used to be great.  However since the merger with Alliance Boots, it seems that the employee welfare is now of little concern.  Not at the store level, but from the company and upper management"
good,great place to work just the pay is not enough as a manager. Some areas do not have security or any means to help team members. so the job security is extremely low.
good,managers are always watching you and waiting for you to tell customers certain things. People always called in as well so if you are a good worker you are always getting called in.
good,"I had some good managers and I had some bad ones. They never seemed to keep the same manager at the same store for very long.They had good benefits when I worked there. Low pay, you wouldn't be able to afford a place to live on your own. I liked my co-workers and still talk to them. It just really depends on your manager. A good manager can turn a bad job into a fun one, a bad manager can ruin a good job. the district manager was the worst, thank god he didn't come in all that often!"
good,"Customer service based company with a fast paced environment, but cuts hours in the summer with almost the same workload. Decent benefits. You have to have a backbone to work in the pharmacy or you won't last."
good,"Walgreens is a nice place to work if you don't have kids and have open availability, once I changed my availability my hour were cut and I couldn't survive"
good,"Loved the customers that came in all the time. Had problems with one assistant manager that didn't want to put me out of the sales floor or anywhere else. Was stuck in one area of the store for over a year. Didn't care for the favoritism that was going on, employees that should have been fired for mistreating customers got a slap on the hand over and over again."
good,There was never a hard day when you love & enjoy what you do. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that every patient that I helped always left satisfied & pleased.
good,"DMs care only about looking good on paper. They ""round"" on their stores, but couldn't give two pieces of toilet paper stuck together with number 2 about the actual daily lives of their employees."
good,The job was cool just the store manager was unbearable she was the type you make you stock shelves that were already falling over. She made personal calls at the photo area but would say something about employee phones.
good,"Very Ad-hoc software development and integration process."
good,This is a great place to get experience.  It is a stressful fast paced and busy environment and each day has its challenges.  Store manager is fair.  The amount of knowledge you learn can prepare you for future jobs.
good,"stock shelves , clean and mop store , unload stock truck , assists elderly to there car . available to pick up an extra shift when someone calls out. hardest part about the job is dealing with rude customers a few times out the week but im able to manage ."
good,"This was a humbling and ever learning experience. Working next to a pharmacist is very intense but when you leave at the end of the day, with your feet hurting from standing and your eyes throbbing from counting pills, it is very rewarding. You feel good going home knowing that maybe, you could have played a small role in helping a stranger feel better."
good,A nice kind of family environment.... Fast pace working pharmacy. I liked it because i like to multitasking. You learn about a lot of different medications.
good,Walgreens was very calm with a slow pace. You were allowed at least one break per shift and were able to work in different areas of the store if desired. Management was less than desirable but not terrible. The most enjoyable aspect was working the register and the least enjoyable would be stocking. Overall it was a good starting job.
good,The job was one that I enjoyed. The people were nice and the managers were good to the employees. The hardest part about the job was the system and network issues that negatively affected production.
good,The pharmacy is really the bread and butter and brings the repeat business coming back. it can be quite hectic and if someone is not able to multitask they will slow down the production of the team.
good,"typical retail job but with added stress of constant phone calls, agitated customers and working against a deadline to fill medications on time. Best part of my day is when I can get to help a patient."
good,"I worked in the pharmacy for three years. I input prescriptions, billed insurances, call for verification on insurances, filled prescriptions and customer care. The whole department including myself was responsible for inventory, deletes, billing, patients information updates, confidentiality,  and all services related to the specific job. I ran the photo department which also included the grocery area. I was responsible for ordering food, stocking shelves, and making sure to have products on hand for customers. I also was to order chemical supplies and photo supplies to ensure production for the department. In addition to inventory and services I was responsible for the maintenance an upkeep of our processing an printing machines. Weekly cleaning and monthly chemical changes in order to keep the department in production."
good,The job itself was a learning curve. But the general staff held and is amazing. The site manager however well stab you in the back with a smile.
good,"A great opportunities for growth within the company "
good,"Enjoyed being able to help people as a part of my day, but the store I was positioned in was poorly managed. My co-workers showed poor teamwork and time management skils"
good,"Upper management not willing to act on the concerns of other employees made for a drama filled, stressful place to work."
good,"With the changing healthcare system, is can be difficult to serve patients with the care and attention that I was able to give them as a locally owned pharmacy."
good,I wish Walgreens paid their technicians more.  The requirements of the position do not reflect in wages paid and there is limited amount of advancement within the company
good,"Each day has about the same qualities to it- I do my inventory management, temperature checks, and any other morning tasks given to me by management. Then my day is usually filled with helping the pharmacy when needed while balancing the front of stores breaks, my own breaks, and restocking the shelves. I also have to complete any other tasks given to me by management, and tri-hourly temperature checks. I also manage photo and making sure that the orders are all complete as well as assist customers in the store, pharmacy, up front and in photo as needed. Overall I have learned how to multi task to the extreme as well as making sure to hand out surveys (the basis of which we are judged upon). They have installed a program where they enforce us to hand out stickers with our names on them; it started with only a few but we are now required to hand out 9 this month, and next month 12 stickers. My coworkers are ""ok"", however many do not treat the customers with a lot of respect. I get along with everyone just fine but would most likely not hangout with them outside of work. The hardest part of the job is the job itself. I am expected to almost be a manager in the sense of all the tasks I must complete daily, as well as anything else that everyone else needs, minus the pay benefit. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers. I love helping people and knowing that I made positive difference in their day."
good,This company has been a really great company to work. If you are looking for a good little part time job definitely try walgreens.
good,"They did provide the best training that i ever got but that is it. the Walgreen that i worked at was in a bad location in town so the job security was due to that, the management did care somewhat but they expected you to be at work even if there is a family emergency going on they just did not care"
good,This job served me well for a first job. It eased me into the work lifestyle and taught me customer service skills. The only downside to this job was that they were not willing to work with my college school schedule. Other than that this was a good job.
good,I would work 40 hours one week and 12 the next. This was frustrating and affected my work ethic. I liked the annual evaluations because that allowed room for me to grow as an employee
good,"long hours"
good,"I was at walgreens for 4 years and had some of the best and worst times. The raises are very little and expect to work hard while others slack off. When truck comes in you are doing 3 people's jobs. Also, the cosmetic area is very stressful because of the quotas they require for sales in cosmetics. You pretty much have to harass people to buy certain products and check out at your register. Still, with good co-workers Walgreens is a good job."
good,"Overnights are slow and pretty boring. Easy work, good if you have homework to do. Nice working 7 on/ 7 off. Not a lot to do on overnights. Sometimes stocking, but usually not."
good,"The pharmacy was absolutely wonderful as a whole and yes there are plenty of stressful situations but either you adapt and move on or you get left behind and do not belong in that environment. If you do what your taught to do and ask questions until you feel comfortable, there will be no problems. Your not going to get along with everybody, which is fine."
good,"*Depending on the position held at the company a typical work day would range from traveling from store to store doing over-site, training team members, filling 800+ prescriptions a day, maintaining profits through inventory, and insurance chargebacks."
good,filling and verifying. helping customers find otc products. counseling patients on medication side effects
good,very well structured and understanding.i have learned alot from this job and i have grown from it
good,"A typical day at work starts off by turning machines on, then I process photo orders developed overnight. I learned how to use the equipment, teamwork and cash handling. Management was not the best, but I made the best out of it. My co-workers were the best! They were like family to me. The hardest part of the job is when you get multiple tasks thrown at you and not having sufficient time. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers and getting to know them."
good,Co-workers are great. I learned a lot. A typical work day working with customers and filling rx.
good,"Typical day at work included warehouse; stocking; register; camera department; pharmacy tech; and closing.  "
good,"Maintained and organized sections of the pharmacy with extreme intricacy and detail. Communicated effectively both verbally and written with consumers and supervisors. Collaborated with co-workers to solve in store problems; such as, inventory, profits, training and incoming items to stock."
good,"Honestly, the Walgreens I work for is pretty relaxing and fun. The co-workers and some of the supervisors/managers make it tolerable. The wage no one can survive off and  is not worth the demands that we are faced with everyday - management can be unappreciative of our hard work sometimes."
good,Whatever your shift may be always be prepared to see about 100 different faces.
good,A typical day at work was great you came in and did all the work all the pharmacist had to do was check the work. What I have learned at Walgreen's is how to connect with people.Management sucked they gossiped a little to much for me. My co workers was the best they were friendly and made me feel like we were a family. The hardest part of my Job was when we got robbed I couldn't focus but I also did not receive a day off or even a call from the district manager.The most enjoyable part of my job was my customers I got to know them by name. After all its a great company to learn from but if they could control management their ratings would soar higher.
good,I worked there for about a year half in Albuquerque and half in Santa Fe it was a good learning experience for me. It really just depends on who your manager is.
good,"Very nice landscape, fun co-workers. Nice place to work as far as the work that needed to be done."
good,"Company use to care about their employees, now its just about the mighty dollar. Worked wih some great people through. I did however have a boss who really cared about his staff and our development. He wanted to see all of us do well. Hardest part of the job is working a rotation that included overnights and working long hours. My paycheck and my co workers were the most enjoyable part of the job"
good,ok place to work until growth stop and eventual downsizing.
good,"wow....long days learn patients working for this company"
good,"A typical work day at Walgreens consist of opening the store, counting the safe, give cashiers enough funds to operate their registers, check emails, check for price changes, and complete a daily store walk and take store notes, which will be delegated later amongst my employees."
good,"Learned facing products, setting up displays, and just over all what gets done in a retail job. Good people to work with but the hardest thing is being under staffed. Our customers are the best part"
good,"This job was great at first but then there were a lot of changes in management and problems with other employees. Other employees not wanting to do their job. There was a lot of favoritism. I mostly enjoyed helping the customers, and going on my lunch break. It wasn't a high paying job but it was something to get me by and take care of my family."
good,"This company was an excellent one to work for. The new CEO has made changes, especially with compensation. As with most companies, they want you to do more with less."
good,"A typical day at work was like even if there is a big storm and you reach at work 10 minutes late ,you get written up."
good,Reason why manager was never there to help did not give me my job back after i left out of state to bury my father.
good,"This location in particular was a nice place to work, the staff is very pleasant and helpful to new employees as far as teaching them how things work. On an average day I would cashier for the majority of the time while also maintaining a clean front of store, if it was a slow day then I'd help put things up on the shelves from the latest truck. I learned the new sales system and a lot about the products Walgreen sells. The hardest part of my job was some times dealing with difficult patrons. But at the same time developing a friendship with the regular customers was the best part."
good,"I worked with Walgreens for almost 8 years. But, I'm really trying to look for employment in Northern,MN. Financially it's hard for me to make it tin the Twin Cities area. Nothing against Walgreens, but i need a balance between work and my personal life."
good,"i was at walgreens in fresno for 3 years before i transfered to bakersfield things were good in fresno i was very close with many customers they would share there storys and they knew some how always when i was not in the best of mood they knew when something was bothering me was like having friends that came in once in a while and i was able to make them happy. co-workers were some of the best people i could ever have worked with they were caring and suportive to eachother in the store we were like family working together. managers were great too they took the time to know who you were as a person. hardest part about there was leaveing when i desided to move to bakersfield and transfer,"
good,It's nice and pleasant place to work. If you want to be pharmacist it a good place to intern.
good,"My typical work day is busy with consitant calls from customers. At times, the calls were slow, but very seldom. I have learned not to take the issues of upset customers person because they are always seeking help. My co-workers were a great set of people to work with and always willing to help each other. The most enjoyable part of my job was resetting the customer's passwords, calls were always short and nice."
good,working for walgreens has broaden my mind in business... i truely enjoyed working with this company for the knowledged that i recieved and for the challenging experienced in customer service merchandising managing prices inventory...
good,"I have been  working in this company for 15 months and yes i have learned so much but the communication skills and courtesy in this store  is very poor when it comes to the company,managers and  some coworkers I  guess it can be cause we transition a few months ago or maybe is the area i work in but it can be BETTER....."
good,"Walgreens was a great place to work in the past. Now It has gotten horrible to the employees. They will work you full-time, but refused to give you PTO or benefits of full-time employees. I have had the pharmacist disappear several times and leave me and other techs in the pharmacy alone for hours. The standard of Walgreens has fallen greatly. A good thing about Walgreens is that you must really do something horrible to get fired. I have seen many girls go smoke in there car for an hour on the clock and not even get a slap on the wrist."
good,Good starter job to gain work experience and learning customer service. Also good for learning how business works. Great for starting out and gaining work experience. Work life balance can be difficult and highly depends on luck. Depending on the needs of the business you can be working any type of shift so do not expect to always be able to go see friends and family to attend special functions
good,"A typical day at Walgreens is contacting doctors to clarify prescriptions, taking in scripts at the drive-thru and drop off window, and contacting insurance companies to clarify which drug is covered."
good,"Job required lots of hard unrealistic hours , you’re expected to work when they call you in on a day off with out any problem! They will threaten your job for no reason."
good,Working here has been great up until recently. We are not compensated for or valued as managers for having extra responsibility. Our bonuses have been removed and we as pharmacists have not been allowed a raise in 3 years.
good,"Between the changing landscape of brink and mortal retail and long days without much time off, I would not recommend working for Walgreens as a store manager."
good,Its retail what else can you expect from a large chain store. My particular store staff is great. I wouldn't want to work anywhere else. They make me feel like I'm part of the team
good,"I liked working at my local Rite Aid (owned by Walgreens - plus we had a Walgreens Pharmacy) but, the management for my store was toxic, and never really understanding of me needing to take time off work.  Mind you I was still in high school while working at Rite Aid, and had school events to attend to, which most of the time I had to skip to work.  "
good,"Flexible schedule, room for growth. Management changes often due to advancement and each one runs the store as they want, some good some not so good. Pay increases are based on a 1-5 evaluations yearly or promotions only."
good,"It's a good company to work for, just hard to move up. I started off as just a cashier, they moved me around alot which I am completely ok with, I got motivated to move up and show I can work in any dept. I obtained a liquor license and a temp pharmacy tech license  but never once got even a .5 cent raise."
good,"As a Designated Hitter I got to work in both the pharmacy and the front end. The pharmacy can be more fast passed and stressful at times, but overall it is a good place to work."
good,"Good job , didn’t like the fact that I was promoted to a lot of different things while working for the company. After 3 years they fired me ! In loyal"
good,"Slow paced but good place to work. Friendly, quiet environment. Minimal hours available. Not open overnight. A good part time, to make extra money, job."
good,"I was an unpaid extern at Walgreens as a part of my degree program to complete my Associate Degree, I was able to learn how a retail pharmacy works. It was a very interesting experience for me."
good,A day at work at Walgreens as a CSA is going to involve working all departments and being flexible if you're on top of things. Recommend learning how the business works as fast as possible and proving it to management to be promoted to shift lead.
good,"Walgreens is an excellent way to gain experience in customer service and time management. They are willing to work the schedule with students although some stores are not willing to let you study/complete homework during anytime except break. For college students who have a lot of work to do, this can be rough. It will keep you busy with tasks such as cleaning and stocking, but requires a great deal of multitasking as you are still required to assist customers. The team work varies depending on the personality of your coworkers. DO NOT be afraid to ask questions. As a starter or in-between job it is exceptionally fair. However, if you do not do well with people I suggest doing as many years as you can handle and then use what you learned there to find something else."
good,"Fast paced, challenging, requires 100% focus, will meet all kinds of ppl. I think bottom line is if you have a good manger who acknowledges your efforts and is fair to you , you would be v satisfied. Not the best place for work-life balance though"
good,"Favoritisms"
good,I love my coworkers but Walgreens is starting to cut hours and pay.  I sometimes fear for my profession.  It is still a great place to work currently.
good,We working extra hard. More work for us. I’m taking for my others partners no only me.i feel my health is affected because I’m working to much and I’m under a lot stressed. We just need help. Thanks
good,Good place to work but not worth the minimum wage because managers (depending at the walgreens you work for) would ask for more that what you expect when you get hired.
good,"This was my first real job and it was really a perfect fit for someone just starting out. I wasn't at all comfortable working in customer service beforehand, but the clientele was lax enough to not mind my inexperience. Typical work day would see you either solely on the register, or working in photo while stocking shelves during downtime. During warehouse (days when truck shipments would come in), things could get a little hectic, but overall the work environment wasn't too taxing."
good,"Walgreens is a great company to work for, they have great benefits, hours are flexible, you have job placement and transferable employment. Some employees and managers believe in great customer service."
good,"I would have a stayed. My customers were amazing. However, after being a cashier for three years I wanted to move up in company. Everyone else was moving up the corporate ladder and i wanted to as well but never got the chance."
good,"the management was not very concerned about customer service. the pharmacy manager at my location was very knowledgeable and really cared about her patients, but was so overworked not every patient was able to get the best service possible."
good,"A typical day at work would be filling prescriptions, answering phone calls and assisting the pharmacist. I learned a lot about prescription medicine and insurance."
good,Walgreens will help you move up in the company wherever you want to go! I started here when I was 16 and they have always made sure to make me feel like I was an asset to the company
good,They weren't very amazing or anything but did help push you further if you wanted. They didn't give lots of time off. Their pay raises weren't very high. But most people that I worked with were great.
good,The work place is good. Also  the hours a week are great the pay is good for a person who is independent. The management team are not really good they judge you and try to work u harder then u need.
good,"At the beginning of my experience too many people were trying to tell me what to do but not all were on the same page so it was confusing.  "
good,"Very nice environment to work in, friendly co-workers and some manager's, givez you tbe opportunity to travel and expand o your skills. Also allows you to meet productive people within the company of walgreens."
good,"take in coming call, update information,identify hippa guidelines,review and update medication list if need be, change address and schedule shipment dates for medication"
good,Great people and great atmosphere. I had the chance to expand my work experience/ work resume. Was introduce to behind the scenes protocol of a store which I really appreciated.
good,I had this job when in college. I was able to work around my school schedule. I eventually had to leave once I was told I would promote to another area and it passed and the hours became inconsistent. Walgreens also likes to rotate their managers so you can not build a good working relationship for long.
good,"Its was nice! Customers that i mis most of all"
good,it was a great company to do my externship with. i got a chance to work with a variety of great pharmacist. I got the hands on experience i needed to complete my 180 hr externship.
good,"The work environment is ok. The customers range from nice to terrible. The pay is not great, can't sustain a family, but good as an entry-level job. it was a good experience."
good,The store I work at has low ratings. SM and ASM play favorites with certain employees . Not enough employees working we normally recently have an opener with management a mid and a evening shift person with management. Then on certain days the person that closes has to open the next day verses being a mid or closing again.
good,Walgreens is a great place to work as a teenager in high school. I think it's a good place to learn how to interact and communicate with customers. It was a great learning experience for me.
good,"If your passion is customer service than Walgreens is your dream job. The workplace is fun and exciting, yet still remains structured. You meet a lot of new people every day and the help you lend to them is appreciated and leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy inside. Unfortunately, there are still the political drawbacks... like with any workplace."
good,made sure my zone was up at 40% or more a day. keeping the company on quotas they had for their cosmetics. Keeping consumer up with the sales we had going on in the store.
good,"I enjoy working with Walgreens, I have had a few hiccups with my children being sick & I as well. But as far as the manager she is late when it comes to opening the store. I would prefer to work elsewhere with the way I am treated."
good,"My internship was very enjoyable. I learned alot, I learned how to fill medication and how to talk to doctors and customers and what to do when there was a problem. But most of all I learned how to be a pharmacy technician."
good,"at the site I worked at, many of the technicians acted like high schoolers instead of doing their job. They are not very honest about raises either, I was still at my hired rate of pay when I left almost 2 years later."
good,management extremely helpful but a ton of turnover. you can sometimes feel like you are drowning in your workload. they try and do their best but corporate never seems to care about the stores themselves.
good,Great place to work I loved the people and the job it self. I was on time and a determined worker always helped when I can or if another co-worker was in need of help.
good,"I was given multiple opportunities with this company to learn not only how the company functions as a store and a pharmacy, Walgreens also sponsored me so that I was able to get my pharmacy technician certification."
good,"Employee relations really don't do nothing  I was a loyal employee for 22 years came to work on days of my, came into work sick ,up until the new manager pushed me to retire called employee relations  and nothing was done but retaliation  against me"
good,it was a nice place to work  I learned how to handle peoples attitudes management was understanding fun to work there is none unloading the weekly truck
good,My experience as a workplace was enjoyable. The employees were friendly and helpful when training. The clientele was diverse. The store was located in a very busy part of the city so the store was often  filled with customers. The management could have used some help. My impression was they were a little too young.
good,"Walgreens was a slow-paced job that had long hours standing. There were not many employees at a time working, so all housework on shift was divided between only a couple of people. Overall it was a good job."
good,"In all fairness, I worked for Premium Retail Services, who contracted with Walgreens. I enjoyed the work, even though we occasionally put in some gruelingly long days."
good,"In order to move up you have to kiss a lot of butt no matter how good you are, and if you get a new manager chances are you don’t know anything at all according to them, they have a hard time about ppl with kids, they expect the job to come first"
good,"Good entry point to pharmacy field and enable you to get certified at no cost, a good alternative to paying for this or technical school.  Job role is limited and will not have much exposure to preparing medications/packaging unless also work in pharmacy production downstairs. Would not recommend call center positions at this location, higher stress for low pay.  "
good,"Your work place depends on your Store manager. If you have a wonderful SM your will love work, but if you don't everyday will be a 50/50 choose of you walking out the door or not"
good,Walgreens is just fine for people who wants to work temporarily as being promoted doesn't give you better compensation.No pressure and flexible when it comes to schedule.
good,It was a nice job and never had any issues with management or employees. Everyone was nice and manager was very flexible with school hours. Definitely recommend if you need a job and going to school at same time.
good,"Walgreens, was very happy place to work, with room to grow and learn. It had values for the employees that provided the store with customer service. Walgreens CARED !  Then Walgreens, started buying other companies, and GREED, started. The company was open the entire day on Christmas and Thanksgiving. Hours for employees that worked 38 to 39 hours, suddenly were given 30 hours per week."
good,They def need to pay their employees more. Upper management overpaid for the little they do. Upper management always in different training while regular employees are trained once. No room for growth because all management has been in their positions for years.
good,"racism treatment to some of the workers, but it wasent in all the stores!  but I get to hear conversations between store manager and assistant managers while I was working on the next aisle they were saying that they wasn't going to do everything they can to have everybody working on that store they own race.that was the end of it wonderful job because I didn't like it it's too bad that I decide to change the store because it was very far away and end up in that one. But were getting is a good store to work in"
good,"Co-workers are friendly and supportive.  Mostly fun environment, however current management team are not team players and challenging to work with.  Good discounts, great customers."
good,I enjoyed working in a fun pace environment and getting to know the costumers on a personal level. I learned a lot about making different kind of photo products. Towards the end of the job management stated to go down hill with people they hired and it just didn't seem the best fit for me. However I will never forget the experience I gained.
good,"Good place to work, but a big company with lot's of daily task requirements that seem to shift the focus from the reasons you started in that particular field."
good,Overall working here was not bad. You don't get insurance or benefits but if your in school the schedule is flexible to do both. Its a good job got short term.
good,"Management took a fairly easy job and made it more difficult than it has to be. Also, everything is the team members fault no matter what so don't even try to defend yourself."
good,"I enjoyed working with my manager, he was great. company seems to function with a skeleton crew. not enough people hired to make sure each shift is covered"
good,You'll need a good pair of shoes because you're on your feet the whole time. New balance is a pretty good shoe. The good thing about that is that the time goes by pretty fast.
good,It was a nice work atmosphere.. Ienjoyed helping the customers and making new friends. I gave beauty advice and helped customers locate items in the store.
good,"I love my coworkers at Walgreens, they are what gets me through some of the stressful times. It's not always fun though especially when hours are cut randomly and can never have a consistent work schedule."
good,Nice place to work but the hours are kind of crazy.  I liked the people I worked with we all seemed to get along.  Slow times I needed more to do but I had to keep the register in view.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to provide great customer service and filling prescriptions in a timely manner. I also enjoyed training new employees so that we can work as a team.
good,"My management was very laid back, easy going, and were real nice people and always willing to work with my schedule. As long as you did what you were supposed to there's no problems. About my only complaint was having a SFL who felt she was god's gift to the world, always complaining, always making me do all the work while she lets the other CSAs do nothing, and always making me pick up after her mistakes. But other than her, I liked the rest of the managers and we even got along as friends."
good,"Young staff, organized store, relaxed place to work, nice manager, fair schedule, some late nights, position not clear at times and there was favoritism."
good,good for part time and not to continue with as a life learning job. its stressful and very busy it was very hard to take a break. one thing I really enjoyed is that management worked very well with you.
good,"Lots of phone work"
good,"I enjoyed working there for the most past because I got along with everyon that worked there well other than the management. They expect the employees to do all of the work, but then take credit for it themselves. I would stay and continue working there if need be, but the pay isn’t enough and they don’t allow enough hours to pay all of my bills"
good,"Walgreens is a pretty good company to work for. I would definitely recommend it to others. The work pace is a little slow on some days, but it comes and goes."
good,I enjoyed my time working here but when I took over night crew and was unable to get off it wreaks havoc on you as a person. That being said good benefits and lots of fun
good,"Working at walgreens Taught me many things.Top me excellent customer service , how to multitask keep a balance when work pace speeds up. It also tought me that team work anything can be achieved. To never give up even if confused always ask, better to ask and do better , then stay quiet and keep doing it wrong."
good,"what I learned from working at Walgreens is how to use a register.Management was alright, 2/5 managers would help us out on our task, the others would do their own things. The enjoyable moments I would have are working with my favorite coworkers, it was only about 3 people.Also having conversations with my regular customers, they make my shift go by fast. Hard part working there is dealing with rude customers, coupons, shoplifters,and bear runs."
good,"The pay definitely was not much of anything, however, anyone who is customer service oriented and enjoys people and assisting Walgreen's could make for a very fun job."
good,"Loved how fast paced this job was and how structured it was, you knew exactly what you would be doing every day when you went in. Unfortunately company policies don't allow for overtime and being understaffed you almost always needed to work over. That being the case, as a pharmacy tech you typically were during the job of 5 people."
good,"I was hired to open and staff this location and that is what I did.  I had no idea that it would be a 12 year run!  I trained upper management, did payroll, made schedules did alot of things!  "
good,Overall my experience working with Walgreen's has been positive. I have leaned a lot and made lifelong friends. The company currently lacks room for growth and improvement in my current position.
good,"Transcribing medicine, getting it ready for the patient. Providing customer service to the patient and ringing them out. Making sure to keep up with fast pace environment."
good,The only downside is the distance. 62 miles round trip! I have two kids and it's difficult to spend a lot of time with them when I spend so much time driving back and forth.
good,The work wasn't Hard at all.. Lifting packages mostly was the only thing I really had to do. But I also had to organize certain things in specific places.
good,Fast pasted stocking the shelves with new by putting the new to the back  great  management friendly and easy going I didn't find any part of the job hard to do Waiting on the customer.
good,"No longer promoting from within, work all holidays. Not enough paid time off.  Not enough benefits. Unwilling to be flexible with school schedule. No structure within management."
good,I worked with an amazing crew of people who were very supportive and fun people to work with. Management was also the same way but with scheduling and using the system to schedule days off communication became an issue.
good,"Good place to work, nice benefits and the discount was always very handy. I worked in most every possible part of the store from the front counter to photo, cosmetics, pharmacy, and stocking/inventory. The work was fairly easy as in straight forward. Once I was pharmacy trained and had worked at all the other positions in the store there was little room for advancement without going into management. I also was not impressed with the pharmacy manager I had to work with and in the end my feelings of her being very 'clicky' and playing favorites among the employees was one of the main reasons i sought employment elsewhere."
good,"Never work here again or even buy a water, end my position just too not give me any more money, you actually wanted to tell me to take almost 2 dollars less. not a good company at all."
good,Busy most of the time. Most of management was great and easy to get along with the hardest part was when it came to scheduling because it as hard to have a personal life when the schedule was constantly getting changed
good,"Good place to work at but customers can give you a hard day. All coworkers are friendly. Although it's a good place where to work at, there are too many people coming into store to steal."
good,Good place but not the type of job to advance you. It wasn't a bad environment they have your back. Just doesn't bring in enough income but not a bad start
good,It was okay.  You don't have to take call.  You are paid hourly.  You work your shift and go home.  No real opportunities to advance.  They are selling clinics to surrounding healthcare systems.
good,It worked with my college classes. The people was nice to be around. It was well balanced between fast paced and slow paced. Over all very good experience.
good,My typical day would be where I receive a bunch of request for repairs from centrally located. The hardest part to me is when I have job request from stores in upper Westchester and lower Manhattan and both places are flagged as emergency. I want to complete both jobs as soon as possible but it is not always possible due to the long commute between both places.
good,"Walgreens is a good company. I say it is hit or miss because some of the managers will screw you over, mess up your advancement opportunities, and throw you under the bus. It all depends on who you work with."
good,The problems with the workplace culture are not about the company or the team.  It is with the management.  There are not enough clearcut expectations.  The rules don't apply to everyone but are pulled out to use as weapons against anyone who has dared to voice concerns about management issues. I loved my job but then got the rug pulled out from under me.
good,"working at walgreens is a task. You have to be nice an understanding of the custmers. help them find what there looking for.  you need to smile an say nice thing to them . make sure you are on top your game. Be a team worker. stay on task , an learn as mush as you can."
good,Supervise day to day operations of the company.  Did not enjoy much the atmosphere and the work relations of employees in the company although challenging working with new people most of the time.
good,It really depends on what district and even more what store you work at really. Every store is different based on the store managers way of running things.
good,"In general good benefits, they provide also all studie guides for becoming a pharmacy tech and send you to classes to properly study for the license test. They reimburse the cost to licensing if you pass.  If your a good responsable worker, come to work on schedule days, a fast pace and I can do attitude and apply your self in learning the day to day of run of the store promoting is at your reach, all the way to running your on store."
good,It was an ok job. I called off for a week so I could do this project that was more than 50% of my grade...yet they still scheduled me for that week. Then fired me cuz they scheduled me when I said I needed it off.
good,I worked there for 6 years When I was in the hospital to many times I was fired. No paid time if you need to go to jury duty. You get to meet alot of different people.
good,Walgreens is very neat and organized. I feel better working in a clean environment and it makes me feel like I have a more positive aura while working.
good,"For about 2 years Ive been with the company its has its pro and cons."
good,I've been with Walgreens for almost 29 years and have worked in various departments.  Most of them have been clerical and customer service.  I like my job it's rewarding and I focus on my daily tasks plus more that gets handed to me by upper management.
good,"Management works well with new employees"
good,My manager was from the military and ran the store like he was still there. He was horrible and that's why I left. I was told that I was hired because I was pretty and he liked my name but because he thought I could do the job. He shouldn't be allowed to be a manager.
good,"Overall, I liked the job and the experience. However, I was promised school comes first and a set number of hours each week and it was not followed. I fell behind in school because my hours increased and my managers did not care. I had to quit because it got so bad."
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced and customer oriented."
good,"I learned to work physically fast in a safe manner.  I learned how to take a job and make it my own, but the culture got out of hand. The culture was the hardest thing to adapt to."
good,I left Walgreens for what I thought was a better opportunity. The grass is not always greener. Rotations were expected. No one got stuck into doing the same job all day. Holidays and birthdays were recognized. Patients and employees were respected. The pay could have been better but this area of the country doesn't pay well overall.
good,A typical day at work would be to come in and assist patients with prescriptions and process photos. I also worked in the Cosmetics department and handled money transactions. I learned a lot from this job but it was very hard trying to move up when the positions were always crowded. There was nothing hard about this job and the most enjoyable part was helping my customers.
good,"Day at work was great. Loved the different people who came in daily."
good,When working mornings it was always better for me because I was able to get a handle on things. Starting the day in the afternoon was always a challenge because I always had to fix others mistakes or was being blamed for things by customers. Overall it was a very great start as far as learning the roles and responsibilities of a pharmacy technician.
good,"sitting at a cubical all day taking calls for prescription orders, some calls are fun, some not so fun, there are those that consist of angry people that tend to say mean things at you, but just have to remember that they are just trying to get there meds. I enjoyed calls to the pharmacists they were generally helpful and talkative which made for a nice break in the day. This job is stressful on certain levels such as note taking and calls are timed and listened on,"
good,"Daily tasks such has dealing with customers in person and one the phone, at the same time, having to multitask everyday. Always having a smile on your face, promoting the sales. Always doing your duties of that day."
good,"Working at Walgreens ultimately was a pleasure. I really enjoyed the face to face interaction with the customers. There was always something new to learn. With so many products we had to keep up with new sales requirements and pitches, the displays and also sales prices. We also did a lot of on site advertisement. The only thing I can say about Walgreens is that they don't pay enough. $7.25 and hour."
good,the management and the way they conduct themselves really should be looked into. there is no communication between anyone and they throw there employees under the bus to make themselves look like they actually do something.
good,"I worked the floor and also the liquor dept. "
good,"I liked the people who I was working with the work environment was fine until they started making a lot of changes like giving us a long to do list which includes, cleaning the store  and the bathroom, taking out the trash, working in the freezer"
good,"Unfortunately at this time  I dont not wish to give review, but I will state this is a place of employment and any job is better than not having a job at all."
good,"Training is Good ,Terrible hours for Managers no room for Advancement. No time with Family members for the Holidays .If you are looking for Training in Retail this is the place .was trained in Cosmetics an Customers Service"
good,Its a job. Not enough hours or help. Good co workers corp. Employees get paid for doing less work blah blah blah. Company is not what it used to be thats for sure
good,"Everyday was something new. "
good,"My typical day is going to work at the register for 6 hours or working at the photo area of Walgreens for 6 hours. I've learned everything there is to do with the cash register and the photo equipment. All of our managers are great with great personalities. They don't really take action quickly when you tell them a problem that is going on but I guess you can say that it'll get solved sooner or later. My co-workers are great also. Their all polite and straight forward towards me if there is a problem. I say the hardest part of the job is going to the register. I personally don't like the register as much as I did. I've been at the register for 6 months and more and I understand that you have to work your way up. But, there are people that have better positions then I do that started after me. So, any day that I have to spend my time at the register is the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is the photo area. Every guest that comes to Walgreens are usually energetic or have a great attitude. Its always great to work in photo because you're constantly doing something with the help of your co-workers and the day goes by faster."
good,The company was family orient during start-up and a excellent workplace. The managers were friendly and approachable. The company offer good benefits.
good,"There is a lot of drama among the ladies, but it was never a dull day there. Always work to do, but hours get cut short. No advancement there, and do not ever expect a pay raise ever."
good,"We are always short staffed and i end up having to work with three departments. The pharmacy staff has trained me in how to do insurance, typing, adding and editing patient accounts. In Photo Lab i print and edit photos as well as fix many of the in-store issues that arise with the software/hardware."
good,"While working here you get close to the girls you work with, you make lifelong bonds with everyone.  Fun place to work meeting new people."
good,"Opening / Closing store. I worked in the pharmacy assisting in filling prescriptions or helping customers."
good,"Self taught job, not very difficult to grasp. Very slow work, not a fast pace environment."
good,"A day filled with customer service ."
good,"Great for a point of entry or in between job.  Great place to learn about the retail industry, selling and customer service.  The pay isn't that great but you get to move up quickly and learn a varied amount of skills if interested."
good,"A typical day would be just to come in wait until 10:00 am to punch in and work until 2pm. "
good,Outstanding co-workers. People are always willing to share best practices and learnings. The hardest part of the job is the workload and the very old systems. Overall it is a good place to work but you will need to work extra hours to meet expectations.
good,"Spending 15 minutes preparing to open the store."
good,"The training was great, very thorough.  The hardest part of the job was the constantly rotating shift.  It was difficult to go to school and sometimes find child care."
good,I enjoyed my time with Walgreens but it always seemed like the message they wanted to give had alternative meanings. They were never up front about changes and through them at the leaders which actually helped me embrace change.
good,"A typical day at work consists of being busy from the moment I clock on to the second I leave. Which, for me, is a plus. A Pharmacy Technician is constantly multi-tasking between phones, data entry, and assisting patients. I learned a lot about general insurance, data entry, and basic medical filing. Management is fair, and my coworkers are great about putting in a team effort. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with insurance, because they very so much from plan to plan. The most enjoyable part is the relief that some patients have after you've helped them understand their complicated health insurance or whatever issue they may of have."
good,"new management styles, low wages, customers are great, always busy, flexible hours, work holidays, business open for long hours"
good,I worked here for about a month and a half to get experience as apart of my program at school. The people who worked there were really nice.
good,"As a cashier/photo technician I check customers out. I helped mostly in the photo lab and developed pictures. I also assisted in cleaning the photo printer and helped customers with the kiosk machine. I also helped with stocking of merchandise. I worked mostly part time, so my hours varied."
good,"Overall, a good place to work at as a pharamacist. You can get some really good experience at Walgreens, and the upward mobility is great. The software used is top-notch and flexibility is amazing. You can work anywhere from 1 day a week to working overtime, and the people in the district office I'm at are good people. The main drawback is the lack of the ability to staff the pharmacy in a way to optimize the workload in a way that is beneficial to the staff and patients. Otherwise, it's a great place to work."
good,"I learned how to do a job and help others.  I remember working on Christmas Day when the hottest items for the day were milk, batteries, and cold medicine. I learned how to count and balance my drawer.  I took phone calls and transferred them to the office, photo lab, pharmacy, and cosmetic department."
good,"Always on the go, never able to stop and take a break. "
good,"Spent alot of time here putting in great work over 5 years and not really being rewarded and/or advancing within the company, just time to move on"
good,"Walgreens, the company, great. Great benefits, plenty of opportunities, and a reliable company to work for. A typical day for me would consist of coming in, checking what work was needed to be finished before other items, and doing my work. There were assignments to each employee on what their area to focus on should be. At the end of the day, production and time sheets were to be filled out and work area was to be cleaned as thoroughly as possible."
good,"Frustrated with the global direction and lack of family values as our culture shifts priorities and Walgreens followed suit to keep up. Benefits and health insurance are a joke from what they used to be. Could be a reflection on the global initiative but cuts money from the wrong places. Salary caps reinforce the idea that Walgreens is a starter job and move on when you hit it. Like the people, most customers."
good,"The day goes by quickly since there isn't a day without work to be done. I have learned that how that evey persons hard work contributes to the success of a company. The company is a very stable and has a well founded belief in helping the customers and patients that visit the stores. "
good,"8 hours of helping patients. i learned how to be empathetic to my patient and to always treat my patient's as if they were my family member - this allows me to go above and beyond to help patient's. "
good,"You feel busy and rushed all day. I learned a lot more about medications thanks to my staff. The manager was great at quizzing the staff over drugs and safety in a fun way! It is a fast paced job so you are on your feet all day. My co-workers were always alert, very helpful and always willing to help with other duties in order to provide fast, professional and good customer service. Hardest part of the job is being alone in the drive thru which requires multitasking with no help. The Walgreens where I worked at, is the busiest in town filling over 1500 prescriptions daily compared to 100 prescriptions that the neighboring pharmacies handle daily. Good thing about it is that you are so busy the day passes by really fast!"
good,"Always something to do from start to finish, fast paced, lively co-workers and giving excellent customer service was the best part of the job."
good,"●Participated actively in all areas of store operations and management responsibilities; resulting in smooth running of shifts alongside motivating employees to perform at the highest levels  "
good,Walgreens is a mostly friendly atmosphere where there is hope of promotion.
good,The workplace itself is okay but they definitely need better management. My co-workers all work as a team and are willing to get the job done. I was one of the top pickers in the workplace. The hardest part of the job is training all temporary team members to learn the job at one time because it brings your rate down and with the rate you have to pick 305 boxes in an hour 2 have a 100% average rate.
good,working for this company was a struggle the job and customers i would run back to but as for the management i would not
good,Very helpful staff. There was a lot of standing.I was taught how to delete and store.Plenty of filling scripts.
good,"The position was enjoyable depending on your placement and supervisor. If you had a good supervisor the opportunity for advancement was better and the opportunity to commute was less. Very straining work, mentally and physically. The hardest part of the job was working every holiday and turn overs days (closing til 12:30am then opening at 7:30am). The pay was reasonable but there was no compensation for working holidays."
good,"alright place to work, manager sucks. basic first job warehouse"
good,"If your willing to work hard you can get promoted fast."
good,"Every body works as team, friendly. When i get there times goes fast because they always are lots of people."
good,"Youre a glorified stock boy, and if you don't kiss up to the right people, you can grab all the imaginary brass rings you want, but they are just that. They changed the pay scale, so now you don't make much anymore."
good,"Strict Corporate mentality, with the emphasis on strict.  Sometimes customers are waiting when the pharmacy opens, but at times as well the pharmacist has no help to deal with them appropriately.  Management often too busy to help."
good,"Working in Walgreens is fun but busy at the same time due to shortage of staff.  I have to be honest It is really stressful for the most part, answering phone calls, filling and handling the front, not to mention having one tech who is in charge in the front, we are lucky enough to have 2 technicians who handles the front when we have extra hours to give, another thing is having less hour per week, I hate to say this but my hours were cut, I only get good amount of hours when one of our regulars ask for a day off or a vacation, nothing is hard when you ask me, It's just stressful when we are short staff, less hours for me to work and they split my 8 hours to a two day making it 4 hours a day, I experience working alone, all by myself when I was only working for about couple of months, and was tough, but that strengthens me and made me a better technician, I would love to work here but having less hours will not work for me, I want to work as much as I can, I can even work between a pay range of 10 to 12$ as long as I get a good amount of hours, I am willing to be trained and learn about the job."
good,"During my time as an EXA, I worked on learning how to run a Walgreen's Store including sales, profitability, merchandising and managing employees.  Also during my tenure as an EXA I participated in Applied Drug Store Management  training program.  Successful completion of this program was necessary to be considered for Store Manager.  I completed the course at number 3 out of 40 participants.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to control the pace of my training and promotion to Store Manger.  The hardest part of the job was disciplining the employees and overcoming the discomfort of doing this part of the job."
good,"working at walgreens it was some what good it was when I was still in HS ."
good,good learning experience and fun environment... good for a start up job. Learn new things about retail.. 
good,"great place to work,  great management, no weekends."
good,The workers never want to work and the supervisors are always breathing down your neck about every given thing. Worse experience of my life working there. But the customers made my day go by so much easier (:
good,When I worked for Walgreens it was a great place to work. Most of my co-workers where nice and I use to love coming to work.
good,"great pay, just not an equal employment opportunity. its cool to work here if you don't have other things going on in life because they are not flexible at all. "
good,"I worked 10 hours days 3-4 days a week. Spent most of my time in cosmetic dept. This was my first job in retail and I really enjoyed helping customers. Met some very nice peolpe. Co-workers came to me a lot to try to solve problems with management...not fun! Found a lot of workers spent a lot of time looking busy, but not really working. Enjoyed ""truck days"" when supplies came in so I could restock shelves. "
good,"A demanding fast paced environment requiring full attention to details in all aspects of retail pharmacy. All day, everyday"
good,"Filled a solutions architect position under contract.  "
good,"Rightfrom the start I am working with customers checking out at the registar, Handling photos and helping out customers used the kioas machines. Once it slowes down i proceed to the stock room to pull items from the stock room to put on shelfs. Mon., Weds., and Thrus. the days we have trucks and check-ins. Groceries, Totes, Water, Sodas, and Ice Cream for the entire store i use a TelZone to do all checks-ins."
good,Typical day:
good,"I loved working for Walgreens because time went by so fast in the pharmacy. It was at least 1500 prescriptions to fill everyday. While managing the phones, and filling the medication, you are checking a person's insurance coverage. Multitasking made this my favorite job, but it got in the way of school. The hardest part is when someone calls off and it really feels like everyone is missing another pair of hands (it became horribly backed up and busy)."
good,"i come in get the photo lab started, checking the inventory, stock the shelves, place orders on missing items, deveople photos, double count the pick ups and drop offs."
good,Enjoyed multi-tasking between a beauty advisor and photo tech as well as a cashier. I enjoyed being friendly and professional with the customers and able to give them a good shopping experience.
good,"A typical day is working with customers / patients to meet there medication needs. You will deal a lot with insurance companies, Medicare / Medicaid, and clinics."
good,This is a workplace you come in get straight to work. As a cashier you are constantly intereacting with customers. Fast paced. If not cashiering then we are stocking isles or cleaning our designated work area. I learned so much about the regular customers that shopped at Walgreens and it was great. The management was judgemental and talked behind people backs and I did not like that. The hardest part of the job was listening to my bosses talk badly about other employees. The most enjoyable part of this job was getting to interact with customers on a personal level.
good,I lerned how to fill prescriptions. I liked the people i was working with.
good,"Downsize a lot. Do not care much for employees, just trying to profit as much as possible. Work you like a dog."
good,"opethe store,count tills, count the safe,open the photo lab do smart counts, prices changing,check for call ins or recalls quarantine what need to be qwarantine receiving, coordinate the staff, get evryone working. revisions in merchandise,"
good,Overall it was a good place to work. The management was nice they were good people. I enjoyed my co-workers everyone got along pretty good. The hardest part was around Christmas time.
good,"I was able to count drugs daily, I also got a chance to learn how to pronounce the prescription drugs that I filled as well as the purpose of the medicines. The Pharmacist was great to be around and didn't make the job hard or intimidating. The co-workers at Walgreens helped me alot and treated me as if I were an employee. The hardest part of my job was not having a enough time to understand the computer system. The most enjoyable part of my externship was knowing that I filled the prescriptions that came in correctly and was able to meet the customers needs."
good,"A typical day at work is dealing with customers, vendors and inventory. I've learned how to do several things at once, how valuable pleasant customer service is and that everyone has their own way of doing things. I've also learned how to get an unhappy person to smile. Store management tries to put a positive spin on the daily tasks and situations. My co-workers are of varying ages and backgrounds. The hardest part of my job is dealing with gossip, I've had several jobs over the years and never have I had to deal with the rumors and gossip that I deal with here. The most enjoyable part of my job is my customers. Some of them are going through so much in their lives but they stay positive and always make me feel good!"
good,"head cashier, training other cashier, help on the sale floor, co-worker care about me,it's was a fun place to work, you get to see new faces everyday."
good,has a lot to learn in terms of friendliness and can utilizing skills in different departments.
good,This was a great experience because of what the salvation army stands for. The money we made at the thrift shop was used in so many positive ways to help the community.
good,Commitement to fulfeel all valued customers in very professional manner.
good,"Walgreens is a great company to work for. I've met the aquaintences of so many cultures; Australian, British, African and Scottish. My management and associates are fun and I am inspired by their work ethic. The most difficult part about my job is not finding something to do. So far, I've learned to multi-task and appreciate our customers."
good,Location was a problem but it was very fun to work there I also learned a lot about the retail business while i served as an employee at Walgreens
good,i really enjoy working with walgreens< my team members work togetther and it keeps the job new and fun.
good,"At Walgreens, we have customers from open until closing. In between customer service, I am stocking the sodas, filling the cooler, stocking the paper goods, organizing the stockroom, cleaning, and ensuring the photo department is running at its most optimal. I've learned to multitask, to be understanding of customers with a problem, ordering supplies, ensuring what is ordered is received, and how to alleviate the problem if there is one. Management is professional, easy to talk to, and honest. Some employees work harder than others, which is a given no matter where you work. As a whole, everyone does their job, and has good attendance. The hardest part of the job would have to be appeasing a customer who is more than mildly upset, it doesn't happen often, however, when it does, I do my best and do whatever I can to make amends and ensure the customer leaves with a smile. The most enjoyable part of the job is definitely the regular customers. The people I know by first and/or last name, they are the faces I see weekly, some daily, and I forged some relationships that will never be forgotten."
good,"Management is nice, however, there could be more control from specific managers and how they deal with issues arising within the store."
good,"A typical day at work included running the store successfully (i.e. counting drawers, handing returns/ exchanges, customer complains, etc.). I would typically close so I would also be responsible for locking up the store and making sure that it was presentable for the next day. Other duties that I did included maintaining good customer service and merchandising. I am very strong at these skills among others. My store manager and the rest of the other assistant managers were good people also dedicated to make our store run smoothly. We all worked together to ensure that this happened. The hardest part of the job was time management. I worked at a busy store and it was sometimes hard to get store work done when we had so many customers. It always still got done, but it was a challenge to do so. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that some customers actually appreciated my hard work. They would show their gratitude my telling me, my manager, or the district office."
good,"Walgreens has great Benefits, but sucks if you want a family because i the hours ou work is crazy."
good,The Shedd Aquarium was a great place of employment in which I learned a lot.
good,I wasn't given many hours at all. Products that were given to us to push to customers was insanely expensive thus leaving our sales way down.
good,Walgreens CPO is a great place to work. It's stress level is alot lower than actually being in the store.
good,"i cant say anything bad about the one i work at, i am just trying to advance ..i learned a lot and also met a lot of good nice people  . the coworkers are very nice"
good,"The company itself isn't bad, the environment is terrible. Very drab place with no life. No one is happy to be there and no one enjoys their job (except the ones who don't talk to customers) I thought that my job would be to help customers but really all I do is transfer calls. The job is pointless."
good,Walgreens was a satisfactory job. It provided me with customer service skills. This job allowed me to learn all different types of positions. I enjoyed moving up in the company.
good,It is a ok store. Customers are friendly and so is the employees that I work with. It's a slow store for hours but it's a nice store. They have almost everything you need with great deals.
good,Working at Walgreens requires patience at an unmatched level! The customers are ALWAYS right even when they’re wrong as two left shoes. Hours vary and so does the benefits depending on the amount of hours worked.
good,"Walgreens connects deeply with their mission and all their tasks and metrics point back to it. Moving up is easy if you are a hard worker and genuinely care about people. The company is constantly changing to anticipate market trends or adjust to customer's needs. Management growth opportunities are much more difficult once you reach Assistant and Store Manager levels. Management also moves frequently between different stores. Hours, tasks lists, and corporate send outs are very demanding and budgeted hours are low."
good,"It's a Decent place to work, okay employees, lack of care for employees that have precondition injuries. 3.5 stars out 5.............................."
good,"I work at Walgreens as a Beauty Consultant, full time. I wish there were growth opportunities for me like there are for CSAs who are hired on. While they can move on into the Pharmacy or up the management totem pole, my role has become quite stagnant. To move into the BAE position is impossible and usually hire from the outside since it’s a corporate job. Store to store depends on management. I have decent managers and that provides a decent experience. I’m looking to grow in the beauty industry and unfortunately Walgreens I ant doing that for me. Despite wanting to be a major beauty realtor along Ulta."
good,This company has existed for over 100 years. Store level operations has undergone a major overhaul. The company is driven for success-with pharmacy and beauty as top priority.
good,There is a certain amount of favoritism that needs to be addressed and some rules are to rigid. The company needs to take steps before automatically firing dedicated long time employees
good,If you’re looking for a good first job then this is the place for you. It’s a heavy traffic environment and gets very busy during lunch time and it’s easy to get overwhelmed but just stay focused and you’ll do great
good,I loved my team but it was all about competition and favorites at our store. I loved the customers and helping them solve their issues and loved working in the photo lab.
good,Great employees and managers but the corporate side of it is not the best. The people you work with are great but corporate expects way too much from over worked employees.
good,I greatly enjoyed being hired as a photo technician because all of my previous sales and retails positions were mundane and with Walgreens I actually was able to learn a lot of new things. The overall atmosphere was good for the most part.
good,This is a place that is open all Holidays and during that time is open until 12am. You do not get 40hours in a week it is inbetween 20-30 hrs. The Walgreens that I was employed had the older women to unload the truck and do a good bit of the stocking while younger employees stood at the register I;m not saying that hard work should be did by the younger working people but it should have been at least rotated so that all can work.
good,Work hard and people will notice. My managerial experience was great I got a chance to interact with customers and made great friends with my co workers. Overall a really good place to work.
good,"I loved working at Walgreens it was fun, challenging, and rewarding. Miss working there and would welcome the opportunity to return anytime."
good,I worked with them for a very short time. I learned a lot from the pharmacy but it was often not taught to me by the pharmacist but by the cashiers. They often times had me doing small jobs instead of the jobs that I was supposed to be performing.
good,An easy job with consistent and flexible hours that provides a moderate amount of working hours. A typical day of work can vary dramatically depending on your shift. Coworkers were excellent.
good,"I  would  tell  others  to at least give them a try. The  work  itself  is not hard,  but at times be demanding.  Show  the  best of  you  and  you  will  be  treated  fairly."
good,"This job is very flexible with staff. They put a lot on there employees to get done. Which is sometimes impossible with the amount of staff on duty. The benefits of the company are good to me, but to others can be better."
good,"cashiering, Floor work- consisting of building displays ,ordering and cleaning.Greeting customers and resolving any issues they may have  or helping them locate a certain item or product."
good,"I loved working at Walgreens. I loved the people, the customers and the environment. I did not like the lack of advancement. Raises are rarely given out unless you transfer to the the pharmacy or get promoted."
good,"They were a pretty good company to work for. But their maternity leave was not the greatest. Management and the sift leads were fine, they pushed for me to learn more so I could become more valuable."
good,I was younger then so I didn't really know how to deal with issues that arouse in certain situations. I loved and enjoyed working at Walgreens. I met new faces everyday...I am.a people person.
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work if you dont have a family to take care of. The hours are never steady, the employers are always coming and going. Customers are our primary concern."
good,Working at walgreens is not a very stressful job. The responsibilities are reasonable and do able within the time frame allowed. The issue comes from poor management and lack of consequences for certain employees. Certain employees cause the same issues time and time again but no consequences are ever dealt to them. There is clear favouritism towards certain associates and some associates and even managers will talk negatively about fellow coworkers behind their backs.
good,"Walgreens employees all have very good customer service skills we had to interact with each customer we walked by or made eye contact."
good,I worked with a friendly staff that made long working hours somewhat enjoyable. Management would help out in the pharmacy during peak hours if staff was short.
good,"Great training, great job. Only negatives were the low pay and during non busy times there was nothing to do. I was hired during a company merger though,  so it may not be that way now."
good,Good company to work for but the appreciation for the employees have decreased over the past 10 years. They don’t value the employees as they used to. Benefits are good but the pay is not nearly enough for the workload.
good,The environment is great but it is hard to work at walgreens if you have a family. They work with your schedule if you go to school but the work schedule changes all the time making it hard for you too see your family.
good,"Great place for part-time work. Most stores do not offer full-time unless you are in management. The corporate structure has changed and is not the company it once was. Advancement in the company is difficult and many shifts in leadership often happen, so the chance of being fairly evaluated for promotion is unlikely as new leadership enters a store every year."
good,To describe Walgreens I would have to say that I loved it very much and during my six years there I grew from being a simple cashier to being the head of my own department with much more responsibility that I enjoyed.
good,"I have worked for the company for many years and many things have changed. Sadly, Walgreens doesn't pay the employees enough to give up the work/life balance. The love the people I work with but that doesn't pay the bills."
good,"The job is fast paced and can be stressful. I like my coworkers best of all, they really made it enjoyable coming to work. The managers are also very caring and helpful."
good,Our location is currently in the process of  transitioning from a Rite-Aid to a Walgreens Pharmacy & I am unable to comment as I have not had the opportunity to work in a complete Walgreens environment since my employment prior
good,"Customers were great, Night Shift leads were okay for the most part. Assigning jobs to  front cashier that removed us from front of store, then getting upset if we didn't get to registrar immediately from cooler, back room to help customers. Inconsistent breaks and jobs assigned"
good,"Overall, working at Walgreens has been a positive experience for me as a manager.  Most of the employees are fully engaged in meeting daily expectations and demonstrate a high degree of performing well.  Working in a diverse environment is very rewarding to me because I'm a people person first.  Numbers come second. The distribution that I worked at have a huge opportunity for performance improvement and accountability.  Better system tracking and training is extremely needed to be competitive with the current and future market place."
good,"the management at the evanston location was awful, alot of favoritism and lack of professionalism.wouldve loved being a beauty advisor if it wasnt for management was there for almost two years"
good,"Stocking, reorganizing, cashiering, loading and unloading truck. "
good,"I start this off that my reviews were generous for the department I worked for. I was hired through a really great hiring agency and was told that my job was contract to hire. Which most of the time is normal. After about 2 weeks working at Walgreens I find out that my job was only a temp position and they had been hiring to fill the position I was in and did not tell me about it. I found out from another department and someone encouraged me to apply for it. So I did.. because I was already working there, and why not right? Well they chose not to accept me for my current position because they already had someone in mind. Possibly the weirdest job situation I've been in."
good,"Buen trabajo. Pero solo fue por empleo de verano, me hubiera gustado quedarme ahí"
good,Walgreens is a very relaxed place to work and can be relatively very easy compared to other jobs. You work really at the pace that customers come into the store and when no customers are in the store it is very slow and you work at just about your own pace.
good,New culture is corporate oriented instead of family oriented as was in the past. Teams are less engaged due to frequent changes in company and demanding tasks. Less focus on customer service.
good,"If you're prone to getting sick, or have a kid who's always sick, and need to call out, good luck. At the Walgreens I worked at, You have 12 lates, 6 leave early's, and 6 call-outs before they give you a written warning - which, by the way, carries over to the date you received that warning. Otherwise, everything resets on January 1st. I.E. You got you written on October 7, 2016? Carries over until October 7, 2017. But, if you only have 3 late, it resets back to 0 and you have 12 again."
good,"The job seemed like it would be long lasting, but the work culture was terrible. The pay was fine, the work was easy, but the coworkers didn't work consistently."
good,stress full at times you do meet great people and bad ones workplace culture is great nothing is hard about the job and the best part is getting to know the customers.
good,"Great company for basic employees, management is okay depending on your store manager, but still can barely have free time, I have seen a lot of career advancement at this job."
good,Really all depends on what store and what district you work in. Over all worked there for 4 years as a Sfl. Had no life outside. Pay is better than others same with benefits.  When it comes to moving up it's about who you know.  I
good,The hours are very sketchy. One week you can have 30 and the next only 5. It made it very hard to budget money and make sure bills were paid. Management was decent and tried to help anyway they could.
good,"1 Difficult to balance work life with weekend shifts"
good,"Most of my co-workers were nice and respectful. Although most of the managers on the other hand didn't seem as understading. I had fun meeting new people. The travel from work wore out my car. I was going from Moyock-Kill Devil Hill everyday, it was an hour and a half drive (one way) plus a lot of traffic."
good,I've nothing good nor bad to say about the company. Although I felt 90 % of the time we had an excellent crew. We all worked very well together so that is all
good,"The store I worked with in rural Tennessee was an overall good store.  As an intern I never felt accepted, but the actual employees had good positions"
good,It was great to work here in the beginning but now with no raises I cannot continue to work less hours and still be able to pay for my bills. This company doesn’t care about the little guy.
good,"The job itself is not complicated, it just requires someone with the ability to multitask and maintain a pleasant attitude with customers.  The store is open a wide range, so scheduling around your life was fairly easy."
good,"Started in college about 3 years ago, only making 50 cent more than when i started. pretty nice employee benefits, and you will get hours if you perform your jobwell"
good,"Fast paced store, always busy and customers needing help with orders. Promotions throughout store and sales kept job interesting and fun. Store was kept clean and looked presentable to customers."
good,"I have worked for Walgreens for the last two years, the people who work there made an impact on my life. while the work day can be difficult we always leave the day with a smile and have our laughs throughout the day. management at my store is very easy to talk to and understand if i have any issues. the hardest part of my job is the costumers, it can be very difficult to deal with especially with the merger that has recently happened and lack of hours and workers can disturb work flow."
good,Every few months there is a change in the business model. Management is out of touch with what goes on in the stores. Scheduling is last minute and unfair. Policies are up for interpretation based on the manager. Lack of the hours necessary to properly operate the stores. Quality of sales has dramatically decreased.
good,for the work that is ask to complete the pay needs to be a little higher. The insurance is high cost and the deductible is to high.There is no incentive for people to stay for long time employment.
good,there is a lot of stress that comes with working at the specialty site. I do not believe employees are paid enough and there are always changes with policies and other things. nothing seems to be consistent
good,Walgreens in my years has been a great place to work but promotions are a struggle to come by and there is a glass ceiling at the management level that is hard to break.
good,"As assistant store manager, I don't have a consistent work schedule.  Somedays I work from 7:30 am to 5 pm, and other days I work 12 pm to 10 pm.  I had every 3rd weekend off.  I don't believe I was paid adequately for my work and education experience.  Management is fantastic however.  From Store Managers to District Managers and Regional Managers."
good,This company is a good place to work it is just sometimes the team needs to work together instead of against each other. We all need to be together as one and help support the store as a whole instead o gossiping all the time.
good,I’ve worked at Walgreens for almost two year. I love my job. For the most part it’s a great company to work for. My manager has always supported me 100% with all of my work related decisions.  There are a few things Walgreens could improve about the company.
good,"this job prepares you to either move up or seek out higher employment elsewhere. Managment is willing to work with you and make sure you can do your best work, there are opportunities to advance to the pharmacy."
good,This job provided me with assests like customer satisfaction and money counting. Overall this job is a good entry level to help bulld confidence in the workolace and at other jobs.
good,"Walgreens is a good place to work. It changes every day. One day you could be at the front register, the next you could be working a reset or revision. That is one of the perks of working here."
good,Walgreens is really all about your coworkers. Hours will get cut. You will receive schedules that you don't like. But it really comes down to who you work with.
good,"Good place to start as a worker. "
good,Very interesting externing there. I learned a lot of new things and things that I already knew would love to work there again! Staff was very friendly
good,"I was mostly left to my own devices as the primary cashier after a single day of shadowing someone else on the job and a ton of video training on the computer. Management was unhelpful half the time and manipulative the rest of the time. The store manager had the nerve to boast to me that I was lucky to have him as a manager cuz he was so nice; no, he was just really good at making you feel like you were a jerk for voicing concerns to him, and he made a lot of empty promises that he never followed through on, unless his bosses were in to see how he was doing. I was constantly yelled at for stepping away from the register to do side work that was required of me, because as soon as I would a customer would step up to the register ready to be checked out and I was not right there ready to help them; but if I stayed at the register ready to help and greet customers I was yelled at for standing around and doing nothing and told to do some side task that often took me no more then a few steps away from the register. They trained newer cashiers in certain duties right away, but if I asked for the same training I was told, ""we'll do that tomorrow."" A cashier that got hired after me took to teaching me new things as he learned them, but our shifts only overlapped for 15 minutes three days a week. Myself and two other employees were scheduled to work for every weekly employee meeting and never rotated out so that we could occasionally attend meetings, which is actually a direct violation of the over all company policy. The store manager accused me of yelling at him when I asked him to"
good,If you want to move up i feel like you cant have kids or a life outside of this place. For you to be promoted you have to have a full open availability.
good,I was only there three years and my position changed three times. My first manager made it one of the greatest jobs ive ever had. My last manager I hope I never see again. Its such a large company I think your experience will vary greatly depending on the division you work in.
good,seize opportunities and move up or risk being stuck in the same position. avoid cliques and keep your wits about you with management. business and pleasure do not mix
good,"I worked for Walgreen for a year as a Photo Tech among other duties I had. Overall, I liked it and even miss it a little bit. Good people when I worked there my responsibilities were not bad even fun depending of the day. I worked mostly as a Photo Tech I also did scan outs, call-ins, store pulls and ordered expense for photo. I left because of changes in management. Still, I would work for Walgreens again if given the chance and it made sense for me."
good,I learned a lot about the company and its employees. I worked very hard everyday and I didn't miss any days. The hours was responsible and they were able to accommodate my every need.
good,Walgreens is a place where you can grow as a Leader but has not innovated in many years. Due to this the tools to help be more efficient are lacking bit they are aware and are working to fix this.
good,"Walgreens is a fast paced, high stress, low reward environment.  Assistant store managers work a mandatory 44 hour work week.  Overtime is discouraged beyond scheduled labor and there is an expectation to work outside of scheduled hours.  Be prepared to work nights, weekends, overnights and holidays.  Typical work duties include: frequent stocking, lifting and inventory tasks; hiring, disciplinary and engagement/training activities."
good,My typical day at work in the Pharmacy. When I get to work I see where we are with task that need to be done. If they haven't been done I start working on them. I answer customer question and handle cash purchases. I call doctors and insurance offices to get approvals for patient prescription and payments. I fill many prescription and count medications properly following procedures and legal laws. My favorite part of my position is the customers. I love to talk and get to know the people we take care of. I think the hardest part of this job is dealing with the stress of the volume of meds that we fill and the customers that are angry and don't understand the system of insurance and doctor offices. For the most part everyone that I work with get along and try to work as a team.
good,it was cool at first the managers do what they can to try to help you you have to get along with random people and try to get to know the people that come in regularly you have to multitask and get everything done by the time you leave
good,Walgreens is fast paste and you may apply for one specific job but you train for everything and have you as backup for the other jobs if someone calls in or they need more assistance in that field
good,"If you have little to no work experience walgreens is a good place to start, however if you stay for more than a year you either end up stuck there for the rest of your life or get canned shortly after. I would not recommend staying at walgreens unless you plan on becoming a pharmacist, the retail end is not worth a long term investment."
good,Very fast paced working environment
good,"The summary covers all of it. Basically just avoid the overnight shift, and you'll be okay. Overnight itself is a pain if you have a bad shift lead, and painfully slow and boring otherwise."
good,"Greeting customers, setting up displays, merchandising new items, managing a department, scheduling for the department, reviewing new products and training to be able to educate customers on the new products."
good,"Walgreens expected a lot from me. I was 16 doing more work than the older employees and even the ones working there longer. They always cut my hours, had me train people, and work multiple departments by myself."
good,"Low level of engagement. Doesn't matter what I do to make it fun at work, employees don't want to participate in anything. The low engagement score is blamed on me even though I have tried different activities to get them engaged. The pharmacy manager is in a world of his own and will not listen to anyone.  I live what I do, but I am getting tired of the drama."
good,"Job was very laid back. Offers flu shots and other things that I think is really good and convenient. Good discount as well. However certain locations are not safe to work and its a lack of security, or provided security for the employees safety."
good,"Typically work days consisted of helping customers, cashiering, and random cleaning duties. I learned how to stock things by using the numbers in the bar code, and how to use the computers. The management was good at my location, with no managers that I didn't like. Everyone that worked there was really nice, and I enjoyed getting to know them. The hardest part of the job was learning where everything went, and the most enjoyable part was the coworkers I had."
good,I liked working with the company because I loved all my customers. The things that could of been better there was the hours they where giving people other then that everything was good
good,I was here for years and I only moved up the ladder slightly. It is a dog eat dog world in that company. I worker overnights as a shift lead so I worked 80/ week and then was off for an entire week. I loved it.
good,"I was working for Walgreens for about 12 years, It was a very good company back on it days. The workplace culture started changing a lot.. The harder part of the job was dealing with the DM who most of the time did not know anything.."
good,"This job is decent, but nothing special. When at work, the coworkers were often negative. Management tends to be rude and has an awful use for harsh language."
good,"Good first job for someone in high school, not a good long-term option for someone unless you're a store manager. Pay isn't the worst but doesn't pay off working part-time. working full time you get paid time off and better benefits. Advancement is not the best and your yearly raises are usually like 20 cents or so. Customers can be ridiculous and irritating but that's life."
good,Walgreens was a good company for me I met a ton of great people while I worked there that I still keep in touch with and the work load wasn't that bad you never have too many customers. The people and work environment is great if all jobs were like that they'd all be great however store managers can be very demanding while being lazy in the office not all of them are like that but they're are quite a few. Basically you are stocking shelves helping a customer in the beauty department as in recommending or you're helping in photo or pharmacy or you are ringing up customers that's basically it basic stuff
good,I worked in The Beauty Department and it was exciting. The only thing that wasn't pleasant there was there wasn't enough coverage on the floor during peak hours.
good,"I really like working there, especially with the people I work with."
good,I think Walgreens has a great pharmacy system. They have decent training. It was a good experience to have worked there. I only worked there part-time for 3 months.
good,"The work-culture and practices made sense, friendly management steps. Some opportunities to grow. However, favoritism did come in now-and-then. :-). Overall it was a great experiences. i was promoted within 3 weeks of working with the company, then started pharmacy technician classes, which they offer to employees for free. I left due to personal reasons that were hindering me from performing effectively. Otherwise, I would've stayed."
good,"Love the work simple balance paste well trained workers management just need a little work, nice steady shift . I would love to a friend to work there."
good,"You fill about 200+ Rxs a day, you're on your feet the whole shift. You learn a lot yet, but the pay for the work you do is way too low. Everyone I've worked with is so nice and helpful, but it's just a really stressful workplace."
good,"Store work available for college students — flexible schedule—"
good,"Lots of exercise every day,good benefit, wonderful coworkers, great regular customers, employee discount."
good,"good place to work, not much pay. good way to advance in the hospital field. The staff members are nice and knowledgeable. Also able to get certified through there training programs."
good,"I only did heavy lifting all day, long, boring hours. Very busy all the time. The main manger sucked, but all the other managers were very cool and nice. I liked talking to people ."
good,"Repair Printers, PC Workstations, Cash Registers, Alarm Systems, CCTV Systems"
good,"The associates were very kind and hard working. Some tended to goof off and only got away with it because of seniority, they generally were the ones that helped the store make money when pharmacy wasn't giving enough flu shots or signing people up for medicare. But it made the overall atmosphere comfortable to work at."
good,"Although it was a temporary job, Walgreens was an overall good experience. I was the beauty advisor/ cashier. Loved when customers would ask questions about beauty products. There was paid training, discounts on almost everything in the store, comfortable size break room, paid break time for most shifts and also opportunities to move up in the Walgreens career"
good,"Management was decent, hours fluctuated too often to remain stable."
good,"A typical day at work would be receiving new items and making sure we organize and put them away. Making sure photo orders are complete. I learned how to work in the photo and beauty department. And how to use a scanner. Management in my case wasn't the best, I got pregnant and ended up getting treated poorly by my shift leaders. The workplace was stressful but also fun, fun in a way that I got to meet new people and gave them a reason to come back. The hardest part of the job was every holiday changing the isles and moving everything that was there, and replacing it. I enjoyed out of the job was the experience and working in photo and helping customers find what they are looking for."
good,"Direct management was great, area management was not. They had unrealistic expectations. The pay was low for the area (Memphis), It is a good job to get experience."
good,"It was a nice job, if you are non-management you are typically quite young they will have to pay more if they want to keep talent in their company, im not sure if mcdonalds even pays less"
good,"Loved the staff and customers' there but didn't have an outside for family and friends. A lot of promotions were salary cut or wiped out overtime. Store never close for anything whether it's inclement weather, holidays, and etc."
good,"If you are just starting out in the workforce, or are in between careers (out of school) and need something temperary, it would be perfect. Interesting ways of handling different situatins. Everytime there is a new manager there are severe changes and not all the time for the good."
good,"It is a great place to work...  If you are flexible and willing to accept change.  A perfect place for customer oriented people, specifically as a csa.  Good opportunity for advancement from within.  As a store manager or assistant, be ready for a few long days, and try to keep a good work/life balance."
good,"Every day is busy at Walgreens.  There is always something new to learn and different obstacles you run across.  Management is always available to help when times get too busy.  The most challenging part of the job is keeping up with the flow and making sure you stay on task, but as long as you as disciplined things should go pretty smoothly.  The customers can be challenging at times.  The people you work with definitely make a difference and can be the best part of the job."
good,"While there are spurts of business, the job is mostly slow paced.  Technology has its bugs, but runs well enough.  Management is in constant check as to keep employees happy.  Pay leaves much to be desired."
good,"clock in and get on the register or what ever position they have you in. while its slow start putting items back and making shelf's look neat, walk around while keeping an eye on your register making sure you dont have a line. help customers look for what they need and help them check out"
good,"Steady job but you will work yourself into exhaustion. There is no balance for family time and the job is always first. You have to work a ridiculous amount of hours. Upper management does not care about you. They only focus on numbers and results. The pay is decent but if you factor in all the time you work, it's not worth it. The more you do, the more they expect."
good,is a great work place benefits are awesome hours are great everything is just great i go get my work done give excellent customer service witch i love
good,Get to know your team members and have fun with them. I made some great friends and very strong conections. These people are not just my co workers but my family. Great work environment.
good,I loved this job because I learn how to communicate with the customers and employees. I dedicated myself to this company but sad that management will not encourage or show support to their employees.
good,"I was an ""all around"" team member here at Walgreens. I worked as a cashier in the front, cosmetics, photo and in the pharmacy. I enjoyed the people there. Especially the many awesome customers."
good,Learnt about Medication and the way it Interact with the bodySafety was the number one concern wit Walgreens.There was easy access to Management which is a plusCompared to other Companies
good,I consider this job a challenge because management does not work well with the staff. There is not much room for growth in the store. They also do not reward hard work or effort.
good,"I learned a lot from this job. I learned better people skills, team work, leadership and some other skills. Though I also learned that people will do anything to benefit themselves, and that made this job a little less desirable."
good,I didn't get very many hours which made it hard to pay my bills. I liked the environment and learned a lot about how to stock and price items. I enjoyed working here.
good,It's a great place to meet different people and their ways. At times it became stressful but overall I love my job in dealing with customers helping them find a solution  to a problem. I also would help in pharmacy and that was great as well. Had to do hands on projects like re-sets on certain aisles. Loved it!
good,Depending on job location very fast paced environment. Depending on location and day had to multitask and do lots of different jobs at once. No room to grow in job field. Benefits are better than most. Hours depending on location.
good,"Working at Walgreens can be alright, but not a job to make a living off alone. Great for students, or part timers, but not a stable career. There's rarely ever any opportunities for advancement as well."
good,"Depending on where the store is located it can either be busy or slow. As a cashier you are expected to provided customer friendliness, handle transactions, answer customer questions and assist management with daily duties. "
good,"Walgreens was first official paying job, it is where I learned about the work field. It was an amazing job at first, I enjoyed coming into work and had a positive attitude. Then the management team changed and there was a man hired as assistant store manager. When he was hired the store basically clasped within itself. Things that were supposed to be done within a matter of two hours or so were dragged out over weeks. The pay always became a problem because we were required to do more work than we were payed for. A lot of the employees started to feel underpayed towards the end of my career at Walgreens. I loved that place and everything it taught me but I knew when I decided to leave that I was making the best decision for myself."
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work as long as you can pick things up quickly and keep your cool in difficult situations.  "
good,"Ive worked with Walgreens for 2 and a half years. I loved working for the company itself. Not much opportunity for advancement, but great place to work for."
good,"lots of price changing and stocking,resets,answering customer questions, taking and transferring phone calls. Scan outs,working the photo department, taking passport pictures."
good,"To start out with a job, it helps you get in the job market, give experience in customer service and related jobs. Learn to work with good equipment, learn cooperate type of company.  Can move around to different stores."
good,The location I am currently employed at has compassionate and thoughtful staff. We all work well together and get all work completed. Customer enjoy coming to this store.
good,As a Pharmacy Tech there isn't really room to necessarily advance unless you were to take on a different role within the company. Walgreens paid for me to take my certification exam which saved me from having to pay for it out of pocket which is something the company does that a lot don't. Overall I worked with a great group of people and felt that it was a great place to work.
good,The company does not provide advancement opportunities. Same routine and expectations each day. Nothing new or different to look forward too. Management was great and treated employees well.
good,This place is full of liability. Be careful. The managers are great but corporate does everything they can to make your job harder. There are roles consistently being added to your job description without proper compensation.
good,Business was great. Learned how to deal with a lot of diversity. I learned that its always good to help people in need. I also learned that being a manager requires a lot of hard work and time.
good,I have been working for Walgreens since I was seventeen and it has served me well as a high school and college job.  They have been flexible with me with my needs to be transferred to a new store when I moved away from college.  Decent pay and good working conditions.
good,"I enjoyed the opportunity that was given to me when I was hired for Walgreens. I learned a lot about management, handling money, and supervising other associates. Like any retail store they had a lot of favoritism in management, they didn't really motivate associates in any way to work harder or better and the schedules were so unpredictable. I chose to leave for that very reason I had a 6 month old at home and I couldn't work a night shift one day and then a morning shift the next. The hardest part of working for Walgreens I guess was the fact that no one was willing to train the proper way. The most enjoyable part of the job was realizing that I was manager material."
good,"It had its time when the job was extremely busy, I learned how to have a lot of patience and to handle and defuse situations. the hardest part of the job was being on your feet the entire day but you eventually got used to it."
good,"I loved externing here. Super fast pace, always something to do. Never boring. I learned a lot about the pharmacy setting.  More people to interact with"
good,"This is definitely a great place to start. but I do not think of it as a career. You can learn tons about various things here and the people i work with will help most of the time,"
good,"first time job , i love it but lately it has been hard for me because cut hours, I think the team should be a team work but it doesn't feel like it. Yea"
good,Worked here as part of the Summer Youth Employment Program. I was a greeter. Greeted incoming customers and helped them when necessary.  Kept shelves stocked and neat.
good,"Enjoy working with all ages 2 years to 100, many variety illnesses. EMR easy to use.  Fast paced and often very busy.  Minimal breaks and lunch. Must be very independent  with good people skills and knowledge base, though some computer assistance in reviewing such as Epocrates."
good,Lots to learn but fairly logical to apprehend. Love that I chose what I'd like to do that day for the most part. Management's very cooperative with scheduling.
good,"If you enjoy working in retail and with people, then Walgreen's is an enjoyable place to work, especially if you are looking for part-time while in school, or around a young family. You can usually get the hours/time of day to suit your life. On the negative side, your hard work and contribution is usually not recognized and you feel like a number not a name: that your contribution doesn't mean very much. Turn over is high and someone can easily replace you."
good,"It was a great place to work, especially in high school and the years after. They were flexible with the work schedule. I learned how to perform great customer service."
good,"In my two years of working for Walgreens, I've learned much more in the field of customer service, and even advanced into learning pharmacy skills. At first, learning pharmacy was a bit difficukt and still continues to be but the connection I have made with my regular customers and coworkers has made it worth it"
good,"An examplary day at Walgreens usually included working the cash register, beauty counter, photo area, and alternative expectations. I learned that working with your manager is exceptational, also clear communication was a big lesson learned. The management at Walgreens was mediocre and ultimately unprofessional. The workplace was hectic at times, but overall a memorable experience. The hardest thing about working at Walgreens is making time for self initiated projects but,I get to split my time between creative and organizational tasks. I love having that duality, because when I get stuck on the creative substance, I can switch gears and do the organizational substance. So apart from all the trial and error seeing those smiling customers was the most influential part."
good,"Everyday was busy, for the most part. I learned customer service, responsibility, creativity, and how to pass down what I have learned the correct way. I also learned to feel and function. Management was great, always trying to find a way to make hat extra dollar for the company. We all worked good independently, but we also came together when necessary. The hardest part of the job was the adaption period, learning the ins and outs of the store other than that I enjoyed myself."
good,"Specifically working in the Downtown Miami Walgreens, one of the fastest paced pharmacies in Miami, is more austere and the management is more demanding than management at other stores. The hardest part is definitely having to lift and move boxes twice your height and weight, but this has taught me that I'm stronger than I once believed. As a Beauty Advisor I mostly worked moving new products from the stockroom to the floor and old products back, getting to know all the products we sold and memorizing the locations, helping out customers with whatever suits them best while not recommending things to them. The most enjoyable part of working for Walgreens is definitely helping out the customer by finding what helps them feel better about themselves and makes them feel more secure enough to see them walk out with a smile."
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with.The Company is getting to young and to controlling. I use to look forward to go to work.
good,Basic clerk job pretty self explanatory. Come in Smile tell people about the deal of the month. Engage in sales and conversation.
good,"Don't rush, ask questions make sure you understand, a typical day will consist of working with customers, and/or patients when you work in the pharmacy, handling money durning transactions and help people find things that they need."
good,"I would mostly work with people. This is one of the best parts of the job. With medical insurance being a large part of the system I was given many operunities to evolve my problem solving skills.  Neatness and order were important, so being organized and on task was paramount."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walgreen's. For the most part the employees work well together. We knew how work and have fun. We wanted to be there to assist customers with a big smile on our face. Even though its a lot of work to do on truck day you can still manage to get it all done."
good,"I work well with people , so I enjoyed the customers as well as co-workers weather it be customer service or just conversation, the day would be over before you know it."
good,"The employees for the most part are a joy to work with. As with customer service anywhere, you have to possess patience and great problem solving skills. Balancing work and family are a challenge with this particular job because of the time required at work, but it's rewarding to be able to provide customers with excellent service."
good,You have to be able to handle many hours and task all at once with a small team and to many things to do and sometimes only one lead on shift. It is fast pace high productivity.
good,"One of the biggest strengths of the company for me, personally, is the strength of scheduling during my college career. This was a reason why I stayed with the company so long. Very reasonable scheduling for students. Over the years the job culture, however, has suffered and not to go into so much detail, it is up to the upper management to provide an example and competence for helping the rest of us work to the best of our abilities. Based on past issues such as culture, poor management of available hours, and terrible aspects to the position known as the SFL it is easy for me to see that this isn't the company it was in 2009 and three large reasons as to why I am ready to move on and seek much better cultural and fiscal opportunity."
good,"I enjoyed working in the photo department and interacting with customers; however, I ultimately left the company due to frequently fluctuating hours and never receiving a raise or opportunity to advance."
good,"my typical time at Walgreens was excellent, I enjoyed my co workers my management staff, and most of all I enjoyed the customers, they bought so much light in my life that words is not enough to say about those people, but all I know and all I remember is, they made me love my job a lot more, they appreciated me and all I did for the company Walgreens."
good,"Other than extremely low compensation, the place is very nice.  management is very good and work.  Company benefits are excellent, which helps balance the very low compensation.   If they paid a reasonable wage, I would NOT be looking for a new  job."
good,"You know what is expected of you. Good chances for advancement if you perform well. Management can be a little tough to deal with, but that's mainly due to the trickle down of poor training. Can be fun with the right people. Standard retail 9-5."
good,"I loved my work but NOT enough hours or pay as promised when hired. I was a front cashier, stocker and I worked on Mondays as a cosmetic associate.The co-workers were AWESOME to work with"
good,"Be prepared to work more than your fair share and receive less than you should. Before they got rid of the Lead Photo position, you were responsible for 4+ different areas of the store, then you were told that you get paid just as much as someone running 1 department at Wal-Mart..."
good,I enjoy working here i am just looking for a higher paying job. I would recommend people of all ages legal to work to apply!
good,Work environment is good. At times it seems that you are not valued by the managers. The day shift crew are nice and helpful. Night shift is active. Learned how to properly give great customer service.
good,"Walgreens is a good entry level position job for anyone who is looking to begin building set skills needed in many other jobs. Customer service associate position is best for high school students for first time workers. You can build basic skills such as operating a register, stocking merchandise, learning how to communicate with customers, and how to work with others."
good,Co worker were friendly and hard workers. Manager was easy to work with. Assistant manger was difficult to make happy. You were always told you did not do it right. Was not liked by anyone. Made the job harder than it was.
good,The location made it tough to maintain stability among the staff. Co-workers were great but management needed improvement.
good,the hardest part of the job is having to do someone else's work. i work overnight and it is like the 95% of the time. having to face and help customers can be quite annoying too.
good,Walgreens is a very stable company which is constantly changing with customer demand.  They have a great understanding what it takes to maintain being an industry leader.  There is plenty of opportunity of advancement and it is on you how your make your career develop
good,Time Consuming programs that effectively take time way from results oriented tasks. Daily meeings and planning that leave much to be desired. Its a simple business founded on time tested principles.
good,The store is usually pretty bus during the summer time and they do not have enough staff for the amount of work they expect us to get done. I would usually come in and stock be the cashier clean bathrooms and other spills.
good,"It can be a hit or miss employment opportunity depending on location. I've had negative and positive experiences in different locations. You need to have your boundaries set and clear, when you'll confidently be able to work, and what kind of work you are willing to do, otherwise overreaching leads and managers will work you to the bone."
good,"The hardest part of my job was PPL's or computer work on because it was so long and could make the day drag by. However, the co-workers i interacted with made my work days much more enjoyable."
good,"A typical day of work would begin with completing or doing all of the inventory, call lists, patient fills, refills, answering phones, calling insurances, taking in prescriptions. I love my coworkers, the job is nothing if you don't like the people you work with, Walgreens taught me how to put the patient first, meet the patients needs, go above and beyond in customer service, and unfortunately, you cannot make every one happy. The hardest part about my job is dealing with customers who don't really trust you and what you have to say."
good,It's an ok place to work if you don't mind doing the same things over and over again. They pay pretty decent for the work you do. I don't really have a bad thing to say about the company.
good,"Although working there we made sure the customers were happy and healthy, the employees need to be taken care of as well for their hard work."
good,"during my time at Walgreen my primary job was to maintain excellent customer service performance,  ensure up-sales were being performed by myself and the workers under my shift. other duties included inventory counts, and back of the house stock work working for this company increased my sense of urgency in sales and in customer service. my most enjoyable part was being able to solve every customer i encountered issues, while keeping a happy work enviroinment during my shift"
good,"Don't get hurt or you will be thrown to the wolves. Otherwise I enjoyed my job, co-workers and customers. If you have good Pharmacists so trust you are in great shape, the store management however isn't usually your friend."
good,"Walgreens is a wonderful company. My job is lackluster but requires very much from me. I do monotonous work daily, and half of my days are spent wondering around the store looking for things to do. The hours are okay, but I do not agree with making employees work on major family holidays. Management sometimes struggles with disciplining poor behavior."
good,"Taxi Walgreen is een gezellig familiebedrijf waar er voor word gezorgd dat de passagiers leuk maar vooral veilig van A naar B worden gebracht."
good,I am driven to help others and make people smile. I loved being able to help others quickly and efficiently.  I was able to work with some great people who were dedicated to customer satisfaction.
good,Great place to work just not enough help is hired. Your pretty much running the whole operation by yourself with little help from Pharmacist.
good,"Working at Walgreens was enjoyable. I got along with my co-workers very well and enjoyed helping customers. I particularly liked resolving problems for both employees and patrons alike. Management had a difficult time relating to the staff, but they tried. The most difficult part of my job was my schedule. My schedule made it difficult on my family life and would change regularly. That being said I really enjoyed the people."
good,"hours were not good, rate of pay was not good. good place though for career advancement. lunches were 30 mins unpaid only if you worked more then 8 hours. 10 min breaks"
good,"This job does present a stressful environment, however you can learn a valuable trade/career if you apply yourself. This job is not made for everyone you must have an open mind to lead, serve and grow."
good,"I enjoyed working for Walgreens, but when management changed and the store wasn't being run properly it effected the work environment."
good,Great experience learned about different medical plans and how the health industry is incorporated.fun place with supportive management and coworkers.
good,I worked nights at first then transferred to days. When I did that it became increasingly difficult to get hours switched for my son's sporting events. But overall I enjoyed working there.
good,"The first 8 months were spent as a service clerk. I was then recruited to be trained as a photo technician - 2 yrs spent in that department & offered the Head Photo Specialist position. Then I was recruited to go into pharmacy to act as a cross-trained photo specialist - became a regular pharmacy employee & promoted to Sr. Tech after earning certification, 1.5 yrs prior to resignation. I was give multiple opportunities to excel, and because of that I stand where I do today in my career."
good,"We follow a particular work flow which enables everyone to rotate during the shifts, I have learned a lot at walgreens ex; how to read &  type scripts, the different class of medications, insurance billing, multi-tasking, being a team player,  resolving insurance issues, & learing how to deal with all different types of people,   I have built long lasting relationships with most of my co-workers, management  needs improvement & more training , the hardest part of my job is dealing with patients some of course can be very difficult but its my job to remain understanding & to accomodate their needs, the most enjoyable part of the job is also the patients I have built great relationships with most of them in my 9 years of service with walgreens & they really make my day, they trust & depend on me & I provide them with excellent yet personable service..."
good,"meeting new people"
good,"A typical day at work usually begins really slow and gets busier after 4pm. I learned that not everyone has a good day and that it's easier to ignore what people say rather than take it personal. Management at work was poor but the shift leads we're very nice and responsible. My coworkers were reliable and caring. Each one of them were hardworking and helpful. We all worked as a team each closing shift. The  hardest part of the job was probably days when we got shipment in. Until I learned how to balance restocking items and watching the front of the store to check people out. The most enjoyable part of the job was probably the ""5 min meetings"" that we'd have everyday at 3:55. We'd talk about daily goals and experience in the store from the previous day."
good,"Hello,  a typical day generally starts off with customer service ring up rx, typing in new prescriptions,., Then follow- up with team member to complete daily task returns, third party issues , inventory etc.  Then, rotate to back to fill and count prescriptions,help with third party issues and assist pharmacist.  For the most part part I worked well with co-workers.  The most enjoyable  part of my job was the job. I really loved my job"
good,basically using foh and boh methods and inventory checks everyday. building small relationships with customers and helping elderly customers with their walgreens experience
good,Walgreens was at one time a very pleasant to work for but in the yrs they have taken away hrs due to economy and because of that people are really going at each other. I Love to work with people but not if they are stressed out.
good,"This a customer service center and with no time to spare. Walgreens is a very competitive business, and very aggressive with the management of their employees. That being said, this is not a work place for the faint harted. Be prepared to hear peoples complaints and be sitting all day taking calls. On the other hand, you get to talk to lots of people and meet good co-workers"
good,"My experience with the company as a cashier has gone well for the most part. Some employees get away from doing their work but management keeps them moving. For the amount of work, breaks could be a little longer. Stores are understaffed big time, meaning employees cannot do what they were hired to do. Still hate how they sell cigarettes when they are a pharmaceutical company. :-("
good,Its was a good learning management experience for me. work/life balance is not bad but the culture needs some improvements. the basic agenda is on point but the overall structure needs a bit change.
good,"Work is never the same from day to day.  The customers that come in have different needs and their moods can range from pleasant to irate. Trying to stay one step ahead and reach a solution that is agreeable to both the company and the customer is probably the hardest part of the job.  The best part by far though, is watching customers walk out of the store with a smile on their face.  I love seeing women walk out of the store with their heads held high and a sparkle in their eyes."
good,home in the comfort of my home. Signed on when ever I wanted to. No management was my own worker. Co-works that I spoke to through e-mail was helpful indeed. Hardest part staying up and giving the customers great customer service. home base
good,"people were great, i was on my internship and they wanted to hire me but no position was available but it was a great place to work."
good,Great place to start as a certified pharmacy technician. Experienced pharmacists to help guide in training for someone straight out of school.
good,Working at walgreens is a typical work environment where we as coworkers treat each other like family and work as a team but in a professional way. We all depend on each other to do our parts
good,"I love the customers, and I love where I work. the management team need more work and better understanding of their work duties."
good,Easy work. management kind of pushed me away. A lot of he said/she said non-sense. My first job. I've always shopped at Walgreens and had a good experience just working there is definitely different.
good,Get along great with everyone. Love the monthly luncheons. Points on my balance reward card for employee surveys which I could spend in the stores. Learning excellent customer service skills.
good,"The workplace environment is very enjoyable. The people selected to work here are pleasant to work with. Scheduling on the other hand was what I believe to be the downfall in this company. The hardest part of this job was to get hours. I was given a good amount of hours to start with, and then the company chose to hire more employees, therefore leaving me with less than needed hours in a weeks time. I very much enjoy this job. Walgreens has taught me so much within the last few months."
good,Walgreens is one of those jobs that is pretty boring unless you make it a fun environment. This job basically where I figured out that I was decent a sales. My manager used to praise me for getting top sales in the region. Overall hardest thing is customers and easiest is actual work.
good,You do get Christmas day off and they offer benefits and depending on who you work with the other employees can be awesome. I did learn about lay-a-way and how to work in the customer service department. The best part of the job was customers.
good,"The co-workers were more about gossiping than actually working. Good way to get customer service training. Enjoyed dealing with customers, being in the tourist part of town I got to meet a lot of people from different countries."
good,Walgreens appreciates its workers. I know that every month we had an employee of the month and you would get rewarded with a $25 giftcard.  My district was fun and I had a blast working with the people I did. The only thing I didn't like was the changes they were making.
good,"Assisted customers by providing information and resolving their complaints."
good,It was a very busy work environment but I enjoy working with all my co-workers and I have gotten to know a lot of our patients.
good,"I have worked for Walgreens through thick and then. Sometimes it feels like a great place to work and other times it is miserable. It depends on your management team and coworkers. The company itself, seems like a fine company to work for."
good,"Got along very well with all co-workers."
good,"My job is to develop the various photos that customers bring to Walgreens. Many of these photos are stored in electronic devices such as memory cards, cell phones or disposable cameras. With the help of the machines and equipment that I have in the photo department, I help the customer prolongue their memories trough photos.  I also do a lot of customer services.  I have to poitn the customer to the right directions anytime that their are looking for any of the products or services that we provide."
good,I enjoyed the employees as well as the management....overall good company to work for. I am however unhappy with the hours required as I am unable to continue working 2nd shift only.
good,"There is no potential to grow or make a career out of walgreens. In all the years that I have been there I have experienced the constant reform of policies and procedures that favors only the profitability of the company. Seemingly every other month there would be a new new policy to restrict hours, mandatory increase in workload etc.. When it was mandatory that I had to sign documents agreeing that my pay rate may or may not cut as the company can determine, that was it for me."
good,"Typically week days are busy, weekends are more casual. Interacting with customers and various types of people proves to be the most enjoyable part of the job. Also working at Walgreens has taught me a great deal about the meaning of customer service and satisfaction."
good,"I always enjoyed interacting with my customers, especially my regulars. Helping them live an easier, more comfortable life was a great reward. On the other hand, management was not very responsive to employee concerns and the wages were nowhere near sufficient."
good,"Overall I believe Walgreens is a good company.  I learned a lot about management, supervision of employees, and time management.  In my opinion it's largely a team oriented work environment and it's important to use your resources (employees) in the most efficient manner possible.  Making sure the right people are being used to complete tasks/projects that best suites their abilities."
good,helping sustomer with ther everyday purchases and returns
good,"A typical day at work for me would consist of, getting my team together for a productive day by assigning them all jobs according to their work area. I learned how to deal with all types of people there, it made me more rounded. The management was horrible, i was disrespected daily and called out of my name on many occasions. The hardest part of my job was making it past the days the store manager was in. The most enjoyable part was the team of people i worked with. The benefits were wonderful, but the stress caused by working here was not worth it."
good,"Days consist of a lot of stocking, cleaning, cashiering, and facing. A good environment in which to apply the skills I already acquired."
good,Great place to work and the people was willing to work. I don't know what else to say.
good,"While the job could be a little repetitive, the working atmosphere was pleasant and I enjoyed all of my co-workers"
good,Great for part-time work if your a student or just looking for part time work this would be a great job.
good,the management sucks and the area is a slow area and no hours. The team is amazing when it wants to be.
good,I have worked for Walgreens since 2007. It has been a very interesting learning experience. I started as a service clerk and earned my position the pharmacy department. Any further details are available upon request.
good,"Working at Walgreens was pretty decent. I was able to maintain a neutral relationship with all of the staff. I learned how to operate most of the machinery within the photo department, which was quite fun. I learned how to stay calm even when things are hectic, also keeping in mind that there are still individuals who are not accepting to the differences of cuture and individuality. "
good,The most enjoyable part of the my sift lead is interaction with customers & co-workers in a positive and upbeat mode.  I have been a manager over numerous employees for many years.The hardest part of the job is manual labor; unloading a truck and stocking merchandise on high shelves on a ladder.  I signed on with the agreement that I would advance fast-track and that has not happened yet.
good,when i worked overnights i worked 10 hour shifts 7 nights straight and then was off for 7 nights. it was a strange and terrible schedule.
good,"Walgreens in Montana is not your typical Walgreens. I take pride in my store and the job I do, and enjoy a challenge. Customers appreciate a person that is willing to go above and beyond for them."
good,Working at Walgreen's had taught me quite a bit about customer courtesy. I had previous customer service experience and Walgreen's added to my knowledge.
good,"•	Receive, sort and record inventory, and replenish stock daily and ensure pharmacist has right product. "
good,Overall nice place to work but can be hectic at times.  Typical work day involves review data for new prescriptions as well as for refill prescription. Checking to make sure correct product/drug is being dispensed to the patient. Overall pharmacy technicians are well trained. Pharmacy software is user friendly. One of the things I learned is being able to multitask and control work flow.
good,It's an okay place to work. Not really exciting or challenging.
good,"I left here due to wanting to advance to management after 5 years of working here. Was told due to lack of degree, no..Then they would hire a manager that I would train. This was a 24/7 store so worked every holiday, evenings and weekends"
good,"A typical day opening the store starts with counting the safe, putting out tills in deparments, checking email, administrative inventory functions (price changes, markdowns, etc.)  Following employees arrival for shift, handling vendor receiving, customer service calls, running change to cashiers, setting daily goals with staff and a daily departmental worklist.  Supporting staff in completion of worklist.  Suppporting departments (photo, pharmacy, cosmetics)covering lunches.  Supporting pharmacy during busy times by entering scripts, filling scripts and selling scripts."
good,some managers where kool and great at what they did then their where the iones that where clueless
good,Nothing good or bad to say... It was a job where the focus changed daily.. You never new the direction of the company..
good,I love my customers. They are the reason I am there and the reason I get paid. Working with the public is never boring.
good,This pharmacy gave me the opportunity to learn and practice what I learned in school. They would allowed me to do everything a tech should do.
good,"Typical pharmacy job, w/ minimal perks.  A hybrid between data entry, insurance troubleshooting, multi-tasking, filling prescriptions, and pharmacy technician supervision and management."
good,Count by five and you will stay alive! You have to be able to do 5 different thing at one time and do them correctly. Expect to yelled at by patients and smile back!
good,"wants 1 person do 8 job at a time and train others to do jobs."
good,Teamwork is encouraged and employees are supportive of each other.
good,The managers were very sociable. The tasks themselves were mundane.
good,it's a nice job to working and friendly customers and i would go back so i can move up in the company
good,"I enjoyed my time with the company. However I feel hard work goes unnoticed by anyone in management. I poured my life into working hard to make my customers as happy as possible. I would often have to pick up the slack of the coworkers as the work is judged by the team not the individual. The customers really make it worth it, it felt like home and I believe the new mantras of the company are working hard to make that the priority. I learned a lot about what truly matter to the customer. However the actually learning programs are not helpful I was self taught for the most part. The hardest part of the job was that you can only rely on yourself. My coworkers were unmotivated and did not work as a team."
good,"Walgreens is a wonderful company to work for. I enjoyed every second of my employment. I unfortunately got caught in a Manager's bad circle which caused me to have to leave. If I had not had this experience I would still be working for this company. "
good,"Following procedures for opening/closing store"
good,The company over all is a great Company to work for just would like to get benifits and better pay ill rat it a 7 out of 10
good,I enjoyed assisting customers and learning new things.The employees treated me well.
good,I learned a lot and how to provide great customer service. I didn't like some things like being robbed several times because I often worked the late shift
good,"As a photo specialist you take peoples photo orders via internet, store kiosk, or 35mm.  You give them pre-selected time to come back, them you go over to the machine and hit a few buttons.  You put their pics in a sleeve and your done. Not bad.  What sucks is the rest of the store, which they expect you to help with no matter what you have going on in the lab."
good,"A typical day at work was always busy, there was never any free time to do anything, but work. The team was proficient and I learned how to work fast, well and with a team. I learned how to pick up on everything just by watching and within one day I had the entire routine and system memorized and was working perfectly with all of my co-workers. My co-workers were encouraging and easy to work with, but the hardest part was never having a break and I never stopped moving. However, that was also my favorite part because I love being busy and having things to do. "
good,"A good start for my first job, the only thing was they did not offer enough hours. "
good,Walgreens is an environment where you learn so many things about different medicine.  Co-workers were extremely nice
good,"Getting in now will be tough with new company direction. I would consider staying with the company if not for the medical aspect, I thoroughly enjoy the retail portion."
good,"A work day would be 8-9 hrs. A high demand on orders being processed and shipped out of state. I learned that a specialty pharmacy is a great place to work and we shipped feritly and all special needs meds around the counrty. Managment team was fair and supportive to their employees. My co workers were great we all helped each other when our station became very busy. Team players. The hardest part of the job was working in hot conditions. I really enjoyed filling orders for patient who were in home care, doctors offices and fertility clinics. I learned so much."
good,Working closely with the pharmacist and assisting elderly customers. Team work with co-workers. Enjoyed atmosphere and somedays it became tedious and nerves were shot
good,"Worked 40 hours a week. The location was always busy, very demanding. I spent a majority of the day on the phone with physicians offices or insurance companies. Filled mass amounts of prescriptions. I left every day feeling accomplished and complete."
good,"Open and Close down photo lab . Count out the reg's, face and customer service online orders."
good,The pharmacy environment is a very stressful environment. There isn't any type of down time. In retail pharmacy you work with people and insurance companies. You have to know money and how to work a register.
good,"I loved working here at first ,But after my pharmacy manager was moved to a new location it went down hill fast i hated going to work it was a everyday battle"
good,"No jobs are particularly hard with the company. I have learned a lot, in 9 years & have been provided with lots of training in different areas. The bad thing is that there is really only 1 route for advancement, and if that does not appeal to you, you are stuck at the lowest level. Company tends to start multiple new projects frequently that are not long lasting. Compensation is kept to a bare minimum (in most cases), which conflicts with the culture that is portrayed."
good,I would start my day by opening the store with a team managment. I would be a cashier until I was relieved. I would then get to my department. I would clean and pull orders of Hallmark cards. If I recieved a shipment then I would displayed the items. I would then place orders of item that need replace. I was also back up cashier when we became busy. The best part of the job was the guest that came into the store. The co-workers were a wonderful group of people. The hardest part of the job was I could not make a living on the pay rate.
good,A typical day at work is mostly stocking for the holiday's and making customers happy.
good,"It is a very fast paced environment where we encompass many different health care needs and promotions, from health care testing to immunizations to prescriptions."
good,"Build customer relations and provide customer assistance with all cosmetic products or other general area need. Ring up all customer purchases and offer knowledge of store sales, coupons, and benefits as well as product locations. Count all register money before and after each shift. Help with overflow stock in different departments within the store as well as assigned department stock. Assist upper management with inventory count of store products quarterly. Unload all and any trucks that came in. Stocked majority of the items. Check all the outdates and rotate stock. Provide assistance to all employees on the shift with stocking registers and providing requested change orders. Make sure that all employees receive breaks and lunches in a timely manner. Make sure all employees have an assignment and are sure of what the work day will entails. Provide superior service experiences for customers as a team. Did all the overall cleanliness of the store. Process photos, calendars, posters, and store signs. And all so did the majority of the resets, revisions, and displays."
good,"There was no typical day at Walgreen's, Everyday Was different. I would ring out customers, help them with their problems, Fix coupon errors. Put out new items in store. Put ad tags out and Mylars out. Which is the scan codes for products."
good,"The best part of my job is dealing with my customers, I start my day with all the tasks that I already planned for that day, sometimes I can cover all of them but sometimes I don't have the same chance. Normally I tell the techs what I want them to focus on that day in particular. Being busy the time goes very fast. I had learned to be very organized and do everything that I can when I have the time. I get along with everybody very well but not one is perfect and deal with some co-workers or staff under my supervision is a challenge, but I guess this is normal everywhere. Most of the supervisors are under a lot of pressure and the work load is very heavy and sometimes they are not available in the way that I would like. The hardest part of my job is that I would like to do more but I don't have the time and manpower to do it."
good,"Troubleshooting patient, doctor and insurance issues. Rotating in 2 hour increments to drive thru, out window(selling prescriptions), filling prescriptions and to in window(entering prescriptions)."
good,Fast paced pharmacy. Customer service oriented position.
good,"Great People, low pay but its a job and don't like the shedule changes from day to nights, nights to days every week."
good,"a typical day includes stocking and helping customers. 85% of the management is very lazy and give me and other coworkers their work to do, on top of what we have already been given to do. My co-workers are very friendly and we work together very well, we try to help each other as much as we are allowed. The hardest part of my job is not being able to voice my opinion and only being allowed to say yes to everything. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the customers and being able to help out my co-workers when allowed."
good,Enjoyable place to work.
good,It was a good job which help me experience and gain experience in the work force
good,A typical day is clocking in counting the safe and writing o do lists for my cashiers. then dig in and work.
good,Just work the management were a little hard to get along with
good,i loved working at walgreens. multitasking was my speciality and was able to work in different locations of the store
good,"Management sucks, scheduling sucks, not being given seniority sucks, lied to sucks."
good,"A typical day of work consist in maintaining the photo lab, testing the paper, processing film, completing all orders on time. I have learned to manage the photo lab as well as learning other skill from different positions in the store. I work the floor, the cosmetics department and from registers."
good,"I enjoyed it. I am a people friendly person, and was privileged to meet alot of different people"
good,This is where I started it all had a great manager I worked for but I hated the long hours we were open 24 hours. I learned everythig there is to know about retail working here.
good,"A typical day at Walgreens is defined by the attitude that the individual arrives with as they enter the door. Depending on where the employee is scheduled to work, a member of management may assign the employee tasks to achieve for the day or task-by-task. While completing the tasks, there are customers on the phone, internet orders, and most importantly, face-to-face that require immediate attention."
good,A fun environment to work in while having the ability to assist numerous patients.
good,A typical day at work includes a to do list we have to work on through the day..in between that helping customers.
good,Good company to work for. They just didn't give me enough hour's plus there was a Hireing freeze. Didn't really learn a whole lot there i was always in the stockroom tackling bays. Or in the isles putting stuff away.I worked 12 to 18 hours a week there.
good,"I loved working at Walgreens, probably one of my favorite jobs but rules are very strict. Some management is really good and others not so much. Some stores are wonderful and some stores are horrible. Just like with any job you have to roll with the punches."
good,"Walgreens is an all-around company. They have been around for many years. My position is in the pharmacy. Upon entering work, there are many assignments to complete. I process many prescriptions per day to ensure the patients get their medications to start their treatments. Since serving for the company for 3+ years, I've learned how to assist patients quickly and efficiently. Getting the patients in and out is top priority. I've learned how to multi-task and the value of customer assistance. Co-workers are easy to get along with and are there to lend a hand whenever asked. We as a team work hard to give customer satisfaction each and every time. The most hardest part of the job is finding out one of our patients suddenly pass and having to console the survived family. Although there are many road-blocks, heads are put together frequently to come up with better solutions to enhancing our company as a whole."
good,Walgreens is a great place to work. I love my job and the people i work with.
good,good company was much better before CEO change now they are cutting pay and benefits
good,Family oriented. Awesome customers. An actual working enviorment that feels like home.
good,"must be a multi-tasker to work here. expected to do the work of 3 people, but kept cutting budgeted hours"
good,Walgreens is one of the oldest drugstore companies around the Pharmacists are very knowledgeable for the customers medication needs.
good,"I loved it there ,the job & people .. The management was awesome and always helpful in any way I ever needed.  They always  showed  their employees respect  No matter what the circumstances. I just needed more hours in the end."
good,"Walgreens was a place i worked during my high school years and loved the experience. I learned a lot being there, though the pay wasn't always great but it was enough at the time."
good,"Working at Walgreens helps build communication skills when working with other team members, as well as customers. Building a proper work ethic will insure you succeed at Walgreens."
good,Good team! A great place to look for oportunities to create a good customer service.
good,It was always a clean work environment. The staff was friendly and always did their jobs. I would definitely work here again. Everyone treated everyone with respect.
good,"Nice company to work for, management is okay. Position was challenging, yet rewarding working dually in the pharmacy and store. Customer service is always enjoyable."
good,"I would work 7/10 hour days straight and then get 7-ish days off. The pay was decent, but a lot of work got heaped onto graveyard, which was just myself and my shift lead. It could become a bit frustrating at times. That said, my shift lead and I had a great rapport, which made work easier. The most concerning aspect of the job was the lack of security for the employees. Every night, merchandise would get stolen and there were several times were I was concerned for my safety and the safety of the other customers."
good,Good start to obtain experience. Team meetings makes a difference. Team work would make things easier. Customers love a well kept employee. Make sure all task are completed.
good,I worked with the equipment and got aquainted with a freindly helpful staff at all the stores. I was a technician and a corporate employee. The jobs were all over the state so a day may be mostly driving to the stores.
good,If you work in Walgreens in northern regions they know how to manage better. Southern regions do not know this as well. The store I currently work at the management is lacking in having teamwork being even and fair. You will question your worth multiple times a day there as well.
good,"Great place to work. Sometimes it can get extremely busy. Sometimes the hardest part of work is angry customers if issues arise. I enjoy the fact that it's so fast paced, the hours fly by."
good,"Keep focused, do your job and build communication and teamwork skills. It's a great opportunity to create skill sets and to explore retail. Have fun and keep positive."
good,"I enjoyed the side responsibilities you have working there such as replacing tags, resetting shelves and items. I worked as a beauty consultant so I learned and had to be updated about the sales and beauty products. I also cut and replaced coupons and organized them for the customers to use at their convenience. I also did the front register some days. There was always something to do while working your shift."
good,nice place to work good work environment some benefits good but can be better pay and work flexibility which is the main problem for most of the workers
good,Very fast paced . Very respectful to customers and willing to work overtime if needed. They will train you for almost two weeks . That’s the best part.
good,"Everyday we stock, help customers and I enjoy helping the customers make their photos the best they can be. Help with Western Union Transactions and stop shoplifters"
good,"Productive and fun workplace, good supportive management, very dynamic work culture. Learnt a lot. Normally a typical day at work, with ample room for learning."
good,There is a lot of support from upper management and it is nice knowing they are always there esp when there are issues and support is needed. But there always seems to be something new added to our plate as pharmacists that add stress to the job because that adds another metric we have to meet in a time where there isn't always time for everything.
good,They generally care about the employees and the customers. Very family oreiented work place with a great environment. When work piles on any Associate  mangers are willing to help
good,"I believe the company has lost its Original focus. Became a global corporation and treats employees as if they are expendable at times. It was not a bad company by any means, but certainly changing faster than it knows how to quite yet."
good,"I was let go because the branch was losing money and was one of the lower-selling stores. All of the full-time people kept their jobs because of insurance, but I was let go for being part-time and not working as long as others. shame, really."
good,I worked here for a summer job and it was both fun and a learning experience. I would have to recommend this to all people trying to get their first job.
good,"It was a great experience, hard working environment, great atmosphere as well as coworkers. Busy days and busy nights but as long as everyone worked as a team anything is possible."
good,Walgreens was a great place to work for but when they started to illuminate positions that put a burden on everyone.  I have nothing bad to say about any of my jobs because I had a good learning experience with them all.
good,The workers are Walgreens are typically friendly and many managers were outstanding. It is a good place to work in a communal environment. It does have benefits.
good,People help you succeed  at this job. They make sure you get the correct training to succeed. This is a great place to work at and develop  a career  at. There is alot of growth in here as well.
good,"I have been with the company for seven years and they always encourage advancement, I could not be happier working in the environment that I do. I recommended friends to come and work for the company and they still work for them also."
good,I enjoyed my time there and always felt I had something to do!  Management was friendly and took my class schedule into account.  Learning and job growth were always prioritized.
good,My time at Walgreen was enjoyable. My favorite part about the company is the freedom you get. i.e. building your own customers service skills by just being yourself and Walgreen encourages that.
good,Loved meeting new faces and building relationships with customers. Some knew me on a first named based and others would only want me to service them when inquiring about photo issues.
good,Very easy job just couldn't do the shift to late for me. Some of the co-worker there have problem staying to there self don't know how to stop talking.
good,"Working for walgreens was so fun because I had great coworkers who cared about their jobs, allowing them to perform better. However I did think we were understaffed more than most of the time."
good,This job can be boring but it is an important job nonetheless. The pharmacists and technicians work side by side to ensure each customer is properly taken care of.
good,"Walgreens was a nice place to work although I was part time they basically had me working full time hours and being paid part time pay w/ no benefits. Although I wasn't really bothered by that since I started working here young and stuff like that didn't bother me too much until I wanted to do things in life such as buy a car or rent an apartment. I will say the turn over rate was high, but it could have been worse. Customers were very nice more times than not, so that was  never an issue. Just wish the pay had have been better than $9 an hour. Or I would have still been there."
good,"I actually worked for this company through a youth program so I wasn’t exactly working or getting paid by Walgreens. I enjoyed how I got to make my own schedule and overall, it was an okay job. But then again I was working through a youth program, so I don’t really know the pay, benefits, or anything to have to do with the employees on that behalf. It was kind of like an internship, but it was good experience."
good,"I always enjoyed this company and always felt that I was being taken care of as an employee until I was fired, without any write-ups or warnings for breaking policy on, in my opinion, a ridiculous tobacco sales policy of having to card everyone, including elderly people."
good,The pay is decent. no off days for holidays. No holiday pay. dont trust the managers!!! They are like snakes in the grass. Customers sometimes make the job a little easier. 30 minute lunch breaks. Employee discount. Ummm and nice sales other than that don’t think you can make a living at Walgreens they cut hours after holiday time is over. Good for high school and maybe college students
good,"Walgreens offers opportunities to learn and grow in a safe, accepting environment. I have learned many of my computer skills (Excel, Office, PowerPoint, for example) during my time working with Walgreens."
good,This company has a decent culture that everyone follows. The company themselves have made changes and that has helped a lot of employees stay over the years.
good,Always fast past at Walgreens. Management in store is great but company is constantly changing. They hired me without my certification through the state and within a year payed for me to do it.
good,I have no formal feedback to provide for this company.  My experience was unique and not necessarily related to anyone else's experience. I would prefer not to expand on this.
good,Great  experience to work . Fun place and staff. Always coming up with new ideas in pharmacy world. ………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….
good,"Compared to other minimum wage jobs it was not strenuous, but hours were tight at the end. I would recommend for students or others who do not require a living wage."
good,"Managers can make the store or break it. If you have a bad unsupportive manager they represent the company for you and that's how you'll view all walgreens. Not every store is bad. I really enjoyed working at the stores, but I feel as though they underpay their employees. I was an assistant manager and pharmacy techs made more money than me and even though I was expected to do more and had more tenure. Besides that, the company is great to work for."
good,"Working at Walgreens provided a great opportunity to balance work and professional school. I was able to pick and choose hours, easily switch shifts with other student workers, and adjust my hours as needed."
good,"When I started with this company is was great, then management changed hands and policy wasn't followed. Hours were cut short, we were doing more with less and putting patients at risk."
good,"good company to work for decent hours fair pay excellent opportunities for improvement and advancement "
good,you have to be able to work in a changing environment based on customer needs and wants while completing daily task and goals per company and store driven directives
good,This company always has something to do. New lessons to learn and areas to work. New merchandise arriving to display for the customers. The customers are wonderful to work with.
good,"Overall, the company has great benefits and respects their employees. I learned most of my basic work ethics there and was acclimated to retail and working in general under Walgreens. Be careful under what management you are under as each store is different. This is what makes or brakes most of the stores."
good,Loved this job. Loved the atmosphere. Loved the customers. Loved the experience altogether. I still keep in contact with old customers from when I worked there.
good,"I worked at Walgreens for 11 months, working 6 or 8 hour shifts. It was a good job for going to school. The hardest part was dealing with customers who weren’t happy and when the computers didn’t act right. Pay wasn’t good enough for what all we had to do."
good,There was a lot to do at Walgreens and it didn’t matter what your job position was you needed to know how to do everything. Working at Walgreens you ended up doing tasks that weren’t yours.
good,"Retail means working weekends, every weekend.  Some of Walgreens plans do not include selling items that need to sell, but rather following policy which are mostly built on archaic processes.  Hours are cut and repetitive and unnecessary work gets added."
good,"this was a good job to start with in high school, it's a good place to get customer service skills. You do quite a bit of stocking and after being there for a bit they will start to train you in different areas so your able get experience everywhere"
good,I loved working at Walgreens and getting to know the great people I had the chance to while there. Upper management did a great job of communicating with associates about changes and resources. I actually regret resigning.
good,This employer gave me a chance to become a certified technician.  Learn different things working in the pharmacy.  Enjoyed the employer and all of the employees
good,The Walgreen was an OK place to work with great people. It was a small store environment. It can be boring at time if there is no customer. The mangers were helpful at times.
good,I was always working hard and was on time and did everything I was asked to do but I was never recognized for anything I was doing. Certain times I was the only one helping customers
good,"Wasn’t the worst but nothing special either. They were very short staffed, hours were like a carnival ride just up and down.  Even the workers there let me know that walgreens has gone down the last few years, more about money than patient care."
good,It was pretty good for the most part but I just wasn’t for me it is a great job and it pays well ......................................................
good,"ive been working here a while now, and i love my co workers and customers, especially the regulars, but i never really got a pay raise and they will rely on ypu to train everybody and pick up their slack, and thr district managers are RUDE."
good,I cleaned and organized all the products and helped customers find what they needed and the coworkers were very friendly when I first started working there .
good,"Fast paced work environment with great enrichment reward, effective workflow management, team participation, decent management, learning opportuinities ."
good,Working at Walgreens was a good experience. I went from working behind a register to behind the counter in the pharmacy. Payed for classes and books for pharmacy. Gave flash cards and study guides. Reimbursed for background checks and finger prints. On the job training for pharmacy.
good,Walgreen's is a great place to work workplace is small just how i would like it. If i had not decided to go for nursing i would have stayed and became a pharmacy technician until i got my pharmacist license
good,Walgreens is a good corporation to work for. But if you want regular hours because of family or other things they usually want you to have an open schedule.
good,If you're at the register you will be greeting customers coming in and out of the store. I learned repetition and consistency. The management was kind and helpful
good,"I worked for Walgreen while attending college to complete the academic requirements to achieve my degree which I received in January 2019."
good,"Working at Walgreens is a good job if you like stocking, the typical day at Walgreens for me was easy & sample I never had a hard day everything was smooth working there"
good,"At the time my son went to school down the street from the Walgreen's that I worked at I was able to drop my son off to school and go in. I was able to go get my son after school, They scheduled around my son which was what i needed to not have to pay for a babysitter."
good,"Helping people all day long , makes you feel you are actually doing something good. sometimes there is a question that really needs an immediate attention and you are just right there at the appropriate time to solve it."
good,This was my first job ever. And It was given to me through school. I worked there for about 3 months and it taught me the basics of getting a job and taught me responsibility.
good,"teamwork is very important in this place, only because new customers would always come in, and as a cashier it was very difficult to to three things at a time. by three things i mean, i had to cash in the customers who are in line and answer any phone calls from the store and help customers that were all the way in the back. "
good,Overall decent place to work mainly for part time HS students. Full time capabilities as a pharmacy technician in the back. Management works well with workers.
good,Job okay if your in school or would like fast advancement in the company. Hard to have a outside life since your always working. Short staffed most of the time so you would learn how to multi-task a lot of the time.
good,Very busy store so you have to be a multi tasker. Work in a small town so you have a good relationship with customers. Have good relationship with coworkers to help each other out.
good,"Working there could feel exhausting if you don't get into the rhythm of retail. I worked at 755 broadway, and it was hard at first because it was a busy store, but after a week or so I understood the flow."
good,Everyone is so friendly and plenty of team work to get jobs done.   Management is great with answering any questions that you may have. The culture of the company is promoting good health. The most enjoyable thing about the job are the customers.
good,"I started with the Company at the age of 18. I grew up there. Lots of room for advancement. Started on the floor, moved to the Pharmacy. (loved it but crazy busy and they cut hours like crazy) I worked with some of the best people. I worked at the District Office, which was great. I learned a ton there. Moved to Specialty site and there is just not enough help. However the goal and how many people they help is beyond words. I have learned that not every place has to be crazy busy. I truly believe I am who I am because of all the years, experience, and so many amazing people treated me like family. (something I lacked)"
good,"On a typical day, I would open the store and prepare it for business. Management was awesome! Outside of some struggles going on in the company, this was a great place to work. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to assist customers and help them retrieve the products they believed would bring a higher, healthier quality to their lives."
good,Working in customer service can be difficult dealing with different personalities on a daily. However with a good team the work environment can be manageable even when theres a high volume of ppl in the store.
good,"I have had a great time working at Walgreens! Between the flexibility of the hours, the employees I work with and my customer base you couldn't ask for a better team to be apart of"
good,"Very diverse company. Great benefits, friendly evironments overall."
good,I was usually on the register or on the floor occasionally worked in the photo department. i enjoyed working at Walgreen's because it was my first job and I had the opportunity to grow as a person and learn my strengths and weaknesses.
good,"The job was almost always busy, not much different from any cashier job, what you see is usually what you get. Offered work shirt and employee discount. Management needed some work at the time."
good,Managers are flexible with employee schedules and can work out any discrepancies. The work is clear cut and set out for you each day when you come in so you always know what there is for you to do.
good,"The pharmacy I worked at was a very busy one, so I would usually be running around all day taking care of patients. I loved to help so I did not mind at all. I learned something new every day which was always very exciting. My boss and co-workers were very nice and helpful. It was difficult at first to pick up on the routine and how the system worked, but with time and help from everyone at the pharmacy, I learned in no time."
good,I worked front  cash register . If a  customer  Needed help finding anything in the store i would help them. When i didn’t have customer i would go in every row to make sure everything in place and put new  products up.
good,"My time at Walgreens was brief, but from the time I was there until I left the environment was somewhat quiet. We were the busiest over the weekend due to alcohol sales."
good,"They've fixed the problems that they had when I was working there so it's not to bad now. You still get the horrid customers screaming and yelling in your face, but that's all customer service jobs. So if you can handle dealing with over grown toddlers you're good."
good,Great job for entry level and plenty of room for advancement. Good experience for customer service as well as other positions. Stay on your feet most of your shift.
good,Not my cup of tea. At times it is was ok. If you are flexible with your schedule then its not a bad place to work. I think this would be a good fit for retired people looking to keep busy.
good,"Working in the pharmacy requires a level head that will let you work effectively at your job. You'll need to fill prescriptions, deal with insurance companies, as well as work with customers."
good,"The environment of Walgreens was fine. Despite the frequent robberies, it wasn't a too bad job to work at. The managers were pretty nice and the customers were nice."
good,I learned a lot during my internship but didn't feel appreciated by the company.  They hired someone new while working there instead of offering me a chance at the job.  I still haven't found a job in the field.
good,"When I worked here every shift consisted of stocking shelves, putting up sales tags and taking them down. Taking in truck and putting it away on scheduled delivery days. We also dealt with customers on a daily basis. I gained good understanding of customer service."
good,When I started with the Company in 2004 it really was family oriented business and the atmosphere at work was great. Things change and so did the moral of the company.
good,I like working with walgreens they help their employee's.. They work with you and the co workers are nice. Oh and they match your 401k... Sometimes you get rude customers but what job doesn't... You have to be a people's person to work in any retail store
good,"If you're looking for something easy to do and enjoy for  about $10-$12/hr, I recommend Walgreens. Simple responsibilities and easy assignments. Stocking, cashier, unloading trucks, sweeping, cleaning, etc. I recommend working at Walgreens. Apart from the discount (which isn't that good), it's a good start."
good,Currently struggling to recapture it's lost culture and former vitality. Opportunities still exist but in much fewer numbers. Employees struggle to find meaning in their day to day tasks.
good,"Walgreens is a really good start paying job, i would recommend this job also. Best environment & friendly workers. To say the least, walgreens management is poor and Hours are also poor. Hours are being cut to all walgreens stores and slowly becoming unreliable when needed hours."
good,"Worked nights so don’t really know what went on during daytime. Just did my job and left, reported to night shift boss, when I did see store manager we would discuss whatever was going on..., promotional material other matters"
good,"It was a great experience, but I don't like how I was laid off and only had a 9-day notice to find a job. Managers are fun to be around and cool. It was relaxed but if fewer people are scheduled on truck days it was tough."
good,I really loved working at Walgreens I learned a lot about the background of the store and the employees I made lots of friends and the pay was good for the job I was doing !
good,Management was not proactive. I did not feel like they cared about their employees and employee accomplishments. They did not give you the opportunity to grow in other areas of skills.
good,"To work for Walgreen is ok, You must be on your feet during your shift. From the moment you came is very busy, thus all the different phases of pharmacy are presented through out the day."
good,"Managing needs to be more mindful of working on sales floor, pharmacy and with customers as well as employees! Not sit in office on chairs all day. No manager should show favortism."
good,"I had a great experience at Walgreens it was a great job they never gave me anything that I cannot handle, this job really helped me build consumer service skills as well."
good,"Being at walgreens I learned a lot and became a better people person. Being able to communicate with customers and help people is something I enjoy along with Stocking food, beverages, etc."
good,Walgreens was a great part time job while I completed my training at North Arkansas College. It allowed me to work weekends and evenings. I recommend all workers spend some time in retail.
good,"Running the front end was a fairly easy job. There were times when I would have to handle an upset customer, but for the most part it was not an issue. However, early mornings and late evenings were often incredibly slow, and assigned tasks such as cleaning, inventory arrangement, and stocking did not take that long. As a result, there was a lot of standing around doing nothing. I can't speak for other positions such as running the floors however."
good,"In our busy schedules over at Walgreens, there is rarely any down time. When there are no customers at the time being, we work on issues involving insurances and/or work to ensure that inventory is adequate enough to meet the needs of our patients. Happy or upset, each customer's thoughts and feelings in regards to the pharmacy is one of our many responsibilities when it comes to our jobs. At times, it can be a difficult job but the most rewarding part of it all is seeing patients over and over again and realizing that you truly make a difference in these peoples lives from a medical standpoint but also on an interpersonal level."
good,Walgreens is always busy no matter where you are or what time of day it is. You will never be bored. Either with tasks or customers you are always doing something.
good,"Fun place to work, at least where and when I worked there. I was in high school and worked with all my friends. My management was really great but that isn't the same story at every store."
good,"Transcribed patients and prescription information into Walgreens database"
good,"A typical day at work was an enjoyable and very fast pace. I was happy to learn everything from photo, pharmacy and expanding my knowledge for customer service."
good,"Work days were busy in waves, fun interaction with customers, met great people. Shifts were flexible, store interest versatility (photo, pharmacy, cosmetics, on floor)."
good,"good ethic, people are held accountable for their actions. The chances of getting a promotion is high it motivates you to work hard and progress with goals for the future."
good,"The day-to-day isn't too bad. It does get pretty old after about the 3 month mark though, and some of the customers will wear your patience very thin."
good,"Good place to work, very laid back. Things have changed over the years. The ones that have been there awhile have seen a decline, but it is what it is. Not a bad place to work at all."
good,I had worked in Walgreens for 6 months. I got to see different cultural people from all over the world. I used to work in a tourist area. I could see so many people there.
good,"Work day varies. Some days are very hectic, others slow.  Management expect stock truck to be put away by end of shift. With limited staff and numerous customers, it is hard to comply with that expectation."
good,"Loved working there learned a lot was fun and fast paced, had a lot of regulars specifically ask for me, completed my tasks in a timely and safe manner"
good,I believe Walgreens is a very easy place to begin your working career. The expected work is very straight forward. The work allows you to adapt skills you'll need at any other job.
good,"Nice place to work, really cool managers.the only thing was the shoplifters can really get out of hand, and you cant do nothing about it.i was at a Flagship store, that was 3 floors."
good,I like working there because of Flexible hours and opportunity for growth. Nice management and friendly coworkers. Good benefits for 30 hours or more.
good,"Not a bad company to work for. You get a decent wage and are given online modules to complete to help you become familiar with daily tasks. The job consists of filling, typing prescriptions, a lot of customer interaction, checking stock and ordering meds. Dealing with insurances and sometimes difficult patients can be tough. This job really depends on the coworkers you have. If they are friendly, helpful and encouraging, then you will definitely love the job."
good,Walgreen was my first job. I recommend working at Walgreen for anyone looking for a first job and wants to be a part of a company that does allow for growth in skills in the workforce.
good,"Walgreens is a good place to work, employees were helpful and nice, management was easy to get along with and helpful. Job was easy to learn. Would recommend."
good,"As a sales associate at Walgreens, which is basically a cashier that also handles stocking the shelves, the job is pretty straight-forward. It's not very stressful and you get the hang of it fairly quickly. As with any retail job it requires good face-to-face encounters with customers and unfortunately you may encounter a few customers that just aren't having a great day. However overall the customers are kind and respectful, and the coworkers were fantastic. The management was also quite relaxed which really added to a positive overall experience."
good,"A  fast paced centered on customer satisfaction.  I gained excellent  technician skills, and work ethics.  Patients healthcare need is most enjoyable."
good,"Job was often slow paced, but steady.  Activity picks up closer to holidays.  Employees often had help while working from other coworkers.  There was limited range for promotion but it was available."
good,While i was working a walgreens i had a fun experience. work was from 9 to 2. it was a syep job so i worked limited hours. i stocked and had a fun time while doing it.
good,"I enjoyed working at Walgreens. Being a pharmacy intern, I did not have the pressure that the pharmacists often spoke about. So it was strictly patient relationships and working with insurance companies to ensure a positive outcome for the patients. Ever since Walgreens and most other retail stores cut hours, I will say the amount of work increased with the same amount of time to do it."
good,"Better security for employees. Too much theft and even reports of getting robbed. "
good,"On a normal day I showed up for my shift and went to the back to clock in. I then asked where I was going to be for the day, and usually it would be up front working the register"
good,"Walgreens as a company seems unsure how they want to handle their future. They flip flop between initiatives and the company seems to have a ""theme of the week"" feel lately. One week we push a charity, the next nps. If youre lucky enough to get a good store manager they can make it bearable but Walgreens has a tendency to latch onto managers that have been around for decades and seem incapable of keeping up with a changing company ethics. Theyre slow to promote from within."
good,It’s a good job to start at in order to build customer relationships and work with others on a team. Walgreens is not a place to stay if you plan on building outside of retail.
good,"The other employees are very kind and the work is relatively easy. I had a great time working there and I learned a lot. The only negative thing about it would be an occasional rude customer, that being said in my opinion the customers were very kind and understanding if there was an issue."
good,"The time working here, I learned a lot about all the products the store carried. It was easy for me to know where the products were in order to best help the customers. I over all liked working at Walgreens. I enjoyed interacting and seeing the normal day to day customers that always came in. Over all experience with the company wasn't bad at all. If I had to go and work retail again, I would go back to Walgreens as my first choice."
good,"Jusy do your best tp please not managers but the ones right under them. Ecause tjey seem to control everything on the floor."
good,"Great customer service policies. Schedules are often difficult, but are part of the fair scheduling program.  Great people to work with.  Opportunities to advance if you have a college degree."
good,Takes itself pretty seriously but they care about their employees. It would be nice if the pay was a lot better though you only get minimum wage for the amount of work they expect of you.
good,"worked almost 5 years with company"
good,I have a great time working here nice and friendly co workers. i also enjoyed the work and the costumers they were very nice and i would always try to be the most helpful to them.
good,"Working at Walgreens is an interesting experience. The best part about the job is the sales floor working staff. The Management can lack sometimes with scheduling and the workplace app, but they work with your schedule. However, there are no paid lunches, and the job can be stressful at times with impatient customers."
good,My manager works with each employee with regards to development and helps to maintain a stable work life balance.  We have a great team.   I enjoy the autonomy when I am on shift by myself.
good,"Typical retail pharmacy.  Cut tech hours, do more with less. Management often trying to help out by only filling scripts...which leads to errors and them not being able to get their own work done. Upper management only truly cared about their bonuses.  Was always intimidating to see people dressed in suits and ties, while the grunt works looked like slobs do to their choice in uniform."
good,Started working a the photo lab and got promotion to pharmacy tech. Learning experience with type of medication and costumer services busy all the time..
good,Learned how to interact with multiple levels of management and the general public. Workplace culture was positive and a typical day included operating the cash register and assisting customers.
good,"Worked for this company for a long time. Great company when you live in a big city, lots of support. Not so much when you live in a small town and the nearest buddy store is 30 miles away."
good,"I didn't really enjoy my time at Walgreens. I was never trained well and they would throw me into situations where I didn't know what I was doing. New employees came and went like crazy, and at 16 I felt like I was running the place, while still getting paid minimum wage. The customers were horribly rude and even things like the sanitation of the store, bathrooms, and break room were horrible."
good,Ive been apart of great stores and ive been apart of less than great stores. Varies based on manager. Ive had managers that give you a fair opportunity to grow and some that only choose their favorites.
good,"Merchandising the store for success."
good,It started out wonderful but 6 years in I feel worn down and unmotivated due to lack of encouragement. It seems like a never ending cycle of not being good enough despite dedicating your life to the company. Also the insurance is a little overpriced. The company means well but lacks positivity or optimism.
good,Gallery place itself is a interesting environment to be in regardless. But the customers were fairly decent. The staff was cool for the most part. The work is self explanatory
good,Walgreens was a great place to learn how to grow in management and within a company. I furthered my education into the Pharmacy department and walgreens helps pay for Certification as a Pharmacy Technician.
good,"Management was good, he would check in to see if were doing well. Everyone got along very well, it was a close friendship between everyone. The hardest part of the job was having to keep rushing all day, because we were always busy and it was a little chaotic at times. The best part of the job was helping people. Helping someone feel better always makes me feel like I'm improving their life in some way."
good,"It is a good job for high-school/college students and elders. Great work environment with good benefits. A day would include stocking, putting up sales tags, and helping customers."
good,"Did not have anyone work full-time, paid minimum wage. Sometimes you would have to work back to back shifts.  The GM is very nice as are the assistant managers."
good,fun but really repetitive really boring and soul crushing but the work itself is easier than you would expect only draw back is standing on your feet to long
good,"If you want to move up at Walgreens, it's who you know, not how hard you work. The company is a good fit for anyone who is willing to learn different ways to do tasks from different managers. Some leaders should not be leaders."
good,"While stocking inventory in its desired area, it is satisfying to also be able to keep a steady pace and not having to be in a rush. Fun work environment."
good,fun place to work when I was there only if the senior techs would let you learn and help you once you recieved your license.  Other wise I probably would have stayed back then
good,working in a retirement community was extremely interesting as you had to work with people that required patience to handle. Cashiering was great and you got repeat customers that you could call by first name.
good,"Walgreens was my first job and it was nice I like my coworkers and I really liked the job experience I was gaining. I had a lot of difficulty with the scheduling; I was looking to start getting more hours but Instead I started receiving less hours at my primary location. When I continuously asked for more hours management stated that I would need to see if any other locations in the area had any open hours, which was really frustrating. I loved my coworkers and the learning experience and the environment but because I needed more stability."
good,"Working for this company you can expect to make it your career. There are so many opportunities for advancement. This company also takes an interest in your education, if you are in the medical field.."
good,not a bad starter job. worked in multiple places in store and liked each one. pretty easy going day to day. some days were busier than others. photo gets busy during holidays
good,This job can be relaxed and easy going and in the same day busy and fast paced. Must be great with customer service quick on your feet with answering questions and solving problems.
good,"Friendly work place, great customer-worker relationship.Great management and they appreciate and promote the hard working staff. Good benefits and raises."
good,"Walgreen's does not pay a living wage to its Customer Service Associates, and they are restructuring PTO. However they do provide  health and dental insurance and are willing to accommodate your schedule."
good,As a shift leader you spend most of your time doing minor money handling and safe control. You do spend a large amount of time ensuring stock is out and available when a customer requests it. Your last big task is to be yelled at by customers who didn't get what they wanted because you were following procedure.
good,"Work from home"
good,"It's a pretty laid back job and the people were nice. They recognized employees. The only con is you get customers who do fraudulent activities. It doesn't require too much training, but the job is easy."
good,"Work environment was very up beat, very prompt enjoyed working with staff and  helping customers, nothing wrong with working there everyone was always friendly and kind."
good,They are very  thorough when trainging and on slow days they would have you do computer training back in the pharmacy. Management and other team members were very helpful while training. The job was very fast paced.
good,I learned much about the entire cycle of store operations.  There was always something new to learn as the store is continually trying to meet customer needs.
good,It is always busy at walgreens. There is literally never a dull moment. The employees there are nice to work with. Nice environment. I really like the flexible hours. They will work with you to make sure you are able to come to work.
good,"On any given day I would punch in and jump on the register to relieve whichever manager opened that morning. Greeting our customers and chatting with the regulars was the highlight of my day. Seeing how efficiently I can get through a line of customers while keeping everyone happy was my daily goal. "
good,"Walgreens is a good company for the most part.  Some of their policies do not lend well to customer care, but they typically have the hours to employ enough techs to keep up the pace."
good,I was in highschool at the time it was the perfect job for a highschool teen I learned a lot using the computer and the photo machines I enjoyed being a photo Tech
good,The environment is either slow paced or fast paced depending on the day as well as the time. The hardest part of this job is pleasing the customers. The most enjoyable part would be my co workers.
good,"I learned a lot rotating from front end, photo, cosmetics, and some experience in pharmacy. Friendly neighborhood. My manager ROCK! You have your fair share of favorite customers and nightmare customers. Overall, it was a fun experience."
good,"I was a part of the recent buyout from Rite Aid so my experience with this company is limited. Thus far, however, the day-to-day task management is much more organized than it was with Rite Aid, but the software is outdated and requires a lot more steps."
good,"Good company, but does not set you up for achievement and moving on into the company. Will keep you at the same position as long as possible, there is no room for moving up. Great part time job for students."
good,"I was there for a contractual hire that lasted six months and I enjoyed my time there. The manager and coworkers were exceptional at making new employees (be it full time or on contracts), comfortable."
good,"Most of my coworkers are friendly and helpful towards me, very patient when I was still learning and still is whenever I need help. Though sometimes when I do need help they are too busy, it is not their fault most times, understaffed, especially in pharmacy. Hardest part are the busy days and especially customers."
good,I was the head photo specialist at Walgreens for almost 5 years. I enjoyed every aspect of my job and wish I could have stayed with the company longer. Due to personal matters I had to move out of state and could not transfer my job.
good,"In a typical day of work I fill,type,and sell prescriptions. I am also responsible for answering phone calls and assisting patients. My job also consists of me compounding any medications that Need to be compounded."
good,"I was constantly harassed during the last 6 months I worked there by my old boss who hated me, even though I was adored by the regular customers. But I loved working in customer service, I loved helping people."
good,"The pharmacy technician assisted customers with finalizing the purchase of medications, medical equipment and often times merchandise from other areas of the store. An individual in this position also ensures that customers insurance, address, phone numbers and other identifying information is current and updated as needed. This position also offers the opportunity to work with the pharmacist filling prescriptions, counting pills, measuring liquid medications and ensuring accurate information on the prescription labels."
good,"We brought in an enormous amount of money for the company, I know for certain I did.  Nothing was enough.  They moved the billing office out of state b/c it saved them money.  We were all laid off with no warning."
good,"Great company overall as they do take care of their employees. The management was the issue at that particular store at the time. Also promotions were only given to a certain group of people in that area. So, no the company itself wasn't the problem, it was the people running the show at the regional level."
good,"Very basic position, slow, but very low stress work.  Terrible pay, but nice people and unlike at other retail positions you feel slightly like you are making a difference and that the company cares about you.  Promotion opportunities are highly location dependant."
good,Some Of The Management Were Very caring & Considerate Gave Me A Schedule That’s I Could Work While Being Pregnant Gave Great Hours I Was Always Busy There The Customers That’s Came On A Regular Were Very Kind
good,As a student I was able to work full time and still go to school because my managers were understanding of my busy schedule and always made sure to accommodate me.
good,"A typical day at work was very fast paced, if you were training you needed to learn fast. It seemed to go by faster the more you had to do. The management was very friendly with staff and very understanding. I learned how to work within the store and how the organization within the store worked. The hardest part of the job was probably the long times on your feet, you rarely got breaks, alongside the required breaks. The most enjoyable was probably the coworkers, they made the day more enjoyable and worked together to complete tasks and made the job easier. The workplace was very high strung and the whole entire mood of the store was based on how to Assistant manager was feeling that day."
good,"constant customers"
good,"On a normal given day, people walk in with smiling faces and bright eyes. Even on someone's bad day, it's not hard to make them happy because the simplest smile may do enough justice."
good,Working for Walgreens has taught me a lot. When I started I had no idea what to do but over the years they have taught me everything I know now. This is a great company that I was proud to be apart of.
good,"My store is very busy. Stay changing workers , people quit or don’t show up. The employees are cool and some of the custom but most of the time the customers suck"
good,It was your basic retail environment. Management was usually decently active and attentive. Job duties were outlined well but not a high ability for advancement.
good,"sometimes incompetent management is promoted due to tenure but other than that, there's really no complaints. they offer a lot of training and great insurance to compensate for the poor pay"
good,"walgreens was great to work at for the people and the job itself. it wasn't overly demanding, but it kept you busy. i don't think it pays enough for a living wage though and could have better opportunities to advance in the company."
good,moving up within the company is very political.  It is not bad is your manager is competent but that goes without saying no matter where you work.  You will get yelled at a lot in the pharmacy so have thick skin.
good,Good employer but could only work part time. Wanted to work full time. I enjoyed the job when I was busy and the store was busy. I liked unloading the trucks and stocking shelves.
good,Please do not make me answer questions about a company that I worked for over 1 years ago. The benefits were on the cheap side. I had to change doctors and hospital in the middle of my pregnancy
good,"Work and life balance are a bit tough to handle. great work experience, get to learn and interact with the pharmacy staff and costumers. The hard part is that staff stands the who time."
good,"Get the ticketing system and see what needs to be done on a daily basis, somedays would be a printer issue, Desktop, Monitor, PC, Kiosk, servers. Management usually was good, if I had a problem I never had an issue getting an answer on any issue I had, Hardest part of the job would be the driving, any giving week i would drive 1200 miles. Most enjoyable part of my job was the people."
good,"A typical work day consists of helping customers throughout the store with finding products, stocking shelves, submitting photo orders, and selling cosmetic products."
good,Help customers from front end to pharmacy. Walgreens really pushes NPS and making sure the customer leaves happy. However with that said they are pretty tough when you do not hit targets.
good,"Managers and staff are really nice. You do have to deal with theft, sometimes daily. You learn new skills and meet really nice people. the managers where approachable, but not all."
good,Good experience for internship hours. Learned a lot of new things and ways to apply skills in every pharmacy atmosphere no matter where I land a job. (:
good,Walgreens is a solid company to work for.  They have invested in their employees which along with great communication has created a positive work environment for the current store.
good,"it was productive "
good,Great co-workers and experience. Work flow is quick paced and hectic at moments. Pharmacists are very knowledgable and helpful. The scheduling is good and fair.
good,"Walgreens is a great place to start off as a technition. When working with Walgreens, I felt I had a flexible schedule and great coworkers.  Walgreens is also understaffed."
good,come in to the pharmacy and assist the pharmacy technician and pharmacists with what needs to be done. count medications and entry in new patients and medications when asked to do so.
good,Good company as far as benefits and compensation. Needs better balance of work and life. Needs more emphasis on support staff to help ease work loads and for better customer service.
good,I worked for walgreens right out of high school. I went from being a cashier to being a pharmacy intern. I was hoping to become a pharmacist as well but things did not work out as planned. good company.
good,"Walgreens is great. The only issue that may occur is understaffing or the management playing favoritism. Luckily, the larger management is there to help correct the store."
good,"Fun work environment, friendly staff, great opportunity for advancement. Fair pay, benefits, and flexible scheduling are all plus sides of working here."
good,I liked the work at the retail pharmacy.  I loved the computer system.  The technicians were sometimes unreliable.  The manager did not want to be a manager.  I also needed more flexibility since I had small children at the time.  I rarely got lunches or breaks.
good,Working here as a pharmacy technician I received on the job training and I believe it was very beneficial to my career. Very fast paced environment. Management nice.
good,The boss's treated me right even though sometimes they would contradict themselves while giving instruction. Wear some good shoes for you will be walking and standing for long periods of time. They should talk more about what to do when people shoplift.
good,The hardest part of my job is to stand six (6) to seven (7) hours per day.  However the most enjoyable part of my job is to meet n greet my customers and assisting them in whatever way I can
good,"A typical day of working at Walgreens is its a slow place environment in the morning but pick up during the evening/night. You must be very customer friendly as if you are in any typical retail environment. You learn how to stock merchandise, operate a cash register and perform customer service. Walgreens is a mixed workplace culture. There isn't a hard job task in Walgreens. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you know you put 110% in helping a customer and the customer leaves happy."
good,"Walgreens was great, I loved the people I worked with. Come in, do my work, help customers and clean up head home. I feel like I truly made friends at my time at Walgreens."
good,"I interned here while I went to college.  I loved the company and the staff.  I worked there for almost a year for FREE.  They didn't hire me right away.  5 months later they offered me a job at 10.50 hour.  Lowest pay offer I received even though I worked for them one year for FREE.  They didn't bother to discuss it.  It was … - take the job or we will hire someone else.  I had a year training with them and could easily step right into the job.  It took them 45 days to contact me about the job offer and by then I was already working for there competitor and with more money. There loss- I was very upset to say the least since I was a very dedicated employee."
good,Walgreens was a great first job for me. I even got to transfer when I started college. I started to dislike the environment though very quickly once I moved away. The management was poor and communication was terrible. I was asked to do many things in just a few hours and it seemed like no one else was having to do these things. It became a poor work environment very quickly and I decided to leave.
good,I wanted to work there but was only there learning the ropes. At the time I was a high school student that was in pharmacology. Very interesting experience.
good,"I enjoyed the company and what they had to offer. My coworkers where amazing and I learned so much from them. It was a downtown location so you never knew who or what would happen at the store. I was in the beauty department, which meant after 5pm no one wanted to come and get makeup unless it was a Friday night."
good,"Didn't advance after the company changed direction from a community based to internationally based chain store. If you would like to start as a pharmacy technician, be prepared for not-so-nice customers and awful insurance claims."
good,Everyone is really nice. It is a good job to get if you're new to the workforce. the environment is pretty relaxed. You can easily make friends there.
good,"I really did like going to work most days.  The one major downfall that I did not like was my hours were all over the place!  I am a member of a parent organization in my children's school and I had a very hard time keeping my commitment since my work hours were never the same.  I liked that the store was pretty busy most of the time making my day/night seem to go faster.  I did not like when you have to ask everyone if they wanted to get their flu shots, during the cold and flu season, or when the ""be well"" tag line was being used! What's wrong with just saying to someone, ""hope you have a nice day""? Or every person that walked into the door you'd have to say ""welcome to Walgreens"", pretty sure they know where they are!  I sometimes would forget, and just simply say ""hi"" or ""welcome"" and those were not good enough! But more than not, the work flow made up for this!"
good,They don't like to  work with parents schedules. The company is so wishy washy. The day one thing and set policies. When employees do what we are told we get in trouble because it upsets the customer.
good,Worked for part time. Great company to work for. Reachable targets given to sales associates. Management consistently asks for feedback and input from their employees.
good,"Started as a cashier and was asked if i wanted to work in the pharmacy and I said yes. I didn't have no pharmacy experienced in the  pharmacy but thanks to the new pharmacy manager, he helped with with hands on training and fell in love being a tech. I was promoted to a Pharmacy Tech without pay increase but was given a lot more responsibilities which later on turn into more stress, I went from loving to hating working there. They expect a lot of their employees but don't pay them more."
good,"Daily, I enjoy helping my customers by helping  them find products in the store or order on-line, helping with photos at the Kiosk and cashiering.  On shipment days, I like putting merchandise away. I also enjoy doing resets, such as putting out new items for holidays and occasions. My least favorite part of the job is hanging sale tags on Saturday night."
good,I was never bored at this job because there was so much to learn every day.  The job was rewarding as a manager and fulfilling.  As a regular employee there was more time to spend on everyday duties and less stress but the pay was not as good.
good,Overall good experience but they need to invest in all stores to have security. Very easy to move up in the company if you show them that you can advance.
good,Walgreens is a good company to work for. Theres plenty of room for advancement and training. The benefits are good as well. Not very flexible with my schedule however.
good,it was a good place to work...worked with alot of good people...management listened to your issues and tried to work with you if you had any issues!!!
good,"A great place to work, at the time I worked there the benefits were great and there were plenty of opportunities within the company to be able to be promoted."
good,"If you're just getting into retail, Walgreens is a great place to start. Through their various store training programs and with the support of your peers and upper management, you will learn the basics of how a retail location operates."
good,"Walgreens is a great company for a high schooler who is just starting out working. They have proficient training in customer service, so that can help their workers in the long run. However, I don't believe it to be a good job for someone with actual bills based on the pay they offer."
good,What you would expect for working retail. This is the type manager determains almost everything about the job. It was slow and easy but so much so that the manager had no desire for improvement.
good,"Walgreens is a decent job, I have no complaints besides working late shifts. I'd say the hardest part of the job while I was employed there was probably taking down and hanging up sales tags, very tedious and can get very annoying after doing it so many times."
good,"This job has a great workplace. The people here are all nice and everyone works at the same pace. They have a great break area with games, darts, pool tables, etc."
good,It is a typical retail job that makes you work the hours they need. depending on your manager they can let you switch your hours or not. There are many different types of customers you will deal with
good,"Walgreens is a nice, and moderately paced job that is demanding at times due to customers but that compensates for little to no demand in heavy lifting or daunting task. Orverall nice job if you can comply with the relatively low pay. Management is fair as it should be. Hardest part of the job is the customers but its also the most enjoyable part as well."
good,"Gives you the opportunity to grow your customer service skills, and how you treat customers in the long run, plenty of opportunity to reach higher management if you put in the work"
good,"Walgreens was a great place to work as far as enjoyable, easy going, great comradery, and atmosphere."
good,i would just go to work and make sure the floor is clean and make sure ever is organize and helping the costumers with finding products and assisting the elderly
good,"A typical day at work for me at walgreens was i would come in in the morning at 8 am everyday from Monday to Friday. I would work five days a week from 8am to 5pm or 7:30 am to 4:30pm. The job was pretty easy i did stocking, organizing, cleaning and outdated which was pushing all of the upcominjg expiration date to the front of the shelf and putting the later one's to back of the shelf. I was allowed to work the cashier because i was working under a summer internship."
good,Fast paced type of working. I became good friends with my employees and I liked going to work. There is always the few things that make a job hard but I left for a different career path.
good,"While it was worth it working here, in a financial sense, there were many days that seemed to be draining and repetitive showing no progress for those just starting out all the way to those managing."
good,Was pretty slow placed at times but there was usually always something to do. Not a hard job and was given many oppurtunities to move up in the company.
good,Walgreens is a great entry level job with great opportunities to grow. You can start off as a customer service associate and grow into a manger role in no time.
good,"Good place to start for someone in school (high school and college)"
good,"Great productive place , filing scripts, processing insurance, communications with others, team work, typical break times, left to receive better pay ."
good,I enjoyed working there. It was a comfortable atmosphere to be in. Very polite workers and people to surround ourselves with. A friendly neighborhood place.
good,"This was a great place to work and I had the opportunity to work with different team members. Also, I had the ability to improve my leadership skills."
good,I Worked there 5 years while putting myself through college so I don't really have any complaints. It was my first real job and I had some great co-workers
good,"I have worked at many different Walgreens and if you find a store that has great upper management then your time there will be enjoyable. I ran into one store that eventually made me leave because they did not care about us, just numbers and writing people up. Overall though I loved my time at Walgreens!"
good,It was ok it wasn’t bad at all It was a fun experience to be working at Walgreens the management there it ok and they all treat you with respect there was no bad experience there at all
good,"Those of us who love short stories know the magic behind a well-told tale. There are times when you just need a complete story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. And you need it fast."
good,"I have worked for Walgreens almost 4 years, and have enjoyed the company culture be it when I was in North Carolina or over here in Massachusetts. Regardless of location they are always on top of their communications with employees and updates on policies and ever changing pharmacy laws. They continue to provide many tools and opportunities for learning and advancement for all their employees"
good,"-a typical day at work would be going in clocking in going to my designated area and greeting customers. I than would bring up my computer screen and start putting in prescriptions as people were bringing them in, making sure all the information was correct. "
good,Very physically challenging.  My last manager was an absolute control freak.  He micromanaged every little thing we did.  I did however have a great assistant manager.
good,"In my opinion, they are better then Target/CVS and Walmart in regards to their Pharmacy Dept.  I would work for them again"
good,I liked working at here but working until 10:30 pm isn't working for me. My grades suffer and it isn't worth it for me. The managers are amazing. I am constantly bored at work.
good,"love the job but the hours are rough, closing one day open next , one weekend off a month . no work life balance here. Manager is great . employees are helpful and fun to work with ."
good,I learned and grew significantly as a manager working for Walgreens and am very grateful for that. Walgreens is dedicated to their customers and the company drives itself to improve on the quality of customer care and convenience unceasingly. I was proud to be a part of that experience for those that I was able to help on a daily basis.
good,"it was a good job and they were understanding when i left for a better job opportunity. typically i would put away shipment, restock shelves, help customers. i was allowed to run a special holiday promotion where i offered free gift wrapping with the purchase of perfume and cosmetic gift sets."
good,"overall it was a great very flexible  definitely had to work as a team player,but I did get my hours i did like the fast paced when we are on the registers"
good,"Great company to work for, have learned a lot of great skills and am able to do my best everyday. This job is a good balance between soft skills like managing people and tasks and labor."
good,"The other pharm techs and the pharmacist were helpful and courteous with each other and me. There was a learning curve, but during my time there, I didn't feel intimidated from asking questions or for help."
good,"Not a bad place to work, just a very furstating due to no support, poor equipment, broken equipment, lack of clear communication, not consistent  in how people are treated."
good,"Working at this company"
good,haven't worked there for years but i had good memories of being employed there. wouldn't have left but relocated and there were no spots for me during that time
good,"I enjoyed working for Walgreens. The only problem that I had was the managers were not all on the same page as far as store policies. I know that sometimes you need to override things, but everyone needs to agree to how they handle things. It not only confuses the employees, but the customers as well."
good,"* Daily customer service "
good,"For the 6 years that I worked for Walgreens, I have enjoyed it very much. The management team that I worked with when I first started at the Woodside store was great. I loved working with and helping my co-workers. The best part of my job was helping people. I learned to do many different tasks at this job, such as, how to do resets in each department for when new products come in, how to take inventory of my department using the AS400 and a talzon, and how to order inventory when products are not in stock. The hardest part of my job was pleasing everyone, I found that no matter how hard you try, you will not always please everyone."
good,"A typical day would be customer service for one. Then cashier duties, stock merch., zone area, do photo orders, follow hippa laws, count register at end of night."
good,Love my job and the people I work with. There’s always something to do and people to chat with. Always room for advancement in the company if you do your job.
good,"Walgreens follows daily routines to keep up with store maintenance, because of this iit is never much of a surprise what you are expected to be doing on each shift."
good,Things were boring after the first month. The only upside was the employee discount. I did enjoy the day when all I had to do was stock the fridge and frezzer area.
good,Walgreens is a fast-paced work environment and plenty of opportunities to grow within the company. Each department is best run with teamwork from all employees.
good,Ok place to work better than alot of places I have worked in the past. I just feel like I have gone as far as I can with the company. Walgreens is working very hard to include all employees in the running of each store
good,"It was an ok job in New Orleans"
good,It's definitely a forward moving company. They encourage their employees to come to them if you have concerns. Frontier is a big part of what Walgreens is doing. Letting the employees take responsibilty for the work that needs to be done.
good,They can take a way your raises so it takes four different people to approve your raise. A lot of people at walgreens haven't gotten a raise in three years.
good,"Working the front end consists of many simple tasks, such as handling money or facing products. Will mainly work with regular customers, as many come to buy cigarettes daily."
good,I had a great time uploading and adding my information. Indeed has made it easy for its customers to display there information online without hassle or delay
good,"A typical day at work was a little stressful because you didn't honestly know what your task was for the day. I learned how to use a couple different items that I've never heard of before I started working there. Manaagment wasn't as great as most people would think it was, The hadest part of the job was making sure that customers were happy and satisfied on what they found in the store. The most enjoyable part about the job was the customers and seeing them smile while in the store."
good,"The overall atmosphere was fairly relaxed, each manager sort of ran things differently. Being trained in three different areas was rather difficult (cosmetics, cashier, and photo), but they typically put you where you felt most comfortable or did the best in. Cashier was very stressful, not being able to sell alcohol under the age of 21 could also cause stress. Overall, pretty good."
good,"The job was enjoyable, there was always something to do and it wasn't a boring work environment. My managers were cool besides the one who had a problem with me."
good,Customers make my day there pretty difficult but my amazing coworkers and managers make up for it. extreme couponers are a pain and the short breaks aren’t that great
good,Pay wasn't great but coworkers were amazing. Management team at my store was awesome. There was confusion regarding proper breaks and sometimes we did not get lunch/meal breaks but it eventually figured out. Depending on location theft is a big problem.
good,I did my internship with Walgreens and I can say that it was a very good experience. I was able to get the practical pharmacy operations I needed to successfully get a job in a pharmacy.
good,i work there for about 5 years before going back to school at the time they where a nice place to work and they treated there worker good its been 10 years now
good,Pharmacy is a great place. I worked at several locations and will say that the environment depends on the pharmacist on duty. Overall it is great and fast paced. The downside is that there is not a set schedule
good,Ok place to work. Going through several changes in the ever changing industry of healthcare. Walgreens is not creative in the ways they cut cost. Always reduce payroll but should look to cut unnecessary investments.
good,Overall i enjoy working for this company they are very productive and allow the opportunity for you to expand with the company if you desire to expand also the management team support's one of another and truly believe in team work and putting forth a good effort.
good,"Walgreens is a great company, I learned many things while being an employee. The workplace was very simple and you had to learn things very fast while being there."
good,I have learned so much from this company from the three years I have been with it. I have been able to work with a diverse group of people in age and culture which I get along with and have worked with on a regular side to side each day. The knowledge I received from working in the pharmacy of how to deal with complications of insurance and solving these problems has taught me how to help the customer receive their medication adequately and efficiently in an appropriate timely matter to give our customers the best customer service we have to offer them. I enjoyed being able to solve any complications that a customer would have with their medications and to be able to see my customer leave happy and to a better health recovery.
good,"Everybody worked as a team "
good,"This was by far my longest standing job and it was rough. Working night shift wasn't great since I was the only person (aside from a manager) that could ring out alcohol, but I gained a lot of experience from Walgreens. I'd recommend focussing mostly on your department and area of the floor before helping in other departments. It eliminates a lot of stress if it is done that way."
good,"Really awesome workplace environment, not much room for someone to advance. But for a job for a teenager for some getting going money, decent job! But for a career choice, from cashier to move up. look elsewhere!"
good,Very good but hard to make a living. They are flexible and able to work with your hours but it is hard to advance in this job. Good as a part time job or something on the side.
good,"The company overall was fine to work for, but a few of the managers put extra pressure on employees, and the particular store I was at was poorly run. Not sure if that is indicative of the company as a whole."
good,The work environment was very friendly and efficient. Tasks got completed and work was done in an orderly as well as timely manner. The hardest part of the job was dealing with tough customers but it there would not be too many of those. The most enjoyable parts of the job was seeing and interacting with regulars who would come shop there.
good,"There were issues between our location and the corporate structure, as we did not fit the mold.  This caused a lot of tension with management which reflected on the performance of the lower level employees.  The culture attempted to be progressive and supportive, but the company required more that it should of minimum wage employees."
good,"At my location, it's a good working experience. Management can be a bit better though.Lack of experience with the assistant store manager which leaves things incompleted."
good,"I worked in the retail end of the store for close to two years and then moved back to the pharmacy and that’s where it all became a stressful, learning curve mess. The people I worked with were a joy."
good,"Walgreens had a lot of benefits but very low pay and zero advancement , we also got a lot of customers that stole items and the Walgreens i worked for was in a dangerous area"
good,Work 8-10 hours a day.  Friendly co-workers and many long-term employees.  Ranges from fast-paced to slow.  Decent pay compared to other places in the industry.
good,"Each pharmacy has different RPH in charge, so varies in pharmacy environments. Can be very stressful, a lot of responsibility for low wages. Patient/customers can be difficult at times. Must be able to remain calm."
good,"working in walgreens was an alright experience the managers were all nice and helpful, the only con were how disrespectful the customers can get if something doesnt go their way, like if their cupons expired or they cant get a sale price."
good,Walgreens is a place to meet different backgrounds that will help you to grow as an individual. 
good,"It's a relaxed environment to work in, you don't do much that actually gets you really tired, and you just have to get your things done, it's not hard."
good,"The daily routine can change each day. This can be good for anyone that is easily bored with repetition. I was able to learn a lot about managing a team, providing a great customer experience and team working skills. "
good,"A fast paced work environment, with a variety of things to learn in a very busy environment.  Management, is very settled in their ways, and sometimes they do not look to others for feedback or followup.  The job is not hard, the customers make the job very enjoyable."
good,"It's a minimum wage job , if you're lucky you'll work at a store with nice coworkers and manager but maybe not. It's laid back, work 7-8 hours and leave. Annual pay raise of .25$."
good,"I was paid very well when I worked here because I worked as both the head of the cosmetics department and also as a pharmacy technician. "
good,"It is an okay entery level job, but not a place that one can start a career. The pay does not increase to compensate for inflation, or even the cost of living for the areas that employees work."
good,Advanced technology equipped to handle high work volumes. May be stressful at times during rush hour or busy seasons. Friendly staff. Convenient location.
good,"Management could be better and hours are not that great, but over all nice place to work. There are opportunities to move up within the company like management"
good,While I was a intern at Walgreen the experience was welcoming everybody was kind and patient when teaching me how i have to fulfill my daily functions.
good,Good company but the salary was too low and not enough hours. Advancement was not good either.  I needed more money and hours to support my family.  Not a bad place to work if you can get more salary
good,"No job review after 90 days, so I have no idea where I stand or if a pay raise is in the future.  No opportunities for advancement; permanent fixture at the register; breaks are difficult to get at a reasonable time during work hours.  Lack of communication."
good,its good for high schoolers.  lots of stocking and facing. the hours sucked as they would schedule you to close then open the next day.  management had unrealistic views of how to operate but hey that's why they're management. no one can be happy and joyful every day for 8 hours
good,The store managers are the boss of the pharmacist and do very little to help the pharmacy. They will blame everything they can on the pharmacy manager.
good,Rewired job levels making it challenging to stay same levels of pay. Became a company that stop showing interest in regular employees. Opportunities for advancement was lowered.
good,"Nice place to work and brush up on customer service skills. Work culture is collaborative, everyone wants the best for the customers. Customer is always right no matter what."
good,"quick paced and busy.  be ready to work, hardest part of the job is juggling all the tasks, waiting on customers, answering the phones= stressful"
good,very time consuming. great place to work but all your time goes into working there. I was apart of management so it is different for me. wanted you to be all about Walgreens and not an outside life.
good,Walgreens is a great company to work for. They provide employees with great benefits and a awesome work environment. I really would recommend this place for employment!
good,I have worked with Walgreens for over a year now and at two different locations. They are both a wonderful place to work and have many things to offer. All of the employees at both locations are more than happy to assist anyone in need and they all work hard to get jobs done.
good,Working at Walgreens provides a great deal of knowledge for business operations. You slowly learn how to manage inventory as well as employees. The hours are not the best.
good,"The pharmacy has a small staff and the training leaves much to be desired.  As the new employee every error is blamed on you with no opportunity to verify, IF you get the chance to redeem yourself, it's ignored.  Staff will not work one minute longer than scheduled, even if you have a line 20 people deep."
good,"As a store manager a typical day consist of training, facilitating, planning, and hands on activities which include receiving warehouse and unloading it by hand.  Store managers are expected to spend 1 hour per day in the pharmacy which is very hard to do in a high volume location."
good,A typical day looks like helping customers.also assisting people who needed help with issues they had for finding their needs. The company also included very strong organizational skills.
good,i feel walgreens was a very fun place to start learning and gaining experience fresh out of school. they were a little busy at times and was unfortunate because it reduced my chances of learning all of the smaller things into detail but was also an advantage because i had experienced a busy days work right off the bat. that sets you up for any days of work like a piece of cake.
good,"My overall experience was good. My hours would always fluctuate, depending on busy seasons, or how well we did the month prior. I was part-time, so when it would get slow, my hours would be cut first before the full-time employees. I gained a lot of experience working there. But overall, I needed more stability and a reliable income each pay week, which is the only reason I left."
good,As an intern i felt like there was a lot more i could have been trained to do. for an 8 hour shift there was only half hr break. you have to love pharmacy to get into the field. co workers were very relaxed which made the environment comfortable to work.
good,"Days at work were really pretty okay, there was so many new things to learn everyday as the interaction with costumers was very broad. The hardest part of the job was that there was some miss communication but usually that would get resolve, sometimes we were short on staff. The most enjoyable part of the job was the concept of helping people and interacting with them and talking to them about the products teaching them if they had a question."
good,"there is no comment here for "
good,the days were unpredictable some days will be swamped with alot of work other days were pretty laid back so you can get word done around the store. Managment was great they could handle any problem that customers had.
good,I worked as a Cashier - Customer Services Representative. I took the Job because I was able to work 3rd shift.  My intentions were to get another job to supplement my Income.
good,"Walgreen's was my first Pharmacy Technician job, and I am very grateful that I learned to operate under these conditions because it made me very grateful for the increased flexibility that I found in other job opportunities. I feel that you get a lot of  experience solving problems first hand and getting a well rounded experience within the pharmacy setting."
good,Working for Walgreens really depends on what store you work for and how you other co-workers are as well. Some stores are great to work at others are just stressful and high volume. The job is very enjoyable to help people. Wish we got paid more and corporate understood what employees do.
good,"Delivering products to walgreens stores, using a conver belt system about 325 cases an hour. Hardest part is unloading products due to heat in those trailers."
good,I enjoyed working for the company.  Loved the opportunity to work with public.  Learned a lot about merchandising and how to stage merchandise on sales floor.
good,"I was in my senior year while I was working here, so they were really lenient with my schedule. We got really busy sometimes and sometimes there would only be one of us, so I would say maybe have more people up front and the rest can help with everything else"
good,A typical day at walgreens was boring I did the same thing every time I worked. Management was wonderful they always compliment me on the work. The hardest part of my job was dealing with rude customers'
good,Competitive place to test our skills. Really strong management and good and friendly people so day just goes by real quick. Sometimes challenging tasks but fun to do work.
good,As Liq mgr constantly calling and working with reps. Pulling stock periodic counts of items. Entering items that were received into computer. Doing planos of endstands and basic. Mgt most part was helpful most were. Nice culture hardest part of the job was consent  lifting to which I did manage. I enjoyed the most the cust. and my co-workers. I got along with all. Was working to move up higher in company but a change is good. I liked working at walgreens but with my store closing it would be nice to apply for different jobs.
good,That about sums it up.  Not bad for a part time job.  The leadership team seemed pretty stressed most of the time which made it a bit stressful for the associates too.
good,"the job is okay as long as you are a quick learner. you have to stand on your feet, and learn all the roles if you plan on moving up the chain. or starting a career"
good,"Overall working at Walgreens was good. Most coworkers are collaborative, helpful when necessary, and friendly. The atmosphere was relaxed most of the time and your manager will assign you tasks to do during your shift, which is helpful on slow days."
good,Typically on your feet for more than 6 hours at a time. You will sometimes come in contact with irritable customers but must keep calm. you must maintain a clean environment at all times.
good,"Overall decent company. Was able to move up very quickly, but with each promotion you change locations and have to deal with new customers, a new team and a new manager. You'll have to deal with a lot of politics and drama at points."
good,Act as a pharmacist intern under the direct supervision of a pharmacist. Rotate along with other technicians so that everyone have a fair share duties
good,The project was an exciting opportunity to get a first hand knowledge of the very happening retail pharmacy business. My team and the manager were extremely cooperative and goal oriented.
good,Very nice environment. Professional people. Fair schedules. Good benefits. Learned a lot. Provided great training and paid for certification. Great place to grow professionally.
good,I was an intern there so I did not have many duties but I was interning as a pharmacy tech so I had most of the same roles as the pharmacy techs that worked there.
good,this job was a assement they had me face put stuff out an to get rid of out of dates product also helped out coustmers with finding stuff an keeping store clean.
good,"I enjoyed the customers I'm still friends with a lot of them. But management was bad. It was very stressful , truck day no one worked. all we had was women unloading truck all the time."
good,Interesting to work as a service clerk for the first time.  Always had a professional job.  Working in a non-professional job was like a whole new world with very different experiences.
good,"A typical day in the pharmacy was very hectic during peek hours. The majority of customers who need prescriptions are sick and highly irritable. Also, insurance companies do not always cover medications that patients need and that further upsets them. That is the most difficult part about working in the pharmacy."
good,"Management, training and duties vary from store to store. "
good,"If i wasn't working on unloading the truck, i was at the front register.  Would help everywhere in the store, photo, cooler, cos, inventory and replenishment."
good,Loved working in many roles while at Walgreens. During my time I was able to gain experience in photo development and in the pharmacy. Management was given proper resources and tools to train staff.
good,"While employed at Walgreen I encountered many possibilities and opportunities . Being located  in the heart of downtown Atlanta this work place taught me alot about stay prepared at how to improvise. The hardest part of this job would have been the rude customers . The most enjoyable part of the job would have been the benefits and the hours available,"
good,The days can be busy or slow they are usually up and down. There is usually room for advancement. The pay is pretty good and I really enjoyed working for them!
good,"1. Work Cash register"
good,"The job itself is very satisfying, but unbearably stressful around certain times of the year with little to no help from co-workers or management in some cases."
good,Is a fun place to work the employees are very nice and helpful they allow you to listen to music while you work they bring pizza once a mont for all employees
good,"Pros:  Compensation"
good,I loved my job at Walgreens.. I got to move around the store and do different things everyday. They people were great people. The only down fall for me was Management.. The store Manager was not a good fit.. Never got any overtime
good,"For a first job, Walgreens taught me everything I need to be an asset in the workplace. They took time training me, and slowly integrated me into different departments. The hardest part of the job was the occasional rude customers, and when you start off, memorizing the cigarette wall can be a little daunting. The best part is the staff, it's like a small family and you can always count on them to help you out. Surprisingly, they were quite flexible and understanding with scheduling."
good,The company takes care of its people. Hard work and results will be rewarded. Constantly changing business landscape will provide great challenges and excitement for the right people.
good,The company takes care of its team. If you work hard and obtain results you will move up quickly. Constantly changing business landscape provides additional changes that can be motivating to the right people.
good,Working for 3 years with Walgreens has been fun. The staff were ok and some days the customers can be a pain but it makes the job worth while but working for too long while not getting the proper recognition I don't see myself working for this company for a long time in an entry level position.
good,"i enjoyed my job at walgreens, my manager was super nice and helpful. my coworkers were nice and friendly and my i genuinely liked my job, my tasks were easy !"
good,"Good team work environment"
good,not here to review a location that I work at. I feel that the pharmacy that I work at goes out of their way to make the customer know that we care enough to go the extra  mile
good,"Daily tasks changed depending on which department you were scheduled in for the day. They are not very different from one another although sales pitches were addressed differently. Working throughout each different department (other than pharmacy) I learned about time management, and multitasking between customer service and setting displays."
good,Walgreen's has come a long way and since I have grown the pharmacy has really helped out on all the different medications my family and I get have gone threw.
good,"Walgreen's is a company that pays and compensates the workers just enough. It could strive to do more and general store management could be more understanding of their workers. That everything is ""to run a business"". People have goals and as a Walgreen's employee, it simply did not meet my goals anymore. To the point of stress, mental exhaustion, and physical pain."
good,"fast pace very busy doing around 4-5 hundred scripts per day lots of customer service tasks as far as flu shots, electronic billing, resolving customer issues"
good,"This job atmosphere was very unfriendly after you get out of training. I was monitored when I had to use the restroom, favoritism was at its all time finest in order to move up in the company for what I got paid it did not even come close to the work that was completed"
good,"Collaborative work is key to Walgreens success. Team members are chosen carefully to fit the culture of working together to win. Demanding customers can make the day difficult, therefore, relying on your team is necessary to stay upbeat. "
good,They keep making me type things. working at Walgreens was alright theres good and bad everywhere it was my first real real real job so it was okay okay
good,Walgreens expects a lot but forget to realize that sufficient training need to be in place to achieve expected high  productivity. Seperate hours need to be  provided training techs not just pharmacist.
good,I found working at Walgreens provided me with new and safe equipment. Being dispatched daily for that day routes was a difficult part of the job.  Hoping to find 50-60 hr. a week employment.
good,I worked as a cashier and stocked merchandise. I enjoyed working with customers. I worked at two different locations (Ocala & Orlando). I transferred when i moved.
good,"A typical day as a pharmacy technician would involve stocking medications, preparing prescriptions, taking customer calls and organizing prescriptions to their correct places on waiting bins."
good,I liked working there when my first manager worked there and when he was let go they hired someone else who didn’t work hard at all. Everyone talked about each other (mostly the girls) and the stockroom was always messy. I liked working on the floor and helping customers find what they need and stay satisfied.
good,"Good place to work, learn, and apply your skills. Hours are good. Vacation time. Walgreens stores are everywhere, so it's easy to find one to work at that's close to home."
good,Expect to be yelled at from impatient customers. Annoying repetitive beeping noise when a car is in the drive-thru. Frequent multi-tasking. Short lunch breaks.
good,"The job was pretty easy, however they change your hours  alot. Moving people to different departments is something thay happens alot, even though they dont warn you during orientation."
good,Nothing to complain about really. Stocking shelves is easy. New digital cash registers are easy. Work culture depends highly on the manager on duty at any given shift.
good,Walgreens is a great place to work for a few years. The management staff is amazing and does their best to accommodate all schedule time off requests. This can be difficult during the holidays
good,It was a fair balanced work enviroment although it  was odd having to  fulfill other work positions other than what you were hired to do. Not an issue since I  was able to  acquire even more retail  experience. The managers were nice and proffessional.
good,"I havent worked there in almost 9 years, Im not sure what they offer or what goes on there. I worked there as a teenager and it was an enjoyable place to work at the time"
good,Walgreens is a great place to start if you need customer service experience. The customers happiness and their experience at Walgreens is very important to the company and we make it a priority to help them with their needs.
good,Management at our store is very involved and willing to work with employees and help when needed. The pace is very fast and and knowledge of the database can be difficult as you learn much from just experience.
good,"Day to day work for a part time employee wasn't very strenuous. The employers and coworkers were great, the only downfall was dealing with upset customers."
good,"Walgreens was my first none self employed job.  It was also my first retail job so everything was new and intimidating.  Co-workers and managers are always quick to help and correct any mistakes."
good,Very rewarding place to work if you are a people person. Not a super fast-paced environment but it is very steady. Must be willing to help customers and have an outgoing personality.
good,"I was a cashier, so I interacted with the customers a lot, helped them find items they needed, and cashed them out as they left. I also helped with stocking the shelves and redoing sale tags."
good,i learned alot about stocking working here learning how to load and unload a truck.they alos taught me how to ride the transporter and the fork lift its a very good plac to learn about those things.
good,"fun, stressful, but professional"
good,Hardest part of job would be a break down of equipment during production hours. Liked the job until I suffered on job back injury requiring surgery. Now I have restriction as to what I can do.
good,"walgreens was a great place to work when i first start, my manger was great, he will have a meeting with me every morning and i felt important. he set the pace and everyone fallowed. but they relocated him and the new manger did not pay much attention to may position."
good,Great memories this was my first job in high school. I was a cashier. Learned a lot about ringing up customers. At first it was hard for me and the customers were inpatient and rude. But with time became easy and fun.
good,"Planned, organized, directed, and provided safe and appropriate pharmacy services to Walgreens patients in accordance with the policies and procedures. Provided support to patients and other health providers by speaking knowledgeably of the scope of services that are available through Walgreens"
good,"Good retail company with avenues for growth at the local level.  Tough hours and sometimes long shifts, but typical for retail environments.   Management varies in quality."
good,"Everyone was nice and welcoming. typical work day included cleaning the store, restocking merchandise, ringing up customers and customer servicing. Very simple job"
good,"My first store I worked at was great, decent pay and moved up very quickly. Great manager there but then they closed down that location forcing me to step down or relocate. I relocated only to get into a horrible store where no one treated me fairly and where I was eventually fired for unrightful reasons. Even Human resourced said I should never have been fired and was able to be rehired immediatly and for the same management position."
good,The manage was nice and the people were as well. They management will throw pizza parties for the staff a few times out of the year. Walgreens really does pride itself on their customer service and wants the customers to be number one priority.
good,"While I interned at Walgreen's, I answered customer questions and collected carts. I also faced items and stocked shelves. It was a good experience for me in terms of paying attention to detail and building customer service skills"
good,"low stress, easy job, average management, after training pretty much left to do the job, employee discounts on inventory, liked working inside, all the employees were friendly"
good,I enjoyed the time I had there everybody was friendly so I enjoyed working there. It wasn't to far from my house but it was only temporary till I found my mechanic job.
good,"Days could be a challange depending on the time of year.  There were days that were extremely busy,  If it was tourist season, in the summer, we could have selll up to 300 river tubes per day  During the winter, as soon as thew imountain closed for the day we would get swamped.  I learned a lot about patience and understanding of people. For the most part, management were there to help.  "
good,it was a very nice environment to work in. the people were very loving. the discounts were only 20% but anything is better than nothing :) they just need better pay
good,"Learned how to interact well with customers. "
good,40 hours a week for $12 an hour for a shift lead is not enough. Long hours in the freezer when needed. No respect for shift leaders as far as asm and sm . Playing favoritism.
good,All stores are different. Depends on manager and area. I loved some stores and hated others. Easy to move up and move departments. No life outside of walgreens tho.
good,"Retail pharmacy is hard enough and to include all the opioid addition problem the society is going through, Walgreens at least has your back on your decision to deny a prescription."
good,"theres a difference in managing a team and leading a team. we were a team that wasnt led, we were managed and treated like we were just people in the store. im a people person, i loved my customers and went out of my way sometimes.. worked at different locations to help other stores, and still was just uncomfortable and felt ""managed"" not led. and i feel like its not all managers..maybe just this one."
good,"Poor management at my last store. The store manager was more focused on how her last store, in a heavily populated community, ran much better. She didn't realize and adapt to Fairbanks as it's own specific culture."
good,"Great place to work,"
good,Working at Walgreens is a good job if you are looking for a slow-paced relaxed environment but there are not many opportunities to advance. They do however offer a flexible work schedule although you will have to work on holidays.
good,"No matter where you worked whether that was on the floor or at the register, you were always helping customers and your other co-workers to make it a better place to shop and work."
good,"standard type of job, very customer service oriented."
good,The company is not the same as it was when I first came aboard.  There are great management staff with in that help show you the way and are will to share with you their knowledge if you are willing to work.
good,"You are able to interact with so many people from all walks of life, that make you strive to be a greater person than you were the day before."
good,"Good benefits. Poor store and pharmacy leadership. No help in job advancement.  Even with planned training and goals, and a directive from store managers, no one has stepped up to approve Senior tech level. And with increasing violence and belligerent behavior of customers, particularly the elderly, working with the customers has became particularly upsetting. Opoids, etc. have made this position intolerable."
good,"You are responsible for not only providing great customer service, but you will also be responsible of merchandising, store inventory, maintaining store displays, and handling cash register operations."
good,"It was a great place to work and meet your'e customers face to face.  Love interacting with the public, more so than on a phone call basis.  Just wish they had benefits for part time employees!"
good,For the most part in need of technicians who understood more than just basic operations.  Who should also be involved in managing inventory and understanding that the firm is all about the public.
good,"Working for Walgreens usually starts with entering and placing any items back to their shelves and helping customers. Opening up registers for our rush hours and stocking what needs to be stocked. The management isn't the greatest, they need better fit individuals for those positions. I learned how to keep my patience here, as well as gaining great customer service skills."
good,"Low compensation but corporate policies efficiently protect employees. Fair paid time off, breaks are fairly given. Working holidays are never fun, but are distributed fairly among team members."
good,"It's a really easy job.Make sure to be nice to the customers as well as staff. The work that needs to be done is usually always the same.Stock and order items, help customers, try to clear waiting lines as quickly as possible."
good,"The workplace culture alternated between tacky and progressive. Walgreens tried to uphold decent values, listening to its employees, and tackle changing trends proactively. However, they are new to it."
good,"I enjoyed working here. I started as cashier and advanced to certified photo specialist. I done stocking , cleaning, cashier, printed pictures, broke down machines to ensure cleanliness for best photo quality."
good,"A typical day at my store can range from super relaxed and easy to hyper difficult within moments. Depending on if you are working with certain team members, the shift will be somewhat easy. On the other hand, certain team members can make the work day grueling. Every day is usually the same be it checkout, photo, or stocking."
good,"Walgreens is a good part time job , some time your needs do not match the store managers needs (HOURS NEEDED). Work is not hard . can be busy a little hectic"
good,"most work days go smoothly, fun team members, good discount, paid time off, easy daily tasks, unfair scheduling, not many weekends off, hours not consistent."
good,"The work environment was good.  The store manager was flexible regarding scheduling.  There is a lot of work with not enough employees to help.  Over all, it is a good place to work."
good,"go in make sure order is put away, help customers , stock shevls, check to make sure that the order is ready for the following week, help in other areas of the store."
good,"All entry level employees are completely expendable. Even managers are underpaid and treated like dirt. After six years with the company, I asked for a raise and was told there was just no way. They let me walk out the door over 50 cents an hour."
good,"Overall any tech position at a retail store would be harsh. The patients are sick and unhappy, and its a fast paced environment. However, the atmosphere here does not help the environment."
good,"I worked here as a secondary job for some spending cash in the summer. I really enjoyed working there, but had to resign due to college classes. I highly recommend it for a secondary job rather a full-time gig."
good,"my manager was very hands and one that was understanding to a point. I had many issues and he was there for me in more ways then most mangers, only issue was not enough employee at a time to cover different areas."
good,It is a workplace that employees performs high level of customer service to everyone. Policies and procedure are implemented to meets customer expectations
good,"Depending on the team you work with, working for Walgreens could be very relaxing and smooth. Or it could be very stressful. The opportunity will present itself to move up but the pay does not balance out."
good,I have been working for this company for three years and have experienced some great managers. I understand seniority is shown favor but I had some members of management take it to the extreme.
good,"Walgreens is a pretty simple job once you get the hang of it. I was hired as a cashier but of course you help out with everything. You handle the cash transactions and maintain the order of the front if you're main. If you're backup you can be doing a variety of activities depending on the tasks that need to be complted for the day (packing out deliveries, printing signs and mylars, putting the signs up and taking them down when the sales are done, returns, checking osa, store ordering, etc). As long as you put in the effort and pay attention, this job should be a breeze. The workplace culture is pretty chill at my place but it may be different at other places. The hardest part of the job I guess for my job position would be cashwrap(though pharmacy definitely seems like the hardest job), we""ll get people trying to scam so you always have to pay attention to the little details. The most enjoyable, doing returns I suppose. It's easy and you get to talk to the other co workers while you're going around the store."
good,It’s a pharmacy so it had its busy moments. You will learn a lot about the medicine business. Be prepared to stand on your feet all day. Nothing too bad to say
good,Overall good company to work for.  Lots of changes going on.  Must be customer focused to succeed.  Holidays and seeing new merchandise is always fun.
good,"My typical day at Walgreen was quick paced filling RX, data input, dispensing medications, innovatory, ect. I learned that the customers always come first under all circumstances.the hardest part of the job was speaking to insurance companies and being on hold for more than 45 min when pts needed medication. the most enjoyable part of the hob is when I can help a pt get the medication they need."
good,"Can be boring, there is no opportunity to grow"
good,after being an employee for over 9 years my job was threatened by a manager that would not allow me to transfer closer to home but made me drive over an hour to get to work as a single mother. after making up his own rules and inappropriate talk.
good,This was my first position out of pharmacy school and the introduction to retail helped me learn many pharmacy skills and how to work as a team.  I loved working with my patients to find the best care for them therapeutically and financially.
good,It's fast paced especially during the first of the month and holidays. New district manager is constantly changing requirements for staff which makes it hard for us to remain on top of things like we normally would.
good,"Retail is difficult to work day after day, and after a while you feel that Walgreens is only interested in the bottom line, the employees are just a way to that goal"
good,I enjoy the atmosphere and friendliness of those that I interact with daily both customers and co-workers. Nice clean working environment. Happy customer base.
good,My working experience at Walgreens was a fun one because everyday I would learn something new whether it be at the workplace or helping the customers. The environment is always fun and enjoyable within the co-workers and even most of the customers. The hard part working there is when certain merchandise are out of stock or is no longer selling or that are nonexistent in the store some customers would complain or make a scene because of it and they make it a bit difficult to help them in anyway.
good,Every Walgreens I've worked at has had amazing coworkers and employees but the amount of work you have to do with poor pay made me want to change jobs
good,I love working in the photo department I just didn't get along with management as best as I would like. We had our disagreements but besides that they were very supportive
good,"Don't get me wrong, I love my work family. But I am currently looking for a career that is paying more money so that I can provide a better future for my children."
good,I liked working at Walgreens. It is busy most days so employees have to be able to stand for long periods of times. They are open 365 days a year so be prepared to work some holidays.
good,"A Day a Walgreens is is full of surprises. One day you deal with alot of customers and other days you may not. Comusters will come in sometimes in the best mood and other times is the worst. You as an employee have to mantain your composure and try to make the customer happy as much possible as you can. CUSTOMERS ARE ALWAYS RIGHT, no matter what a satisfied customer is happy customer."
good,Multitask in all positions.  Management has a tendency to show levels of preferential treatment towards employees. Benefits are good for full time employees.
good,Was a good place to work for besides certain management. Loved some of the employees I worked with. You work hard enough you may move up. Nothing is guaranteed obviously.
good,It was nice working there. Seeing and helping people was a joy. work hours were good. Supervisor was very nice. It was a pretty easy job. Not hard at all
good,"I loved working with my customers. The management lefft someething to be desired.They were disscriminent with weekends off, some people would get get every weekend off and others would only get a weekend off if requested a month before."
good,"While working at Walgreen's in Moses Lake, it helped me to learn how working in a pharmacy really obtains to. I learned how to fill prescriptions properly, and how to help customers."
good,"Walgreen's is a good place to work depending on location. Typical work life involved daily bay stocking and cleaning, stock room fixing, cashier, customer service, photo technician, and (if night crew) graveyard shift."
good,"Very big reliable company. Flexible if you're going to school etc. A lot of locations, literally a Walgreens on every corner. A lot of opportunity to grow in the company."
good,"Working at Walgreen's was a good experience for me. I would assist customers and straighten up the store around me. I learned social skills, how to work with money, and how to take care of merchandise. The management was very friendly, helpful, and experienced. The workplace got boring from time to time and the music was pretty repetitive. It was hard standing and walking for hours on end."
good,Staff were easy to talk to and I was comfortable approaching management for any concerns or needs. Other employees made the day fun and helped the work day stay productive.
good,"Nice profit sharing"
good,"This pharmacy is a 24 hour pharmacy located in Warminster PA.  It is a very challenging store but it is a place that I like to practice.  There is a diverse range of pharmacy practice here that other pharmacies do not have.  I have learned a lot about MTM, chronic disease management, and immunizations.  Hardest part about my job is when people call out and we are a person short but we always make it through because we work hard and communicate well.  The most enjoyable part of every day is talking to the people of the Warminster and developing that relationship we desire."
good,"Overall good experience. Quick advancement. Quick turnover. Enjoyed the job. People are friendly. Customer driven, focus on the customer not the sale."
good,I like the direction that the company is going. The company is driven by the needs of the customers and they are always trying to improve the customer experience by implementing core values into their employees.
good,"It was a great place to work, and provides great opportunities to those who are productive, determined, well-measured, friendly, courteous, and quick-thinking"
good,"Although I was not at Walgreens for very long, I did enjoy the experience. It taught me what it's like to work in a retail pharmacy and just how crazy they can get."
good,The company is a nice company. They have some incentives that come into play for people who has worked for them for a long time. You learn alot about customer service and the value it has.
good,"My time here was fantastic. The company is ran fairly well, and promotions are easy to come by. Only bad thing is the scheduling and trying to request days off."
good,"Good manger. good environment to work and learn as a pharmacy intern. good chance to learn about insurances, OTC, prescriptions medications. got chance to help my patients."
good,"I worked at various stores as a 'borrowed' employee. My home store was great, but others had serious management issues. At one store, I got screamed at to the point of backing me into a wall for doing something per Walgreens policy, but not the sloppy way the manager wanted. Their advancement opportunities were a joke though. I was training some of the new assistant managers coming in, but could not advance to management myself because I did not have a 2 year degree... in anything. I was basically told I'd have a better chance of advancing with an associates in something completely unrelated and zero experience, than with my experience with the company and training their managers in the same position I was applying for."
good,"Growing organization with great people to work for. "
good,"Working at Walgreens could either be extremely slow shifts, where you just fill photo orders and place sale stickers on shelves for hours at a time, or you could have a shift where hours pass by and you're constantly assisting customers."
good,"Awesome place to work great people!        "
good,"Walgreens updates their system frequently However, staff do not have time to finish their learning on time because there is no actual time given for learning"
good,my review is this I'm a quick learner.. i get along with everyone and i am  a hard worker..  most of everybody i worked with was fun and a joy to be around
good,"Great place to work while it last, was employed at Drugstore.com for 7 years. Unfortunately Walgreens.com took over, after 3 years, the plant was shut down."
good,"I worked part time at Walgreens to save money for our home. I ended up working there for 5 years, until the new manager started giving me a hard time about working more hours, even though she knew I had a full time job as well"
good,"its mostly a calm setting with a few costumers who need help finding a product, co workers are quick to handle any new package that needs to be handled."
good,I loved the people I worked with and for a job to get through college it was awesome. I learned a lot of customer service skills and it helped me come out of my shell. The hardest part of the job were the long hours on your feet. I loved my coworkers and the management I worked for.
good,worked at a Walgreen for seven years and would still be working there if I didn't find a better paying job elsewhere. you become a family working there and the benefits were better than some.
good,Walgreens adapts easily to varying schedules and loves to hire new workers of all ages. It's a great starter job and is easily the one of the easier cashier jobs there is. One  can learn so much and expand their growing arsenal of experience.
good,"professional workplace, management was great, friendly team, busy workdays, hardest part was being understaffed, learning the culture and values of the company is being well"
good,"I have to stock the shelves of bath, hair care, razors and dental care.  I also have to work the truck on truck days. I ring out customers and bag groceries."
good,Revolutionary steps in Beauty industry and we are in the Beauty Team. Benifits are not too much as we expected before.But whoever love to work in sales is good for them
good,"A typical day includes opening the store 30 minutes before open time, counting the money for each drawer, balancing the cash report from the night before and making sure no money is missing. duties include following daily lists that have resets (resetting a part of the store), merchandising etc etc"
good,Generally a decent place to work but has certain pitfalls like any other job. Customers can be a little difficult like any other retail job and understandably so when dealing with medications.
good,"I really like my job. However, I started as night and weekend shift. I have a son and wanted to switch to day shift but was told I would not get any barely any hours which is a big con and only reason I would find other employment."
good,"Management was a difficult group to get along with. My assistant manager was amazing, kind and willing to work with me on my busy schedule because I had a lot going on as a student. My store managers, on the other hand, were less so and made them much harder to get along with."
good,"they make you always say ""be well"" even though they sell cigarettes. If you are a cashier be prepared to sell lots of cigarettes. The photo lab is the best place to work there, and easy to do."
good,this job was very hands on and fast paced... you hadto make sure every thing you did was accurately done in a timely manner. overall good job but it was a 24 hour store which meant your work hours varied a lot
good,Good Company with great management staff.  Cafe on site with large  variety. Overall great place to work. Easy going but well structured environment with room for growth.
good,Temporary position. Enjoyed working in a professional atmosphere. Really loved being a Resolution Center Specialist. Wanted opportunity for fulltime employment but was pushed in another direction.
good,Walgreens wasn't a bad place to work but I feel like CSRs did alot more work than the shrift leads did. The customers were always nice and friendly...
good,"Fast pace, always on feet, worked all the tine. need comfortable shoes. managers were cool. if you do your job then youll be fine. they dont like people that dont like to work."
good,"I typically day can be very stressful dealing with management unwilling to help with tasks, and employees calling out. I have learned that the company put the customers first and everyday is a learning experience. The managers stay in the office most of the day checking emails or on conference calls. The workplace culture consist of constant change in SM/ASM. The hardest part of the job is having only one weekend off a month. The most enjoyable part of the job is working as a team to complete tasks and being recognized for great performance."
good,Great company to work for! They really take care of their employees and make sure you are fully trained before letting you go alone. I did have some issues with one of the managers who for whatever reason didn't like my views on things and would make it unpleasant to work with them.
good,"I worked overnights, was very easy job. It however was very boring and tiring. Same routine. Unusual customers would come in the middle of the night. Managers were very nice."
good,Interacting with customers and learning new and different things about another pharmacy was very interesting. Some of the people are great to work with.
good,I worked here during high school. They were very good to accommodate scheduling needs.  Fun place to start out in and get that good experience for later in life.
good,Hardest part of the job especially if you work in cosmetics department you have to sale certain items to get a little bit of a bonus. The more you can talk people into buying them the more money you make. If you live in a small town where people live paycheck to paycheck it can be hard to get money out of it.
good,"Learned a ton at this internship. I worked with a lot of really great people, and overall I really enjoyed the expdrience."
good,As far as retail jobs go Walgreens is one of the better ones because it usually is not too busy and it allows you to learn many skills that may help you in the future.
good,It was a fast paced job and always busy. Sometimes a very stressful one. Have to be patient. It was a good experience and helped me improve my pharmacy skills.
good,Fun place to work around the holidays.  Not very busy at certain times of the day and very busy at others.  Co-workers were very helpful along with managers.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Walgreens, however when it came time to move buildings they fired me for a ridiculous reason and then fought unemployment."
good,Walgreen's is a great company to work for. They allow you to move up within the company and allow you to open p and become who you are striving to be in life. They are very flexible with the schedule and work with you if you need the help.
good,I was trained as a technician with Walgreens in '06 and worked here for 10+ years... My only complaint would be the constant cutting of hours. I would work here again.
good,"While I enjoy and still get along with many of the employees, including managers, the store itself seemed to be in a constant state of under-staffing. It was a busy location and on busier days the normal daily tasks would be proven nigh-incompletable, especially on the afternoon shift."
good,"It's a good job that gets you to be more well-rounded. I really enjoyed working there because they respected most all requests, kept things confidential and had a positive and fun environment"
good,"great managers. great area. I would recommend for friend to work there. the benefits are worth it as well, but most are food related. also, the managers are very welcoming."
good,This company allows you to grow and gives individuals life long skills that can be applied in future jobs. I enjoyed gaining my first five years of customer experience with Walgreens.
good,Working here was fun and easy. The only issue I had was the low pay and part time hours. Great for a first job or someone who can live on part time hours and pay.
good,"Very friendly environment, great staff, easy going, laid back, everyone picks up their slack, different areas of work, very easy to learn, wonderful atmosphere."
good,Everyday was challenging and rewarding. The team members are warm and welcoming to new hire. A team environment is encouraged and practiced daily.  Benefits are great.
good,I enjoyed being around my co-workers and managers. Everyone worked as a team and was very helpful. Some days were busy and stressful but we would all manage to get through it. I learned how to cope with angry customers from time to time.
good,"It's fun working with the coworkers, however, when a team member sees another team member ""slacking"" everybody begins to slack. Hardly anything gets done depending on who works. The morning shift depends on the night shift, as well as the night shift depends on the morning shift. Duties hardly get done, and you have to keep reminding the management about a problem until its resolved."
good,This job was just a summer job for me. Management was not very understanding and did play favorites. Always tried to get sales in Cosmetics but if you did not get enough the managers made you feel like you were not good at your job.
good,"I enjoy working with my coworkers. They provide and fun environment to work in, and I look forward to coming to work with wonderful people. I love my job and would recommend working there to other people."
good,Working in Walgreens a shift requires one to be in more than one place in as little as 30 seconds. The number one job of any employee in Walgreens is to tend to a customer and make sure their needs are met. The job doesn't teach many skills that one can use outside of the company however it does cause one to use problem solving and time management to get things done. The management of the store are fun to work with. They make the job less stressful but at the same time make you understand that you are still at work and there is a job to be done. The hardest part of the job is moving from one task to another. If you started on a task and a shipment of product was just delivered to the store you may have to drop everything that you are doing and go to a task that requires your immediate attention. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to meet new people and having a conversation with them about their day while your helping them check out or find a product.
good,"staff was fun, happy, cool, managers was very sweet and understanding. I felt I learned something different everyday and time would fly because it was so busy."
good,"Management was nice, however some of the management was not that great. I did not enjoy being moved to different positions, and would have liked to stay at Cosmetics, but they moved me because they thought I did not like working there, and never came and asked me personally. I feel that they could have had more communication rather than moving people around, and not giving us a chance to voice our own opinions."
good,"Strange, strict rules. However, there is an open door policy that is useful. "
good,I loved working for walgreens due to all their philosophical donations and events. This company truly cares and is sincerely there for you. I would return to work for this company.
good,"A good job with family culture between coworkers. Good opportunity to move up in the company, but pay is not good enough for the amount of work you are required to do."
good,I was a cashier/photo lab assistant. Learned how to help customers with printing photos. I assisted customers around the store and made sure they walked out the store satisfied.
good,"I enjoy my job here more than any other I've had. At my interview, I was told all about how Walgreens prefers to promote from within and how advancement should be my top priority. What they didn't mention is that not ""sitting at the cool table for lunch"" will prevent that advancement from happening. My team is great and the benefits are wonderful, but I don't want to be a check-out girl the rest of my life."
good,"very nice people, they teach you stuff and wont hesitate to communicate with you about any mistakes you may be making. pharmacist is super cool too they will help you in any way you would like."
good,Walgreens is a great company. Never had any issues with management. Very easy transition from store to store during the school year. Enjoyed my two years there.
good,"I enjoy walgreens although I've only been there a short time. "
good,"The average Photo Technician salary is $18,760. In Rochester, a Photo Technician can make $20,960, which is 11.7% higher than the national median. Filter by location to see Photo Technician salaries in your area."
good,"You never really know what working for a drugstore is like, well you will soon. The days can be rough with trucks to unload and displays to build. Customers not always the highlight of your day."
good,"customer contact and customer service , ordering for department (cosmetics) working front counter and working in pharmacy department. putting products on shelves for customer to purchase."
good,It wasn't a bad p;ace to work it's just as time passes by you become more and more miserable and you begin to not want to work there anymore. I personally prefer over-night shifts or early morning shifts. They started me off working two to three says a week. Then jammed me with 4 every week which I loved I was working 18-23 hrs a week. Then they just cut all hours.
good,"Pros"
good,"As a Solution Architect, I worked with the Chief Security Architect, delivery teams and Business Development teams to develop solutions and support complex business development initiatives."
good,"Overall, Walgreen's was a fun, relaxing experience compared to what I'm used to. it is peaceful, but can get hectic at times. The company offers great benefits as well as a employee discount that comes very handy at times. The most enjoyable part of working at Walgreen's was learning how much time and effort is put into making the store look nice and neat. It makes you aware of how long it takes having everything look perfect and more considerate of making sure you put something back in its rightful place as a shopper."
good,Supervised a great team of diverse people with all levels of experience. It was a very busy work day as we were redesigning the new Walgreens website plus needed to send our e-mail alerts daily.
good,"I worked in the store, it was nice that I could take the days off that I needed.  It was nice that I got to do a verity of things in the store.  As a high school kids it is a great job."
good,I really enjoyed working here they have a great store manager at this company. Decent shifts just wished for more hours. I actually enjoyed stocking here.
good,"I loved working for walgreens, but after 14 years i was looking for a change! I transferred here to ga from illinois and it was a whole lot different than my walgreens back in illinois to slow paced for me and too many chefs in the kitchen!"
good,"Retail jobs aren't very fun. Go to school and get a better job. Really. Don't think that you'll just work your way up, because that doesn't always happen. That, and it's easier to just get a degree and then work as a manager straight away."
good,"I worked in the downtown Chicago eCommerce office and it was a different culture than the Deerfield HQ. Still very corporate but functions more like an ad agency. I worked with a very talented team on the award-winning mobile app. Great bosses, great team members."
good,A fast paced changing environment.  Never a dull day.  Best part of the day is watching the store level employees interact with the customers and how they have impacted their lives.
good,Patients have gotten more and more impatient. Insurance companies have become more frustrating to deal with. Store management is actually wanting pharmacy technicians to clean the restrooms after the pharmacy closes because those on the front end do not think it is fair that they have to clean the restrooms. Pharmacy technicians already have plenty of responsibilities to tackle.
good,i enjoyed the opportunity but they did not tell the truth about the handicapped accessibility work place . In fact it was not at all accessible. i fell and then they wanted to avoid a lawsuit that's when they made arrangements
good,"Great training, lots of resources to run a success operation, competitive pay. Strong commitment to customer service. You tend to get moved around on an almost annual basis. Lots of weekends, holidays and nights. Limited opportunity for promotions."
good,Working at Walgreens is a good way to get your foot in the door if you want to get into the pharmacy field or just test it out. Once in however Walgreens is not the best place to move up the ladder and see increase in pay.
good,the most enjoyable part of my job was helping the costumer get what they came to the store for and making them want to come back to the store. Also I made sure the customer trusted me and was safe being assisted by me.
good,"It is not a bad place to work, coworkers are nice for the most part.  The hardest part of the job is really with extremely mad customers but to  just have to work to de escalate the situation."
good,"There's a good amount of work to do at Walgreen's, not a good place to stay for more than a year but great to pick up some experience. The employee's are nice and its pretty easy to pick up the flow of what you have to do everyday. Hardest thing you'll have to do is work with customers."
good,The store I worked in was great. All of the employees were kind and fun to work with. The managers were great. The floor positions are minimum wage. They do offer in store training to advance into the pharmacy or management  positions.
good,Steady and easy work for college students. Flexible hours allows you to easily maintain proper study time for your college course work. Good starting pay for managers.
good,"It's a good job for a High School or College students. They side with there managers, some co workers become family. It's been awhileI worked at Walgreens in 2010 it was along time ago so my review is irrelevant currently."
good,"Typical day consisted of Opening the store, counting registers, setting up the employees to prepare them to work, verifying drawer counts, unloading trucks, stocking the inventory, counting money, money drops, counting the end of day drawers while making sure they balance out, closing the store and making the deposits."
good,"When working at a place where you are in constant communication with people. your smile has to be on point. Some people needs that to go on with there day. I loved working there, The customers always made my day and i'm sure, I make theirs too."
good,"Worked here 120 hours for an externship through school program. Great place, learned a lot in the time I was there. Pharmacists made sure to continuously test my knowledge and keep me up to speed."
good,especially when you help customers and make them happy gives me some different feeling but as usual you can't satisfy each and everyone specifically about the price of the prescriptions.
good,Management is easy to get along with and it was slow paced every time that I went to work. Walgreens is an amazing company.
good,"Walgreens was my very first job and I loved it! However after I graduated high school and I told them I was going to be moving to Dayton, Ohio they cut my hours to only 11 a week when I had fully open availability. The job was nice and taught me a lot that I will carry with me to every job, Walgreens management helps build you up not only as an employee but as a person."
good,"I would help with RF scanning, picking, packing, auditing and shipping merchandise to the customer. "
good,"My typical day at work as a pharmacy technician is when I am opening, I do inventory work like smart count and deletes. My everyday duties include taking the prescriptions, typing them, filling them, and after verified by the pharmacist, sell them to the patients. I also answer the phone, take refills orders and any other requests. I also talk with the nurses and doctors on the phone and I also participate in another inventory that happens every month."
good,"Busy, learned how to communicate, work environment was friendly, management works with you on your schedule. I enjoyed working with the people around me"
good,"•	Analyzed business requirements, functional requirements, use cases and provided feedback for clear understanding of each requirement."
good,Learned how to interact with the public. Checked drug interactions and was able to offer my expertise and recommend over the counter medications and answered clinical questions.
good,Walgreens is full of opportunity for the employees to grow within the company. There is always something new to learn everyday during a regular work day.
good,The people at the store would always make the day fun and go by faster. There was aways something to do and my cowokers always made it enjoyable.
good,"Good company. Enjoyed working with the other employees. "
good,"Since starting with Walgreens, I have learned a lot about the workings of a retail store. I have enjoyed the opportunity to grow and evolve my management skills in an ever changing culture."
good,"A typical day at work consists of helping customers find products, stocking shelves, all cash register operations. As overnight associate we ensure the store looks it's best for the following day by facing all isles and shelves."
good,Worked at walgreens for 8 years they were very flexible with me going to school. They worked around my schedule which was easy for me to figure out what classes I needed. In my first few years it was great loved coming to work and working with great people that I still talk today and hangout. Towards the end it changed with the company and with new management coming in it turned for the worse. Still now I see that it hasn't gotten any better. The manager does not take care of the store.
good,"It was a pretty easy job, but could be very frusterating at times. I hated being stuck behind a counter all day. My feet would always hurt after work."
good,Very busy pharmacy located in a rural town in southwest NM. A lot of our patients are elderly and some only speak the Navajo language. Walgreen's is very good about employing bilinguals to help translate.
good,"inconsistentcy from store to store-"
good,"I started working on the sales floor. I then was able to learn how to receive the products on the truck. Was able to learn how to run and organize the stock room. I even was able to learn the register, photo and even began to learn some pharmacy"
good,worked as a pharmacy technician-processed patient profiles and input prescriptions. also verified insurance and filled medications.
good,"This job provided for a good experience in the retail and convenience industry. However, the work was very task oriented and repetitive. Management was a bit cliquey and slightly unprofessional at times."
good,"The employees are very caring and fun to work with. Just don't slack off. This will get you on the managers bad side. The tasks that they ask of you are not unreasonable but if you're at the register, you'll be standing in one spot most of the day."
good,"working for walgreens is ok. i just feel there isnt any growth. during my years with the company i have learned data entry, sales, developing film. taking inventory. there isnt anything hard about the job its just customer services and cash handling."
good,"A typical day is taking calls, assisting customers . Can be very fast paced on some days. The hardest part of the job is handling difficult customers and de escalating calls."
good,"The people are nice and customers are relatively friendly. Being in the pharmacy can be stressful at times, but the staff is supportive and willing to listen to concerns."
good,It was a learning experience working there on how to manage with both customers and money. It was a warm environment and always friendly to the customers
good,"Working at Walgreens is really the same as working at any retail store; you have to check out customers with a cash register, help customers find what they need, and restock shelves. I was never really all that great with restocking, but that's cause I didn't work there long enough to memorize where every item should go. You're also working with people, so your day to day experience will always change based on who you're dealing with. My boss and my coworkers were friendly and patient with me in the learning process, and things went about as smoothly as they could have. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because it just felt like a summer job, and not a permanent career. Other than that, if you actually try to do well, then you will."
good,Some people helped wheb there was a lot of customers sometimes not. So there was a lot of waiting on managment to help get the line down or help with any problems.
good,I really enjoyed being an intern at Walgreens. The technicians i worked with were great as well as the Pharmacists. They were all willing to teach me what i needed to know.
good,It helped me to become a more experienced and professional individual and develop interpersonal skills with clients.
good,"A typical work day was cashing out customers, greeting them and making sure the shelves were stocked. I learned how to treat people and how to make sure customers always left happy.  I managed 3 people under me and I always treated them with respect as I would also want in return. My co workers and I were a team and got along great. The hardest part was leaving and the most enjoyable part was coming there and being with my team who to me felt like family and seeing my regular customers and helping them in any way that I could."
good,"A typical day at work included plenty of customer service. I learned quite a bit about health and beauty while working there. Management in both stores was quite phenomenal, anytime a problem would occur  it would be handled quickly. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with the near impossible expectations set up by corporate. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting people who came through."
good,"A typical day at work could include helping customers with the photo kiosk, helping customers find products, promoting beauty products or promoting pharmacy events."
good,". Depending on the mood of the day and the employees and employers."
good,Working in the pharmacy was very fast paced and upbeat. I had great co-workers who always helped me out; within in training and all around work day. This job was very insightful in helping me understand people.
good,"Although Walgreens is a very busy pharmacy, I think it was a great way to start as a pharmacy technician. Because of it's higher volume, I got to learn things a lot sooner than I think most places would allow. I enjoyed the challenge of the job. It was only in some instances I would suggest more employee help. But as along as there was an efficient and knowledgeable pharmacist on staff, things usually got done. I learned the most from Walgreens Pharmacy and appreciated the challenge of the job."
good,"What I have learned is to interact with not only my team members but my customers also. I learned how to make the people I am around daily to enjoy and always had my customers come back."
good,"Typical work day consisted of assisting customers in finding products, cashier, and also shelf re-stock and product facing."
good,they usually give you a task list at the beginning of your shift to finish by the end. You learn a lot like how to order and take care of your own departments.
good,This was a very productive internship. Helped me gained knowledge of what it took to become a pharmacist and work in the pharmacy field. I recommend this program to all students in high school who are in pharmacy.
good,Enjoyed working with the staff. Everyone worked as a team to get task done in a timely and productive manner. Management was great. Loved to help customers there.
good,Organization and printing of customer photo order while simultaneously tending to customers with care and attention as well as stocking or organizing the products in an acceptable format
good,Pretty good place to work for but will not allow overtime.  Expect to work all holidays but the double time is nice.  Managers are typically easy to get along with.
good,"Was great when 1st started as Head Cashier.  Happy team work."
good,Walgreens was an okay job. My location was very unorganized and we had several store managers. I loved working in the pharmacy. I loved all the Pharmacists and techs. I learned a lot from those professionals.
good,"I enjoyed working here and I learned a lot, customers are a little bit difficult but if you like to help people it is a very nice place to work. Management was a little disorganized because it was a new store but it was nice to work in there."
good,"Work was definitely a fun and interesting job. The most enjoyable part of the job would be getting the opportunity to be able to socialize with all types of people, and animals on occasion."
good,"It is a good place to work at. In my experience coworkers have been friendly and great to work with. A typical day would have plenty of tasks to complete. The hardest part of the job was the difficult customers, but that is part of the retail experience. Learning to deal with all sorts of customers polishes your customer service skills and gives you the ability to manage different scenarios. I learned a lot from my time at Walgreens. I feel this company has given me the skills to better myself as an employee."
good,"Highh pace, prepare to work, develop customer service skills, learn to multitask. Love your coworkers, Management needs improvement."
good,Really enjoyed working for walgreens. the benefits are great and the company offers a lot of discounts and perks. pay isnt the greatest but otherwise a good company to work for.
good,"A Typical day at Walgreens ... I walk in everyone speaks and we all ask how we're doing and we catch each other up on what tasks are to be completed. I learned about different insurances, measurements, medical terminology, and becoming a better team player for my pharmacy. My management are wonderful people they're very kind, helpful, and positive. The hardest part of the job of my job is seeing the sick customer/patients. The most enjoyable part of my job is making my customers/patients smile and making them fill comfortable and know that I'm providing them excellent customer service."
good,"We would start by getting the days inventory.Then I would type Rx's in the Que,and I would fill the Rx's.I learned how to change manufactures,partial Rx's,search for pt. in Que,and set up ready bins.Management and co-workers were great,I learned a lot from them.The hardest part was learning location of drugs..The most enjoyable part was working with good people."
good,"I found it very hard to advance in Walgreens. The better the employee the more likely you will become stagnant. Your advancement depends on your store manager. If you have a store manager that is a mentor (rare) you can advance quickly. Although, the majority of management care about how successful the store is. If you are a good worker they will want you to stay in the same position to keep the store successful. You may have a store manager that as long as you dont steal or come in late will completely ignore you. They hate to replace people. The customer service has changed and is not very good any more. It is hard to be terminated from Walgreens. So you can be a mediocre employee forever. However, Walgreens has excellent benefits. That is the best part of working there."
good,"The typical day of work can include a lot of stress; I learned essential management and communication skills in my position. The working environment is incredibly fast paced, and in management positions- can be overwhelming"
good,"Overall great job with lots of teamwork opportunites, you will stay busy your entire shift. Central focus is always the customer so you will spend the majority of your time aiding customers with finding a product and recommending other brands that may better suit their needs."
good,"N/A"
good,I always like working photo lab. I got extremely good with the machine and taking hard requests on making something as a special gift. Once they intigrated the job with stocker it became a bit more demanding cconsiderin your main job was photo but to make sure you completed the truck.
good,Walgreens is a very busy place for the most part. You see a lot of different faces and some you'll see often.The work isn't very hard and it's quite easy to catch on to the swing of things. Managers are kind and understandable.
good,Being a Walgreens pharmacy technician is great but the pay isn't significant for the job we do and many times treated unfairly depending on which pharmacist you work with.
good,"Walgreens is a good company to work for, with good coworkers and good management. They expect you to put in a good effort, but treat you fairly."
good,"Gerentes se preocupam com o bem-estar dos empregados."
good,"I enjoy working for Walgreens, I had the opportunity to train and develop many of my peers. Working in customer service was a big part of my job that enjoy the most  ."
good,"It was a nice time at walgreens. I like working in the beauty department. I learned a lot of things that I didn't know about. The mangers were cool, strict but cool. The hardest part was probably working after 2 because that's when kids go out of school."
good,"A great place to gain experience, especially when expanding customer service, leadership and professional skills. Everyday is a new opportunity to meet and interact with all types of people which is never a bad thing."
good,"Typical day includes providing excellent customer service."
good,"They teach us to serve each customer with care and to assist them well, we greet everyone when they come in the door, with, Welcome to Walgreens..."
good,"Having worked for Walgreens for 10+ Years gave me experience to be in 3 major areas of the store. Overall, my favorite department I grew in was Cosmetics."
good,"This job is great for young people starting out or student. The work is fast paced, and has a lot of busy work. There is a lot you can learn about task orienting from this job."
good,Learned a lot about retail sales and what goes on behind the scenes of a retail store. my c-workers were easy to work with and always very helpful.
good,Good company. There is a propensity to move pharmacists up into roles they are not initially qualified for which can be frustrating when people with specific tech skills have to go back and educate.
good,"My coworkers were pretty cool. The management team wasn't the best. Not all of them were nice, but most were. The work load was acceptable."
good,"Walgreens is a great company, my day goes by fast because my store is 24 hours and is very busy. My coworkers and I all work together as a team. We all help each other with situations and help teach each other as well. The hardest part of the day is when the computer systems stop working or there is a customer acting up. We take control of the situation and do our best to satisfy our customers. I want to grow and move up in the company."
good,"Management was great. Co-Workers were nice. Typical day- stock shelves, help customers find products, cash out sales, photo developing. easy laid back place to work"
good,"A typical day involves checking out and assisting customers, stocking shelves, and managing multiple sections of the store quickly and efficiently when needed."
good,Its just like any other job. I learned how to print pictures and take inventory. The managers were ok the coworkers were great and the customers were awesome.
good,I start my day out with restocking the shelves and cooler.  I complete the transactions at the register.  I process the photo orders as they are sent in to our store location.  I also assist customers with questions and instructions when they come into the store.
good,Typically I was travelling 4 days per week and the work life balance suffered due to this requirement. I was in supervision which allowed me to make my own schedule although that meant working more than 40 hours per week.
good,"Busy, busy, busy. i learned how to compound prescriptions, call doctors, inventory, scheduling, and audits. Management change too much. The hardest part is dealing with fake prescriptions. I enjoyed working with my co-workers everyday, we became a family."
good,Had a very good work space. friendly coworkers that ended up being good friends outside of work. the manger was understanding especially when it came to family. i had learned how to do reset for the whole store also how to check the inventory of the store.
good,Its was a pretty easy job. You just read off your sheets and fill the containers with the customers orders and once the list is done you close the container and slide it on the belt. It was kind of fun to see what everyone orders online and going to the different levels for the next items.
good,I've learned so much about retail working at Walgreens. It can get quite busy at times but we pull together as a team and handle it. Management gives you freedom to work on your own but is always there to help if needed.
good,I loved being busy every day and if no customers were present i always found something to do. I enjoyed learning new things with the 3+ years in a retail pharmacy setting.
good,I worked mostly as a cashier so I was required to work with customers on a daily. My coworkers were reliable as well as the shift leads.
good,Working for Walgreens was an awesome experience. Always meeting new people and developing relationships with the regular customers. Never a dull moment management is also very funny and amicable.
good,The hear you out and want you to be involved in the company problem solving. The are a great company to wok for and want you to be happy to come to work.

good,"This was a great place to start out working at.They teach you how to be proficient in customer service, communication, and time management. Such a great company."

good,"Walgreens was a very nice and peaceful place to work at. Great atmosphere, good pay and benefits. Loved the customer experience.I would recommend working there!"
good,A typical day at work is running the cash register and facing the store I learn to mark down and put up different displays. My co workers help me with work and we work as a team alongside mt manager.
good,"Very busy, although i love helping people find the make up and hair products they desire."
good,"I have been with the Walgreens Company for almost a year now!! You learn new things every day, get to meet both nice and nasty people. But as the saying goes, it the people that make the place - the people that I work with makes that saying truer then ever. You hours are played with from time to time and there is sometimes no organization. I myself am screeching for new employment due the manner in which scheduling is dealt with."
good,Walgreens Service Desk is customer focused.  Our customers are the stores.  We help fix software and hardware when there are issues.  We enjoy getting the store up and running as efficiently as possible.
good,A typical day at work consist of calling doctor offices for refill renewals and handling any problems that occurred during the weekend shifts. Checking in medications from our distributor and processing of medications and handling any insurance related issues
good,"For retail pharmacy it was one of the nicer places to work. Work I ng nights, weekends and holidays was not so nice but it's what you do in retail. Nice coworkers and management."
good,I really enjoyed helping customers find the best needs to help them get and stay well. The smile on their faces made me feel like I was doing my job the correct way.
good,"Great environment to learn to multi task, have one on one time with patients, and help out patients get their medicine. As a technician, I learned to prioritize my work and help make sure the pharmacy was running smoothly."
good,"Being the new CPhT to this state and store, acquiring the trust and worthiness of co-workers and management is a process.I have been with Walgreen's for nine years and new state, new rules.The hardest part of my job: getting used to different shifts, I had set hours in WIS. I don't mind it, just something to get used to. I love being a pharmacy technician, it challenges me everyday, the people, the doctor's, the insurances, all of it, you are never doing the same thing for very long, and the busier it is the better, and I wouldn't trade it for the world."
good,I have enjoyed my time at Walgreens for the most part. My position has been eliminated as of 8/31/2016. I meet a lot of new people every day. My co-workers are friendly and courteous.
good,"Walgreens"
good,"I'm almost 40 and when I applied for this job, I was expecting it to be stressful. I figured that stress would be the customers rather than the job. "
good,"Assist with customer service"
good,"Great temporary job, for kids in high school. Potential for promotion, flexible hours, good experience. Management is willing to work with your personal schedule."
good,the hardest party about working for this company was the cashiering because I had no Idea how to work the register at the beginning but I had the best supervisor that tought me the best I needed to know
good,Its a good place to work and always keeps you on your toes. Never the same thing every day. don't always get days off that are needed
good,This is a great place to start your first job or while going to school. you can get great work experience. make some money  while in school or have a busy schedule.
good,The work place is a rewarding and active learning environment that provides the opportunity to acquire great skills on hands-on pharmacy practice and pharmacy management at a faster pace.
good,Great company to work for however there is little room for growth. As a technician I'd have to either become a pharmacist or look into store management.
good,"A typical day at work generally involves ringing up customers and filling prescriptions, when it's too busy management is very good about coming back to assist.  I learned so much about insurance claims and processing prescriptions and worked for some wonderful people.  Unfortunately, the company sets full-time at anything over 30 hours, cuts hours based on success within the store and offers little to no opportunities to advance within the company."
good,"Working at Walgreens was a good experience for me. I had to learn how to put others before myself 100% of the time, I found that to be very eye opening. There was a satisfaction knowing that I did everything within reason to make someone happy, gave me a sense of accomplishment."
good,"I liked working at Walgreens because it was always busy and coworkers were very great to work with.  I worked about thirty hrs weekly when I first started there but due to cutbacks, I am not working enough hours."
good,"I work with a great team of Pharmacists and Technicians that have taught me a great deal in my year and a half working of working with them. My day, as all other jobs I have worked in, starts with customer service. I take a lot of pride in helping people with medications, insurance issues, and just giving them a great experience as often they are not coming to us at their best. I really got a lot out of working as a team with this group of people. Communication is the key when working with so much data and prescription drugs."
good,"Pharmacy Manager for walgreens in middle village is very nice. very professional,  but the staff pharmacist that works for her is a bit harsh."
good,I highly enjoyed working for Walgreens. The only issue i had was a manager who was a bit more strict than i was expecting. Other than that it was great.
good,"Learned a lot. Great staff. Of all the managerial staff encountered, have always been flexible with schedules and if need always understanding with outside problems."
good,I was a pharmacy intern with Walgreens. I would answer patients calls. I would contact the insurance companies regarding patients issues. I would ring people up at front desk.
good,"Working at Walgreens taught me many things and a lot of that is attributed to the great team I worked with and management that helped me along the way. It really made going into work everyday something I could look forward to because it was fun too. "
good,"Good company"
good,"Management lacks leadership, but overall I wouldn't say it is a bad place to work at. Not a good career pick. Thank you. That all I really have to say about this company."
good,filling scripts daily. processing insurance and abiding by company policies to safeguard patient information. Fast paced workplace that give little time to slow down sometimes. overall you learn a lot.
good,"A typical day at Walgreens is usually very busy day between handling cash for assisting the cashiers and helping customers with their concerns and requests. I learned how to  deal with customers in a more effective way in order to provide them with better customer service. Management is good, being part of it I know that every one is willing to work with you and they are good at directing the crew and running the store with me. They help me learn more about managing and keep track of my progress as well. The hardest part of the job is just dealing with problematic customers, but at the end of the day resolving problems and making those type of customers apologize to you really is gratifying."
good,"This was a good job to have. Solid hours and never really boring."
good,"Wal greens was fun to work at and the people were funny and I learned a lot from what customers shared about why they use the same products all the time,"
good,"While working at Walgreen's, I learned a variety of important skills and gained valuable experience in dealing not only with customers, but also with team members. I have learned how to quickly and calmly diffuse a situation and how to unsure that the team worked well as a whole."
good,Walgreens was really nice place to work. I left Walgreens in search of a new career path. I was able to grow while at Walgreens
good,"	Provide courteous and efficient service and solutions to customers"
good,Retail is retail.  Very busy but Walgreens gives best opportunity to deal with customers and patients.  Not much room though for advancement in company.  Very saturated and political.
good,"A typical day at work included making sure the customers were taken care of as well as making sure the store was nice, neat and orderly."
good,"During a typical day of work there were many tasks assigned, whether it involved managing the beauty department, the photo department, assisting on the floor/stock room, cashing customers out and managing the front of the store. I learned customer service strategies, how to manage my own department, how to train other workers and work in various sections of the store. This included taking inventory, scanning in orders/packages, organizing and cleaning the stock room/departments and developing customers photos."
good,It was an decent place to work at but got boring do to the job not challenging me on a intellectual level. The other employees were some of the best people to work with. Management did a fine job running the store. Costumers seemed relatively pleased with there experience.
good,the job is easy it is a job it pays the bills like every job the people you work with can make it bearable the team I as on was small and we got along great we all had similar work ethics s we got in and got it done and left a had fun doing it
good,"Arrived and clocked in, first check to see if my draw needs to be refilled before I start my task. As the day goes by and the store isn't as packed I would step down from being a cashier and restock items."
good,"You basically are your own supervisor in the sense that you go to work each day, and you know what is expected of you, and you perform to the best of your ability.  There isn't someone hovering over your shoulder constantly.  You have weekly meetings where your strengths are touched on as well as areas in need of improvement.  There is not much room for growth, in the sense of climbing up the ladder.  But, other than that, overall, it is a great place to work."
good,I enjoyed working for Walgreens. One was given enough responsibility to take care of the customer well. Management was understanding and reasonable. The customers were great
good,I hope to use my knowledge of the computer systems and my contagious positive attitude to help people while working for this company.
good,The people were great to work with and the job was not difficult at all. I learned that working with others can be great when everyone works together and have positive attitudes. The managers were always willing to hear you and point you in the right direction. The only issue was actually being bored sometimes.
good,Walgreens taught me time management and how to prioritize work. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the more difficult patients but that helped me develop the skill of dealing with all types of personalities. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I saw the appreciation on patient's faces after I had helped them solve their medication problem.
good,"It is a great company to work with. I liked working as a pharmacy technician and I enjoyed helping patients. Assigned work was efficiently completed within the established time frame. Ideas and information were expressed in a complete, clear manner."
good,I am always moving around at this job. I help customers when it is necessary and make sure everything I am assigned is done. The eight hours passes by very quickly.
good,"I am an excellent exceptional worker, who love to multitask. I love providing excellent customer service both to kind and unkind customers. I love helping my co workers. I haven't come across the hardest part of the job because everything I do I try my hardest and make very easy to learn and adapt to."
good,"having fun working and getting along with employees."
good,"fast pace, every one got along. sometimes they over worked employees but I cant complain overall. weekends are hard to get off. manager does nothing all day"
good,Working for Walgreens was an adventure. I came from a buyout and I think that Walgreens handled the transition quite well. They even sent us other volunteer employees from around the country to help us transition to our new jobs and what was expected of us.
good,Good environment to work in. Management and fellow coworkers treat each other with respect.  The job is more suited to someone who wants to work part time.
good,Working at Walgreen was an enjoyable place to work.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and helping customers with their daily needs. The manager always use me as an example how things should be done within the store.
good,"It was always very busy from start of shift to end, I liked that.  I did learn a few new things; such as operating the photo machine and developing photos.  I had a great management team at the store I worked at.  The hardest part of my job was the hours I had to work.  I really enjoyed getting to know the customers, most of them were real fun and enjoyable to be around."
good,"Very diverse and interactive career. Walgreens gave me the opportunity to further my career thru classes, seminars and daily work experience."
good,"While pregnant, I was at high risk of miscarriage.  That was the reason I decided to quit. I enjoyed the customers also the coworkers.  I loved learning on the photo equipment."
good,Walgreens was a very fun job to have but at the sametime it was different cause thats was the first time working in a store like that. And i had a lot of people get mad at me cause i was under age and i couldn't sell cigarettes and beer.
good,"The pharmacists, technicians and front-store staff all work hard and as a team to provide the best experience possible for our customers."
good,"A typical day at Walgreen's was always busy. Went from regular employee to management in a year. Learned a lot along the process and when I became management I was still learning. The hardest par of the job was doing the job for two other shift leads and always getting blamed for not doing something or not doing something correctly. The enjoyable part of the was working with my co-workers, they made the shift fun."
good,"I like working at Walgreens, I love interacting with patients and the hours were great. However, I had to relocate and there was no opening at my new location."
good,"Great working environment ,and a place to learn as you earn .I just need a change in career .As a shift lead i get to teach new employees on a daily basis in which it helps me to learn  more about the finical aspect of the business ."
good,"Started as a regular team member and worked many of the departments throughout the warehouse.  I was promoted to function leader when I applied 14 years later.  I learned a lot of valuable skills in my 7 years as a function leader like managing a department, conflict resolution, leadership, and computer work.  This distribution center had a lot of great people that I was able to work with.  I spent 20 + years there and enjoyed most of it."
good,"Walgreens was a fun place to work for the most part, towards the end new management was brought in and changed the whole job for myself and a lot of other people. Overall, the job offered decent benefits, flexible hours and was a nice learning experience for me as a first job."
good,Filling Prescriptions and assisting customers at the drive through and front counter. Other duties included stocking supplies and medications.
good,"Not always fast paced, but always had something to do. The people were easy to get along with, and I enjoyed my time there."
good,I never had any issues working there.  Great company to work for and the benefits were also good.  My management team was also good and approachable.
good,"•	Developed Customers photographs, clean, passport documents, Help customers "
good,I had fun working here. I started as a cashier working at the front of the store and then I moved back into pharmacy after a few months. I learned a lot of different stuff working in the pharmacy.
good,"Great place to work, wonderful hours and vacation for part time employers. Great raises and fun and new and exciting things to do and learn everyday."
good,Hundreds of prescriptions and very fast paced! Great co-workers and some lovely patients who really appreciate all your hard work!
good,"I worked overnight shift, liked it but the compensation for my area wasn't enough to be able to pay my bills, also being overweight didn't help with being on my feet for 10 hours"
good,it was a ok job just decide to go wear i was making more money an getting payed weekly. but the mangers an customers were excllent
good,The Walgreens Patient Call Center is a Great place to work. Great benefits and really nice people to work with. great place to work
good,"Pizza Hut is a great beginners job. Flexible with your hours, fast past job. Younger people to work with, Managers are down to earth. Being able to advance up is decent. i was able to move up to lead cook."
good,"Multi-tasking a must.  As the only pharmacist on duty most shifts balancing the many tasks such as overseeing activities of technicians and interns, verifying correct medication in dosage, amount, drug interactions and efficacy as well as performing MTM's and immunizations, interacting with third parties via phone,counseling patients both in person and via phone, managing drive up and patient consultation window plus much more all provided for a fast paced but productive atmosphere. Providing excellent customer service an absolute must!"
good,"Job was great, versatile, and helped employees work on communication skills with others. Enjoyed working days or nights, fun environment with time to enjoy your day and holidays."
good,"Great place to work.. Lots of fun!  There was always so much to do with new displays.  Holidays inventory change over.. "
good,"An average day consists of filling prescriptions, helping technicians, answering phones, customer service by helping the counter and educate patients. Most enjoyable part would be when I get to interact with the customers and help them with whatever their needs may be."
good,"Walgreens wasn't bad at all, managers were great and loved the challenge presented to me everyday. Very good company with some good benefits."
good,"A very easy job, not much is required of the employee, management was always kind and understanding and fellow employees are generally just as kind and willing to help you learn."
good,"Ultimately at Walgreens, my main responsibility was customer satisfaction. Making sure that all our retail associates were putting the customer first. I would maintain a day-to-day operations such as receiving inbound products and relaying duties to my employees. Behind the scenes, I would identify current and future customer requirements by establishing rapport with potential and actual customers and other persons in a position to understand service requirements. I would ensure availability of merchandise and services by approving contracts; maintaining inventories. In my down time I would formulate pricing policies by reviewing merchandising activities; determining additional needed sales promotion; authorizing clearance sales; studying trends."
good,Very fast pace work environment. Lot to learn. How to pick full cases and how to pick individual items. Co-workers are very helpful.
good,"I was very sad when I was let go from this company, I felt as though there should have been some sort of an appeal process to be able to explain my side of the story."
good,"Walgreens is a great company to work for! The managment/district managers truly care about their employees and the company. One example is, we have daily 5 minute meetings that include up-coming events for our company, our daily goals, and survey scores..etc. I enjoy opening the store the most and helping customers find what they need. The hardest part is having to work the Holidays, but that is expected in retail."
good,You have to be able to learn quickly and handle angry customers as a pharmacy technician at Walgreen's. I learned about many different medications and their uses and had a very good experience with my fellow employees at Walgreen's.
good,"The job is good, and if you are not in a leadership position they will work around your availability, but leadership has horrible hours.  There is a lot to do, and they are happy to teach you anything you want to learn, but as soon as you learn it, you are expected to do the job, even if that task is not part of your job.  They cannot keep staff so you are always doing double duty."
good,"Its a nice place to work at. It made me really a different person, more responsible, smart and changed my way of looking at people."
good,"The pharmacist ad technicians as well as the general staff outside of the pharmacy were all very nice and we formed a great peer group during work hours. The only deplorable time I've experienced is working at the drive through pharmacy when people are in a hurry and they refuse to be cooperative and provide you with anything helpful to let you do your job. Except for a couple instances of this, the job was actually quite enjoyable, and many customers gain a great appreciation for you when you are friendly and remember their names, etcetera."
good,Very good structure and nice co-workers. A typical day working at Walgreens is stocking shelves and assisting customers. The management was very strict but nice.
good,It has an awesome infrastructure all over the world when compared to the others.The management has undergone changes and is looking to boost the growth.
good,taught younger children the fundamentals of gymnastics . played games and built obstacle courses for students. the hardest part was dealing with over bearing parents .
good,"If you work in a busy store, you should expect to WORK 90% of your shift on any given day. Weekends are sometimes the nicest day of the week, where you can slow down a bit. In the pharmacy, holidays really just mean more work on the days prior to and following. "
good,"I did stock inventory and checked the dates on all medications. I would do inventory counts as well. It was a very fast paced environment with a lot of customers. I would get prescriptions from doctors and enter them into the Walgreens system. From there they would print out and I would fill the medication. I would answer phone calls from patients and talk with insurance companies about co-payments, deductibles, and whether the patient was able to get a different medication if theirs was not covered. The hardest part about this job was being under staffed and not being able to keep up with the work flow because of it."
good,"Walgreens to one of the best company that i have worked for, excellent benefits, pay rate could use an increase for the full-time employees."
good,"overall good place to work, does depend on store location and store management however. Had excellent pharmacy managers at almost every store."
good,"If you are new to the work force, then Walgreens is a good option to start out in. They have multiple positions within the store that people can advance to. The management team are helpful and friendly."
good,"Sunday means fun day. Every Sunday I had the opportunity to open with one of the outmost  humble and nicest manager not to mention about the rest of my co-workers. Sunday was extremely amazing, I had the opportunity to perform one of the greatest duties I enjoyed the most; price change. Been surrounded by co-workers who demonstrated interest for you made it feel like home. Welcoming every single customer and getting a smile in return was one of my greatest achievements."
good,Great work environment the customers are very friendly and the low prices we have are a plus. And the co workers are great as well.
good,"Working for Walgreens was intriguing. The ability to see all of the innovation, creativity, and hard work that goes on behind the scenes gave me a great amount of respect for the company. There are many great minds that work there; it was a pleasure to be a part of the team."
good,"Decent work place, good benefits.  Advancement isn't always based on improvement or work ethic.  For such a large, successful company, they could care more for their employees (better pay)."
good,loved the staff and customers. the hardest part of the job would be stocking all new products coming in. The management was very helpful but not always on the same page
good,"you have to do an excellent customer service, put merchandise as fast as you can, support the main cashier when the line is more than 3 people, given priority to the task that the shift lead or assistant manager order you and you never stop it is exhausting."
good,Its ok the same chores day in and day out. Not much growth wise on the retail or corporate side since moving to Europe. Good for management experience.
good,"The work itself is pretty tedious, but it helps to grow attention to detail and retail experience. It offers a lot of room to grow."
good,"cashier for the most part , worked in photo khakis and also helped out in pharmacy when needed . I feel as if I was a great leader to the team that I had , always was open on new ideals how things should have been ran and operated"
good,great company with excellent benefits. Meet diverse population daily. Tries to meet customers demand always. Clean and fun place to work at time. tries to work well with school schedule
good,"fun working environment, we all do our best to make customers feel welcomed. wish we had enough employees to make every body job much easier. There have been many changes in the company. some good some bad. but we all have to run with the punches. company promotes promotion, which is great."
good,Walgreens has been a wonderful company to work for over the years. It is a very ethical company that an employee can be proud to say they work for.
good,still employed as of today. Was hoping to stay in dept they hired me for but my schedule looks different every week. And I think I am a good person in the COS dept
good,Was able to work developing photos at this job which was fun. Other than that the job was repetitive and monotonous. Great Co-workers
good,great place to work I learned a lot and they helped in ptcb certification. I started there 8 years ago with no pharmacy experience and got state licensed then ptcb certification
good,The pharmacy is a fun place to work but is quite demanding in what they ask of you.  The goals are ever changing and if you meet your goals they seem to just ask for more.
good,it really depends on how you look at it retail isnt for everyone but it wasn't all that bad they change management a lot so you never know who your fellow managers could turn out to be it really gets in the way of communication
good,"The company has many avenues for growth as an employee. Although it is great to be able to help so many people stay or get healthy on a daily basis, it is also quite demanding because sometimes it seems there aren't enough staff members to get customers helped quickly."
good,My typical day at work used to be run up a 100 customers or more per day and provide customers with extraordinary customer care.
good,"My time at Walgreens has definitely been a learning and growing experience. It has made me more efficient and flexible. I have enjoyed learning more skills, and becoming more of an asset to the company"
good,Working for Walgreens can be a very good and fulfilling job or a miserable experience. The manager and the shift leads really determine the culture of the store. A bad manager can ruin a store! I do like that the company dose put an emphasis on diversity and excellence. It is very hard to get a promotion or a raise of you are part-time. There are not too many incentives to do a good job. I have liked that you are encouraged to learn all the departments though.
good,"Long story. The main issue was conflicts of scheduling. The management was kind and genuine. I was being pulled in too many different directions at the time, but the job was typical of retail."
good,i was not there long but while i was there the staff was so nice and supportive. The manager was supportive and patient. I learned so much as a photo lab technician and i enjoyed doing that.
good,I learned from my co-workers the importance of detail. I was inspired  by how much they cared for the growth of the company it  motivated me to want to more.
good,Walgreens is a great company to work for. I am looking for a career change. they are fair to their employees and offer great benefits. What I love most about my job is merchandising and coaching/developing my employees.
good,"Fun work place, multiple opportunities available for advancement, flexible scheduling and hours available, huge emphasis on teamwork"
good,"The work place provides a friendly work environment and promotes professional growth. It gives a wide range of opportunities in various fields, not only in pharmacy"
good,"Undergoing a major IT re-organization.  But in time will land on its feet.  Outsourcing most of the development, and QA organizations along with Project Management and other management functions."
good,"Working in the pharmacy has definitely taught me alot about the industry, however, Walgreens is no longer the company it used to be."
good,If you are not self motivated and can motivate others then Walgreens is not the place for you. The hardest part of the job is employees not respecting management.
good,The people you work with will make your shifts feel longer or shorter. A lot of politics with the management. There are going to be hard days and easy days. You can not please everyone.
good,I enjoyed working for a company where I was valued as an employee. I also liked that there was diversity in the work place.
good,"I took care of the Hallmark section of the store, I worked in photo, and the main register. I enjoyed this job because of the customer interaction and how I could help them."
good,"I have held multiple positions, in multiple states as a CPhT. If you are willing to move where there are opportunities, you can advance. Seniority is given benefits, however no job guarantees. With the recent merger with Alliance Boots, and their CEO taking over Walgreens, the direction of the company is changing. Many 20+ year employees (pharmacists and technicians) have lost their jobs due to RIF (reduction in force). There is no central talent acquisition office to offer assistance in jobs within the national company. Progessive in allowing CPhT to manage pharmacist performance. Beginning to utilize Kanban and Lean Six Sigma philosophies, but not aggressive enough to introduce it into retail yet."
good,I enjoyed working out in photo and the store more than in the pharmacy.  I got stuck more at the drive thru and could never really hear the customer.
good,"retail is a hard work ethic. you must work nights, weekends, and holidays. that is hard for me being a single mother with a child in school."
good,"I worked for this company for over 20 years. I worked for several different managers. The management was primarily caring and helpful to the employees. In a typical day, I would assist customers and employees to make a better relationship for the company with the community. I learned how to look at things from different views and to listen to people. The hardest part of my job eventually became the overnight hours. The best part was the people, not just the employees, but the customers, also."
good,"The graveyard shift has you working ten-hour shifts, 7 days straight, but then you also have a week off (minus delivery day). This was preferable to me compared to some of the schedules I had to put up with at former employers (unloading trucks at Walmart sticks you with one day off at a time, which means you really can't plan anything resembling a weekend). "
good,Fast paced facility work and life balance is hard to maintain. Management not interested in what going on in your day to day only demands what you must sacrifice for them.
good,Managed numerous locations over my ten years with Walgreens. Fortunate to work with all types of employees and serve all types of customers.  Hard work but everyday was different. Continually adapted to changes in retail over the years.  Time and employee management was critical to successfully led a team.  Results were rewarded at every position. Effective communications and efficient operations were essential.
good,Walgreens was a good place  to work. I leaned a lot and it a large part of my body of work as a retail manager. Walgreens is a great place to start if you interested in retail.
good,Supportive management with built in room for career growth. Slightly numbers driven in terms of performance evaluations.
good,"It was an alright job, the typical day would start off with me maintaining my area i was assigned to, I'll miss that place."
good,I enjoyed working with my employees and helping customers.  I was always willing to help anywhere needed in the store or at other store locations.
good,Advancing in Walgreens taught me a lot about working hard to get to the top. Working here also taught me how to get along with difficult people.
good,When I first moved to Milwaukee I barely knew anyone. I applied at a Walgreens just down the street from my apartment which happened to be one of the busiest in the area. My coworkers were very friendly and greeted me with open arms. I became friends with all of my coworkers and a lot of the customers as well.
good,"I was able to enhance my ability to provide excellent customer service. As I was responsible for assisting store management with opening on the weekend, I helped count verify the registers drawer; place ads, place coupon books and also provided assistance with photo."
good,Most coworkers are fun to work with. Management is ok for the most part... They slack up on communication but overall its a nice place to work.
good,Very supportive and responsible management. Fun atmosphere. Always customer focused in every situation that arises while on the job.
good,Walgreens is a great company to work for. Great benefits and a steady work flow. Easy to get into the swing of things and they like to promote form with in.
good,Great place to work for part time all the coworkers are great to get along with and the job itself is not as bad. Management is great they help with any work related problems that arise.
good,"It was great to work within the pharmacy, learned a lot from my experiences there, there is not much room for growth without pharmacy degree"
good,"Hard place for management"
good,"Walgreens has been an excellent company to work for."
good,"-Helping customers to live a healthy life"
good,Very nice company with strong ethics and good company culture. They invest in technology to keep things updated and the company is strong in customer focus.
good,"Learned about time management"
good,Great Company. They really put the customers first.  Their software is easy to figure out. Corporate is very approachable and they always make sure you stay up to date on policies and procedures.
good,"A typical day of work here is no where near typical. With it being an every changing environment, it was a challenge that was easily dealt with. My coworkers are fun to work with, which makes the job easier to me. I have learned to provide the best customer service possible from this company. Management wise, they are still lacking in some areas. The hardest part of the job is the hours. Constantly changing from different shifts will take a toll on you. Evenings from a few days, then day shift back to evenings doesn't feel very stable."
good,"I started as a seasonal worker while home from college, and continue there now. There is a lot of room for growth within the company and I have learned skills that will be essential in any future positions."
good,"Good /kind people"
good,"During a typical work day I had a variety of tasks including replenishing stock, ensure cash counts were accurate, facing product and closing the store at night."
good,"I had an incredible experience at Walgreens. My typical work day consisted of helping customers, ringing up products, and cleaning the store. My co-workers were great to work with and it felt like we created our own family within the workplace. My favorite part about my job was getting to meet so many new people while still getting the job done. The hardest part of this job was working holidays in a retail setting."
good,it was a great place to work. i learned a lot from the people there. they were helpful and friendly. i will definitly work there again.
good,"This job can be awesome if you are willing to commit the time to becoming a manager and entering the training program.  However, if your aspirations go beyond the confines of Walgreens then you will want to move on quickly."
good,"Very accepting of crazy work hours, unfortunately had to work many of the important holidays so I was unable to spend them with family. Decent pay, with decent hours."
good,"I met and greeted guests upon arrival, assisted guests store products and location, range/checked out a guest when they were ready to purchase their products and mentioned to them about new store offers and promotions. I worked well with coworkes in a teambuilding atmosphere and being able to get tasks done in a timely fasion. Managment was very goal oriented and was fair when it came to employee relations."
good,I learned a lot from this company. I learned how to process and fill prescriptions. I learned how to enter in patient and insurance information. I also learned how to solve any problems that may have occurred with processing a customer's insurance or prescription.
good,walgreens is a great place to utilize and gain customer service skills. a day at work consist of helping customers with cosmetics and other retail needs .
good,"We did compounding, stocking, customer service, ordering etc"
good,Prescriptions filled quickly and with a smile. Any question you have for the Pharmacist they are quick and willing to help answer your questions
good,"Great for people looking to keep busy. Your often alone in the office and a lot falls on you to get things done. So if your looking for something you can take control of and feel ready to manage quite a bit, than this is right up your alley. Your multitasking skills will be reach the best you've ever had."
good,"If you really feel drawn to a career where your helping customers, this is the best place to work. Walgreens really shows how much they care for people and genuinely want to keep you well."
good,"I loved working there.  It was close to home and I was able to work extra when ever I was needed.  I worked with some of the best people and working together, we were able to accomplished what we needed to because we worked as a team."
good,Friendly and fun co workers. I got to work in all the departments. Enjoyed working in the pharmacy. Enjoyed meeting new customers.
good,Working at Walgreen's has taught me so much about customer service and patience.  I utilized many customer service skills in order to help customers find exactly what they need to buy.
good,"loved dealing with customers, new experience with retail, met new friends in co coworkers, most enjoyable part of working there was meeting new people"
good,"Pharmacists get good pay, options to chose premium healthcare, bonus structure for management is good, received bonus stock units from company, decent company to work with. Recently they have been responding to field feedback. No lunch break provided for pharmacists."
good,The first thing that comes to mind when you hear walgreens is old people. The elderly need alot of patience and proactive help.
good,"Walgreens is a company that allows its employees to work their way up. I was hired as a Shift Lead and now I have the opportunity to apply for jobs at the district office as well as Assistant Manager in Training positions. The benefits are also really good and the company supports LGBT lifestyles through insurance and policies that protect against discrimination. Like any retail store, the pace is very fast and not all employees can keep up. The worst part about working at a job is the possibility of having to work with people who don't take their work seriously and complain."
good,"A typical day consists of mutual respect and teamwork. A time managed lunch schedule to reduce irritation among co-workers. Taking time to work with local and national vendors alike, and a good sense of helping those who walk into the store to be in good health."
good,"A typical day at Walgreens being a manager is first thing you do is look at your sales from the day before. You handle all necessary paperwork for the day. Next you walk your store and make notes were you see there are opportunity to get sales by changing displays, stocking your shelves etc. You make a list by departments delegating the task. You have a 5 min meeting with your staff to let them no about sales and store information."
good,"I could not wait to walk in the door and see my co-workers.  I was truly happy to be there in the cosmetics department.  I learned that i CAN make a difference.  I was well known and respected.  The management was always there for me.  The hardest part about this job was tying up all the lose ends at the end of the night, along with cleaning and facing.  There never seemed to be enough time to perfect my department.  What I enjoyed most was the recognition for my work.  I earned 13 customer service stars in just 1.5 years."
good,"Managing the day-to day activities of a Walgreen retail store, including front-end and pharmacy operations. Primary manager in charge of hiring, training, cross training, evaluating, disciplining, scheduling and payroll of my staff."
good,"When I first started working for Walgreens, I felt like I was misled on all accounts. The people were not friendly, (most of) the managers were not effective and the employees were awkward. Sure, they were ""friendly"" until you passed the point of small talk which led right into uncomfortable silence. The employees all seemed to be socially inept around others whom they did not know. Conversations could not be held that did not revolve around Walgreens.Awkward eye-locking was a common occurrance. There was absolutely no form of teamwork within that store. I will give the benefit of the doubt and say that perhaps it was just never necessary. I will also give the benefit of the doubt to the store manager who never seemed to do anything. If he was outside of the office, he would not be seen doing anything strenuous. More often than not, I would find that he and the pharmacy manager were in the office, chatting up, laughing and clicking away on the computer."
good,"I either helped open or closed store"
good,"i love shopping at walgreens and the discounts from working there are a big help, i need a job with better pay. i like being a pharmacy tech but i want a better job with better pay and who can work around my schedule as a mom. i feel like i dont spend enough time with my son"
good,"Overall my experince with Walgreens has been good. They worked around my schedule when I was in school, and the health benefits are good. You are also given an option to participate in their profit sharing 401k program. The stock purchase with a 10% discount is also a plus."
good,"Training Individuals on a daily basis with more than 900 employees within our specific District. "
good,"Its retail.  I spent a lot of time on the floor interacting with customers which I liked.  The actual work is hard on your body.  Lots of climbing, bending, stocking shelves, lifting heavy boxes, etc.  There are opportunities to advance as long as you are willing to spend some time in the job.  You work approx. 44 hours a week but the upper level managers are expected to work about 50-60 hours a week."
good,Handle daily activities centered around a leading category.  Communicate with vendors and cross-functional teams regularly.
good,I would enter/fill prescriptions. I would also cash out the customers. I felt it was a very rewarding job being able to help people get the medicine they needed.
good,"A typical day at work first included clocking-in so that our work time could be recorded accurately. Then I would go straight to the manager, or assistant manager, and ask them what was needed of me to do that day. They would give me a list of items that had to be completed my the end of my work day. I usually would start off either at the cash registers up front, or working hands-on in the store. At the cash register I would greet every customer who came in, check customer's items out for sale, handle money, and maintain the front counter areas. Working in the store, I would stock shelves, move items/shelves, price items, check for dates on items to make sure they are not expired, clean anything needed, make price/sale tags to put up, etc. The hardest part of the job was doing a new task that I was unfamiliar with. I learned how to have patience in learning new tasks and the more I did them, the better I became at doing them with no problem. I also learned how to perform good customer service. No matter what day it was, I always showed politeness and helpfulness to the customers because I wanted them to have the best experience in the store and want to return. The management was well for the most part, it seemed to be organized and professional. My co-workers were very pleasant to work with. I enjoyed having their company each day at work and we all seemed to get along. The most enjoyable part of the job was feeling accomplished when I successfully helped a customer. Especially when customers take the time to thank you for your services and being accommodating to them."
good,"I was assigned a number of Walgreens stores. I would get up in the morning and prioritize my day. Depending upon the critical calls that came in, I was able to coordinate my work and maximize efficiency. I would troubleshoot, repair and maintain all HVAC and refrigeration equipment. I also made minor plumbing, flooring, carpentry, and electrical repairs. I learned how to manage my time because of the responsibility put on me and the team by management of allowing us to run calls as we felt were most efficient. I also learned new equipment as Walgreens upgraded equipment. I learned automation controls. My coworkers helped out whenever I needed and I did the same. The hardest part of my job was the whether and those hot days on the roof. The most enjoyable part was meeting and forging friendships with the store mangers."
good,"Most of the managers are pretty good at what they do, but a couple of them aren't very compliant. Overall I've had an alright experience. All of my co-workers are really nice. A few of them are kind of lazy but I'd say more than half are really helpful. My favorite parts of this job are working out of totes and interacting with regulars, the hardest parts are dealing with coupon problems and the registers' computers crashing and having to restart in the middle of a busy day."
good,"As a member of management the constant moving around was a headache. As soon as you build a rapport with you staff you are getting shipped out. The benefits were good and the work wasn't hard, just getting reliable people to do their job is difficult. Would of stayed if they offered tuition reimbursement, but sadly they dont."
good,"I have been with this company this time for 10 years.  The company is changing, hours are being cut, they are getting ready to close 200 stores so not sure about job security.  I like working there.  I have been disappointed to learn that there is a cap on my pay, and really not much room for advancement.  I love the customers that I wait on daily.  The hardest part of the job is the physical labor like unloading truck and other demanding physical activities."
good,"A typical day at work included stocking the floor, helping fulfill customers needs, and working the register. I learned very good people skills. The managers come and go very often and it is very rare, at my store, to have the same cycle of managers for more than a few months. It is great experience working with and around all types of people. Co-workers vary, some want to be there and some do not but the important part is that you do your own job right. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers that are not satisfied and very unhappy. It is hard to not take things personal but you just have to understand that it is part of the job. My most enjoyable part of my job is when I help a customer and I see them leave happy and with a smile on their face."
good,"Daily filled , packed ans shipped prescriptions. Coached and developed team members.  Researched and solved pharmacy patient issues and problems. Most gratifying job knowing that we serviced the patient and were error free. Working and interacting with team members was a very enjoyable part of the job."
good,This is all part of the bank.  This particular department was in Marketing.  I was pulled down to that department because of my sales in Customer Satisfaction.  A group of 5 of us were top sales associates and they needed more sales in Marketing so gave  us a raise and asked us to move to that department.  I did a lot of Balance Transfers.
good,"Celebrated staff accomplishments, learned how to work in an upbeat environment. Everyone was helpful and patient with me being new to the company and it was a welcoming place to work."
good,Moved up the ladder.  Good company to work for.  Learned a lot about managing people and running a highly profitable company.
good,Enjoyed the amount of group communication. Tasks were done effectively due to the great workplace environment. Commission for selling side products were also appreciated.
good,"Any new hires that Walgreens hires they are required to work 3rd shift. "
good,"See other Walgreens review within this profile. (First review provides the same details for both locations in Fitchburg, WI and Buffalo Grove, IL)"
good,"This was a great place to work, I have remained in this company for a year now and have switched between two stores.A typical day at work was just spending time with cutomers and assissting them with the things they needed. management was a great success at this store."
good,"Not too much to say about this company, they are no longer in the area. But while I was there it was a job that paid the bills."
good,Company was a great place to work with flexible scheduling and promoting from within. Training provided for those that want to advance in the retail setting.
good,"*Learn a lot"
good,"The job is a decent job with room to advance, sometimes relatively quickly. Management is usually pretty understanding and willing to work with employees for scheduling. It's a slightly physical job, no more or less than probably any other retail job."
good,A typical work day consists of doing multiple tasks. You will provide customer service as well as perform some stockroom duties. All customer service associates are required to be cross-trained in at least one other department.

good,Every day was different. Store teams were great. Too many corporate changes to keep up with for most of them. Most district personnel were helpful.
good,"Every day, each employee was assigned to meet a certain sales quota. This quota helped to improve the sales skills for every employee which i found very beneficial. The best part of the job was restocking all the inventory at the end of every night."

good,Everyday gives you something new to tackle.  I learned to be aggressive in my own learning and to be open and adaptable for any situation.  My co-workers have always been fun and amazing to work with and can be one of the best parts of working for Walgreens.  The hardest part of the job is being able to multitask everything that needs to be done in one shift.
good,Working at here was very nice. the staff makes the experience even better. i got to interact with many different types of people. Most were nice while other's were a bit emotional. Sometimes its hard to make changes to the schedule though.

And learning how to interact with impatient customers.
good,Flexible Schedules. They were able to work around my school schedule which was nice. Management isn't always the best. Yearly raises are often cut. Claims bad revenue for small raises but always buying some new company.
good,"In my time working at Walgreens, I can easily say I learned a lot, and had a memorable experience. The managers were focused on training everyone, despite the store being extremely hectic and usually pressed for time. It is a very welcoming environment, and I picked up a variety of skills that will serve me well.

good,"I have to work with customers and handle their prescription and personal information.  None of the information that I come across can be spoken outside of work.  Everyday there are challenges with insurance, doctors, and patients that need to be resolved and they need to be resolved in different manners and I find it fascinating to find these solutions and fix the issue.  I work very closely with the pharmacists there to make sure that the patient is being handled in the best way possible.  Communication between the pharmacy staff and customers needs to be strong and the technicians play an important role in providing the communication needed to complete the job.  Being thanked by the customers when I go out of my way to solve their issue is always the most enjoyable aspect of my job.  I always like to hear that I made a difference in someones day.  Getting a customer compliment is also highly enjoyable and when I receive one I know that I am doing my job well."

It was the kind of place where it was like a neighborhood meeting place.  For most employees, it was a job to have on their way to big and better things, but most of the employees were fun and knowledgeable."
good,"A typical day involves review reports such as inventory status, sales, payroll, and corporate emails. In addition to reviewing reports, preparing the agenda for the day and delegating task.

good,"A typical day would definatley depend on which part of the store you were working. If its the pharmacy during a typical work day, then it consists of working very hard to provide people with their medicine with the hours flying by.

I liked working under an organized and upbeat manager, and with good supportive co-workers who were willing to learn and do their jobs. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers whose insurance was cut off or did not cover the medication. Trying to help them understand or give them other options, which they usually did not want was difficult. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to assist customers in a timely fashion and give friendly service that was sincere and they appreciated it. It is a very fulfilling career that I enjoy."
good,Depending on the store it can be really busy or very slow.  The people at the store level our great.  Not a lot of room for advancement but pay isn't terrible.  Would recommend working here.

good,The current location I'm at is a very fast paced environment. I have learned to have more patience because we deal with all types of customers. The hardest part of my job in being a manager is remaining calm in situations where a customer is very irate and in your face hollering and screaming.
good,"Walgreens is a very productive place to work. There is always something to do. If you like interacting with customers on a daily basis, this is the job for you."
good,"There is a lot of opportunities to advance up in Walgreens. What I like most is that every day is different and you'll always have a new project to work on. The thing I don't like is using the branded salutations such as ""welcome to Walgreens"" and ""be well""; which are now requirements to say."
good,Good chances to grow with the company. Nice place to learn about sales and marketing.
good,Overall a great place to work with lots of career potential.

good,I really like working for this company. The customers are very nice and remember you by name.
good,The inability of a flexible schedule due to business needs is extremely hard to get days off when needed. The individuals in manager are great people but are unable to effectively manage due to higher individuals being involved preventing others to grow underneath of them
good,Constantly busy! Encourages excellent customer service and continued education.
good,The best part of the job is getting to know the customers that frequent the neighborhood Walgreens.

good,I worked primarily as a cashier during my tenure at Wallgreens. I was responsible for greeting customers entering and leaving the store; as well as ringing them up quickly and efficiently. I also had training as a photo tech. Here I had to develop customer photos and assist with any questions regarding development of film. I learned how to use a cash register and helped count the till. The hardest part about this job was the spontaneous schedule. However it was also one of the most enjoyable aspects of the job since I wasn't stuck on one schedule.

good,"Typical days work involve the general public. Occasional theft from customers, clean ups, and multitasking.  I have learned how to use in-store software. Management does a good job to help with any issues that may occur.  Best part of the job/day is when customers are appreciative of the help that you give them, especially the regular customers. The worst or hardest part is dealing with theft. You cant confront a ""suspect"" you have to know that they are and what items."

good,"Has on the job training."
good,"-Take the information needed to fill a prescription from customers or health professionals"

good,"Daily events consist of customer service, inventory management, trianing new employees in all departments that apply to them, taking care of vendors while checking in product, and dealing with new situations everyday."
good,Walgreens is a company currently involved in international expansion.  The expense of this investment leaves the stores in the United States short of some resources.
good,"great company. a typical day or night i should say was assisting customers (finding products, selling products and cash register). management was great in that i got to work with different managers on a weekly basis and all of them were supportive and kept me busy my whole shift.My coworkers were great though I worked overnights so interaction was minimal. The hardest part of the job was managing task and covering the front of the store simultaneously. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a great diverse group of people."
good,Walgreens is a good place to work overall.  Sometimes because the company is so large it can feel like you are not significant and the sense of Culture they try to imbue feels unnecessary and forced.  However the benefits of working for a stable company with decent pay outweigh this.
good,Walgreens hired me on as a part-time employee while I was a full-time student at the local community college.
good,"Excellent working environment and nice coworkers."
good,You see something new every day.  Setting the seasonal aisle is fun.  Being the first to see whats new for each holiday is exciting.

good,"Fun and enjoyable workplace. Got Promoted after just a few months from Cashier to SIMS Coordinator. Which taught me a lot about Inventory, Ordering process."

good,"Mainly cash handling, i.e. working a cash register. Also, cleaning, reorganizing the store (resets), refill ink cartridges, developing film."
good,I enjoyed working here.  My hours were cut and my car was in severe accident that prevented me from getting to work.  The people there are hard workers and very kind.  I miss working here
good,The pharmacy is a 24 hour pharmacy and it is always busy. A typical day includes customer service and assistance. The duty of a pharmacy technician is to aid the pharmacist and to explain medication to several patient. The pharmacy team is a really excellent staff and very helpful. The hardest and most enjoyable part  of the job is customer service. It is very rewarding helping patients and customers with their needs but it is also very exhausting.
good,learned a lot there was a lot of opportunity to grow. I wish that the pay was slightly more but overall it was a great experience.
good,"Walgreen's was a good company overall.  They took care of me when it came to making sure I had the correct and up to date certifications and licenses to work in the pharmacy.  The main problem was the scheduling.  They did not care if you had a family or not.  Everyone was expected to work evenings and weekends, and were expected to be there and do whatever necessary to make sure that their kids, if applicable, were taken care of.  Every store I worked for it seemed as though the technician who made the schedule always had the best schedule and made sure it worked for them, not considering what was best for all employees. Every store differed in the management and how well or not so well they played a role in the work environment.  I found myself, in most cases, playing the role of a manager over the other technicians.  I feel as though becoming a ""senior"" technician was taken advantage of in not only my case, but also the case of other technicians who accomplished this goal as well."
good,"I was a beauty advisor for Walgreen's, I performed essential store services including cash and credit transactions, ordering of merchandise, customer service, and employee supervision. I interacted with 350 customers to ensure quality of service and resolved any complaints or issues. On special occasions I would solicited sales of new and additional products and services. Hardest part of the job was I had to work some weekends but I always enjoyed working with customer and employees."
good,"At walgreens I was cross trained. I was cross trained in the Cosmetics dept, Photo dept and trained as a Cashier. A typical day up at the front register included ringing up approximately 150-200 customers in an 8 hour period. I answered the phone and directed customers to aisles and to specific departments based on their needs and wants. I learned a great deal at Walgreens. I learned how to become a better multi-tasker, how to answer the phone professionally, to be more outgoing, to be more assertive, how to make the store clean and pleasing to the eye, how to design displays to maximize profits and much more. My co-workers at Walgreens were my absolute favorite co-workers out of all the other jobs I've had. I actually became super close friends with one of my co-workers and she is now my best friend. The staff were super friendly and very helpful. They all wanted you to succeed and they would help you do just that. I would have to say the Cosmetics department was the hardest to learn because of all the information that you learn. The most enjoyable part was the customers. I loved meeting people and hearing their stories or about their day during their transactions with me. I enjoyed making most of my transactions or interactions with them, personal in some way. When working at the Front Register, you met at least 90% of the clientele. I was a very shy person before I started working at Walgreens and working there helped me come out of my shell."
good,"pharmacy is a mess. "
good,walgreens is a typical pharmacy busy as the others fast paced and every one seems to start off there. This is a place that takes everyone in trains them and yet still gets buisness done.

good,"A typical day at work consisted of me assisting the team with getting the day's tasks accomplished and in a timely manner, all while providing excellent customer service. I learned how to communicate better, be more of a team player, and how to process a roll of film. The management was outstanding. Always sure to check on their staff to see if we needed assistance or to help with customer service and cashiering. My co workers were the greatest thing about the job, next to the fact that I was constantly meeting new people and helping  them get what they need. The hardest part of the job was juggling tasks and assisting customers while trying to adhere to a strict deadline. But the challenge made it fun. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a great team and accomplishing so many goals and being able to help so many customers get the items they need to get through the day."
good,I learned how to do a lot of skills here like typing and filling prescriptions
good,"When I worked at Walgreens Pharmacy, as soon as I clocked in, I began my main priority of taking care of the customers. I also helped maintain proper storage and security for drugs, maintaining patient profiles, cleaning equipment and work areas, referring any questions regarding prescriptions, drug information, or health matters to a pharmacist, performing retail or mail-order pharmacy duties such as receiving, verifying and preparing prescriptions prior to checking by a pharmacist. I got along very well with my co-workers and helped anyone who was in need of extra help all the while still keeping my full attention on the customers. The hardest park of my job as a pharmacy technician was the multi-tasking but it wasn't something new to me, I tend to work well under pressure. What I enjoyed the most about working in the pharmacy was being able to help customers in need of getting their medication as fast and as efficient as possible, as well as wishing them to get well and have a wonderful day."
good,"I am always early so that I can prepare and spend time with the NP."
good,I held many positions at Walgreens. I had 9 years as an assistant manager and had my pharmacy technicians license also allowing me to help out any position that was needed.

good,"While working at Walgreens i learned great customer service skills and how to interact with people from all diffrent companies who interact with our store. Our co-workers were the best part of this store, they were so nice and fun to work with! The hardest part of the day was also my favorite part. We have a bailer for cardboard and loading and unloading it was my favorite part of the day."
good,"First job I ever had. Was excited and I enjoyed my time here.  However, because it's not a large store, business was often slow."
good,I have been employed with this company for 12 and 1/2 years. I have seen many manager go through the of company cuts and lay offs. I really dislike they way the company cuts hours of the employees based on there production numbers.
good,Looking for a full time job. I am very hard working and fulfill any job given to me to the fullest.
good,"I worked in one of the higher volume stores in the districts averaging about 500 scripts a day. Work can be so stressful sometimes but somehow we managed to work together and help each other out. At the end of the day, we are glad we are there for each other and I can say our store definitely works as a team versus some of the other stores in the chain."

My co-workers have helped me excel in my position in ways of providing informational drug-related articles to enhance and further my education in the usage of medications, background information, and what to look for when analyzing prescriptions. Due to my experience in the field, i've learned how to deal with emergency situations, billing complications and patient disputes. Unfortunately, the limited work hours have conflicted with school hours and I am looking to find more flexible hours."
good,The company has great leadership and management within the store. Team work and co-workers are a great plus.
good,I enjoy working there and having the fun work environment that I do.  The people are really nice. I always leave feeling accomplished.  I've learned great deal about merchandising and meeting customer demands. The hardest part of the job is knowing that you can't please every person. Whether they were just having a bad day or they just want to be mad at the first person they see. The most enjoyable part is knowing that you can make someone happy and there are plenty of ways to assist customer and meet their needs.
good,Enjoy most people I work with. Like working with the public.  Most customers are very appreciative of the help I provide.   Not enough budget to hire enough people to get everything done.
good,No day is ever like the day before. On a daily basis you are faced with new challenges and various individuals.
good,good place to work as a college student. friendly staff and flexible hours
good,"Creating weekly work schedules, managing store operations in the absence of the store manager, handling customer complaints."

good,excellent hands on training and customer service opportunities

I have learned may different things work here management skills, payroll, time and attendance, and corresponding with district office managers. I management anywhere from 8-13 different people teaching them how to develop themselves into better employees, building confidence, and corrective  criticism."

I've learn how the pharmacy operate and how to multitask. Management and co-workers are great people to work with; makes my day a good one. The hardest part of the job is be able to satisfy every customer with there shopping needs. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work with great people."
good,You work with customers all day long. The people that work there and very easy to work with.
good,I have worked for Walgreens for 11 years. I started as a technician and have now been a pharmacy manager for several years. It is a good company but the budget cuts have made it very difficult

good,typical day taking prescriptions orders from members. Learned a great deal about medications. Wonderful co-workers great people. Hardest part of the job is not able to obtain members medications on timely matter.
good,"A typical day as a pharmacy technician in Walgreens in Amityville consists of constantly scanning, typing, and filling prescriptions while assisting customers. At most times, it becomes frustrating with a diverse customer base that tends to be very needy. Calling insurance companies, doctors, and dealing with medicare and medicaid has been a daily task as well. Many customers don't speak English as a first or even second language, so thankfully having the knowledge to communicate with customers has had huge impact. I now know the name of drugs, what they are used for, how they are used, and even the typical directions for taking said drugs. I know how to work with insurance companies as well as warehouses to order drugs. I work with an amazing staff of pharmacists and other techs who have helped me become the successful technician I am today."
good,"* Many new changes related to healthcare focus"
good,"A typical day at work would consist of me working at the cashier. I would come in at 7 and ring customers up. I would answer the phones and if there was a customer who needed assistance I would call up over the intercom for the appropriate person to further help assist the customer if I could not. My mangers are wonderful. If I had a question or a problem or concern they would be readily available for me. They are all very helpful and understanding. I believe I have the best co-workers. They love their jobs and are always so positive. If I'm not sure about something they always are ready to help me and they are very respectful of each other. The hardest part of the job is not being able to move from my position. As a cashier I have to stay on my post at all times. The reason why this is so hard for me is because if a customer were to ask me about a certain product that I wasn't too sure about, I wouldn't be able to move from my post to assist them. I would have to call another employee or manager to help assist the customer. That can be sometimes frustrating for me because I would like to further assist the person but I can not. The most enjoyable part of my job is when a customer would say a nice comment. Whether it be ""you've been very helpful"" or ""thank you for that smile"", it gives me a sense of satisfaction to know that I may have somehow made their day just a little more bearable."
good,"not fully integrated into WAG corporate"
good,Great co workers. Fun and productive work place. I learned more about my job and what to do. The most enjoyable part of the jobs was seeing smiles on the workers faces.

good,Walgreens was a good choice for me i made good money and had great hours.
good,The company is very demanding. They are not aware that  you actually have a person life. It's very busy & customers do come first before anything.
good,Walgreens is becomming one of the largest pharmacutical companies in the bussiness.
good,Comprehensive pay. Fun working environment. A workplace that really cares about it's employees. Management staff were some of the best I've worked with.
good,"Most of the time when you work with Walgreens what you basically doing as a Clerk, is giving customer satisfaction to everyone that sets foot within the store along with keeping the store and its merchandise in convenient status. What i have learned from this is that I gain more of communications skills by the conversations with the customers. The Co-workers that i worked with were always helpful if there was something that was needed whenever. The management in general is understanding and well organized when it comes to the store an its employees. They are able to work bettwen your hours if you have School or and other type of activities."

Request information or assistance using paging systems. Stock shelves, and mark prices on shelves and items. Compile and maintain non-monetary reports and records."
good,"DailyMed by Walgreens is a Prescription medication management solution that streamlines how you or a loved one takes prescription, over the counter medication and vitamins.  DailyMed reduces the need to go to the pharmacy, organize medications, worry about drug interactions and even open pill bottles.  The one draw back in my opinion is that you lose the ""personal"" relationship that you have with your local Pharmacist. Also if something gos wrong getting your medications can be a challenge. Although it is a great concept there were many bugs that needed to be worked out."
good,There was never a typical day at work. Every day was different. You had to be quick at making customer service decisions and also find a way to balance inventory and keep employees on task. You were always moving around and there was never a dull moment.
good,"Depending on locations, customers you deal with can be challenging."

good,"Great opportunity to learn many different types of management styles as well as learning to manage a whole operation, not just a department."
good,"I have had previous positions requiring supervision of several employees all while working in fast paced environments. I feel that the training I gained while I was in the U.S. Air Force has been vital to the positions I have held and also to my work ethic. I learned that motivation and moral is the key to seeing positive results for any company. I have worked with customers and vendors which at times holds it's challenges. What is best to keep in mind is listening, recognizing the issue, apologizing and providing a positive result so that the customer will continue to come time and time again. I enjoy not only working with people but also being creative and setting goals in all I do. I eccept criticism as I feel it only makes me a stronger employee and allows me to grow and go above and beyond."
good,A lot of diversity.  Come and find out for yourself.  This is a large corpration located in Deerfield Illinois.  Easy to get to from expressways.
good,"•	Multitasker: customer care, employee coaching, staging"
good,"""Always someting to do""  if it was cleaning, loading and unloading warehouse trucks. I learn as being a shift lead how to coordinate several tasks and perform well under pressure. The co-worers were team player, as team leader we all stayed engage as a team. The hardest part was rearranged and set up stock. I really enjoy developing, creating, planning, and completing complex assignments with minimal directions."
good,"good work environment, demanding, frequent drug-testing approximately every 2 weeks."
good,Walgreens is a company which thrives on their share of market competition. Being an assistant manager there was always challenging. Long hours and frequently sudden shift changes made it difficult to balance job/family responsibilities. I would still be working for this employer if Corporate downsizing and management restructuring had not eliminated my position.

good,Place where someone can learn a lot of things the managers are always willing to help and show great understanding for anyone and everything
good,"My day at Walgreens began with clocking in and checking my drawer. Once the drawer was set and ready to go I began working either stocking the shelves and stock room with new inventory or switching the new sales stickers for the week. As the day went on I would assist any customers in my section. I also would ring up sales in my section or occasionally take over the main register. There was limited interaction with co-workers but we all worked together to keep the store running smoothly. Management also did a fine job responding to any issues brought to light. The hardest part of this job, in my opinion, was restocking all the tiny pieces of make up. The most enjoyable was the interaction with the customers as the day went on. I learned good communication skills, money handling skills and responsibility."
good,it has been 8 years since i have worked for walgreens. I love it.
good,It was usually pretty busy at work. I learned that there is a lot more pressure put on a technician than what I had thought. The management was nice but got stressed out quite a bit but my co-workers were amazing. The hardest part of the job was when people would get impatient while we were waiting for a reply from a Dr. The most enjoyable part of my job was filling the prescriptions.

good,"The overall company is great. My experience with the management was fair, but the people who actually run the store are the assistant managers not the actual manager. I loved working for Walgreen's and the benefits are excellent. The option for promotion and pay raise is not really there. The company really cares about it's customers and employees."
good,"Walgreens is a great company to work for, unfortunately due to budget cuts in retail and in most industries, Walgreen's stores are only delegated a certain amount of hours and those are distributed among the pharmacy employees."
good,"After finishing school, my class requires me to complete 160 hours of on the job training for credits."
good,Walgreens was a nice enviorment to work in. for me to get some exposure for the retail world of stock.

In this position you are given the opportunity to work with these different types of people and understand what it means to work for the improvement of your employer. I found the hardest part of the job was dealing with the repetitive and mundane. It is not too much a problem with the job itself, it is just my personal desire to have a changing work environment and one in which I am learning new things. The most enjoyable part of this job has been dealing with customers, you meet all different types of people and through face to face interactions really get to help and see positive reactions to the service you provide."

good,"It has been 12 years with a relocation from one state to the next, at 6 years with the company.  Would recommend to others."
good,"Walgreens was one of my first jobs and I was in high school at the time.  They paid well, were flexible with my schedule, and even let me move stores 3 times."

good,Mp personal experiences in the work environment have tought me a lot of new information to help me become more successful and grow.
good,"I work part time at Walgreens as a pharmacy technician. Typically when I get to work we usually take turns in doing our work such as filling prescriptions, cashiering, checking stock or calling patients for their prescriptions. The management and the staff collaborate in making sure that we offer the best customer service. The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers especially when dealing with insurance. I enjoy working in teams as well as talking to customers."
good,More training on the different functions of the cash register (computer) would have been nice.
good,A typical day at work is easy it all depends on what manager is closing. I've learned that everyone is different and patience is key. Management are hard working people but you never know what mood they can be i so you have to keep it professional.   I have a great team of co workers. The hardest part is not being a able to provide certain satisfaction for customers depending on what the terms are. The most enjoyable part is putting a smile on a face that you planted there.

As well, I am responsible for keeping an eye on my inventory and assuring that the customer is always happy.The key part of the job is in the photo department."
good,"It is a make it or break it, workplace in the pharmacy. If you can't multitask, the pharmacy is not for you.  The hardest and most enjoyable part of the job is customer service, the ability to always keep a smile on your face and remain positive despite everything, but there are always those customers that will come and always try to put a smile on your face. The knowledge that you are helping your customers stay healthy and even at time just enjoying the others company.  The pharmacy even in a fast paced environment is very personal, they want to get to know them just like you should get to know them. You should always address the customer by name, because its amazing how much more people respond in kind when you recognize them right off the back.  The pharmacy is very team based, a pharmacist can do everything a technician can, but not vice versa.  However the technician helps to decrease the work load for the pharmacist and in the end you have a very uniformed and balanced work place."
good,good customer service.the hardest part of this job was putting a new store together. but it was fun doing it
good,"With so many locations you can usually work close to home, you get to help the people who live around you and gain a sense of community."
good,"I have been with Walgreens for a little over a year working in the pharmacy department. It can be a fast paced job typically taking in prescriptions, entering in prescriptions, and ringing customers up when they come to pick up their medication. I had no experience working in the health care field previously so it was difficult learning names of the medications and their usage as well as working with insurance."

good,Front desk clerk. Cash out customers direct them to the aisles where items were located. Keep front area neat and clean.
good,"Standard retail environment challenges (young carefree workers, difficult customers, etc)"
good,"  Not a bad place to work, there is always something to do are learn if your willing.  The hardest part is not having the hours to do all and more that needs to be done in a single day. If you wait on customers as they wish to be waited on, then you loss work that needs to be done. like putting up truck, resets...ect. But if you do the work and not take care of the customers then you loss sales.  "

good,"Walgreen's is a fine store to be employed.  The pay could be better.  The pay could always be better.  They offer benefits to full time employees.  The day moves fast because the store is always busy.  The manager was nit-picky, but in my experience, all managers are.  I was blessed to have the most awsome co-workers.  That is always a plus, working 10 hour shifts in a small pharmacy.  It made the day fly.  Dealing with insurance companies and difficult customers could ruin your day for a moment.  Overall, working as a pharmacy technician for Walgreens is a good gig."
good,flexible hours here. I learned everything there was to learn while I was there including things that will better me as an employee but not things I necessarily needed on a day to day basis. my co-workers are always ready to offer help when needed.
good,This company was a money maker great if you wanted to get rich and establish a career but there were no growth opportunities they wouldn't move anyone up and if they did it was 10 to 13 years in the making

I loved communicating with all of the store employees, I had a very vibrant and easy to get along attitude with everyone. "
good,"Learned a wide variety about warehouse operations such as OSHA certified fork lift driver on multiple types of lift trucks, industrial soldering and overall maintenance on conveyor and lift equipment. Management was always very helpful and great co-workers to work with. "
good,"I went in in the morning, filled prescriptions and helped around in anyway I could. "
good,good place to work as a part- time or for students looking for a summer job but if your looking for something to grow  and make a carrier you have to had a good luck or just if you have a great friend as your manager if no you will be have a hard time. As a personal experience I learn  how to communicate be a team work but also don't trust any body and sometimes that work harder is never enough
good,They don't promote women when deserved. They had a class action lawsuit for under paying women. I actually received a check from it two years post termination. They eliminated my position and created a similar key holder position for signifigantly less pay. 
good,"Very efficient friendly workplace, management was great, coworkers great, pay not so great"

good,I enjoy the patients and co workers pharmacy is very family oriented 
good,best retail pharmacy bar none! fast service and good atmosphere
good,I think that Walgreens is a great environment to work in and establish  good business relationships in. I learned how much work goes into managing a store so that customers will always want to come back no matter how far the store is from their house. My co-workers were very lively people that also made work didn't seem so much like work because we were all a family.
good,Everyone is very appreciative of your work and your contributions to the company. Easy to get along with others. 
good,Working for Walgreens has been great.. to be honest the reason I am looking for another job right now is because the Hourly Wage that i am getting paid right now is jus not enough to be able to live outside of paycheck to paycheck
good,"Manged several smaller technology projects and a phase of the Loyalty project, great experiences!"
good,"Greeting customers, stocking and inventory, conducting beauty consults"
good,"Kept busy working in the fast pace enviroment dealing with patients, insurance companies and medical offices. "
good,"A typical day starts with varied shifts which allows me to have the opportunity to work with a wide variety of employees which I find enlightining. Like most all companies in this age there is evidence of cut backs/belt tightening and more demand from employees. I feel management, for the most part, has done the best they can with what they have to work with making new transitions as painless as possible for the workers. I have been learning new skills and taking on many new duties. I see this as an improvement. As far as the hardest part of the job, it has to be uncertainty and the most enjoyable part it is simply being at work. "
good,"Initial point of contact for Doctors, health care professionals, patients and co-workers.  Resulting in outstanding accuracy and displaying excellent communication and customer relations skills. "

There are constantly phone calls to be answered, prescriptions coming in electronically and from customers. You have to handle billing issues, presribing errors/issues, questions and concerns of patients etc while making sure that prescriptions are filled accurately in a timely manner. You also have to complete daily maintenance to make sure inventory is correct. Medications are ordered, returned, pulled due to recall/experiation. There is very little down time. "
good,"This was a great job when I was living at home with the parental units, but when I moved out, I could not support myself with the pay I was getting.

good,"This was a good place to work, the people and managment was great."
good,"Generally, I just worked the register all day and greeted customers as they went into and left the store. If I didn't work the register, I would usually be stocking or doing an odd job assigned by one of the managers. I mostly got along with my coworkers but I feel that too much personal life was brought into the work place."
good,All duties that a staff pharmacist anywhere would perform.

good,A typical day for me is full of customer service. I find it more enjoyable to help customers purchase things that they love vs. stocking the shelves but a day can consist of both tasks. The hardest part is knowing you're doing a good job but not being able to move up in the company.
good,"A typicla day is full of customer service, meeting customer demands and requirements, helping and teaching customers on the self serve kiosks, doing resets and revisions, covering other departments for breaks, and even helping catch up or cover a break in the pharmacy when they need it. Management has tought me quite a bit over this 3.5 year time frame. The hardest part of the job for me are the resets and revisions.

I enjoy helping them when and where they need me to. I like to make my customer relationship personal."

I recently was told that my position in Hallmark is no longer going to be a position starting in 2013. This is very upsetting, but the company has to do what they have to do."

The pharmacists and technicians were very helpful towards helping me to gain as much knowledge as I could while I was there. I learned how to properly fill prescriptions, tons of customer service skills, and how to enter patient information into the computer database. The hardest part of the job was trying to balance answering phones and filling prescriptions in a timely manner.

good,"working at walgreens taught me great people skills, how to multitask efficiently and to work hard, walgreens also allowed me to meet some great people. not a day passed that someone was not laughing and enjoying their day at work..."
good,"On any given day, I am responsible for managing day to day operations and a team of up to 6 individuals. I am responsible for accomplishing a list of tasks the store manager wishes to be completed, while checking in vendors, and handling any customer issues that come up on the floor or in the pharmacy. At a non-24hour store you are responsible for the opening and closing of the store and large sum money management. The management staff is all well organized and work well as a team."
good,Walgreens is a very a good company to work for and it also provides great benefits to both part-time and full-time employees.

But poor management, front of store, Hardest part of the job, was when hours cut but volume was not, very stressful job at times. Learned patience alot of it. And if you speak to someone in a calm voice and they are upset, they will usually calm down, all in the tone of your voice. Most enjoyable, we all cared about our customers and their well being, and each other. This was a very enjoyable job, but I had become sick, and was for a few years, and ended up having to quit because illness, fine now"
good,"It was a fun and educational experience for I completed my Internship there. Everyone was friendly they helped me understand their computer system, how to refill and use the automatic cells, to use the drive-thru."
good,"A typical would consist of clocking in and starting checking out customers, answering questions to the best of my abilities and helping in any way. I answered the phone and directed the calls to where they were needed and helped stock and keep the shelves clean. I learned alot about retail and that I work well under the pressure of the fast-pace, whether from a sale going on or a holiday. The managers were great people that I worked easily with and got along great with as well. My co-workers were fun people to work with that helped when needed. The hardest part of the job was impatient customers and working on Thanksgiving and Christmas Days. The most enjoyable part of the job was the friendships I made and the great customers I met and still know."

They have provided me with different methods on how to lead a staff, build sales and thinking outside the box. Working in retail I have faced many challenges with staff turnover and dependability. Developing employees and watching them grow with the company is the most enjoyable part of my job. Watching someone develop and earn rewards from the company is rewarding for me to be a part of."
good,"Working there was very stressful at times because it was so busy between the incoming phone calls and emails, and the follow ups. On the other hand, hard work was satisfying at the end of the day knowing you made a difference in someone's life."
good,"I reviewed exception reports to determine stores that were not performing at or above standards in a variety of different areas and I would work with store management to determine the cause. If the cause was administrative, lack of understanding, lack of training or time/task management related issues, I would provide the assistance needed for them to improve and/or correct the situation to enhance operational effectiveness and productivity. If the problem was due to integrity related issues, such as theft, I would conduct the appropriate investigative activities to determine the person(s) responsible, how long this activity had been occuring, extent of the loss and conduct interviews to allow higher authorities to make a well informed decision as to actions against those responsible. This ranged from employment termination to prosecution."
good,"Great customers, management is slightly biased, under-paid. I learned a lot about how to deal with different types of customes and also a lot about time management. The hardest part of the job is the time maintnence. All of my coworkers were typically great to work with. There were a few slack-offs but other than that I enjoyed the job."

good,"Providing customer service, and keeping a our store clean."

However, I adored my co-workers and the customers I helped on a daily basis. They REALLY made the job what it was, and I Loved my job. This job taught me true empathy, and it feels amazing when these people put their trust in you to keep them healthy. The hardest part about my job was getting attached to my customers. The demographic in my area was mostly seniors. And sometimes they would pass away, and that was very hard."
good,Walgreens was a fast-paced and friendly environment to work in. The problems that arised as a result of the advanced machinery taught me how to problem solve under pressure.
good,Its is a nice place to work. You can learn a lot of busines administration.

good,Very good place to work with professional staff. The most enjoyable part of the job was we took that store from 10 to 15 compounds per day to over 30 compounds per day while increasing the regular (non-compounded) Rxs per day. We developed a very close nit staff that cared for each other and took good care of the business for Walgreens.
good,"Filled Scripts, Kept inventory, entered and stored scripts"
good,Strong company that constantly reinvents itself. Mostly coworkers are fun to be around. Upper management depends on the personality. Some are rude and most others are generally nice. Work schedules are demanding due to nature of business. You must be flexible and compassionate but wear thick skin at times to deal with certain individuals.
good,I have worked for walgreens for the past 4 yrs. I totally enjoyed my time with them. Benefit package is good. Promotions available to anyone who shows interest in being promoted.I would rate this company as top 4 business.
good,well being a photo tech is pretty kool. and working with walgreens is alright omst of the time. sometimes you get managers who are super strict about everything and they stress you out but most of the time you get the ones who are a little more easy about things cause they dont wanna stress themselves out either. most co-workers i have had have been good at their job but honestly i had more resposibility than them mainly because i was young and because i sought out more and more responsibility to further myself in the workplace. the hardest part of working with walgreens is trying to get time off when you work at a particular store where alot of people take off frequently. the most enjjoyable part is seeing the smiles on most of the customers facing when im done helping them out. good customer service isi hard to come by. its something i kno and its sommething i strive to never become a part of that group of unsatisfactory customer service leaders . what i learned is that in retail there is always something to do and when each member of that team plays their part well everything goes smoothly.
good,I enjoyed the job the most because it kept me busy whether it was bringing in the warehouse or helping customers.
good,"I like that I am always busy but, people are very gossip filled and focus on the he said, she said over the quality of their work. It's not always like this in every store but, the ones located in blue collar territory or cities are the worst!"
good,This job was one of the best. I learned how to do som many things with walgreens. The customers and empoyes were friendly. I worked with a team who did all we could possible do to make sure that we acurely copleted all work duties
good,"As an assistant manager each day is different, providing challenges in customer service, leadership of and guidance to employees, and time management for myself. I strive to learn something new every shift, be it a computer program function, how to handle a difficult customer, or even discovering a new product we carry and what it can offer to our customers' needs. My co-workers feel more like a family than a group of co-workers. We listen, build each other up, and encourage each other to do the very best work we are capable of. The hardest part of the job is balancing customer service and projects needed to keep our business successful, but at the end of the day customer service must always come first because they are the ones who keep our doors open."
good,enjoyed co workers and working with photo equipment learned alot about tracking inventory and customer service
good,Its a high paced job due to the fact that they are usuallly short handed. I have to ensure customers come first and help wherever is needed. I help in the photo dept and the pharmacy. When i'm not doing any of that then i'm busy building displays and making my department shoppable and attract ustomer. I also do the ordering for the beauty department and due reciving and sending of items back t our warehouse. I am a supervisor for the other beauty advisors and have to leave list of tasks to be done while i'm not there and then i have to check and mak sure they were done and done correctly .

good,Most days spent supervising employees and working with customers.
good,Well for starters my managers were strict when it came to work but did have a fun side to them as well. my co workers were great people and easy to get along with. the hardest part of my job was dealing with difficult people but i did learn to just stay calm and address the situation in a collected way.
good,Walgreens is a good company to work for if you are looking to have a career in pharmacy. As of right now its not a great place in terms of working in the retail portion of the company in terms of advancement and salary. Workloads can be strenuous as a manager.
good,Expect you to have a general knowledge of all products. Team environment. A LOT of customer service and catering to their every need.
good,there were something new to learn everyday and it was a very fun learning experience.
good,Everyday at work there is a board posted with the daily tasks. I find this useful so i can get strait to work and i dont have to stop a manager so i can see what is next. The work is usually done quickly so the hardest part would jsut be finding out what to do next.
good,Good management who always encouraged learning. Promoted learning through hands-on experience. We were all thoroughly cross trained in all departments.
good,"I enjoyed my training at this site, I wish they had more opportunities in their store for pharmacy techs."
good,GOT Customer Service Approach
good,Walgreens was a great learning experience. My co-workers and I were always working as a team! I was so shy before I started working there and being on the sales floor definitely brought me out. Best thing about it was always knowing you had help from your team and management! My experience was great

good,worked the cash register and place things on the shelves and did inventory
good,The managers were layed back as well as the atmosphere. The store was clean an well managed. My co-workers were eager to help anytime they were needed.
good,"Most days it is a busy day, but with help from other co-workers it helps make the day less stressful on you. All the other employees are there at your side lending a helping hand when needed. Sometimes the hardes part is customer service, making sure everyone is taken care and that they are taken care of correctly. It makes it difficult to solve a situation if you have more customer showing up that need help and are primary in the customer service line. Most enjoyably is the co-workers, without them the atmosphere of the whole work day would be too stressful to handle. Also seeing how people are in pain or how much the prescriptions and what just a slight discount card that saves $10 does to put a smile on the customers face."
good,"I would process film, print Digital pictures, help customer work kiosk and teach them how to use, I work stock shelfs with items, Organize store, Cashier, Balance Registers, Stock Etc. I loved all my co-workers they were great people to work with. Hardest part of my job was going into the freezer, never did it because of the fact that im anemic. What I enjoyed the most was helping others and having it ready when they got there and seeing them leave with a smile on their faces."
good,Walgreens is a fast paced retail pharmacy. Great software system.

good,"I really enjoyed my time at walgreens, but it used to be a better quality job when they still had the contract with EXpress Script. It is very intense job and I have too work every second of it very hard. I should admired that I learned a lot from people and educated pharmacist whom I work with."
good,"They were great and understanding, They had no problems in getting me transferred when my family moved. They trained very well and never had any problems answering questions."

good,"I only recommend those who do not mind working long days and possible overnights. It's a very fluctuating schedule, overnight and day shifts in the same week."
good,I completed my externship at Walgreens and learned a lot from my Pharmacist and Lead Technician. I was able to help customers and learn new things I had not learned while in school.
good,"This job literally keeps you on your feet. There is always something to do from collecting shopping carts to making sure the customers are satisfied from the time they walk in to the time they walk. Since I've been employed at Walgreens I've learned that you can't please everyone with a winning smile, some people are just plain old grumpy but there is always a way for me to make them smile. A smile goes a long way in customer service."
good,Good to get familiar with working in a retail setting. Drive through is nice for patients however it often gives them the impression that they are at McDonalds. Prescriptions savings club helps a lot of people who do not have insurance. The overall system used everyday is really nice.
good,"Walgreens work experience was great one, I learned a lot during those days as an intern."
good,"Walgreens pharmacy is a very fast paced workplace, but the workflow plans and team oriented environment make the fast paced environment enjoyable while remaining efficient in expectations."
good,Walgreens offered hands on learning experience to advance in pharmacy field.
good,I loved walgreens and it was a really good place to work. They really worked with me while i was in beauty school.
good,Walgreens has a friendly staff to work with. It is very thorough in its training of employes.
good,"Walgreens was a fun place to work, management was always respectfull, and the work was never overwhelming. The atmosphere is great, and being able to converse with customers and give them a little more atttention than a larger store always helps."
good,"This summer job was the best work environment yet. I had helpful coworkers, a steady pace workload, and a curiousity in pharmacology."
good,"Personal opinion, I loved working there because it kept me busy. Helping customers, and my colleagues were the best. They are nice and enjoyable to talk with. Glad I’d choose to work there to gain lots of experience with them."
good,"High volume, fast paced, metrics are very important as it is ran by a corporation who is always trying to find ways to get more out of their employees for less pay, help is not trained well as it’s a 24 hr store and is super busy, always a shortage of employees due to call outs"
good,"can be a nice fast pace, with downtimes in between, is supposed to be inclusive but if you have kids or a medical condition that makes you have days off or need a specific schedule can become difficult"
good,To start there is some management that is better than others. Work is easy once you get the hang of it until a flood of customers come in then they start to blame you when you aren't open and still have your job of delivering 1 hour photo orders.
good,"This place allowed me to ask questions about pharmacy, help others, and learn about how to work in a pharmacy in every aspect. Whether helping customers, filling prescriptions, or doing small tasks around the pharmacy."
good,the place is a good enviroment to start working the hardest part is the customers and the cleaning the easiest part of the job is the morning shift but overall good place to work
good,The work is not hard and the money is good but the environment is horrible. The customers are rude and mean and management does not have your back....
good,"Good company to work for workload can get overwhelming at times. To advance for senior management roles must be willing to relocate , Company is involved with community."
good,Overall good job kept forgetting to put me on the schedule sometimes and when did it conflicted with my school schedule. But over enjoyed the people and experience
good,"There is the opportunity for advancement should you choose to do so into the ranks of management. Pay increases are generally 25 cents an hour each year with your review on a yearly basis. Currently working nights Friday through Tuesday full time (about 37 hours a week) which does not leave much time for a social life. Depending on the person making out the job schedule, you can be expected to return to work within a ten hour time frame which can be a bit much which is why I chose to work all nights. Walgreens is a good company and cares about its employees."
good,Salary needs improvement. Had the salary been more I would've continued working for Walgreen's.  The company offers excellent discounts to employees and that's always a plus!
good,Working at Walgreens is fun and rewarding.  You get to learn things daily and supervisors are very helpful in teaching and assisting when you are not familiar with things.  A little more in pay will be great.
good,"Good place to work if you like people. Room for advancement if you work hard enough. Can be stressful at times, often there aren't enough employees to do all the work required."
good,"This is definitely not an easy job, you always have to be on top of your game.  I take my job seriously and give 110 percent each day that I'm at work.  I enjoy my team members and we try to joke and laugh throughout the day to make it an enjoyable place to work."
good,"I was able to turn a part time job into a full time career that allowed me to take care of my children as a single mom."
good,"The work environment and coworkers work as a team to make sure the customer services is in order.  The pharmacy manager is a great person with a heart of gold and make sure that she schedule everyone with the same amount of hours and will work with school, appointments, and other life challenges that my occur.  For this being my first time in the medical field this experience was very enjoyable and fun."
good,I was cashier and customer support. I greeted everyone with a smile always willing to help someone. I enjoy being a cashier it's fast pace and always busy!
good,"This was a three month temporary position, so I did not have the chance to review and understand the short and long term goals of Senior Management.  "
good,"Walgreens is a good company to work for. Not only is it a place of business where you can save money and earn a good pay, but it's also fun to work there."
good,"Not a bad job, I enjoyed my time there for the most part. Not that hard, not sure what else to say about it. Indeed wanted a 150 character review so here it is."
good,Walgreens is an ok place to work.  They are willing to work with you on your schedule most of the time.  The one of the bad things is that every Christmas your hours get cut.
good,"My job revolved around customer service.  Everyday involved training or coaching team members how to succeed at their tasks while providing excellent customer service. Time management skills, organization skills, diversity in all roles of the company. It was never dull! Busy, exhausting, frustrating yet fulfilling."
good,"Working at Walgreens as a customer service associate is a great opportunity for a first job. If you're looking to advance in the company, the job allows you to work your way up to SFL or designated hitter once expressing interest."
good,"8-hour workday "
good,Every day is a challenge. The people you work with are great. Executive leadership has many opportunities. Overall a good company to work for and grow.
good,I worked there for two years as my first job. I would have had the ability to move into the pharmacy or a manager position. It was a great experience.
good,Working at walgreens was one of the greatest experiences of my career. Had fun and enjoyed being part of a awsome team. Patient care and helping the community was good for the sole.
good,"It used to be a very good company but for the last few years they cut the raise and bonuses blaming the company not making enough money! Also the sick days changed to be frozen meaning if you ran out of your PTO then you can use your"
good,"I started out as a cashier since I was 17. My job consisted of doing transactions and stocking the shelves when a shipment came in. When I turned 18, I was introduced to the photo lab. At the lab, I was entrusted with al the chemicals and photo paper. I was also asked to help with inventory."
good,I really like working at Walgreens it was my first job here in Phoenix. I had a lot of opportunity to meet and talk with people coming in to the hospital and I had the option of taking classes to be a pharmacy technician. Overall it was a very nice place to start off working
good,"Nothing bad to say, just had to move on. Great job to start out and stretch your legs in the working world. I recommend any hiring managers at other Walgreens locations to give more chances to the youth."
good,Walgreens is so corporate at times that it grows tiresome and becomes frustrating. They push you to do a lot in the pharmacy and don’t provide a lot of support. Do not take a pharmacy job unless you can work efficiently!!
good,"Walgreens is a good part time job for teenagers and young adults attending school. The front cashier position can be boring, especially on slow days. The photo tech position will keep you busy, but you get paid the same as a cashier to do the more work, such as sweeping, mopping, cleaning bathroom, taking out the trash, facing the store, unloading truck, and doing outdates."
good,"Overall, my experience with Walgreens was exceptional. I was able to transfer from one state to another with ease. The hours and locations have also been accommodating"
good,"Conversing the customers, learning things about different people is interesting to me. It's really satisfying to have someone express delight in my customer service. I feel like I have a purpose."
good,"Walgreens was a heavy duty job, but it taught me how to have good customer service, how to greet people properly, and taught me how to hold a conversation with adults."
good,"Good working environment, can move to different positions when available. Management has moved around but they have all been good. A great place to work while in High School or College."
good,"Walgreens offered me a great opportunity to get certified as a pharmacy technician through their training program, but had some difficulty following through. Initially I was hired as a cashier, with the promise of promotion after roughly a month to a position that would be trained in pharmacy. This process took more like 4 months, after which time I was almost exclusively in the pharmacy. Not a lot of time to complete the required online training courses, but you do learn the job relatively quickly by being thrown in head first. I've found now that I'm established I've become indispensable, to the point that I can't manage to get time to see ailing family."
good,Personally working at this store has been interesting i learned new skills and i've been able to help many satisfied customers. My only issue would be the management it takes a little getting used to some of their personalities but they are great people.
good,"The work was tedious, but rewarding. I felt I wasn’t trained properly for the kind of work I was doing. We where Always told to call others for questions regarding billing question.   Our billing manager was more concerned about her boyfriend and getting herself married."
good,"I worked as both a pharmacy tech (for a short while) and a photo tech. I loved the people I worked with. My supervisors were fun and friendly, but still got their work done. The manager was rude, strict, and difficult to work with."
good,Fun place to work meeting and greeting customers. I have learned to operate the cashier machine and photo lab machine. The hardest thing about my job is that I stand all day but it is the requirement of the job. The most enjoyable about the job is that I getting along with my co-workers.
good,I’ve worked in all departments but the pharmacy for 10 years now. I have been to multiple flu clinics to help. There are plenty of responsibilities that we have every day.
good,Walgreens was very inviting and I was excited to work for the Company but they schedule me too much and on days I do not have available. I have a lot going on with school and outside of school and work things going on and it's hard to balance everything when they schedule me so often.
good,"Required to be a manager you start as a Assistant manager Trainee, taking classes out of town put up in a hotel. You have tons of homework etc. to do along with the class on top of working in the store and trying to help customers. If you pass the class you then have to interview for the Assistant manager position more than likely they move you to another store. To advance to store manager you need to pass and complete your certification for  the pharmacy. They over all expect a lot out of their managers, there is not enough time in the day to complete everything needing to be completed but we try our best. You do receive a nice discount on products which helps out. I learned a lot from my position and continue to learn new things everyday because there is no way to know everything about Walgreens in a short period of time. Work life balance is impossible I work a minimum of 44hrs a week so to get 2 days off a week I have to work 9 and 10 hour days. Sometimes 1st shift sometimes 2nd shift, which can go from 6:30am - 4pm or 1pm-10:30pm when warehouse truck comes I have to be in at 4:30am. So needless to say my children don't see me much and my body can't regulate sleep properly anymore and holidays are required and when holidays come around you are required to work more so less time for family.anymore."
good,All in all just an average place to work. It honestly didn't seem like you had much chance of progressing into management unless you were part of a click so to speak. The pay was fair but when you don't see a future for yourself it seems pointless.
good,I enjoyed working there and would love to go back of I were in Illinois again. Work life balance is important to me and was improving once I left. Benefits are nice and so are the employees.
good,Awesome place to work. A lot of benefits. Flexible schedules for school and days off are pretty easy to get as long as you do it two-three weeks prior.
good,In pharmacy we have a set schedule so its nice to know when you're working. Removes stress from my personal life. Hardest part of my job is keeping managers happy.
good,So a typical day at work would be coming in and start filling medications or typing out prescriptions. I learned a lot of different methods to figuring out the math. Management wasn’t that great ( why I left ) I was belittled a lot and made fun of but I stayed as long as I could handle it and realized pharmacy just wasn’t something I wanted to do. A lot of the employees gave off good culture and made me feel pretty good about myself. The hardest part of the job was trying to be my best but letting my boss run me down. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things and having fun!
good,This job is great and is pretty much the same routine weekly. Great for students and part-time work and the advancement opportunities are endless. Great!
good,"The managers worked with me when it came to being flexible with my schedule to finish the classes I took for the petrochemical classes. I enjoyed learning about the photo department, while also being trained to a lead position at the time."
good,"The benefits are amazing, the job itself can get a bit stressful at times but other than that a pretty good place to work. They will adequately train you for the position. Always communicate and ask questions"
good,"Fast pace Retail work Job. A good place to work. Day to day job operations depends on staff environment. We have good or bad days, but overall I like this company."
good,"90 days for benefits to be accessible."
good,I worked their as a high school student and it paid well for the job it was. I dont see how a parent/regular adults could survive off the pay. Employee discount came in handy.
good,"Walgreens is a retail job, they train you well and on everything. The manager I had was nice and knew his job well, we just didn't get along that great, which is what led to my departure as he started cutting my hours. It's a great beginner job, or for students."
good,Okay place to work. Hires too many new people into management. Management should train and promote from within to prevent high turn over of associates.
good,I enjoy working for walgreens. Although the recent hours cut has really hurt us all. We now open an hour later and close an hour earlier. I originally hired on for the pharmacy. But I struggled a lot back there. I like being a direct hitter.
good,"As a student being in 10th and 11th grade, Walgreens was a great place for me to learn responsibility."
good,"This job is similar to most in satisfaction in that you get out of it what you put in. Whether I'm assigned tasks or cashiering I stay busy, and there is always something to be done.  This makes time pass quickly during a shift.  I enjoy working as a cashier.  I'm a kid person so I love talking to all the kids who come in. I love it when the kids come back to the store and are excited to see me again. My favorite shifts are on the floor stocking the shelves, working in the photo dept., and cleaning up the store at the end of the night. This can happen in any job, but there is a co-worker, or two, who truly do not get the job done making it harder for the rest of us. The worst part of this job is that the supervisors and managers know this and have done nothing. Again though we have all had this happen before. Overall, Walgreen's the company is well managed, marketed, and organized. They offer good benefits and have multiple ways for employees to voice any concerns of any kind."
good,There's a lot of overtime currently and not enough time to do anything by the time we get out. Most everyone is pleasant to work with. Most of the managers are great.
good,"Wonderful management, willing to go the extra mile to help you if you needed help. Even though its a fast paced work environment there was never a dull moment. Each day brought its own rewards."
good,Too much is subjective. Depending on management not fair. Seems bias and discriminatory. Employees are allowed too much drama among themselves.  Use of phone on sales floor prohibited but management has phones with earplugs all the time.  No example to follow.
good,This job requires a lot of physical labor even tho I was just a sales associate/cashier. A lot of unloading crates from the trucks that brought in items sold there.
good,Walgreens is a very busy and efficient company that has a huge number of Patients that are all cared for in a safe and effective way ensured by the  company.
good,"You will lose your entire life to Walgreens, but without a doubt Walgreens has the highest rate of promotion out of any place I've worked at. I went from a cashier to pharmacy helper, to full time tech, to PTCB certified tech, to senior tech, all in the span of 2 years. I'm now a shift lead. If you work hard and give up all your free-time, you can be wherever you want at Walgreens."
good,"I would recommend working here, just prepare your self for a sporadic schedule and turn and burns, can close a night then reopen the following morning"
good,"I worked as a Customer Service Associate, as a closer. When I first started this job, I was incredibly excited. My store manager was awesome, flexible, and willing to take a chance on me. He taught me a lot of things, even though we barely saw each other. With this job, my shyness lessened. I was able to talk to customers, my managers seemed to like me (for the most part); things seemed to be going great."
good,"This was my first job ever. The manager understood that and helped me when I needed it, however they did have a problem with my availability because I was also a full time student during the summer and fall."
good,"There was always something to do around the store even for the cashier, from making sure the stands around you were tidy and kept clean, to helping customers find products in the store, to handling any questions a customer has."
good,"Good company to work for if you don't have children. Very hard to get flexible hours and make a decent paycheck as a single parent.(hours are never consistent) But a single person with no kids, there is plenty of opportunity with this company. Must be willing to work really hard."
good,"Great place, just unfair pay. New employees would start at a higher pay rate than people who have been working for the company for years. Overall a good part time job"
good,A very busy place to work at while developing your pharmacy skills. learning experience was intense and fulfilling. The workplace culture is organized and resourceful. most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with patients and helping them.
good,"My manager was a good guy, some fellow employees were ok to work with but the hours are all over the place & the pay is not so great either, good discounts though!"
good,"Used to be a great place to work. The pay is fairly competitive, and raises are performance based, so to me that's very fair. The only issue I have is that since Walgreens has bought out Rite Aid and the profits haven't been what was expected, the budget hours have gone way down. You basically work a skeleton crew and hopefully you get your work done. Granted that all depends on whether your skeleton crew shows up. Communication between managers and leadership to crew members lacks in a big way. Accountability depending on your manager is also pretty non-existant. So if you love to work hard so others can slack off daily this is the job for you. The other thing is unless you work in the pharmacy plan on working all holidays."
good,"Easy to learn tasks, friendly environment. Depends on the store, however. I subbed at a few other stores in the area and they all seemed to have management issues except my store"
good,Walgreens could work on it’s friendliness as far as employees. Yes they give online trainings but it can be very vague at times and could use a bit more human interaction. Some people are more hands on than others.
good,"Walgreens could be a GREAT place to work! It just depends on who your leader is. Donations are a great part of Walgreens. I love donations. I love multitasking, I don't love when management can treat you badly."
good,"How well it goes for you really varies by the store you're located in."
good,"The pay is usually minimum wage but it's still a great place to work. However, it depends solely on location and management.  Great job for college students."
good,Ok place to work not the same as it used to be.  The pay and bonus has dropped tremendously in the last several years with the general consensus that the bonus will disappear altogether.
good,"I think Walgreens let’s its customers abuse staff way to much to be a safe work environment. I’ve been screamed at, cursed at, and death threated multiple times and I have never once seen a customer be held accountable for these actions. We call the police at least once a month to resolve patient conflicts. Although my job does offer time for both new mothers and fathers, the hours aren’t always flexible. My store managers are absolutely incredible, but at the corporate level there needs to be more receptive to employees on basic level."
good,"Working at Walgreens is preferable, because I get to work with people as a customer service representative, which is what I wanted. If not for their low budget, I would be working there for 40 hours, or more, each week."
good,Not a bad place to work. Chain pharmacy is chain pharmacy. Bonus points for flexibility with regard to time off requests. Willing to work with you regarding vacation. No lunch break.
good,"This is a solid company to work for as a student or anyone needing part-time employment. The work hours fluctuate but most of the time management is willing to work with the employee. Especially if the employee is a student needing flex-time. The pay and benefits are average for an established retail store. Unfortunately, that is usually well below the requirement for a living-wage."
good,"I love working at Walgreens, although I feel a few things could change. Schedule is all over the place making for a hard home life with my family. The pay is considerate for the hours put in. Management is friendly and educational. A great first job for someone with chances of advancement as a career."
good,"One of my favorite parts of my position as a Beauty Sales Consultant is learning all about my customers' lives, careers, etc. "
good,"Not a bad place to work, Slow paced and a calm work area not much goes on. Most people I dealt with were kind and peaceful. There really was no problem working here and I would recommend this job to anyone."
good,"On a typical day, you will have many good and bad customers within the store. You tend to work along side your coworkers and management everyday in order to get all tasks done. There do tend to be days where you will have very rude customers, and that's when it tends to get a bit hard; they'll tend to make trouble or situations worse for you, and that's when you need to be alert and play smart/safe and in some cases call for a leader of management to help aid or take over the situations. I would have to say the best part of this job is when you are able to successfully help your customers find or get them exactly what they are looking for."
good,"Used to be a good company to work for, almost a ""family""-like culture at the beginning.  After the merge with Boots, employees were reduced to numbers and employees with seniority and benefits were replaced with part-time employees who had no benefits and lower wages."
good,"It is a hard company with its regular changes. Management is great, but it seems corporate keeps them on an unforgiving leash.The company has short lunches and breaks, but manageable depending on your shift. I learned a lot here and was able to grow thanks to this company."
good,"It was a good job to get back to work after my kids where older.  I didn't like the evening hours but it worked so I could be home with my youngest through the day,"
good,"I went through three different managers in the four years I worked for the company.  The first and the last were horrible.  If you are part of the management team, you need support and guidance from your superior.  My experience was hit or miss.  The managers are all over worked, which can affect their ability to mentor effectively."
good,Walgreens is a well run company that is forward thinking and customer service based.  Can be difficult at times based on budget restrictions and volume but overall is a good place to work.
good,"ok job enviroment , felxable work schedule and decnet pay scale. its a good second job to have , but not sure if you can make enough to servive off the salery they pay"
good,"There are a lot of changes within the company and once they get it figured out, it will again be a great place to work.  They paid for my pharmacy technician license, and they pay for their beauty consultants training"
good,"Job is good, just comes down to pay and hours that would make the job temporary "
good,Lots of work for low pay  you do all your own ordering of products for your area than you have to stock the shelves clean and mop before you go  wage is the issue here for what you have to do
good,"Some management were supportive and good, others were blah, but this is anywhere. "
good,The company does like to promote from within. The pay is perfect for someone who is not raising a family and have to pay bills. This is a great job for a young person who is figuring out what they want to do while in school. Walgreens is good to make an extra few bucks while gaining some employment experience. Or as a side job during the holiday for extra cash.
good,"mostly stocking and ringing people up, can be boring at times. Isn't much room for advancement seems like they have too many policies to be running just a drug store. I can understand if we were working in pharmacy but not up front."
good,"Great workplace, however, not enough HR department involvement. "
good,"I reported to Walgreens night overnight, and leave them a messages when they do not pick it up the phone at all. No one willing answer it on the phone calls yet."
good,great environment. good place to work. there is nothing more but i need to fill one hundred and fifty characters to submit this form so that is what i am doing
good,Continues to change; managers are put under intense scrutiny with goals and targets that are a stretch to meet- long time manager terminated for failing to meet vague targets
good,It's sort of impossible to go anywhere with Walgreens. I'm ready to get out because I tend to do the same thing everyday and am not fulfilled by my job on a daily basis.
good,"I was very fortunate to begin a job with the company and was promoted 3 times within 6 months. The schedule for managers was difficult to follow as one or two of the other managers were also students/had other jobs. It was difficult making family plans since there was a lot of changes in the schedule.  "
good,"Managed approximately 60-65 employees. I learned how to lead by example and listen to the voice of my team. Lead from the employees ideas. Coach and training was the key to my success. The hardest part of the job was handling the demand of the patients in pharmacy when they could not receive their prescriptions. The enjoyable part of the job was teaching, coaching my team. I enjoyed helping my patients and customers with their needs."
good,I was able to progress through 3 positions and 2 stores with this company. With a good team around you working at Walgreens is a breeze. The company offers several benefits and resources for their employees.
good,"Lower levelled employees were always nice and helpful with new employees"
good,The managers worked well with my schedule. The job was repetitive and boring. The workers were all kind and they were always helpful when I needed any help.
good,"In the time in the workplace, work wast constant and fast paced throughout the whole time. The most enjoyable part of that job was that it was very interactive that time flew by."
good,It's a fine company to work for.  CVS or any other competing chain would have you do similar job tasks. Pharmacy is constantly changing and you have to adapt.
good,"You are expected to work 50-60 hours/wk but, I felt, you are rewarded for it.  It's a job with a lot of instant gratification(see your promoted displays selling well, seeing a clean store and professional looking associates).  Not an easy job, but very rewarding."
good,"Working at Walgreen's I have gained valuable skills such as customer service and stocking and rotating products in a fast-paced environment. Most of the co-workers and managers were great to work with and made the job more enjoyable, however there were a few who made the job difficult and more stressful. Overall I would say that this is a great place to work and is a wonderful entry level job that provides you with valuable skills and an easy to work with schedule."
good,"Relaxed place to be employed at, friendly associates, as well as managers, very professional environment. Team well put together every shift that was worked, overall a great place to start and gain customer service experience."
good,"There are good days and bad days at Walgreens. You have people coming in with plenty of coupons and you have to be wise about those specific people whereas other times it can be pretty rewarding. It helped me advance my career despite only getting a  maximum of 32-35 hours a week. Shifts weren't bad, however, there were times were management was beyond terrible. They like to sit on their phones or butt while the workers do all the work. I floated between pharmacy and photo therefore it was tough to get more hours in the pharmacy."
good,At this company the patients are regulars. They are like Family. everybody knows each other. I love working there cause its friendly environment and team work makes the dream work over there
good,"Would great the clients and help them make a decision based on their skin and products that they liked.  The hardest part was the holiday season and the craziness involved, but I did enjoy it, the busier the better"
good,I loved all my co workers and management. Most of the time the shifts went by smoothly. My manager always did the best he could to solve issues we did run into.
good,Walgreens was actually a really good job. The management was really good at caring about what made your life easier and giving you a helping hand in whatever they could. They loved the thought of moving up in the company and being able to allow their employees to be as successful as they wanted to be they offered programs for you to go back to college if you wanted and would make sure you got enough hours as you needed to make ends meet.
good,Good staff/ Too many changes too often/ Interesting to meet many people of different backgrounds and learning experience. Great start for management learning.
good,"I enjoy working for Walgreens. They offer excellent benefits and opportunities to advance. I am not very pleased with the work life balance, if you don’t go above and beyond: you are looked over. They expect more than they give. The have budget cuts all the time and then expect more work for very little compensation. There are no incentives to excel, and have taken away what was in place."
good,"It was a okay job. There was barely any other man during my shift. The only other man was my manager. I usually got all of the labor intensive jobs. It was no fun, often I was on the register so I did gain customer service experience. What was unfair was there was an employee who had the skills equal to mine but in addition knew how to operate a photo kiosk, which looked fairly simple. But their wage was a good amount higher than mine. Yet I never was offered to attain that skill, I'm not mad just wish that my pay wasn't so low. Never really any team building activities, there were competitive sales opportunities but rarely, and there was a lot of troubling customers."
good,"Walgreens definitely took the time to teach their interns on how they will function as future pharmacists through their intern program."
good,"The pay isn’t great, but the hours are fairly consistent and the system is very easy to learn. Overall it’s a great job for teens, single mothers, and elderly who’s just trying to pocket some money."
good,The best part of my job over all the years was being able to give my customers the very best customer service. I was able to pass on to them all of the knowledge that I have learned about the products to help them with their beauty routine. The hardest part of the job was trying to finish task lists given by management. There were times that there was not enough time in the day. The past 3 to 4 years were all the changes that took place in the company.
good,I liked working here but I was the only person over 21 that wasnt a manager for almost every night shift until closing so my breaks were often cut short or interrupted if a younger team member needed me. Overall i enjoyed helping the customers find products that might have been relocated in the store. I also helped customers with the kiosk weather they were pointing pictures doing western union or ordering s
good,I loved my job the and some of the employee where good to work with and most of the customers where awesome the store management was awesome to work except the past year we got a new management if she didn't care for you would be seeing yourself in the office most of the time and youll be working nothing but nights and when you would take it to HR the wouldn't do anything and your desrict manager wouldn't do anthing either he would take syore manger side.So the both make company look bad on poor mangement.some of the knew employee where lazy if you would ask them to work the would run to store management and complaining.The never close for Holidays except pharmacy. She would complain if you where a student .But the Assistant Manager was amazing if she was my store manager I would of stayed.
good,"I worked the front end and the photo lab. Provided customer service, cleaned, stocked as well as unloaded trucks. I learned how to work varies areas without losing focus on customer."
good,"Use to be a good place to work"
good,It is a good environment to work but sometimes it is just too frustrated to work with customers and hard to take everything when you are already busy to do something
good,At first when i started it was a family oruented co.pany but as the years went by it started to change alot. When my position ended it wasnt imeven worth me trying ti stick around. At this point the wanted to just hire new young kids that were basically there for a check. They cared about their employees before but dont anymore.
good,They worked with you on scheduling as much as they could with the business needs. They showed appreciation for hard work and recognized all milestones.
good,"Easy job clean work place friendly staff as well as easy to communicate with."
good,"It usuallly gets busy on the weekends and on truck days. When that happens it tends to get very stressful. I learned how to be patient, and fast pace. It’s a good place to get a good laugh and meet good people."
good,This was a great job for me starting out in the pharmacy industry. They took a chance on me and taught me so much. They will even pay for you to take the PTCB exam. This company gave me my first home in the medical community.
good,"My Walgreen's Pharmacy was a very lively , team oriented environment who actually cared for the patients and would go above and beyond for them. Our staff was known for always fixing issues and being that go to pharmacy in the Katy area. Yes, this pharmacy was busy so we had a lot of complaints from impatient people, however we met the needs of each customer or directed them into the right directions at the end of the day. We were so team oriented and family close that new management tore a lot apart and our pharmacy just become a task we had to do and less enjoyable. Everything depends on the people you work with. Other Walgreen Pharmacy's are different."
good,"Depends on store and manager. Generally easy going atmosphere. You will be hired for one position but expect to be asked to complete other job duties within store. Some managers are hands on , others sit back in office all day. I've worked over 15 locations between two different states and have noticed there is sometimes favoritism shown among certain employees. One store in particular actually allowed an employee who wasn't even part of management to change the schedule of employees at any given time with no notification."
good,working there helps me know my neighbors in the neighborhood and how they can help you and you help them with fun and to know that they have and treat you like family.
good,Not  really  a  job  to  financially  support  yourself  but  a  great  place  to  develop  social  skills  and  become  used  to  working  with  technology.
good,Working here was a joy. The customers and employees were always happy and friendly. My team wanted to make sure our customers were taken care of by doing anything they could to help.
good,"Walgreens was a breath of fresh air coming from a labor intensive job. However, being a Chicago resident, the pay is rather unremarkable on an hourly wage. The job is keeping for a college student with minimal or no expenses. Otherwise, it's a constant struggle to make ends meet. As for management, my location's  store manager made an effort to form persinab6 relationships, however, this did nothing to hide the fact that he had an attitude not befitting of his position."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walgreens except I had no chance for advancement as the store manager liked me in job and didn't want to promote me. There is a lot of standing, bending, and stooping required."
good,did not have a problem until they had a problem with me calling in due to my diabetes. other then that i enjoy working with the company and they have good perks
good,"A typical day at work has an endless POA (plan of action) "
good,"A typical day at work is constantly busy and fast paced. Before applying, consider the appropriate footwear for 8-10 hour long shifts. Aside from that, the job is rewarding and the patients make you feel like you really solved their problems"
good,They company is changing daily. They are always looking for employees. The work is not hard. The best part of working in the stores is helping the customers.
good,They really ask a lot for little pay. They are sending me to school so I am blessed but cost of living is going up and so are my bills. I do appreciate my job. But sometimes I feel like I go above and beyond and I still don’t get recognition.
good,"I really enjoyed getting to know the clientele and helping them. It has a huge employee/management turn-around. Most days I loved it, some days I didn't. It can get very busy on and around holidays. Be sure you know all policies and procedures, although after four years it seemed they changed on a daily basis."
good,"Walgreens provides its employee good access to its leaders and overs a its employees good exposure to other business teams. This in turn, gives its employees a deeper understanding of the work"
good,My 3 years with Walgreens was positive.  Our pharmacy was locally owned and purchased by Walgreens.  Walgreens provided pharmacy technician training at their local office and paid for the board exam.
good,"Good training on how to interact with customers. Good Manager, helpful and informative, good to work with and not arrogant. Likeable, Helpful coworkers."
good,"I've been with Walgreens for 6 years. Overall, I've been happy until recently. I learned so much about medication and other things pertaining to a medical genre."
good,The company has changed over the time I've been working there. Some of the standards are no more. The appreciation that was once shown to the employees who come in and work hard is gone.
good,"Running registers, keeping floor space, stocking items"
good,"Good place to work, opportunities, flexibility, different stores to work out and ongoing trainings help managers. Hardest part of job is getting relocated to different stores."
good,This job was great from the co-worker on up too the mangers they where awesome. They treated everyone the same and where was very understandable with the employees.
good,The most thing I like about working at walgreens is getting discounts on merchandise. I work from 30 to to 40 hours a week. When I pregnant I was on work schedule everyday. After I had my baby my hours decreased.
good,"It makes a good first job or stepping stone to something better. With the right group of people it can be a very fun place to work, but like all retail it can also get stressful."
good,Was with the company for 18 years then position was eliminated for a new position same role less money. So I could step down or take a severance package.
good,never knew what time u was going to get off..and always changing hrs at last min....but loved that i was making money to help my family.health insurience was great their....
good,Excellent company that promotes a healthy lifestyle by providing exceptional customer service through beauty and pharmacy. I enjoy working with the public and assisting customers with all their needs.
good,"no real break rooms, inconsistent shifts. busy hours and slow hours. lots of online training. uniform supplied. flexible shift which is nice but starting pay is really low"
good,Company seemed to be more focus on spending money in advertising inside of the store rather than outside but it was still a great company to work with.
good,"Being a Pharmacy Tech at walgreens is a quite interesting job considering where your location is. Some can be peaceful and smooth and others can be, interesting with the customers."
good,For certain stores there are certain problems. Over all I'm truly pleased with the experience that I have received there. There was no big problem that the team as a whole could not handle.
good,"Overall good place to work.  Management advancement opportunities.  Great pay rates.  Employees are very close knit at stores.  Ever changing company and culture, hard to keep the company goals straight, not enough hours."
good,I have only really worked in the pharmacy but I enjoy it. They taught me how to be a technician then when it was time they sent me to a class to get certified by national board. They can at time be a little difficult when a new thing is sent down from corporate but once we are able to find a balance it all usually works out.
good,The most enjoyable part about working in Walgreens is the fact the we help people get better and protect them against many diseases through vaccinations
good,I have had great store managers but it doesn't matter. Corporate always cut hours and made it a very stressful place to work. I was doing the work of multiple people everyday and only getting paid for one person.
good,"managers were great, teamwork was amazing and everybody was like a family. stressful work environment due to the workload. great communication and learning experience."
good,"Great environment, decent supervisors, little opportunity to grow but a lot of opportunity to move around."
good,This location is open 24/7 and was always busy. Very fast paced and not necessarily the safest area in town. The employees were nice and the store manager was very understanding.
good,"Our company ask us to always give great service to our clients. They are the number one reaso and should be above all work. But at the same time our management doesn’t want too see that having less employees makes it difficult to complete our task and give great service. Beside that every day, we have a blast my coworkers and shift leaders while we work."
good,"It is a good place to work Wish  they gave more hours this company makes so much money but never has hours lots of budget cuts , they could do better!"
good,"A typical day at work at Walgreens varied by current needs of the store. Responsibilities were to notice shoppers, see if you could help them find products or fulfill any needs, re-stocking inventory, unloading truck deliveries, running the cash register for check outs, returns, price adjustments or Walgreens ""rewards issues"". Sometimes, on-line training was required and employees were typically able to complete them during their shift. Management was fine and relatively consistent.  Cross training in other areas was not an option when I worked there due to limitations of available hours. The workplace culture definitely was customer oriented and you were to see to the needs of them.  Typically was a positive culture, occasional employee potlucks, recognition for accomplishments, approachable management, time away from work or requests for time away were generally approved as long as shift coverage could be worked out.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people, the co-workers and and staff, general dynamics and culture of the store. The hardest part of the job  was sometimes in completing the required training due to shift schedule.  I would work there again if the opportunity arrived. Two 15 minute and 1/2 hours lunch breaks were given in accordance with hours of scheduled shifts and length."
good,"most important you have to be on time , I've learned to work well with other.Also the management are very understanding when you communicate with them, never have been subject to any discrimination in the work place it was a family feel .the hardest part of the job is the long hours .the most enjoyable part of the job is that the management team made worker feel appreciated"
good,Prior to new CEO Walgreens was a great place to work for. After the new CEO it could use improvement. Having a great staff allows the work day to go by.
good,"If you want good IT experience, this is the place.  Low pay, but descent.  Good training and manager very helpful, they want you to succeed.  I highly recommend this job to anyone who is starting into IT."
good,A typical day is busy with a variety of duties. I've learned so much from 3 different pharmacy managers and a couple store managers.  The management at this store is good.  The hardest part of the job is sometimes difficult patients.  The most enjoyable part is my co-workers.
good,"Walgreens as a history has been a great company to work for.  With upper management changes not sure how secure the company is in the United States.  The company offers upcoming technology, but not equipment for store use.  Benefits are strong, but cost is increasing."
good,"I was a shift lead, management on duty, and you either had way too much to do or very little to do. There really wasn't anything in between. I truly loved by job. I did not however like being blamed for other peoples problems and being told that their failings were my fault."
good,My staff is great. Of course the store I work in is a lot smaller than most Walgreens stores but it makes it easier to get to know customers on a friendly basis.
good,Great and solid company. Great in employees development. Gives you the opportunity to learn and grow in the company. Pay rate too low for the amount of responsibilities for management
good,Very good work environment. Very calm and settle. The work can be hard be its easy. Sometimes you have to move in a fast pace. Must be able to remember all codes to the doors and excess of the back offices
good,"I like working at Walgreens. Only thing is they expect you to have open availability and give you inconsist hours and work days. Training needs to be better with new hires. "
good,Good company to work for. You can get stuck at a certain position. Seems they play favorites at time. Under paid for tasked asked to do. Once past that stuck point great company ok pay
good,"I believe Walgreens is a great company to work for and to grow in, lots of open minded people and people who work hard towards a goal and achieve it. To make something work, and be great is hard, but Walgreens does that."
good,A Great place to work. family oriented and with opprtunity for career advancemet and development. a service oriented company that is completely dedicated to the patient safety and care
good,"The work is easy and the environment is supportive, but there was a high rate of turnover that made it difficult to effectively manage team members and develop a two-way sense of respect and trust."
good,"I began working at Walgreens more than 2 years ago and they accommodated my school schedule. As time passed, I wasn't able to work as many hours due to school schedule. My hours were cut way back as my schooling progressed. It was a temporary job until I finished school. They worked with my schedule until I couldn't work anymore. The main benefit was friendly co-workers and paid time off."
good,"Faced paced, fun. Teams are great and for the most part so are the customers.  The company is constantly changes trying to get the business module right which is a good thing but also results in budget not always in line with the plan"
good,"If I had not moved to a different state to be closer to family. I would still be working at Walgreens. I very much enjoyed it in Illinois, not at all in Alabama."
good,"Well, Walgreen was my first job that I had a long times ago. It was because of Walgreen that I started how to take care of customers well and how to deal with them in an easy manner or polite behavior. Working at Walgreen job as a customer service, It was very frustrated, not simple at all. It might also be very stressful, especially in a busy days. However, I did manage working at Walgreen for three years or less with no problems."
good,"There was always something to do and all coworkers got along great. Everyday was a surprise at first but it eventually became very predicable. Great for a First job, not for a lifetime."
good,It was fine. I did a lot of work and it was great for the most part until other co-workers would slack off and leave me with a stressful about of work.
good,"I enjoyed working at Walgreens because of the different role I had working there. I was either the stocker on the shelf, or I would just help with customers throughout my shift to lessen the possibility of having theft in the store, or I would work as a cashier during some days of the week. There was a lot of flexibility and I liked it because I was moving around a lot, and it made me the person that someone looked up to for help."
good,Was not a very stressful job. Only left because it paid no more than minimum wage and I required more to pay bills and rent at the time. Fun people and location.
good,The company neglected this location. It was poorly under staffed and pushed the tech to their limits. The pharmacy and store managers were no help either.
good,"I have learned to input insurance, type in prescription orders, cashier, patients with our patients, how to fill prescriptions, and how different insurances work."
good,pharmacy manager was the perfect manager he listens and understands the feeling of all his employees and made working fun and also productive at the same time.
good,"We really work together as a team to get our jobs and duties done during the day. A lot of the time our jobs are getting the store set up for the next day, or getting the store set for a holiday and the season. As well as helping customers find what they are looking for and are happy with the service."
good,I enjoyed my time at Walgreens but felt there was no place for me to go after receiving my degree.  I began working for Walgreens before going back to school for my degree.  I am close to graduating and did not see my future at Walgreens.
good,"I worked in Walgreens on every Wednesday to Friday, my job starts on 5:00 P.M. to 8:00 P.M. What I do in Walgreens is to complete the given task on my job sheet. Try to finished as much as I could for the week and for next week get a new sheet."
good,"Opportunity for learning and advancement but high stress level and accomplishments go inrewarded until they are in need of a favor, meetings are helpful but most employee complaints fall on deaf ears"
good,"When I was promoted to Shift Lead, there are many more responsibilities than just being a CSR.  Sadly enough, the training you receive in order to accomplish your daily tasks (cash handling, smart counts, receiving, etc.) is minimal to say the least."
good,"I truly enjoy the people I work with and the clientele for the most part. However, the hours are not stable. Hours have gotten cut twice in the last 2 weeks but when flu season starts they give us so many hours I that each tech would need to work over 40 hours just to use them all. Not enough stability."
good,"Good company, excellent benefits. Walgreens has gotten away from the family oriented company it began as and now has a more corporate feel.  Room for advancement, also help with schooling if entering Pharmacy school."
good,"The average day at starts as soon as you punch in. the phones are ringing off the hook (either from Doctors offices, or patients calling in medications). There is usually a pile of prescriptions to fill between the calls, and thats not counting the line of customers that shows up as soon as you open and usually doesn't end until you either leave or close.  It is non-stop. There are days that you are so busy you forget to go to lunch and are ravenous at the end of your shift. "
good,Great company I was able to learn many jobs within the department. More training processes in my opinion would make some departments more successful. Great supervisor who is willing to help you advance.
good,Great culture and very pleasant people to work with from customers to associates.  Excellent training and courses to keep in touch with policies and procedures.
good,I was able to get nationally certified through the company at no extra cost to me. I worked at several different locations over the years and had several wonderful pharmacists that helped me learn and move forward. I did have to work Thanksgiving or Christmas every year but other than that they were flexible with mine and my kids schedule.
good,It was fun getting to met new people everyday. Love the feel of helping some one. The manger was  races and stereotype people . A lot of the time we be short so that leave me to do all the jobs and stay on top of my work. During the holidays it be super busy. Some people couldn’t handle the pressure. But I loved when it was busy the day would fly by. They only gave us nickels and dimes the most is a quarter for a raises.
good,"Great work life balance, great benefits, however there were/are lots of layoffs and restructuring.  I was allowed to structure my own day and work from home multiple days a week."
good,"Walgreens Family of Companies is not a terrible place to work. I believe however it is more geared towards younger individuals looking for employment, and it takes a WHILE to earn any type of promotion."
good,"I had fun when I worked at Walgreens, I met good people and it was a relaxed environment. I left because I realized I could get better pay and they were not offering enough hours"
good,"It's an alright place to work, they just are like most other corporations and pay you as little as possible, and get as much work out of you as possible."
good,"Company was very productive , good experince in learning. Always exciting updates about company as well as the system. Good company to excel professionally ,"
good,"Your typical day goes by like a blurr.  You need to seriously multi-task or you will sink.  At my store they did not really want to train new people.  And if you weren't practically running around doing things you would get a lecture.  The pharmacist barely had time to counsel patients of new meds or questions because we were under the gun to fill as many scripts as humanly possible which made alot of customers upset.  Management was constantly telling us to sell sell sell flu shots, shingles shots etc. or they would cut our already rationed hours.  The employee discount was nice."
good,Got to be a people person and also have the patience to deal with customers that might be rude but it’s a good job to learn the different medications.
good,I was doing managerial duties but was not being paid the same amount as the managers. I asked about a promotion since I was already playing the role and was turned down. I felt it was unfair for me to have to play a bigger role and not be compensated for it.
good,Loved the manager staff there treated me like family . we ran a tight ship but always worked together like a family which made it a great place to learn and grow professionally .
good,"high-paced"
good,"I worked as both a Register Operator and a Photo Tech at the time. You would need to learn how to operate expensive machinery, deal with negatives appropriately, and accurately place correct photo orders where they needed to go for pick up."
good,It's a very quick pace job. management in someplace are fantastic. but some managers are the absolute worst. management at my store was just recently all rehired due to horrible management.
good,I was a pharmacy manager and it was rewarding. It was good working and rewarding. I have worked for some outstanding supervisors and some outstandingly bad supervisors. It makes you understand how to appreciate the good supervisors.
good,"I’ve worked for Walgreens for over 12 years. It’s a great company to work for if you’re planing to move around the states. They transfer pretty easily. Starting wages became really low after 2008. Pharmacy Technician position varies depending on the state. Overall, low pay for stressful job but still it’s a good place to start a healthcare career. Just make sure to apply for other jobs after a year or so of gaining a few experience. They have a advancement cap."
good,"Good company for pharmacists to get a great grounding in the industry. Fair market scheduling and fair remuneration, good training ground, technology was best in industry, wonderful technicians , hardest part of job is lack of management support."
good,It was a good work experience. I was able to acquire several skills and greatly improved upon my customer service. There were a variety of daily tasks to complete.
good,Just not a comfortable invorment. You don’t know from one day to the next what you are doing management is not on the same page as the rules are one says one thing and another says something different.
good,Loved the company in general but struggled with career advancement and compensation. Management not very supportive as everyone is looking out for themselves.
good,Overall a good place to work at but the management expects a lot fo you. They sometimes expect you to basically do their job while they do the bare minimum. I've been humiliated in front of customers by a supervisor and have felt belittled and inferior during interactions with some management. Not everyone was bad but the management really made it miserable to work here. The store manager has it out for employees she didnt hire and tries to make you leave or finds reasons to fire you. Ive been there for 3 years and am one of the oldest employees because everyone leaves or is fired
good,My typical day would start with opening the store. At times we were greeted with other early birds waiting to pick up or drop off as needed. The day would continue with filling prescriptions per request and solving problems with technology as well as insurance.
good,"This store is usually slow paced, there are many frequent customers. I have learned to manage my time efficiently, and have expanded my problem-solving abilities and organizational skills."
good,"A typical day at work was sometimes stressful but in the same breath rewarding from the customers. I had come to know each "
good,lots of customer service needed always on your feet not bad though if a coworker calls in depending on the manager you could be expected to do their work and be at fault if yours and theirs arent done. holidays get insanely busy too
good,"Working at Walgreens really helped me on how to deal with difficult situations with customers, how to be a person in a leadership position. Every employee that works at Walgreens is very kind and hardworking. They are patient with new employees and shift leads. The most difficult part of my position was trying to come up with solutions that are not always cut and dry but it made me a better leader."
good,"You have to be customer service orientated, you help customers all day along with stocking, answering calls, daily tasks, meetings, and handling the opening or closing duties."
good,"Walgreen's is a nice place to work, my co-workers are all very friendly and I like my managers. However is can also be a very stressful environment with a poor amount of communication, between the staff members, as well as between staff and management"
good,The company offers good benefits. Work can be sometimes boring sometimes stressful. Half hour breaks only! Even if you work more than 8 hours a day. Customers get upset often when price tags don’t match prices at the register.
good,"A typical day at walgreens is incredibly stressful. At my location in particular, there aren't enough hours to get everything done. District leaderships expects way more of us then we are physically capable of delivering."
good,I was blessed to work with some amazing people. I also encountered amazing customers. The lack of security was bad though.If I could've worked an earlier shift then my work/personal life would've been easier to balance.
good,a typical day here was fun. co-workers were friendly never had any issues with management. Environment was friendly and welcoming. Duties were shared between employees fairly and possibility of advancement or department change available to working employees first.
good,Customers are generally good and almost all we do is customer-oriented: help customers find items - in any store or online if item is out of stock. Welcome them. Restock shelves through bringing overstock in or filling it from warehouse. And ring them out quickly. Issues like out-of-stock and pricing discrepancies come up but we're well-trained in resolving them. You get a few breaks (at least one if you're there for more than four hours) and there are quiet periods. And there's the opportunity to move to Pharmacy or Management later.
good,This company is a great company to work for in-terms of benefits. however this is a very stressful place to work. The company is always cutting hours and require a lot of demands. This is not a family driving company you are just another  employee 2222. The company's vision is seeing through the eyes of CEO's that only sees numbers and digits.
good,"there is enough work to do there, but they do not pay you for all they work they want you to do. the benefits they offer you are great though. it is a great job for a retired person to do."
good,The work isn’t hard and it goes by pretty quick most days. Depending on your coworkers there can be lots of drama which is no fun but over all I enjoy it.
good,"I learned how to work with customers more, and how to get along with people better. The hardest part of the job was when we were understaffed on a day that was very busy."
good,"I worked here part time while going to school. I worked maybe 20-30 hours a week, the pay was average, but the overall environment was not bad. I would definitely recommend to someone who needs something to do/first job."
good,"The day was always demanding because of the constant influx of customers, but it felt good to help resolve their needs and to do the work right because the work was very challenging to master. My coworkers were always nice and on top of their positions so most days went smoothly, no matter how busy."
good,"Walgreens was an ok place to work, however the hours did not always add up to full time hours and I was never really trained on the job in which I was originally hired."
good,"Customer service is hard and Walgreens is probably no different then any other company. Walgreens is open everyday of the year and you're not going to get holidays off. It's a fast paced environment and there is always something to do. But again, if you don't know how to deal with customers it's not going to be easy, especially if you work in a rough neighborhood. I stuck it out for so long because I had seniority, and my scheduling manager was helpful when I needed time off or switching shifts."
good,"i would make sure all products are aligned on the shelf, everything has to be organized, and store has to be kept clean at the end of the day. i would fill in the missing products on shelves, and the ice room, crushing trash in the compacter. taking orders for customers"
good,Days differ based on service trucks and store crowds. Management promises advancement opportunities often but rarely follow through with the promises.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of rotating between being a cashier, stocker, and floor associate.  I learned how to manage my time effectively, handle and count money, and work with people of all temperaments. I worked with many different managers and shift supervisors, and the experience was generally good.  The workplace culture was also good.  The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy boxes and unloading the freight trucks.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know my coworkers and customers."
good,"It was my first real job for advancement, but I could only go so far on such little pay. I loved the people I worked with, I became close with many customers, but the constant change in hours and lack of pay and benefits just wasn't worth staying fulltime."
good,"It’s a retail job. Just like any other, some places will be laid back, and others will be miserably stressful. Some days, everything goes smoothly, and other days, every customer that walks through the door is a moron. It’s your average retail job."
good,"Walgreens as a company was a good place to work for. The Corporate leadership was competent and has a good strategic vision. My local leadership was not too overbearing. The pay and benefits were also reasonable. However, it was not immune to all of the negatives of retail, including constant turnover, disinterested team members, a never-ending to-do list, long hours, and stressful holiday seasons"
good,The initiative would have benefited from better executive leadership so that all consultants and FTE contributions could be appreciated by the larger corporation.
good,"The place I worked was fine. The people in management were amazing people at the location I was at. Being in the pharmacy you really don't get much respect form a small number of patients. Overall, not a bad place to be."
good,"The typical work day would always start off well. The drug order would arrive, and everyone working that day would be settling into their ""work-groove."" After about an hour past opening, the torrent of patients and customers would begin. While the coworkers at my Walgreen's were outstanding, we were no match for the volume of work that needed to be accomplished on a daily basis. There simply would not be enough time for the pharmacy staff to complete all necessary tasks for a given day. This was mainly due to the fact that were not enough people working at a given time to attend to all of the needs of the pharmacy. Management would attempt to remedy the situation, but the higher-ups in the company would repeatedly decline to help improve the work environment. While there are plenty of friendly patients, there are far too many patients that are flat out mean, and in some cases, threatening to those working in the pharmacy. The hostile environment created by many of Walgreens' patrons is more than enough of a reason to find a new job. The migraines associated with insurance companies and drug seekers only furthers the aforementioned claim. However, if you are looking to gain some valuable knowledge about medications, working as a pharmacy technician at Walgreens may be a good option for a short-term job, but not a long-term employment choice."
good,It was a fun environment with great people. They had flexible hours which was great since I was in trade school.  Very fun customers that made your job fun!
good,"Working at a 24 Hour Walgreens was difficult. While the hours were flexible there were multiple occurrences of being kept over time. Being a high school student at the time, I could not afford to stay past 10:30 PM as I would have school the next day. There were times where I felt that my schooling was not taken into account when making the schedule."
good,"they where ok to work for until the management started playing games with us, taking away health insurance, changing schedules without notice and to them you are just a number. but before all the changes it was a good place to work for, they took care of you. sad to see something like that happen."
good,"Walgreens was a great retail job. "
good,"A normal day at work involves stocking shelves, cleaning, and sometimes working on the register.  Depending on your job title you may have more or less duties.  I learned how to work fast and efficiently, how to be patient with customers, and how to improve my performance at work.  The management is good and friendly.  The workplace culture is quick, but closely knit group that always help each other.  The hardest part of the job is learning new skills and trying to master them.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the nice customers and coworkers."
good,I have always been treated well with Walgreens. It gave an opportunity to grow and advance myself.  I have been recently treated poorly due to my religious beliefs.
good,"Loved the customers, fast paced work environment, and the management was awesome. The company itself caps out on wages as a pharmacy technician and you can not advanced past senior tech without actually going to school and becoming a pharmacist."
good,"The staff is great to work with. It is a multitasked, fast paced  environment that is focused on helping the customer and their satisfaction. Great place to work."
good,"Good experiences, teaches you many skills that you can take with you and use for future jobs. Committed to customer service and it really shows through the companies drives/focuses."
good,I had no idea what I was getting into when I started my internship at walgrreens in the Pharmacy. Thankfully this pharmacy was slow but the days that it would get busy some people would get inpatient and yell at you if their prescriptions werent ready. I got a lot of help from the pharmacist and she was very helpful with everything i had questions about. I learned a lot from her.
good,Very laid back environment. Maybe too laid back which is why I left. Plus the pay wasn't that great either to be staying here longer than a year or two. Other than that it's not a bad first job. Highly recommend for the start of anyone's work career.
good,"This was a great company to work for, I was sad that I was a part of the mass layoff, pretty flexible and understanding when time needed off and allowed to make up time, received great discounts, many raises, an increase every 6 months and a raise alongside the increase"
good,I learned how to do many different positions at walgreen's. Everyone is very helpful. Employees are very nice and understanding. Willing to work with you.
good,I learned a lot when I worked at Walgreens it was very fast paced and stressful because it is medicine. I liked working there. But it was hard working the hours they needed.
good,"I  love dealing with the public in person or on the phone.  I am a very positive person with excellent customer service ability."
good,"I just was not interested in the retail field and would rather do something more on my feet, as I enjoy fitness, wellness, and the restaurant industry as well."
good,"If you are a college student it's an okay job to pay for books, but I wouldn't recommend this as a career job. Little to no advancement unless you're a butt kisser."
good,"The job was very stressful because all the responsibilities seem to fall on crew members. Although the pay was higher than minimum wage you weren't paid enough for what you were asked to do. Felt like a ""slave""."
good,"A typical day at was was relaxed and slow paced. I learn alot about inventory and management.The hardest part of the job is how slow time goes by, but the most enjoyable is communication with all the customers."
good,Really it depends on where you work and which store.  My first store had a great manager and team members.  The second however was terrible the manager was a pushover and his assistant had us doing the most asinine and redundant tasks.
good,calm and not too stressful until certain times of the year. Perfect if you are at school and trying to keep balance. The work atmosphere was one that was standard
good,"Shifts are consistent on the customer and labor front. Policy and policy enforcement is consistent. Cross training is promoted and it is common for all employees to effectively operate all stations as required. Individual strengths are recognized and factored when tasks are being assigned. This improves overall efficiency throughout the work day. Desire for professional progression is recognized, but slow to action."
good,"This position was a contracted position, and the typical work day included all day scanning, Management for this position was very direct and informative, the workplace was very culture, the hardest part of the job was leaving. The most enjoyable part of this position was the interaction with everyone."
good,General facilities maintenance was handled locally with ease but when something major was needed then it requires to many people to sign off on the repairs.
good,great place to work except for the low pay. long hours on your feet. great learning environment and management. the customers really made you understand their side of needing prescriptions and some not needing prescriptions.
good,"Working in the pharmacy you are not only filling scripts, but dealing with insurance and doctors offices most of the time. The other part is dealing with the ignorant public about their insurance and co-pays. The never understand their plan and they make you feel like the idiot. Also Walgreens is one of the dirtiest places I have ever worked. Floor have stains from spills, dust on products, bathroom has fecal and blood matter on walls and other areas. The break room has dried, old food growing mold on it at most time and the cleaning solutions are openly stored in there. The pay is good but management is not so supportive of personal matters. Just sell and give the customer anything they want, especially when they make a fuss."
good,A typical day would be walking into the office and receiving your list from the shift manager. You would help customers with their needs while trying to complete your list. The workplace was always friendly and inviting.
good,"Fun, coworkers to work around with, but the job is what you make it to be. It can be tough or it can be fun and you can earn a living week to week. I just enjoy working and love to provide for my family."
good,I typicalI  day at Wal Green was stocking shelves with merchandise and then going around and picking things off the shelves that were out dated. I liked the management people because if you or a customer had a question on anything they would drop what they were doing and take care of you. The hardest part of this job was reading the small print on all the bottles of pills to see what was out dated and what wasn't.
good,this is a good job if you are in school or just want a second job. You will get thoroughly trained. They are also great at scheduling you based on your availability.
good,"Customer Service Workers often get rotated based not priority of need to which department to work (photo, floor, front, or cosmetic) to which front check out is what required full staff.  The biggest learning of the job is to be effective and efficient to keeping the checkout line as short as possible.  This required much knowledge on the sales of the products and their cost to not, to keeping count of inventory, to stocking shelf's and keeping the store clean and tidy."
good,"Walgreens is a good company to work for, there are a lot of lifers though and it is just not enough money for me to make a career or even a living off of having so many responsibilities."
good,"Overall a decent job. Advancement seems to be geared more towards the young or people with no family. Compensation is not horrible, but if you work more than 50hrs a week it weakens,"
good,Walgreens was a good place to work. The hours are there and they are flexible. The time usually does by pretty smoothly there because there is always something to do.
good,"The customers and the management i worked with are the people that made it worth my time to stay with walgreens, a lot of the co-workers are lazy and they do not want to work."
good,Started with no experience and the entire management team was patient with me and taught me everything I know in retail. I will not forget the great times I had working with the team.
good,"Worked for this company for 7 years. Spent a lot of time trying to get up into management. After five years, finally. They’re an okay company, but don’t think you’ll get promoted."
good,Depending on location experiences will vary. Some pharmacy managers are professional some not so much. Also depending on the store manager and who they hire will greatly vary the environment of the store front end as well as the neighborhood/demographics of the surrounding area.
good,"You start at minimum wage and probably won't get a raise for about 2 years and that would be lucky if that occurs. They are very, very stingy with the pay for good employees. It doesn't matter if your're the best they've ever seen - you're not going to be paid for that."
good,Walgreens was always good with getting employees schedules down and when they could work. The store I worked in was a very clean and organized store. The only problem I had was there wasn't any opportunities for changing positions or getting a higher position.
good,They're very flexible with hours.  The work environment is good.  Management is efficient and effective.  The work atmosphere is productive.  I enjoy helping customers.
good,"Changes have happened and are need, management needs work and the work place has been started to improve a little but it is an ok place to work.  Helped me out from time to time so as a whole not a bad place just be ready to work and work hard."
good,"On a given day, during the early hours my job would be attending the scrum call, finding out – proactively – what their priorities are for the week and the focus for the sprint, meeting with team for half hour to communicate the clients’ needs and organizing the team schedules around the Project priorities."
good,"As my second job, fresh out of high school and barely any work experience, this was a great job and I really enjoyed working there for the two years that I did. However, my store was constantly hounded by our district manager for poor scores thanks to the area we were in - lots of ""entitled"" customers, basically. Other stores in ""worse"" areas ""performed better"" due to this, but our store seemed to be managed the best. Other than that, as long as your coworkers actually do work and aren't awful, it's a pretty easy, enjoyable place to work. Perhaps can get stressful in management positions with district managers breathing down your neck."
good,"As a pharmacist at Walgreens, you are required to wear many hats.  It is a fast paced environment and is very stressful.  Sometimes there is not enough help during the work shift.  This company however does compensate well with their medical/prescription insurance, 401k, and stock options. Nights and weekends are required."
good,"its not the best place to work, the manager that does the work schedule didn't pay attention to my availability and would schedule me while I was at my other job."
good,Good place to work they care about their customers and their employees.  Frequently they are seeking input from employees to improve the relationships between employees and management.
good,"The typical day at work for me, as an intern, was around the same as an Assistant Manager. I had to manage the regular employees and make sure they knew what to do and how to do it. I supported the pharmacy during rush times. I also worked on the major projects that corporate sent down for us to complete. I imagine the job would be easier at a slower store, but we are the busiest store in Lincoln, NE so it is busy a lot of the time."
good,"At the time I worked for Walgreens Iv'e experienced poor management, favortisim and shady co-workers, but, Walgreens is a great company to work for. I would definitely recommend to first time job seekers and anyone looking for something different in retail. I would suggest though to just go there to actually do your job and just let your co-workers stay co-workers. You do your job and you're really good at it you will get recognized and have other opportunities for growth."
good,"It depends on the season, September thru March roughly is a nightmare. Peoples insurance changing, deductibles, cold and flu season. Late spring and summer are usually pretty calm except when people are trying to get vacation supplies of meds."
good,"As a member of the store-level leadership team, you have to stay on your P's & Q's. Walgreen's is swiftly changing every aspect of its approach as a business. Employees are leaving to find what works better for them. Corporate leadership has changed for the worse and you aren't even guaranteed your job from day-to-day. I have seen the turnover rate explode within the past month and its overwhelming to say the least. The new corporate leadership that is in position now has this belittling attitude about themselves that makes you feel worthless. Even the most confident and educated people in roles feel as if their best isn't enough. It is not fair. I love my job but the change of the very core aspects and foundation that Walgreen's was built upon has changed. Walgreen's has been a great stepping stone for me-- a place where i once thought of retiring from. Now, I feel like I have reached my peak and am looking for greater opportunities outside of this company."
good,"Very busy pharmacy to work at, Yet more than enough support staff was provided and balancing work and home came first. Plenty of time allowed for meal breaks."
good,It is a nice enough environment.  Hours are inconsistent.  You are on your feet all the time.  Chairs are forbidden in most areas.  Customers are often rude and you are under pressure to commit customer fraud and theft.  Robberies do occur.
good,"worked as a pharmacist for 8 years, overall a pretty good place to work, sometimes stressful.  It was the first job that I ever had.   Sometimes you are forced to travel far for work."
good,none was included for us walgreens walgreens walgreens walgreens eastern divison on ground level Washington street your company is not in proper order
good,The company always understood you and worked with you.  You felt welcomed and was easy to work with others.  They would try to give you a raised as much as possible.
good,I worked here a long time ago and it was a time that they had taken the different positions and put them into one.  I was a supervisor/key holder and in charge of inventory which was difficult to juggle
good,"I have been working for Walgreens for almost 3 years. It started out great, until corporate started to change everything. This has given us extra work with fewer hours, causing us to be behind all of the time. It was too much for me, along with a horrible coworker, that I had to leave."
good,"I have been ""borrowed"" at many stored and there are always pros and cons at each store; however, I feel very comfortable at the Stellhorn and Maplecrest store in Fort Wayne, IN.  I enjoy the flexibility of hours and the opportunity to advance within the company."
good,"my typical day at work is to take care of the customers needs first."
good,"Working at Walgreens is like working with your family. Everyone cares about each other and works as a team. The most enjoyable part of the job is engagement day, where the managers let the staff wear jeans for a day or they bring in lunch. The most rewarding part of the job is helping the patients understand and receive their medications. The worst part of the job is dealing with changes in insurance for patients.  Sometimes the patients don't know what kind of insurance they have. We don't mind helping find their new insurance, but it is time consuming. Walgreens also has good benefits."
good,"Once trained correctly there is no end to what you can learn.Training can improve...needs to give employese the time at work to fully understand their job.  Only 1 person should be in charge of the training, otherwise the employee may get 2-3 different ways to complete a task and they are all different and may not be correct.  The people training should fully know who they are training not everyone are the same."
good,Slow-paced and friendly environment. Also safe environment due to having securities on every shift especially night shift. If you customer service skills then Walgreens is the job for you.
good,"Overall great company just wish I didn't apply through a temp agency so that my term wouldn't be up. I would recommend this job to a person seeking full time work with great pay,"
good,I worked as a cashier and photo technician so I worked closely with customers making sure they got the service they needed. Quality service is the most important thing. I learned great customer service skills and how to run a photo lab. Management was great during the time I was there. The management has long changed and I do not know how things are run currently. The workplace was always cheerful and I made a lot of friends in my time there. The hardest part of the job was learning how to fix the photo lab equipment. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and other employees.
good,"It's not a terrible place to work. It is hard to advance up in the company. Lots of drama at all three locations I have been. However, if you can learn to ignore most people--it's worth it. Overall, not the worst  job I've ever had. I wouldn't leave if I didn't need more money and better opportunity."
good,Cashier positions and such are okay as a secondary job or for a retired person. There is a lot of standing in one place foe long periods of time. Patience is a must!
good,"The most enjoyable aspect of Walgreen's Pharmacy is working with the customers. As a manager, I was able to resolve any problems with my customers and my employees, so that there was cohesion and improvement within the workplace."
good,"I really love this job, I just hate the hours. There aren't any set hours unless you're a store manager. There are a lot of changes going on in the company and job security is starting to worry me. I don't intend on moving past a shift lead so I'm just looking for something else. Great job for entry level positions and if you're a hard worker it's easy to move up."
good,"Overall it's a great place to work at but I am in school for business and not pharmacy. I would need my bachelor's to get into the business side of the company, which is understandable. The hours however are being cut every 6 months and I do not feel like my job is safe enough to keep my hours at full time."
good,"They offer great benefits and since the retail industry always seems to be in full swing, there is a lot of job security as well.  Management is working hard to improve the environment at work and that is a wonderful improvement!"
good,Good company with a solid reputation in Chicago. They have have both retail and pharmacy growth and expected to continue on an upward trend. The managers are great to work with.
good,It's an okay place to work if your starting over or just starting in the workforce. Expect to work multiple departments as they are usually understaffed.
good,I liked working there at first. The manager that I have was fare. Then that changed when another manager took over. He seem to have his picks. I got a better opportunity to get a better job.
good,"It is a good place and I would stay but the management at my store isn't all that great. Other than that the cashiers start at $9/hr with a yearly raise in Greenville, SC. great job for high school or college students because hours are flexible."
good,I enjoyed my time with Walgreens. I moved up the corporate ladder relatively quickly but another opportunity presented itself in a company that had better opportunities.
good,"Managers and co-workers take time to help you with anything you need. Working with customers and resolving their requests and needs on a daily basis was one of the great perks that I personally enjoyed, knowing that i was able to help people with what ever they needed at the moment asking."
good,"in a day 2 employees and 1 manager runs the photo counter with good customer service, stock shelves and unload 400 to 1000 piece truck one cashier getting carts phasing items, vacuuming and do any other special tasks which is usually lots. always super busy, cleaning the bathrooms. the enjoyable part is having 2 paid 15 minute breaks and it being a friendly co working environment. the managers know what they are doing and have good people skills."
good,Not a bad place to work but I've been here  for about a year and I'm still on the main register every shift. Very little chances to be on the floor and learn new things.
good,This job have some many opportunities to offer but the problem was getting a group of individuals that was friendly cooperative and or self motivated people
good,"If you don't mind a very physical job, this is a good place to work.  They get a truck three times a week, and tons of merchandise must be accurately stocked.  It's difficult if you suffer from arthritis or back pain.  Walgreen's offers ongoing training to help you achieve excellence in your job.  There are opportunities for advancement and/or transfers.  If you get good performance reviews, you will see regular raises.  If you work at a 24/7/365 store, you will be expected to work on Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving, and other holidays."
good,"I worked my way from a part time cashier, all the way to assist manager.  I love Walgreen and the opportunity to advance throughout the store.   It become a big family away from home."
good,It was a great job to work at but me personally just felt like it was time to move on so i could better myself and my career. I enjoyed the management.
good,Walgreens always had something to do. There was never any sitting around on the job. A typical day had task lists and schedules so you always knew what you would be doing. The atmosphere was relaxed and fun.
good,Decent job for gaining experience. Retail setting so downfall of that and management play favorites with scheduling and hrs. No set schedule. Difficult to get full time unless with in crowd
good,"I worked in-store and generally it is a good environment if you don't want to go the corporate route. There are plenty of opportunities to advance, but you would have to be willing to move locations. If you want to be away from the corporate structure, the store level route isn't a bad one."
good,"I work at Walgrenns as sales stock person who stock shelves, clean the parking lot, take out the trash, mop the floor, fill Arizona teas, and clean mirrors ."
good,"The job is great i would recommend it to anyone. job is easy and lax. But if you get a bad manager and DM dont worry, im sure you will find a great job, any thing will look better than walgreens. Your managers have a huge affect the new programs rolled out have great potential, but again, if you have bad managers you will not reap any benefits from it."
good,Workplace is good and co-workers are helpful. Have got  more knowledge  in  Computer  and Network Systems . Experience knowledge of call center with Avaya phone systems. Management  and workplace culture is good.
good,Cant complain about my team and my supervisor and was very thankful working with them for almost 5 years. But the management just sucks. Less compensation and a lot of mandatory
good,"Learn vocabulary, terms, and more with flashcards, games, and other study tools ... Which of the following psychological terms reflects a disguised value judgment .... Demand characteristics are things that participants in experiment observe that they think are clues as .... C. your facial expressions can influence how you feel."
good,Typical day would be 0pening and closing of the store. Balancing funds in safe. Trained employee's as needed. The enjoyable part was being able to make the customer happy.
good,"Good environment and benefits, initial training is quite complete. They need to focus more on employee training and development to make it appealing to continue working there."
good,"I love people! That being said that is the reason for my many retail years. I make things happen! If you are looking for a particular item, I will find it, I will order it. I look at customer service everywhere I go and learn what I could do at my level to make it better. That is what retail/customer service is all about. Walgreens is a great company."
good,"Management unapproachable. Friendly staff, hard workers and always seem to make the day go by fast due to high volume work."
good,"i would still been at walgreens but management was so lowdown i loved everything about walgreens was a great worker i leaned how to do resets,out dates throughout the store employees are hard workers and we were all sweet but management would not let us be great always got picked on truly miss my job and that kind of work"
good,"A typical day at Walgreens included customer service, loading and unloading trucks, stocking the shelves, and making sure the customers were happy and had a great experience while they were there."
good,"Loved working there, good employees and management, lot's of opportunity of advancement, benefits are good. Only con is management isn't guaranteed a break time."
good,Fun an productive. learned how to greet people as they come into the store.This place has really come a long way in the last couple of months. I see a very bright future for this place and I am very happy to see that the new management is working hard to keep old and new patients
good,"Everyday you learn something new. You never know it all but you do become well experienced working in the pharmacy. Everyday intel's inputting prescription data, corresponding with patients to fulfill their needs to the satisfaction of the company values, filling prescriptions and much more. The staff and management are usually real nice to work around and are available if ever you need them. The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships you build with your patients everyday to help them live and happy and healthy."
good,"Co-workers on the floor are great and helpful, but the supervisors that transfer from store to store are all the same, they pass on their work to everyone else, sit on their phones in the office and have no genuine concern for the store."
good,"As a store associate, you are expected to work the register, clean/organize and work the floor, assist customers with finding products, and work the photo lab. Everything is good except for the pay, which is minimum wage. Raises are not common. Depending on your area, customers can be ridiculous or rude. Many locations have only one or two registers, so sometimes customers who shop at Walgreens like a grocery store will cause the line to be backed up."
good,good place to work in if you're in high school. no set schedule. easy job for the most part. customer service is a must with a friendly attitude and positive attitude
good,"clean environment"
good,You'll get out of it what you put in. Great company if you live to work and you set high expectations for yourself. It gets hard to move up if you not wanting to move.
good,"Walgreen's always has a challenge, there is always something new to learn and a new challenge to accept. I was working in the photo department for a while and decided to take upon the challenge of learning pharmacy, within 6 months I learned how to type,fill, and close prescriptions, along with learning how to bill insurance and fix any rejected insurance. Now I'm focusing on a shift lead position."
good,Are you able to share your knowledge with other employees to help them when they are at work and they are having a problem. Are you willing to step in when a employees is having a problem with a customer
good,"I want to make sure our customers are fully satisfied with their service at Wal- Greens, and I enjoy working with my co- workers, having team work helps."
good,"Retail management jobs, stocking shelves, supervising 8 -10 employees in a retail environment, Was responsible for store complaints and scheduling employing productivity at all times but especially when store manager was gone."
good,I like working there sometimes  but I also feel like there are differences made between employees and favoritism made also.  Sometimes I feel all alone
good,"Worked as a graduate pharmacy intern in one of Walgreens' several compounding pharmacies in Albuquerque. The pharmacy manager was very pleasant and easy going. The store manager was difficult at times, and tended to micromanage."
good,"I have heard a lot of people complain about Walgreen's but my experience was mostly good. I worked at a store in a smaller town so it wasn't quite as hectic as big city stores. There is that corporate balance so pay raises tend to be in a decent timing/manner as long as you're doing well in your job. I will say they way they dole out hours to the pharmacy is quite silly, as it is based on how many prescriptions you actually sell, and there is no control over that. I left because they could not offer me more hours and I needed them. Otherwise I would have stayed."
good,"While the program is fairly new still, it's soo slow and boring! You're on your feet for 8 hours straight with absolutely nothing to do all day. The store I worked at was great and I had AMAZING management, they people above store level need to figure out how to make this position better."
good,Scheduling is terrible but if you're single and can work random hours during the week this job is pretty good. They pay decent and management is overall pretty good to the employees.
good,Everything is focused around the pharmacy. Waiting on customers is number  2.   You punch in then you will go to your department you are assigned to or ask the manager on duty what they want you to do.
good,Pay starts out low but they advance you quickly. Pay started at $10 and was making $18.05 an hour in less then two years. Lots of overtime late summer through the holidays.
good,Working in retail for Walgreens was a great stepping stone. I am now is pharmacy school and need hours in the pharmacy but since the law is 18 and older plus my late birthday it was hard for me to get back there before starting school. This summer is now my chance at a pharmacy job.
good,I loved going to work because the environment was friendly and very busy too. making your shift run by so fast and because I love to be busy it was fun for me.
good,At the store I work at depending on the manager you have makes a difference between a easier day at work and a hard day at work. Customers can nice at time while other times they are looking for someone to complain to.
good,"The main job of a beauty advisor is to meet sales goals while offering personalized customer service and maintaining long-lasting relationships with customers. I enjoyed hosting beauty must have events. My duties were to  find the baeuty products that meet their needs and sell customers as many products as possible. Job duties involve suggesting products, explaining how products work, demonstrating how to use products, performing makeovers, and operating the cash register"
good,"Working at Walgreens was a great experience it made me who I am today an what I wanna be in life. Before I started I wasn't a people person, but being around my previous co workers made my job so much easier an fun. Thank you !"
good,"None of the tasks were hard, everything was fairly easy and simple. Management were kind and didn't breathe down your neck all day. I would recommend this job to people."
good,A typical day at work is making sure that our customers are satisfied. I learned new things on the daily with up training and changes with the company.
good,"Good job, good benefits , wish they didn't close the warehouse, I would still be there . Room for advancement , good hours , and overtime if you wanted it ."
good,"I have some incredibly gracious, kind, and thoughtful people working with me and I would not trade them for the world, but the turnover rate is pretty harsh, being in a college town. Upper management has some consistency issues, but are overall good people."
good,"typical day was managing a team of employees to restock, clean up stock room, and making sure that they were giving great customer service. money handling, opening or closing store. looking over company gross and what can be improved."
good,"if you express the desire they will work with you to become promoted."
good,Too much office politics. Assistant manager trying to take manager's  job by playing employees against him. If you don't play the games they'll get rid of you.
good,Walgreens' pharmacy is a fast paced environment.  The theme here is also to do more with less.  I enjoy working with my pharmacists and they have proven to be knowledgeable and competent.
good,The Ecommerce department is a great place to learn Agile project management and grow your career. I feel that the most rewarding part of working at Walgreens is collaborating on amazing programs with diverse teams.
good,"Working in a Walgreens store is a great experience, especially for a first job.  My only issue came with the lack of employees. My specific store could not hold down a steady flow of updated schedules, or employees. The store manager and the assistant store manager wouldn't update the schedule for the next week  until the day of. this lead to a lot of confusion in the work place. along with that the store managers will ask you to come in early or stay late as convenient to them, ignoring the factors of school or traffic. "
good,"Walgreens as a whole is a very enjoyable company to work for, but with any job, the people you work with and work for will change your experience greatly."
good,"very busy, need to be upbeat, standing all day, accurate in money, willing to clean (vacuum, mop), dealing with so many different people, working register while stocking shelves,"
good,This company has one of the best operating systems. They train you very well. The pay could be a lot better based on the amount of work and demand involved. The hours are very unpredictable at times.
good,I always have enjoyed my co-workers. Management on the other hand could be better. I've been told thats just my manager.
good,"An interesting place to work.Each store is different,but the store where I was employed was a pretty great place.Nice location and wonderful management."
good,"typical day at work at walgreens is stocking, checking customers out and staying neat and organized while meeting sales goals."
good,"It was ok."
good,"Me habría gustado que el Manager estuviera un poco más al tanto a la hora de estar haciendo nuestro trabajo, para así darnos su opinión al respecto. Más allá de eso, el personal en general fue súper amable y cordial."
good,"Good atmosphere, sometimes the professionalism is lacking Thirty minute breaks. Having to fix co-workers' mistakes, which leads to customers being mad at myself."
good,"I really enjoyed my time with Walgreens.  I did not leave on bad terms.  I left for new opportunities with a growing company, because I felt stuck in my current position with little chance for advancement."
good,It was a 9 to 5 job with flexible hours that taught me how to communicate more efficiently with customers and how to handle money efficiently.
good,"Walgreens is a great company to work for. If you value continued opportunity for development and learning, Walgreens offers continuous resources and the experience to enable growth and develop relationships. However, based on the organizational structural development and the nature of the competitive industry, there has been little opportunity to advance since the rewiring for growth following the 2008 recession. "
good,"I liked that tasks varied and changed throughout the day.  I was always busy, never bored."
good,A great place to work being as we had so many regular customers.A typical morning starts with all of smokers coming in to start there and then go into work enjoyed seeing the sames people numerous times a day.
good,"A typical day as a beauty advisor at Walgreens was to interact with customers and work as a team to get the job done. I've learned to communicate better with people and have become more independent. The thing I loved most about Walgreen's was all the people I met from different cultures and backgrounds. I learned more about products and how to sell items as well as to make sure each customer has a memorable experience so that they would like to return later on. Customer service isn't just about giving the customer what they want, but also making their trip enjoyable so they feel welcome."
good,Great company to move up in.. The mangers are always  pushing works to work harder to show that you want to excel within the company. There is always places for advancement..
good,"Great training and implementation, low pay for responsibilities and average managerial transitions.  Inconsistent work hours."
good,Recently many bonuses and incentives have been terminated for employees for no apparent reason yet they continue to expand and partner with companies such as theranos.
good,"I had very little experience within the company itself, however I greatly enjoyed the time I spent there. The work was demanding, but not impossible, and the people were pleasant to work with. If given the opportunity to keep working with them, I would have been glad to, however the externship program had ended."
good,"no hay importancia hacia el empleado, no hay oportunidad de crecimiento,"
good,This job allows you to meet a lot of different people. The best part about this job was working on freight with co-workers to see who would get done with their totes first. The hardest part aboout this job was working on the medicine totes since there are so many different kinds of medication.
good,"As a Sr. Certified Pharmacy Technician I was responsable to process all prescriptions to health plans, medications inventory control and provide a excellent customer services."
good,The warehouse has the capability of being a good one with a few major changes. Starting with management. Second of all if they updated their conveyor system and power equipment that would also help. Overall alright place to work.
good,This is a very busy place to work. I liked working there. Management was good and the hours were good. My co-workers were great and I made new friends there.
good,"People were friendly, and dedicated to getting patients their medication in the call center. Also really dedicated to helping patient get the medication if the patient could not pay. "
good,I was hired as a Shift Lead and there isn't anywhere to go upward from there except Management and without any degree that's not an option. Each day had more or less the same duties and left nothing to do to show initiative for advancement or raises.
good,A day at Walgreens starts clocking in and seeing what needs to be taken care of first in my assigned area. Working in the day time has to do with stocking the shelves and making sure customers are helped. Working night times is about cleaning the store (including making sure everything looks correct on the shelves) and making sure the customers are helped as quickly as possible.
good,very busy pharmacy. faced pace environment. learn a lot of insurance tricks and its also one of the hardest parts of the jobs. my co workers are very nice. management is ok but not the best at my specific store.
good,Great coworkers.  This company is what you make out of it.  They have some good views and some that are questionable as well.
good,The people make the job. It's mostly very busy at the store where I worked at. Benefits and pay arent that bad. Job security because most people couldnt handle how busy it was.
good,"it was fun until it wasnt. My location needed better management and training. Other than that , there was plenty to learn and a lot of fun doing so in the process"
good,Walgreen is a good first job for anyone looking to not start out in food service. The one I worked at had difficulty keeping a store manger and never had an assistance manager. There wasn't a ton of opportunity for training or advancement either as we were understaffed and once you got hired or settled in a certain department then that's just where you worked. There was a woman that had been working at my location for $25 years and was only making $12/hr. I started at $8.50 so not the biggest promoters of raises. No benefits and no eligibility to receive them until I had been there at least 2 years.
good,Good place to work. Friendly people. Low stress. Cutting edge technology. Location is easily accessible from the inrerstate. Family friendly company.
good,being apart of the management was really fun. I had a really great time there. I loved my staff and the environment. loved the atmosphere.
good,"A typical day is making sure customers are helped, fronting merchandise, stocking and re-merchandising. Co-workers make or break this job."
good,Great way to see how independent woman you can be. Graveyard shift was calming for the most part. Bosses all have a GREAT sense of humor.
good,"nothing out of the ordinary for a cashier. You help customers and answer phones when need be. Management may take a little more time than usual to address your needs or concerns, but overall productive"
good,"Team members are always willing to assist. "
good,"Managers worked well with their employees. Everyone had responsibilities and were quick to get them done. Training wasn't extensive, but the job was easy to learn."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walgreen's. Very professional and upbeat environment. The company offered many opportunities for advancement, with decent pay raises as well."
good,I enjoy myself when I am at work. Nothing feels forced by the management. Everyone gets along with each other. Holidays are celebrated very spontaneously.
good,"Corporate often cut back hours, which left me alone with the pharmacist. The pharmacist had one or two jobs to focus on, which left me doing literally everything else most days. Answering phones, helping customers inside and in the drive-thru, entering prescriptions, filling prescriptions, checking faxes, filing paperwork, ordering medications, etc., etc. I liked working there, but eventually left because it became too much."
good,"Work days were sometimes challenging do to lack of work, I loearned to be creative with my time,the managers were all on different pages on how to dos. I worked with some of the best people in my life working at walgreens, trying to convince people to buy things they didnt want or need, but I really enjoyed the challenges.."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Walgreens because I got to know people in my community and was able to help them in every way I could to make their life easier and better. My co-workers was awesome to work with and got to know many new people by working there for 10 years. Advancement in the company was a huge down fall for me because I inquired about it several times with management and nothing ever came of it and I did the job of someone with a higher title than me every day but I didn't get paid for it the whole time I work there. Plus, I proved my skills and ability to management consistently."
good,"On a typical work day i would either work the cash register as a cashier ringing customers or work on the floor stocking assisting customers and cleaning. i have learned how to stock, unload trucks, deal wit customers in many different scenarios,and inventory of this particular store. management were very serious about there job they kept the customers happy and they always listened and took in everything that the employees had to say but couldn't keep most employees happy. the co workers were kind and nice to each other but they were just co workers not really any special bonds in the store except a select few."
good,I invested a lot of time in this company and i learned a lot and missed all the customers i met along the way. I would assist customers on impossible situations and in the pharmacy which held 70 percent of the stores business.
good,"The hours are all over the place. day shift one day and night shift the next day. But overall its a fun company to work, with a few opportunities for advancement."
good,"I personally feel as though when you work at Walgreens, that is your life. I don't have much time outside of work to do much, even as a part time employee. Everyone expects too much out of you and they do not put forward that same amount of effort."
good,"Daily tasks are easily assumed. Customers make the day-to-day interesting; which is the fun part, helping and interacting with different personalities. Product knowledge is important but knowing everything is impossible, so be easy on yourself. Management and shift leads can either make or break the functions and flow of the store. Be careful who you confide in, as far as using the Open Door Policy."
good,"While I know walgreens is currently phasing out the Beauty Adviser position, It was good while it lasted (And when we had good managers)"
good,very fast paced but also very rewarding and fun. Its great meeting new people and also having coworkers who are just as hard working. time goes by very fast and it is overall a great job
good,Takes care of the long term employees and has a well established culture.   Have been there for 33+ years.  I have relocated twice for the company and have been compensated each time.
good,"very fast pace keeping up with chores and customer's, learned how to balance my time to be able to complete all task by given deadline, management was okay not really hands on co- workers were friendly the hardest part of the job is unloading trucks when short staffed, the most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with the customers."
good,"I love the people I work with and my immediate boss, but the job has it's negatives. Low compensation for amount of work, higher up bosses in company do not care about you, and last but not least you deal with the stresses of the general public due to it being a retail job."
good,I have worked at the Loveland Walgreens store since 2007 in a part time capacity. I really like my store manager. He is a motivated person and keeps a clean store. He treats his employees with honesty and fairness. He will work with people who have to work part time jobs the get the most for him and the store.
good,Offering the best customer service possible. Making sure that prices are correct so that everyone is getting all the saving that they can.Setting up displays
good,Walgreen's is a great place to start out your work career. the management is always willing to help you out and my co workers have always been really nice. the only down fall is the pay is horrible even if you move up in the company
good,"You learn something new everyday that you work there.  The management was understanding and very easy to work with as long as you did your job.  The co-workers, were always fantastic and very team oriented. The hardest part of the job has to be the breaking down of photo lab machines.  It was very time consuming to get those babies back up and running.  The most enjoyable part once again has to the the customer that come in and the co-workers."
good,Has good prices and I continue to shop there. Made several friends I remain in contact with. As front register clerk was kept very busy and enjoyed the customer interaction. As a front register clerk in a busy store it was difficult for the time to train in other areas. I remain in touch with some managers and they were very good managers. They had several causes they supported and we promoted them during the course of our employment. The most difficult part of the job was the lack of hours. A typical day included checking with previous clerk as to any promotions and what the Managers expected of us. Greeting all the customers as they enter answer any questions about locations of product. Stocking specific areas and cleaning work area at end of shift for next clerk.
good,Nice and friendly staff. Very flexible hours. Job was only temporary. Would have like to work on a permanent part time basis.
good,I enjoyed working with other. i finish all my task before my shift was over with. the most enjoyable part of this job was interacting with customers. It really was no hard parts to the job honestly just stay busy and focused
good,"Work aside pharmacist and assist with patient prescriptions. Receive and fill prescriptions, handle cash register, etc."
good,It was a great retail job. They expected a lot from their employees from keeping an eye to potential shoplifters to selling candy called suggestive selling.
good,"The rate of pay was too low to live off of."
good,"Good structure, advancement is possible. Options on what to specialize in. Management can sometimes be hit and miss, but overall a decent company to work for"
good,"Typical day at work was very busy since it was 24 hrs and 365 days open. I have worked on all most all major holidays. I enjoyed everyday because it kept me busy. I learned a lot about sales, organization, and team work. Managers were great. we all worked as one team. Co-workers were very helpful. Hardest part of the job was to leave my co-workers and the most fun part of the job was to finish our task on time and serve our customer."
good,"I worked there when it was Bill's Elkhorn Drugs.  He sold the business, so I am not sure how it is to work for this company any longer."
good,"Good company to start with."
good,A typical day at work would be doing duplicate daily tasks and then following the list of tasks to work on throughout the day while paying attention to the customers and their needs.
good,I learned how to order balance books.plan displays.  Walgreens worked long hours late nights and weekend. a typical work day was unloading the truck and checking in the merchandise.  working out the merchandise.  closing out the register and balancing the registers at the end of the night.
good,"The job was a fairly easy one to learn. Quick paced and very busy a lot of the time. Unfortunately it seemed that my coworkers couldn't pick up their slack and the managers played favoritism. The way you were treated was not based on your experience or how good you were at your job, but on how ""fun"" you were.I was disrespected a lot and had personal information of mine discussed between my peers from my manager while I was dealing with some health issues. It's a great place to get from a tech in training to a certified tech, but I would recommend not staying there too long."
good,Being a pharmacy tech at Walgreens was exciting there never was a dull moment. A typical day at Walgreen begins with you getting straight to work. If they're aren't any patients you will begin with filling and entering prescription. As the day go on customers being to com and you will have to ring them up and explain what is going on with their prescriptions.  environment
good,I've learned many things while working here as well as developed many new skills as well as perfected old ones. Its a great experience for students looking for their first job.
good,fast pace work place. learned how to be a team mate and how to be a cashier. my coworkers where helpful and showed me how to do my job. the hard part about my job was working around my schooling but I enjoyed working with the customers
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the members on my team. I enjoyed the communication we had between us. As a collective unit with the other teams we could have been a closer unit to say the least.
good,"Strong company, however once in a while worked a double shift because of failure of incoming pharmacist. No fun going into work at 3 pm and getting off at 8 am the next morning.  Other than working sometimes with a skeleton staff money was great and atmosphere good.  Patients really appreciated the staff going the extra mile and I rarely heard complaints, unlike my other place of employment."
good,"I served Walgreens with almost 7 years of service. When I first started with the company things were oriented for the very best in patient outcomes. I have worked for them on 2 different occasions, and during the 1rst 5 years I believe that this was accomplished quite well. After returning for this last time, almost 80% of the pharmacy technician staff had been cut. Even those technicians who had been with the company 15 years and longer in some cases. This really affected customer service in a negative way. I believe now at the last pharmacy I worked at EVERY technician that was there, is now gone. The style of management too has become one such that people (especially management) do not get the respect they rightfully deserve. Overall, I would say as a pharmacy corporation, being bought out and merging has sent the company in just the opposite direction of GOOD patient care."
good,"It started out great, but they have started to cut back our budget hours, requiring the same tasks to be finished on the same timeline with fewer people available to accomplish those tasks. That has resulted in a lot of tired, discouraged coworkers and has had an overall negative effect on customer service and employee morale"
good,This is a very exciting time at Walgreens. There is significant growth with acquisition of Alliance Boots and soon to come Rite Aid.
good,walgreens is a great place o work. Coworkers and especially the customers make for a great work experience. Management is usually great but they change all the time and not always for the best for the workers.
good,"Most shifts are 8am-4pm or 2pm-10pm. As Beauty Advisor, you are responsible for greeting customers as soon as they come into your department, introduce yourself; ""I'm your beauty advisor today, what can I do to help you?"""
good,Its a great flexible first job. They work with your schedule and give you any days and times that you'd like to work. Only thing is being a cashier their standing for hours with no movement could be annoying and a downfall.
good,Walgreens gave me a great opportunity to gain work experience. I started as a cashier and quickly advanced to head photo specialist which is basically a mini supervisor for a small department. I enjoyed my job but unfortunately work and school would clash because of scheduling. overall it was a decent job for a first time employee.
good,"Walgreens Respiratory and Infusion Services is a great place to put your computer skills to work. There is room to improve on ones computer skill, as well as customer service skills."
good,"Stocking supplies on shelves, and checking out customers. Working there I learned how to cope with upset customers and how to help resolve the issue. The management was exceptional. The hardest part would be getting out late 10:30 or later then going home to do homework and then heading back to school the next morning, they were not flexible with school schedules. The most enjoyable was getting to meet new people and helping them."
good,"I started as an intern with Walgreens and the company, and the people I worked with will always hold a special place in my heart.  As with any company there were pros and cons, but overall I enjoyed my time there.  I chose to leave after we obtained custody of a child with severe behavior problems. His issues were such that I could not continue working and get and give him the help he needed."
good,Enjoyed the staff and the work place. Learned information about different situations and how to work them out. By working at walgreens you get to meet different customers and personalities. Also learning about insurance companies and how they work.
good,"For the most part the company isn't bad to work for. Only down fall is they have put a cap on all pay, they never close for Christmas and other major times of the year. What makes this place enjoyable to work for is the store employees. The down side it is hard to move up in the company. It is easier for someone on the out side to get a higher position than a existing employ."
good,"I wish that I still worked at Walgreen's. I enjoyed the type of work that I did there. Exceptional training at Walgreen's. "
good,"I would stock and straighten out merchandise, help customers find certain items, ring people out, and work at the photo lab as well. Where I would develop pictures for customers and create custom art projects for customers as well. This job help me extend my interpersonal customer service with people, it broke me more out of my shell. I was able to speak to random strangers not just in the work place, but outside of it as well. Management was pretty decent work along side with us on the floor or even when we had personal or in store issues. I loved every co-worker at Walgreens they became my family. Over the theft was the hardest part of the job, it was very infuriating and stressful. I really enjoyed helping people on a one on one basis it felt very satisfying."
good,Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. A Fun experience.
good,A typical day at work is you trying to get your work done and still take time out to cash out your customers.   Its hard sometimes especially when you have to ring up so much in sales and get your work for the day done.
good,"This was a good job to have, liked most of the people, nice place to work. Worked longed hours per day.  But very stable work flow thorough out the year."
good,"It was fun, you learn tons of social skills, great customer service and great management. great schedule and a fair amount of hour on seasons."
good,"Working at Walgreens was great. Management tried to schedule you the best they could around school or another job. The job was basic retail experience. Usually there were good people to work with. Some crazy customers, but who doesn't get that!"
good,"early is not too busy, close to afternoon is busy till 6, frequent visits from District managers (well appreciated, shows good & real attitudes ) i appreciate working there, eperience, and the people"
good,"Even though I was a seasonal team member at Walgreens, the manager at the time definitely taught me how NOT to manage a store team. I am glad to have had the experience I did at Walgreens because it also taught me how to constantly give 110%."
good,"It is nearly impossible to move up in this company. Working for this company is like working in with a bunch of High Schoolers. Although a lot of the staff is indeed in high school, the energy there is ok."
good,"Everyday you work there its a new experience, Rather its dealing with customers or just learning something new to better advance yourself."
good,Was great working with the customers and getting to know them on a first name basis.  I had a variety of obligations to do while I was there.
good,"Fun at times, but too many personal issues were brought to the workplace which caused conflicts. Just be mindful of your surroundings."
good,"worked overnight, which was tough. other than that, the management was great, employees were friendly and well mannered and so on."
good,I enjoy working and helping  people stay healthy.  The hardest part is the hours.  Its a corporation and as most corporations it is based on numbers and not as personal as a family organization.  Individuality is not always recognized.
good,"Great job!"
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work. the environment is welcoming; we, the employees, can go to management with questions and concerns."
good,"Fast pace, fun at times, management can be supportive at times. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I have a satisfied customer, i enjoy putting smiles on the customers face. My job consist of a lot of different task throughout my shift, and overwhelming at times. the company is very big,and i enjoy when I get a chance to help our sister stores when needed."
good,"A typical day at work is productive for my co-workers and management. I learned how to even further my customer service experience and how to further understand people from every different genres. I've also learned how to further my experience in problem solving, whether it's diffusing upsetting situations with customers and/or co-workers, or a physical problem The hardest part of the job was the drama surrounding my co-workers so i did everything in my power to stay away from it which I've successfully done. The most enjoyable parts of most job were the people, building relationships, learning many new things, and being able to help my company build in every way possible putting my best foot forward."
good,"Walgreens is a very good company to work for, a good company to set your roots in if one is interested in retail pharmacy. The company's culture is solid and is reflected clearly through most of the staff."
good,"Reasonable type of work, little internal promotions; some fun and not much new learning."
good,"A typical day was setting up my lab so that I was able to assist customers needs upon opening the store and working on multi projects also during that time."
good,Not enough advancement opportunities close to home. Easy work and flexible schedule a plus.Great benefit and profit sharing package.
good,This pharmacy is a great company to work for. A typical day of work consists of typing and counting prescriptions. Ringing up customers and answering phones. Assisting customers with the purchase of OTC items. The only bad part for me is the pay. Wish it was a little more so I don't have to work two jobs.
good,"I enjoyed working at Walgreens and worked with a good staff. I wanted to work in the pharmacy but didn't get any help in acquiring that. I assisted in the delivery of the warehouse items, cosmetics, stocking shelfs with merchandise, taking down and putting up tags, straightening and keeping appearance of store neat and orderly, cross selling items, and any other job that was asked of me. Also filling in for employees that weren't able to work was a very ongoing process. I was asked to do this alot, and always went to work to cover the missing employee when asked."
good,"Started with the 1st store to open and helped trained all new hires for all 3 stores plus Kilgore store. "
good,"Like most retail positions it is high stress and very challenging.  Time management is key to surviving, moreover being able to prioritize task and delegate are also important.  Compensation is good, but work/life balance suffers.  Depending on location, management varies to a degree. Like any big company there are always politics.  Co-workers are like family.  If you like patient contact this is the place to be.  Moreover, the company is always trying to be ahead of the curve so you will get to try new things before some of the other chains."
good,Days can often go from routine to chaos in an instant. Pay is nowhere near enough for workload. Has the potential to be a very hostile work environment if you cannot get along with coworkers.
good,"The opportunity to work alongside of colleagues that enjoy to pass their knowledge's to the students, and had the patience to teach and let one try what already learn, grow and develop a lot of new experiences."
good,"Good experience. Not much opportunity for advancement. Pay rate starts kind of low, especially for a person with experience. Coworkers are enjoyable."
good,The learning and implementation of phone techniques to assist clients with prescription information was thorough and well developed to make the job efficient and pleasant for the customer.
good,"management gave too many tasks to complete in available time, had to quit because school schedule conflicted with work schedule."
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work, but it lacks job security and Advancement opportunities. I love the hours that I work and the management team is very supportive."
good,"Fun and social environment with wonderful co-workers."
good,"Depending on the department your are working in and what day it is, there is always daily projects and work that needs to get done. You could be focusing more on sales that day: selling a particular amount of items, by using promotional and marketing tactics. Or your day could be more project oriented. Tasks like cleaning, giving other department workers their break, display making and maintaining, etc..."
good,"Walgreen's was a good first job, taught you the basic for most types of jobs. They have a good management core and nice, well liked employees. The have respectful customers and a great working enviroment."
good,"fun & easy place to work!! easy to get along with coworkers & managers. the hardest part of job was when i was working overnights, but then got accustomed to it! the most enjoyable part of the job was facing the aisles & warehouse! :)"
good,I have seen Walgreen's change though the years.  Some  changes have been for good and some for the bad. But all in all its a great company to work for. The employees are friendly and are willing to help you learn your rolls as an employee.
good,I learned how to communicate well with people and stay organized. I learned how to keep my workplace clean and how to display products in a well-organized way.
good,"Call insurance, fill prescriptions and talk with insurance daily. I learned the codes and federal regulations you have to follow while working there. I loved my management they were very flexible when my daughter started school. The co-workers what made the job enjoyable. The hardest part of my job when someone calls off during the first week of the month and the pharmacist and I have over 300 prescriptions to fill not including our other daily duties"
good,"This job is a great first job. There's not a whole lot of responsibilities and the hours are stable. However, don't expect to make more than minimum wage and don't expect to move up in any reasonable amount of time. The company also suffers from poor management."
good,Osco was a great company but the minute Albertsons took them over it went bad. They quickly became a shell of a company and were sold to CVS
good,"I enjoyed working the front register and interacting with the customers. I also liked working on solo projects; I enjoyed learning to do projects faster. I made good relations with all my peers as well as the customers themselves. "
good,"Overall, it is a great company to work for. My coworkers and managers are great people, which makes it easy to stay in your department longer than you should. With the current leadership changes, there are many cutbacks in departments i.e. people losing their job, alot of uncertainty. There are not many opportunities to grow because of the changes."
good,"You have to be willing to accept people of all ethnicities and all walks of life. A typical day at work would consist of customer service, stocking, and keeping things organized. This job has taught me how to be a more humble person and it has also taught me patience. The management can be fun to work with as long as you do what is expected of you. The hardest part of the job is getting attached to some of the regulars that come in (a lot of them are elderly) but that is also the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"A typical day is Prepare and dispense drug orders under the supervision of pharmacist according to established policies, procedures and protocols."
good,With the right management and workers in place it is a good place to work. Management can be too hands off and let too much go undone or let it fall on one person to do.
good,"As a Pharmacy Technician, we need to make sure that we make the Pharmacist's job as easy as possible so they can keep our patients safe and healthy. At the current Pharmacy that I work in, we take in and fill about 500 prescriptions a day. We need to verify patient's information to make sure each prescription is filled and type in the correct way and given to the right patient. We have to educate our patients on the medication that they are taking. Technicians and Pharmacist also follow up with patients to ensure that the patients is taking the medication correctly and to see if the patient has any questions. "
good,"Alright place to work. Not a lot of advancement and a lot of changes within the company. All in all if you need a pay check, it is a good place."
good,"I enjoy my job as a pharmacist technician. I enjoy helping my patients get, live, and stay well. I learned a lot form my pharmacist. I have only been a tech for a year and I'm still in the learning stage but with the help of my pharmacy manager I'm getting better and better each day."
good,"Working overnights at Walgreens was a good paying job if you like being up all night and could stay busy. You are expected to do a series of tasks by the end of the night including restocking tobacco and the front coolers. if the night manager needed help for any additional tasks, you were expected to add that to the list of things that you have to accomplish by the close of the work day. Stocking shelves  and keeping prices up to date with their weekly promotions was included in the job description."
good,I have no review for Walgreens since I was assigned as an intern. During the 100 hours that I was there I saw great teamwork and employees who truly cared about the customer and each other.
good,"Overall, great place to work. Good work life balance. Must be very detail oriented and able to multi-task on a daily basis."
good,"Very little dispensing of medications, mostly customer service and working in the drive-thru window.  I did not enjoy this position and found it tedious and stressful."
good,Working in Walgreens Pharmacy consisted of not very much variability in the job itself. We were charged with main duties such as customer service and filling prescriptions as well as other smaller duties everyday. I've learned very much about the medical field and how certain medications work and how they interact with each other. The management at the store was great but the corporate policies and changes were very harsh at times. My co-workers were all friendly and genuinely cared for the patients. The hardest part of my job consisted of working weekends with less staff. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the patients who had questions and ensuring their safety through our knowledge of how medications work and how to properly take the meds.
good,I have been with this company almost three years. Waiting for a better job opportunity at the company is difficult. They always expect to see good sales or hard work in employees to raise salary and if you're lucky a position. My co-workers are very friendly and I enjoy the group work. Management has been as good or as bad these years. The most enjoyable part of the job is watching the customer leave with a smile on their faces.
good,"The work is easy, it takes about a week to learn the routine. Photo deserves higher pay than cashiers, but everyone including cosmetics starts out at 7.50. It's nearly impossible to move up the ladder at my store, even if you're a great worker. You do still get paid-time off when you're part-time though."
good,When i started Walgreens in 2012 i loved my job and took great pride in it. i showed up to work on time and a bright smile on my face. Walgreens felt like a big family until management changed due to a death. After the death of the original store manager there was no longer trust in the company or integrity.
good,"I love talking and working with customers on a day to day basis."
good,Each day was a new and exciting experiene. I enjoyed interacting with the customers on a daily basis especially the seniors. Had the privillege of working with a great crew including management.
good,"They expect a lot out of you. In my position that can be very stressful when you're hourly trying to move up. If you can figure that out, you will do just fine in the company. Like any other job, it helps to be a bit socially savvy."
good,Good part time job with flexible hours. I learned a lot about dealing with people and helping customers. My co-workers ranged from teenagers to the elderly. Despite the age difference everyone gets along fine. There are many Walgreen and every staff is different.
good,nice place to work while in school or just starting out on your own you learn new things everyday and be informed about new meds
good,"The Experience at Walgreen to me was a lot of customer service. In a regular day I would interact with close to 100 customers a day. The job involved stocking shelves, making sure customer photos were done, and any other job the manager had for me."
good,A typical day at work it was very busy  but i still managed to finish my task. It was fun working around my co-workers. I learn to process films. Running from one department to another. Management was pretty cool.
good,"A typical day involved working with our patients/customers, dealing with insurance, filling prescriptions, managing inventory, and helping out my co-workers."
good,helping people with photo orders either in store or pictures sent on line. Regular customers with their humor makes the night go by faster. stocking and cleaning the store and making sure we provide the best customer service.
good,Its a laid back job and environment. I would recommend it to someone who is just trying to make a quick buck. A typical day involves constant human interaction. There are definitely rude people. But overall its a good job.
good,"The company expects a lot out of you. "
good,Work load wasn't tedious with the exception of having to perform duties the managers should have. Coworkers did their job and were easy to work with.
good,I really liked working for Walgreens. It helped me provide for my family and do things that I never thought I would have the chance to do.
good,worked in the stock room. load and unloading trucks when delivery day come. also packed out the show room floor. making sure everything was properly placed.
good,"I enjoyed working in the pharmacy, pretty fast pace, always work to do, I loved the environment, I definitely will be furthering my career in the Pharmacy"
good,"1) A day at work for me was 10PM-8AM. Until 2012, the only 24 hour pharmacy in a 45 mile radius with 8 ERs in a 30 mile radius. As the only accessible health care resource available, the calls came constantly regardless of where the prescription was filled. I averaged staying 45-60 minutes past my shift each day to accomplish expectations and assist the morning shift. "
good,This is probably the hardest job I've ever had but the staff and co-workers were the best group of people I have ever worked with in every level of management.
good,"I have worked at several different stores that are in the Walgreens community and I would have to say that everything when it comes to if you like a store varies with the store. I have had stores where it was near impossible to request a day off, even if it was  months in advance, because a fellow co-worker was doing the schedule and it just depended on if she felt like giving you that day off. On the other hand I have been at stores where they will just make sure that you get that day off and that nothing interferes with it. I have had caring managers, managers who could care less if they you were do do your job, and managers that you can never please. Like I said it all varies on the store that you get."
good,You learn how to provide excellent customer service to a small amount of customers (compared to major department stores) . Everyday is a fast-paced work day. The management is flexible with work and scheduling. You'll learn how to work in various departments and get your hands dirty in everything the company has to offer.
good,I love learning about medications and drug formulations. I loved my fellow co-workers working in a retail environment. Also working as a team with the pharmacy manager
good,Over the years lots of changes.  They have cut less than the rest.  Fair company with decent mgmt.  As most jobs it is what you make of it.
good,Overall job was part time. Pay was low and enjoyed working with customers and fellow employees. Enjoy working in retail.
good,"productive, motivational, and the fact of their will always be work tomorrow. The fact that Walgreens has plans to be around for some time in the future."
good,"I learned a lot. The people were very informative and helpful. Was very busy and the time went by quickly.  Filled a lot of perscriptions, learned a lot more about the different medications. The hardest part was knowing where to find the medications, but it got better as the time went on.  The best part was that everyone was very easy to work with and they didn't mind all the questions."
good,"Enjoyed working here.  Typical software developemnt position.  Design, code, test and do it over and over and over and over and over again."
good,"walgreens ins a nice company but there are too many guideline you have to know and follow. it does not let your team member think on there own. for a manager there is so many thing to do and so little time when you have to micro manage your manager and your team of employee. there are alot of different people who work at walgreens."
good,I learned that you should know the products you sell and if you don't have the information be swift about finding answers to costumer inquires or get the help they need from a manager.
good,co workers were to themselves busy work day learned a lot of their computer system management was nice super busy workload a lot of pharmacists good work flow good hours it was retail what more can I say... first job learned alot
good,I was in charge of beauty sales and service. I also did stocking and store ordering. I was in charge of cashing customers purchases out.
good,"good management, good co-workers, most enjoyable part of my is helping customer."
good,"A typical day at work brings new challenges: daily learning from our customers their needs and what we can do to improve ourselves to help  and assist in a caring way"
good,"The Co-Workers are great at assisting one another, its a very fast paced environment and safe, the benefits are great."
good,"overall good company, decent temporary job face paced which i didn't mind .. didn't care for mandatory overtime made it a little hard to plan after work time.  I wasn't there enough to evaluate their chances for advancement. I enjoyed most of my coworkers but like most warehouse jobs they had clicks newer versus senior employees etc. The management for the most part was nice and helpful"
good,"I love working with Walgreens. They treat me well for the most part, but occasionally they forget that we are humans with demands that need to be met. Things are occasionally inconsistent and the workload is unrealistic, but all things are tolerable."
good,Excellent place to work had no problems when i  was working here if i could i would go back and do it all over again
good,Great company to educate and participate in community health.
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work if you like to work hard and learn many new things along the way.  Depending on the store you work at, your day may be very busy and stressful, or easy and relaxing.  I've learned a lot working here and feel confident as a pharmacist, regardless of which store I'm at.  You don't have that much contact with upper management, unless things aren't running smoothly.  You will interact with many different employees while working for Walgreens, which is nice, because you make a lot of connections.  The hardest part of the job is balancing the demand of customers and providers, while continuing to provide excellent customer service.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people and knowing that each day will present a different challenge."
good,"Compensation could be better with the amount of work that is required and there is not much room for advancement. But, management is good and the people i work with is great. High volume."
good,"Excellent hiring initiative for people with disabilities."
good,I really my time here. Management treated you with respect. And job security was a big plus. I left because I wanted promotion and it was very difficult to get off of third shift at my location.
good,The interaction with the people everyday was a refreshing and a delight to my day. Being able to server customers face to face and recognize that you have solve their problem first hand.
good,"- Making sure every customer is being proactively assisted with whatever their needs may be"
good,"Walgreens can be a great place to work at. If you are a hard worker and are dedicated you can move up quite easily. I'm a Shift Lead on the overnight shift my duties mainly consist of stocking shelves, pulling product forward, resets/revision, clearance, assisting customers, and motivating my employees. I have learned at Walgreens and I love my job, but it has gotten hard to do all the physical work."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Walgreens. I liked my management team. It is a typical retail drugstore, but it was a good job with a lot of opportunity for hours."
good,We saw about 15 to 30 patients a day. Lots were for immunizations but some came for sick visits and physicals as well.
good,"A typical day at work depends on the day; I love that when we get to work there is already a plan laid out for us. They let us know what they expect for us to get done so there is never a question of well why wasn't this done. I have learned so much from Walgreen, from handling a cash register to moving on the pharmacy there is so much to gain from being there. I love the people that I work with for the most part we all get along and are always trying to help each other out not only in the work place, but personal life as well. The hardest and the best part of my job is the customers. There are days when I have the best people in the world come in and make my day. Then there are other day when no matter what you do you can't make the person happy. I just try to remember the wonderful customers that make it all worth it. I love what because I work with photo's peoples memories I have people who come in and laugh and tell me all about this photo like I'm apart of the family than there are times when I have to help people make photos for a death. I enjoying helping people above all."
good,the work flow at Walgreen's was very enjoyable i love the fact that you can always meet new people everyday and helping them find shopping items was always a plus because this allowed me to get to know the customer more and what they like to shop for when coming into the store.
good,cashier and sales helped customers gave advice checked them out happy friendly I had 100 % customer service from secret shoppers and walgreens
good,Nothing really stood out. Hard dealing with angry customers however it a great place to learn customer service skills. Also learning about retail and communication.
good,This has been one of my longest jobs. It is frustrating and fun at the same time. I will help the unruly customers and i also help some of the nicest people out there. The staff is some of my best friends in life. But then there are other who you question. All in all it is an ok company to work for.
good,The job was good. It was a good place to advance in the company. The management was rough but very good. The hardest part of the job was the people and the workers. The best part was the public and the locals that i had built a relationship with.
good,"Good place to work for getting a great deal of experience as a new grad, but a very high stress environment."
good,The manager was very flexible with scheduling and they always made sure there was someone covering you and that you weren't overwhelmed.
good,"Productive, workplace with a lot of friendly people whom became friends outside of the warehouse."
good,Walgreens was a good starting ground in learning how to manage other team members. There were many pros and cons to working here but I feel I learned a lot in the process.
good,The workplace always came together as a team. The hardest part about the job was being short staffed
good,"advancement was dictated, put product in carts and took carts from hold area to racks for next phase of order picking and shipping"
good,"A typical day at Walgreens consists of assisting customers. Our customers come first, including our trucks we receive and the tasks our manger assigns us. I get along with all of my co-workers, we are all like a big family. I have learned that multitasking takes a huge part of having a job and working well as a team really matters."
good,"The company has downsized areas in the Southeast. It has lost some business, however, it has good products."
good,I assisted customers with their transactions. I had a lot of cash handling experience.
good,Very easy job for those who want to work. Many hours available and the  co-workers are great.
good,"I worked as an intern at Walgreens the experience was great even though I did not get paid but the experience was good. I enjoyed working and learning, but afterwards it seem as though there are no jobs with in the company as pharmacy technician. The staff was excellent to work with and I enjoyed going to work every day."
good,The culture they teach and tell you about differs from what it actually is.
good,Certified Pharmacy Tech - Working with Doctors and Patients in refilling the Rx Scripts for customers. Cashier and working with the various insurance companies to make sure the customer was covered under their plans. Ordering and Restocking of Medications as needed. Making sure all expired medications were disposed of properly.
good,"A typical day at Walgreen's would generally consist of product verification, inventory management, and discussion and evaluation of patient therapy. I took a particularly strong liking to counselling patients and discussing in detail their drug therapy. Walgreen's also offered free blood pressure monitoring and blood sugar monitoring and this was something that I was passionate about promoting. My co-workers were generally very friendly and productive. Management was often very supportive of me whenever I had an issue or problem that I couldn't resolve. The hardest part of my job was handling high prescription volumes with limited assistance from my staff. However what was most rewarding was the look of genuine relief and happiness on the face of each customer that I counselled."
good,"Great company, mediocre location management.  Location management oversight lacking.  Great work environment."
good,"Cashier duties, stocked shelves, put products on display, and assisted customers. I learned how much customers appreciate your help. My managers were very kind and were happy to assist me with any questions. My co-workers were very nice and I trained subordinates who worked under me. The hardest part of the job was to work back to back shifts when a co-worker would call in sick. The most enjoyable part of the job was the peaceful environment that I worked under."
good,It was a cool experience. Managers were very helpful. Customers were mostly friendly.
good,The company is a great one to work for. Not all stores are the same.
good,"Walgreens is a wonderful company with great benifets. Unfortunately they work on budget hour and at any point you could go from working 40 hours a week to 30 hours to having no job, and I am looking to start a family and can't have the uncertainty of losing my hours or job."
good,I did not care for the lack of communication at this job. I had a hard time learning without proper training. I did like learning about photography and how we develop it. I did find it very fun and interesting as a job.
good,"A typical day at work was very steady.  You sit at your desk, you answer inbound/outbound calls and emails from employees at Walgreen's stores around the country.  "
good,"	Take Incoming calls on new patient admission."
good,Good company to work for but there is alot going on and i guess it depends on the store but some managers still act like hourly employees and don't wanna act like managers. But overall good company to work for. Slightly easy to move up in which is always good.
good,"Greeting arriving guests to the stores, ensuring accurate cash transactions. Facing store shelves, lifting merchandise and managing store cleanliness was all in a days work. Ensuring my coworkers managed daily tasks in a timely fashion, was one of the most challenging areas of my work day. The most rewarding would be knowing that I provided the best customer service to every store guest with a smile."
good,ok looking for something better googd co worker good staff jst need a better opputunity in another company
good,"There are a lot of aspects to the job and it all depends on your location. There is a high emphasis on customer service, what you say and how you say it, is always a factor. A typical day revolves around making sales, maintaining your department and assisting customers"
good,"I like working mornings because my shift ends late in the day and I can still go do things I want to do after work. Management there is good, they make sure to take care of customers that need help beyond my assistance. Co-workers are easy to get along with and we work together very well. The hardest part of the job is maintaining all the items in the store clean and put away well. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and seeing new faces that make my day better."
good,"Walgreens is a good company, although I think it could be improved in many ways. I'd recommend it to any part-time seekers out there -- college students, I'm looking at you -- and there's a life/work balance, too. Hours are plentiful, and there isn't a high turnover rate."
good,"A typical day at Osco working as a receiving clerk consisted of checking in vendors, counting product and filling invoices as well as unloading the weekly warehouse deliveries. I learned how to receive vendors and file invoices as well as how to check for any discrepancies on the invoices. The management was very good they always made sure I was handling everything okay. I liked all my co-workers they made the work environment very friendly. The hardest part of my job was being able to check in multiple vendors at the same time. The best part of the job was knowing that my work was integral to keeping the store inventory correct."
good,"Working at Walgreens over the last 15 years, I have made many strong relationships with my coworkers.  It is truly a family environment where everyone gets along wonderfully and sticks together when things get rough.  We are effective throughout the work day but never forget to laugh, have fun, and help each other through the hard times.  We are an extremely busy, 24-hour location and some days do not stop working from the beginning of our shift until we go home."
good,"Definitely one of the funnest jobs I've had. After closing time everyone gets a chance to chat while we clean up our sections, we help each other out and a lot of us would go out afterwork to see movies. I still have friends from best buy even 10 years later. Black Friday sucks when you have to be at work at 4 am and had to stay late the night before to prepare for everything, but it brings people together. A lot of team meetings with games and challenges with prizes. Two coworkers in the same department made a bet that the other could sell more TVs during the month of December, and the loser would have to shave his head. Everyone gathered around to watch the loser face the clippers! I have a lot of great stories from Best Buy."
good,Hardest part of the job was that management reduced hours a week and our income was low.
good,"A very fast pace enviroment, in which it can be very stressful at times, dealing with different type of customers, but always focusing on offering extraordinary customer service."
good,were more just a stat or a number for the company then a real person no type of compensation for anything as far as incentives or goal achievement I love the management I have at my store but as a whole in the district their are some sore thumbs that don't meet the standards to be at their position but I'm not the district manager to speak on this subject in this matter however if there wasn't a  required score to be a manager then I would be already promoted due to my managers agreed I'm ready for more responsibility and decision making
good,"A typical day would start with walking the store, writing store notes and delegating them out."
good,Only thing to look forward to was termination at this location
good,"- greeted customers and checked them out at the register"
good,Good place to work. All of the managers are usually very nice and understanding. It is a good interim job or place to make some extra income. If you are looking to make decent money and get benefits it may not be the place for you though.
good,"The hardest pat of the job was the demanding number of hours. "
good,"Good company, great bonus and stock opportunities. Major organizational and management changes occurring."
good,"Working with Walgreens everyday was different. I had a primary spot for the day depending on what time I arrived.  I enjoy every part of my job, customers, co-workers and management.  I always was ready to start my day and hated leaving at the end of my shift.  I really enjoy meeting so many different people throughout the day and having the chance to just talk with them for even just a moment and make sure they had everything they needed and knew they could call no matter the question or problem.  I must admit the hardest part of the job wasn't upset customers when something didn't go as they wanted but, was having enough time in the day to do they extra little stuff.  Some days when you clocked in and arrived in the pharmacy it was no stop until you went home so those little extra things you try to do to help out another technician or for the next day don't always get done but, to me, as long as my customers where happy I was happy"
good,Fast paced working environment with line coaches always on hand ready to help. Co-workers are like second family to most of us. The only concern I have is management has to cut hours daily so we only get at least 35 hours per week. Benefits are great and management has an open door policy.
good,I typical day at Walgreens would be to ring up a customers purchases as well as to help them find certain items in the store. I also interact with my co-workers to make sure that the customers have the best experience possible.  The hardest part of the job is learning how to deal with all types of people. The most enjoyable part of the job is making a customer happy with the service you have provided.
good,"All Walgreen's pharmacy's are almost identical in their set-up, procedures, and day-to-day duties. It is therefore easy, once acclimated, to pick up extra shifts at other Walgreen's pharmacies. In a typical day, one will alternate between taking customers at the front and/or drive-through counters, filling prescriptions, and taking phone calls. There are well-established opening, mid-shift, and closing duties in order to keep the pharmacy running smoothly. There may be different levels of employees, and widely different compensations between techs, pharmacists and managers, but the overall feel is one of a team. At the end of the day, the most important thing to all team members is the well-being of the patients and all members work together towards that end. The hardest part fo the job is keeping up with ever-growing number of responsibilities and duties as a tech. However, mastering these responsibilities/duties builds confidence and brings a sense of pride in knowing that you can take whatever is thrown at you. This is a relatively well-paying job, and an excellent opportunity for those interested in eventually becoming pharmacists."
good,"While most days go without incident, I have regularly been insulted by either my store manager or executive assistant manager. I have been asked ""why are you talking?"", I've been told ""wow you suck"", and been called ""white girl"". The hardest part of the job is dreading interacting with the two people who run the store. The best part is being able to maintain my own little corner of the store."
good,My recent experience working for Walgreens Medicare Part B  was great. The Management Team was great and the employees were friendly and kind. To bad they lost their contract and was forced to close because my job had to end.
good,Work experience is very dependent on the store and who you work with.
good,"Full time personnel get benefits and from what I read, they seem good. Pay is whatever the minimum wage is for most employees. The managers get more and so do the Pharmacists. They require you to work one weekend day a week and either Christmas or Thanksgiving day but not both. You get paid time and a half on the holidays. You get a half hour lunch and two 15 minute breaks a day. At the locations I worked, they tried not to give people overtime but things happen and you may have to. I only worked over time twice out of the 3.5 years I was there. If you can survive off of minimum wage and stand for eight hours then I'd say give them a try. At one location I worked at, the managers weren't very happy about me leaving my station to show customers exactly where the product they needed was. Customer service really just depends on the employees and if they are happy at what they are doing for a living."
good,some days it can get really boring. walgreens is a slow work environment but often its all about the c workers if they are jovial then you will enjoy. management is not that bad either from what i experienced.
good,"The customers and most of my fellow employees during the 7 years I was there is my most positive and memorable experience about working there. I became true and real friends with a few of my customers and fellow workers as a result of working there. "
good,"Walgreens is a great first job because they have restructure the corporation that does not promote job loyalty.  Previously, I worked for Walgreens were you were known your name now, you are just an employee numbers.  I believe most of it is a result of the changing economy but it does not promote employee/employer loyalty or a sense a work ethic into today's workforce. Don't get me wrong - Walgreens was the perfect job situation for my changing situation but it was never a career for me.  This is only my opinion."
good,My typical day can consist of opening or closing the store change order receiving venders doing refunds and exchanges dealing with unhappy customers I have learned to be patient and listen to co-workers or customers to really understand what their needs may be and help them find a happy point. My co-workers are great and we treat each other like family. Hardest part of my job is closing store we are open to midnight and sometimes we have to turn around and open the store the next day at 7:30am also no lunch break. Love dealing with my regular customers and helping the new ones out and help them become not just the one time customer but my lifetime customer.
good,"In the 20 years at Walgreens, I  have learned how to operate a fork truck, a reach truck, an order picker, a turret truck, and a double/single transporter.  I get along well with my co workers, and would help any of them it needed.   I also show respect to my supervisors.  I always try to be a team player."
good,"Support daily business operations, sales activities, develop merchandising strategies and create in-house marketing strategies to support corporate goals and drive sales with the local demographic. Operational responsibility includes ordering, loss prevention, cash management, inventory control, scheduling, and strict budget/labor hour tracking. As a staff leader, delegate workload among employees, ensure accuracy in transactions and serve as the primary trainer and contact for merchandising implementation."
good,I work with people that are nice and enjoy life and having fun. They are open to teach me every position in the store. Walgreens as a whole is very interactive with their communities.
good,"As a photo technician, I had to print customer orders sent through internet and in- store kiosk. Besides, filling the outs, stocking, merchandising the shelves was part of the job. Any person who works for Walgreens definitely will learn how to multi-task and how to treat the customers well so that they leave the store satisfied. The management however varies from stores to stores as the expectation differs from one manager with the next. Majority of the coworkers are friendlier. The hardest part of the job was to deal with angry customers and sometimes angry managers. The most enjoyable part is the employee discounts and flexible schedule."
good,leadership skills and ability to work independently and with store and district management.
good,worked for over 14 years when I didn't plan on staying for 5. If you can stay above the normal workplace drama its a decent place to work. pay could be a lot better especially when you have experience or schooling. being linked by satellite is a great feature to work with. state of the art in pharmacy in safety. lots of turnover but its retail so not a surprise.
good,"I enjoyed the customer interactions which built valuable relationships. Being able to help people with any of their difficulties was a priority.  I was able to complete all of my daily tasks given a ""work flow"" theme to follow.  At times the day could prove difficult due the time constraints in getting the volume under control.  The best part of the day was being able to learn something new everyday no matter how insignificant it matters to learn something."
good,"A typical day a work would be somewhat productive yet comfortable and almost as hectic as I could imagine for the type of store it is. Working here I've learned how to approach people in need of help and further assist them in their period of slight confusion and doubt. I've learned how important it is to keep a proper, clean and organized work environment and how to achieve outstanding customer service and satisfaction skills. The most enjoyable part of my job would have to be the bright work environment and my head-strung co-workers."
good,"At this  I was responsible for prescription data entry, phone management, stock ordering, filling medications, and selling final medication to customer. My store was one of the busiest in the district. Our store manager was an incredible person and great manager. My coworkers were the best I have ever worked with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with so many rude customers. The most enjoyable was our staff."
good,"Very family, homie orientated store. Their number one goal is customer service first. which I can say most employees who work at Walgreens try their best to fulfill that goal of the stores customer service."
good,the harder you work the more it pays off in the end. The more people one meet the more contacts he/she has to move on to a future career.
good,I start my day by checking inventory and sales goals. I learned that retail management is not as difficult as people make it. the hardest part of any job is basically the same. (people). I ENJOY DEALING WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF PEOPLE
good,Challenging in terms of co-ordinating among such a large group of people for Enterprise Service support
good,My typical day at work is to walk in and no matter what have a positive outlook on what my day will bring. I go into to the pharmacy and start my daily check off list. Such as doing my daily count of certain medications. Also I put away our daily warehouse shipment that we receive in the mornings. Then I proceed to help customers in fillings prescriptions and helping customers to the best of my ability. I have gained a lot of knowledge from my position and I am learning more and more each day. I was promoted from the sales floor to the pharmacy in less then 2 months. The management at my work place are a pleasure to work with. My co-workers are also a pleasure to work with and if I have any questions or concerns I can go to them and they are more then willing to help me and vice versa. The hardest part of my job is to keep up with the changes in our health care system and to be up to date on all new information. The most enjoyable part of my job is to be able to on a daily basis help our customers be happy and healthy.
good,Process of filling prescriptions. I learned the process of filling prescriptions and how to multitask while working.
good,"Even though I was a student, the pharmacy staff made me feel like I was apart of their team."
good,"A typical day included managing a retail store's sales, profit, shrink control, and employees.  During my career with Walgreen's I learned how to do all the things in the previous statement.  I worked with several different managers over the course of my career and was able to learn a lot of different things.  The company provided a great environment to learn at my own pace and own desire level.  They gave me numerous opportunities in stores at different locations dealing with different clientel and employees.  The hardest part of my job was pharmacy operations verses front end operations.  I was very intimidated by the pharmacy operations, but with the training and encouragement of my pharmacy manager and his staff I was able to work thru the challenges and help improve the pharmacy business.  The most enjoyable part of my job was my paying customers and my employees.  Many of my employees were longterm with me.  I enjoyed working with them, growing and coaching them into exceptional customer service providers.  I also enjoyed that I was included in their lives as the grew into relationships, promotions, after college accomplishments and children.  When my customers' would tell me that ""this is my Walgreen's and I will not shop anywhere else"", that was by far the most rewarding part of the job."
good,"This place was very busy at all times. It was short staffed, so it made the work place stressful. I still would recommend this job to anyone who has a passion for this field of work."
good,"I worked for the company for twelve years. Started as a Stock Person, Service Clerk, Photo Specialist, Pharmacy Technician. There is definitely room for advancement. Back when I started management worked around your schedule, and switching shifts with coworkers was a breeze. Now schedule is strictly made to fit the store and pharmacy needs with no consideration to employee. They seem to only want full timers.  "
good,"Each day I come in I'm required to fill in empty spots from the cooler and food aisle."
good,"I bounced around from store to store a lot because I was an assistant manager, so every store was a little different in terms of customers, but the procedures were almost always the same.  Most of the people I worked with, I enjoyed."
good,It was an okay job for what they paid. You never knew what kind of person you were going to encounter from day to day.
good,it was fun while it lasted because ive learned that you always have to work hard
good,"A typical day at work is being at a single station packing and shipping medicine."
good,"Working at Walgreens has expanded my career greatly. After working with many different bosses, I have learned quite a bit in the world of customer service, which is was Walgreens focuses on the most. They help promote an advancing market with the Pharmacy, as well as convenience retail."
good,"full time job"
good,"Customers are great. The work load is heavy and fast paced, but its all about the customer."
good,"Typically, each day starts with a system of cleaning and restocking, at the same time a service clerk helps customers find items and rings them up. Depending on which night it is, the service clerk will be responsible for cleaning the floors throughout the store, unloading stock from trucks, checking in vendors, and organizing the store. Management is organized but unwelcoming, encouragement and compliments are not common for work.  The hardest park of this job is that it is physically demanding, if you have back or arm problems, you may have difficulties with this. Also, if you work graveyard shifts you will encounter many people who are unfriendly or intoxicated. The great thing about this job is that there is always more to learn, every day you will learn something new."
good,"Its a busy and fast peace store with multi tasking activities. My job involves managing member of the staff and assist store manager to execute operational task including but not limited to employee training, customer service, financial and non-financial responsibilities etc."
good,"Comfortable place to work "
good,If you work hard there is room for advancement.Not a lot more to add.
good,"expect to work hard, and be compensated for your efforts. The hardest part of the day is juggling the many tasks we juggle as retail pharmacists. The best part is interacting with patients and touching lives.  "
good,"Very corporate, but you can advance if you're in the right place at the right time."
good,Good intelligent management. Good service and product to their customers. They have way too much product to keep up with and take good care of their customers. I have some great fellow employees there and even more so patients. I have learned a lot of compassion and how to really listen to the needs of patients. I have always had a great care of people
good,"Good intelligent management.  Good service and product to their customers. They have way too much product to keep up with and take good care of their customers. I have some great fellow employees there and even more so patients.  I have learned a lot of compassion and how to really listen to the needs of patients.  I have always had a great care of people, but you really have to love people to work in a retail pharmacy.  We do a total of about 500 scripts a day in our pharmacy and it can get very stressful.  I have learned how to deal with that  a lot."
good,I worked overnights as a cashier and pretty much me and a manager on duty were responsible for organizing the store if it was necessary. Otherwise we faced the store and made sure the merchandise was full. 
good,"hardest part of the job is not being to help coworkers to achieve a task"
good,"Walgreens is a good company to work for. However, there are a lot of politics and favoritisms. The hours are good, however they do not allow for overtime. There isn't any real room for promotion. There are always hours being cut yet they keep hiring more people and that leaves everyone that isn't full time begging for hours. "
good,My experience was good at Walgreen's. I left the company when I moved from St. Louis to Kansas City.
good,"A typical day would be assisting customers in their purchasing needs and providing speedy check-outs. I've learned not every customer is reasonable. My co-workers are friendly, fun and enjoyable. The most enjoyable part of the job are the special sales during the holiday season."
good,"Usually work a 8 hour shift, My work varied threw out the day. Nothing is hard to do. Have had a few difficult customers but what job you wont have that now and a gain. I love my store manager and the rest of the managers I work with. The hole team is like a family. "
good,just like any job out there. some are good and some are bad. its all about how you view the job.
good,manage money customer service build work lists train new associates merchandise products build team work.hardest part of this job has been the constant change most enjoyable part is teaching other enployee things they dont know and building teamwork.
good,Great job to have while in school. The company is very flexible. This company is great for building strong communication skills and leader ship skills. 
good,"I like working at Walgreen, I get along with my co-workers and I know how to my job very well however I am looking for a new job in the career I want to go into."
good,"customer service, photo specialist"
good,"Excellent entry level job, which gives you the ability to run a store at a young age"
good,Some very smart people work at Walgreens and you can learn a great deal.
good,"Cashiering and maintaining the shelves and isles for guests enjoyment. The hardest part of the job is the poor salary. I absolutely love what I do however salary makes it hard to live on. The best part of job is the customers, they always make me laugh and smile."
good,This is a great place to work and advance if you would like to have a career versus a job. Management is always available when needed.
good,"Walgreens is a very interesting place to work, i had the opportunity to learn a lot of things specially how to interact with people. Had also to manage so many different things as stocking the shelves, doing counts, reports inventories its a whole process were is needs to get done everyday. I also had the opportunity to work with such a nice people were we work as a team to get everything done. Be able to communicate and interact with my coworkers and costumer was a very nice. During my six years in Walgreen the hardest part to do was to lift box besides that i really enjoy myself working there be able to learn things everything and to improve my costumer services it was very helpful."
good,"Management isn't as productive and helpful, hours are being cut which puts technicians in a bad spot, and Walgreens and Corporate do not really care about their employees."
good,"A typical day would consist of many items as it pertains to retail management. This included but isn't limited to staff management, stocking shelves, returns, refunds, store cleanliness etc."
good,It is a very interesting place to work with inspired co-workers and reasonable managers. I learned how to handle the cash register and how to make the store look presentable and the most enjoyable part of working there was making the customers happy by providing excellent customer service.
good,"Everyday working at Walgreens was a mistery. Everyday was a different one, new challenges and customers. I loved the ""regulars"". The customers who came in pretty much everyday for their maintence medication. They were the highlight of my time with Walgreens. The people I worked with were all very different and unique. We all had a great time together and balanced eachother. Difficulties that arose at the workplace would definately be not enough hours for technicians. It's hard to be accurate and fast when there is only one or two techs and one pharmacist, and your one of the only 24 hour pharmacy with 3 major medi-clinics and 5 hospitals within a 15 mile radius. Regardless of the hours I still made every moment count, I met amazing people that I will know the rest of my life. The lessons I have learned at Walgreens have made me a better techician and person."
good,My days at Walgreens went very fast. There was a lot of work to do so you stayed busy. I had very good pharmacists that pitched in to help out also. Although majority of the technicians were students they all worked very hard when they could actually come in.
good,Coworkers that wanted to help you succeed and learn the business to increase revenue at the store.
good,"Walgreens was a great place to work. Great technological tools to assist with pharmacy practice. The hardest part of the job was that, in my opinion, Walgreens did not provide enough supportive personnel."
good,Walgreens is an amazing company to work for. Other employees are very friendly and when you go to work you feel happy to be in the environment with kind people.
good,Very fun interesting job with wonderful people to work with.
good,"Normally open the store wait on customers, have to make sales for my department. I learned how to become a better salesperson. Everybody that works there is very friendly and out going. Management is really nice and are willing to work with your schedule. The job isn't really hard. The enjoyable part is working with the people that I do."
good,Work was fine it starts off pretty easy but can quickly become very stressful when the lines start getting big.
good,"I liked the job I did there very easy, not stressful at all, Overtime was offered every Monday."
good,"Walgreens should be any person's first place if they desire to become a pharmacy technician. They had classes and pay for you to be certified. There were a few problems I had with walgreens. Certain locations in my area were really busy, and needed ""more hands on deck"". However, like most corporate companies, they did not want to allow more hours so that there was more help on the floor, which meant longer wait times, a lot of unhappy patients, and frustrated employees. The great thing about walgreens was the pay for being a technician and the raises. They were the best. Like most corporate businesses, walgreens need to also remember and consider their employees. If it weren't for them, the company would not exist."
good,"A typical day at walgreens is to make sure you are able to multitask and at the same time put a smile on your face; its busy from when you walk in the door til you walk out the door. I learned about different medications, how to bill insurance companies for co-pays, and filling perscriptions. The management was understanding with my school schedule, and I felt very comforable to be able to bring any problems or concerns that I had within or without the company; yet the co-workers were very kind hearted. The hardest part of the job was quitting, and on the other hand the most enjoyable part was my on hand learning within the company, knowing that I will take the information that I learned anywhere I go."
good,I worked for this company twice. Originally started as bookkeeper and then Asst. Manager then moved to Ohio and took what was here which was basically a cashier position then got Head Photo mgr. You have to be a multi tasker to work here. They always are short of help and you must be 5 places at once.
good,promised full time work and yet one day a week... was always on register even though i was certified .... yet we were suppose to switch off other Walgreen store did as suppose to
good,"I usually come to work, clock in, then get right on the register to relieve the person who is there at the time. When I am free of customers, I use that time to clean around the front and straighten up areas that seem out of order. I have learned that great customer service goes a long way. My co-workers were awesome! They stayed upbeat for most of the day. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who try to get over on you. They could be really convincing and that is where taking your time comes in. The most enjoyable part was when I was able to make someones day especially when they've had a stressful one."
good,"On a typical day my pharmacy is pretty busy. Most of our customers are not happy and kind of testy, so the most important thing I've learned is how to work with the customers on a more personal level so that they feel more comfortable using us as their primary pharmacy. Because if you have no customers you have no business. My management at my store is kind of unstable. I've had 4 pharmacy managers in the past 5½ years. I love my coworkers. we learn from each other and support one another. The hardest part of my job is knowing that you can't satisfy every customer but trying anyway!! The most enjoyable part of my job is at the end of my shift when I go through my checklist to find that I've had a pretty productive day. I love getting things done."
good,I did only a little in this area because I could not ring anyone out. What I could do I did the best of my ability. Filling prescriptions and handling controlled substances I did with extra care. I followed the procedures I learned in school to try and keep the school's reputation in high spirits with Walgreens' staff. The technicians and most of the pharmacists were nice. At the end I was compared to the technicians that were grandfathered in and has senior experience. I enjoyed filling and compounding the prescriptions.
good,"The hardest part of the job is the schedule. It requires you to be very flexible. Sometimes, these schedule demands become unreasonable."
good,Walgreens IT department allows one a good opportunity to work with cutting edge technology but is unfortunately opting to now outsource their IT roles to India.
good,"is very hurried. walgreens is getting to the point they want thier employees to become salesmen. trying to promote more ""benefits"" to the customer than offering customer service."
good,"When I was in High School, it was a good job to have. Not so much when you are in management"
good,"A typical day cosists of sales, merchandising and customer service. I learned to always strive to be your best and to never stop at no. Management and co-workers are like life to me, they are what you make of it. The hardest part of the job is when you have an unhappy customer and the most enjoyable is when you have the knowledge to make them happy."
good,"Great company, very diverse, interesting marketing plans"
good,I enjoyed my externship with this company being the fact that the location I worked at was very busy for the most part. There was always something that needed to be done. Very Fast paste when the rush arrived.
good,"Working at Walgreens Pharmacy, you have to be able to do two things at once; from answering phones, helping customers with their insurance problems, filling the prescription, and being able to do it all with a smile."
good,"my review on my job is enjoy all my custmers, without my custmers it will be just work. The custmers put an great smile on my face i will go miles for them if i dont have something in the strore that they need i will try to find the item in another walgreens or online. work is an team in at times it doesnt feel like that but at longs as u can get alone wit everyone and make work postive it can make your job fun, great envoirment."
good,"A typical day at work is constanly Providing Good customer service, and providing customers with answers they need. I learned from being there that no matter how slow it can get always remain productive. Management is very Professional and maintain excellence values and goals to keep store under good conditions. My co-workers are always there to support each others in a positive way. We work as a team so that our customers feel comforable around us. There really is'nt a hard part about doing my job. Everything is steady and on-going. I mostly enjoy the time i spend helping my customers find what they need so they can feel complete and joyment after existing our store."
good,"I loved this job, GREAT PAY!!! GREAT BENEFITS!!! I only left due to a back injury =( Otherwise I would have stayed. I love the Admin dept. Inventory, warehousing....all of it!!"
good,"I worked here for about 2 months as an intern. I counted pills, and filled prescriptions as needed. Management was very nice and patient when addressing my many questions about the job. I enjoyed learning new skills and gaining pharmacy experience."
good,Good experience in a wide range of IT. Only issue with the position is that all advancement opportunity's are in Chicago.
good,"Hardest part of the job is managing past education--high school dropouts to MBA's and Doctors, and they all know more than you in one area or another"
good,Its okay every job has its up and downs but you can advance quickly
good,"As a teen who was a cosmetic queen, working as a beauty adviser was a dream.( Didn't mean to get all poetic)"
good,"we would answer all the phone calls for the patients calling into walgreens in Florida, Arizona, Illinois, Indiana, and many more. I learned alot about the pharmacy industry and how much work that can really go into filling a prescription. There was a great group of people who i worked with who helped me out and who were caring individuals not because they had to be nice but because they wanted to be. The supervisors who i worked with were amazing. They actually cared about the people on their team and would help you out any way they could. They gave great feedback every week so you knew what was going on and so you knew that you were on track with things. The most enjoyable part of the job was comming into work knowing i had a great group of friends who i would spend the next 8 hours with who would make the day go by even faster, and also being able to deal with patients and help them to feel better about getting their medications or just being that one person to put a smile on their face that they may have needed that day."
good,I took this job wondering if it might be a career path I might like. It really was not. I learned a lot about handleing sick people while I was there and that they want their medications now and I had to explain to them there is a process. I got very close to some of those people. While inputting the most private of their information into the computer and giving them a dose of compassion.
good,"Walgreen's is very dedicated to customer service, unfortunatly that dedication at times can cause low moral with the staff."
good,"A typical day at work would be scanning merchandise that was returned, expired, or returned to get store credit. Places items in boxes to put on conveyor belt to next department."
good,"Co-workers were friendly, pharmacists were wonderful and very personable, and my boss was great about working around my busy schedule. The only downside was that tech hours were always being cut back."
good,"Okay company to work for, but doesn't listen to employee ideas that often."
good,"its a normal day to me almost evertime i work , i say this because i make it a game when i working, some days it can be hard to focus when we are getting swap, never the less i wouldnt say thats the hardest part of the my workplace except when it comes to dealing with insurance companys or computer issues.i really say i love the teamwork that my team have when it comes to church time, the management is great prolly because they are great people inside but as most of the time when the time comes when its time to leave for that day, i can honestly say i learn something new ever day weather it be new drug sig, meds, and a whole new way of style i love every bit of it."
good,"I walk in an set up the day, find out any issues from previous day and start resolving them."
good,"Good supervisor's, good customers, learned to be a beauty advisor and things about retail, 10 hour shifts were rough due to standing all the time, liked my co workers"
good,The hardest part of the job is being advised by individuals and management that are not qualified for certain positions.
good,"A typical day at work could consist of being on register, providing assistance to customers, stocking shelves, and other duties necessary to provide great customer service. I learned how vital patience can be, as well as how to multitask on a regular basis. Management was helpful to not only customers, but also to employees."
good,"Provided face to face customer services. Took inboud and made out bound calls to Doctors, patients, and insureance companies."
good,"I worked a typical 8 hour shift and learned how to use pallet jacks and a host of other skills while employed at Walgreens working with management for direction on other job duties that were required for me or if they needed me for other job assignments i worked comfortably along with my co-workers, I have enjoyed working with Walgreens during the duration of my time with the company prior to my lay off."
good,"nice environment to work, friendly staff and co-workers; great customers and wonderful hours"
good,"Standard place, with the ability to move up. The managers will gladly teach you every position in the store if you are willing to learn. Excellent management."
good,"Very good company to work for with very little ""negative"" items to state."
good,Everyday was different as with any job there are several challenges. I learned more about customer service and taking care of the customer on a more personal basis. This was my first job where I was not the store manager I learned from some and some I wished could have learned from my experience. I had great co-workers we work together to get the job done as with any job you had strong members then we had weaker ones which made your job harder at times. The hardest part of this job was the hours working late then having to be back very early and never knowing your schedule enough in advance for family time and the transfer between stores. The most enjoyable part of this job was our customers when you could remain in the same location long enough you got to know them on a more personal level which made customer service much easier.
good,"Walgreens has paid me well, started at about 14 and ended up at 20, which for a college student is great to lavish my lifestyle. Dealing with customers sucks, but if you have an good attitude you can make anything fun."
good,"After changes, advancement in the company is harder than before."
good,Great place to make it a career but some polycys are bit harsh//
good,The only reason I even consider leaving walgreens is due to recent hour cuts and being in a small town there is no room for advancement.
good,I started out working on the floor so that I may have a chance to go to the pharmacy. I didn't like the stock work but it was worth it to get the chance to go to the pharmacy.
good,Working at Walgreens has really taught me a lot about customer service and retail management. I like working with people and this is an amazing place to do so.
good,Pharmacy Technician for 3 years and we were previously a Rite Aid Pharmacy. The transition has been a very difficult one for us but we're slowly still adapting and learning as well.
good,"Everyone is friendly and working together to get the job done. Customers come first, as they should...and most of the customers are great and care about us as much as we care about them."
good,Walgreens provides a good place for pharmacy interns to learn about retail pharmacy and develop skills in customer communication and multitasking in a fast paced environment.
good,"I have been here for 5 years and have been promoted several times. There is a lot of room for advancement. However, if you have a disability and require accommodations, they are not easy to work with."
good,"really trying to find a better paying job and that will give me the hours I am looking for, and looking for a place to grow and progress. I been at walgreens for a while I think it is time for something new."
good,I needed something flexible and steady and that is what I got. Lots of variety in the work. Learned new things. Enjoyed my coworkers. Had room for advancement.
good,"Busy location but was always able to learn something new"
good,Great culture and team members. I leaned a lot as a Pharmacy Technician and definitely enjoyed my time there. The pay wasn’t so great as this was a few years ago but it must be better now.
good,The reward and work were proportional. Management had tied hands and lacked support from upper management but they were supportive of the Field Services group and did all they could to make your job easier.
good,Enjoy being an cashier because I get to help the customers and meet new people all the time. I get to learn new things everyday and learn the store when I am on the floor.
good,"Wallgreens is your run of the mill retail job, you work a set shift, you are in charge of a specific area and depending on the hours of operation you may be responsible for a bit of tidying up"
good,"Must really like helping customers and be friendly,polite and patient."
good,"Not a bad place to work if your looking to gain customer service experience. The pay is not great, but they work with your schedule and meeting new people is always nice"
good,Liked the job enjoyed the employees. Was like family . Made alot of customers that became friends still talk to them. Pay was not great .hours were ok
good,Hardest part of the job is the consistent cutting of hours to work with. Always running short handed. Great relationships with co-workers. I have stayed for over a decade. I have formed many relationships and worked on motivating others with employee engagement activities. There are many opportunities for advancement. Managers are good at helping you work towards those goals.
good,Work prioritizes fast-paced teamwork and individual accountability. There is always something new to learn or teach. Proximity to co-workers makes attitude one of the most important aspects of this position.
good,Depending on where you live in the country it could be an great company to work for money to types of people working there. In long island area money is just ok for basics but area upset ny and outside ny is good compensation for the work.
good,"Well known tradition of customer-centered service and dedication to provide quality on every contact. Little opportunity for new hires to grow or learn, as time budget is limited."
good,"Lack Of "
good,"Everyday when i go to work, i always learn something new. Since my job was previously Rite Aid, things have changed and are really different but yet some of it is similar. i like that i can walk in and still be amazed in how neat it is and how everything is organized."
good,"You get to meet alot of good people, who have great stories and conversation. It's always nice to have someone to talk to especially when having a bad day, I could always count on that"
good,"Was my high school job. Pretty good for the most part. Flexible schedule. Sometime pharmacists could be rude. They'd blame techs for a lot since anything that went wrong on ""their part"" could get their license revoked."
good,"Overall Walgreens is a great place to work. There’s always something to be done and never a dull day at work. Costumers need assistance, there’s always something new to learn, there are very busy days and some days and not so busy days."
good,"Retail environment, so it really depends on the location of the store. Great benefits, works well with family schedules and emergencies. Promotion to Lead can happen quickly but stagnates after. Can be years before Assistant Manager is reached. Overall a good company."
good,This job is definitely better than previous ones I’ve had. I do feel stuck a good amount of the time like I’m at my end of this job after three years. However management can be good if you get the right people but you can definitely tell they are stretched thin and it poofs onto store management.
good,Decent place to work. They have good insurance. Flexible with school and always encourage me to do better. Though corporate management sucks... direct management was good and always made sure I grew as a worker.
good,Overall not a bad place to work. It's very busy and short staffed but we are paid fairly well...the computer system was nice. Very customer service oriented
good,One thing that I loved about this position is the opportunity to travel and work with different people.  I feel this gives such an opportunity to improve in your career here.
good,"There's a lot of customers to help and can become overwhelming at times. Over all experience was good though, nothing I couldn't handle. Management was good to me."
good,"My customers are so nice and appreciate the knowledge I have in photo, I love helping them learn how to use the kiosk. When you start to recognize the customer by name or they remember your name it's really nice. My favorite part is helping the elderly because one day I will be their age and will need someone like me to help me."
good,Walgreens is ok to work for it just depends on the manager. I loved working for Walgreen’s when I started but Walgreen’s has changed. Great benefits though.
good,overall Walgrees is a great start to your work career. You can get your feet wet hear. makes it easier for you to transition to a bigger career. would recommend
good,My job is very convenient for me. I do full-time college and I am able to work three days a week at Walgreens with no issue. I appreciate how flexible they are with my hours.
good,Enjoyed the opportunity and loved the overnight shift with minimum interruptions enabling my work assignments.  Did not always unloading the delivery truck when employees failed to show for their shift.  Disappointed when store left 24 hour concept and my position was eliminated
good,I started as customer service associate and quickly moved up to doing both front store and pharmacy. They helped me get a Rx license with ease. After a short time I was promoted to shift leader and kept wanting to learn more so I started training to be a Assistant Manager.
good,"Helping the costumer find a product is the most common task in every day. Always maintain the stores and organized the products. Help the cashier if the costumer line is too long, Walgreens doesn't want costumers waiting too much time in the line. Closing shift consist on going back and forward to the storage to get products so they can be restock, and at the end of the shift the store needs to be cleaned."
good,A typical day at work was always busy around lunch time & in the evening when people were getting off work to get their prescriptions. I learned customer service & how to fill medications in a timely manner. The management was great and always his technicians up to date. The hardest part of the job had to be when we were short staffed & the easiest part was handling medications & dealing with patients.
good,Great place to interact with others but very erratic hours with very short lunch break. Communication between management not consistent. Training fair/poor. You need to be proactive on your own and ask questions or you won’t learn much.
good,"I got along really well with majority of my colleges. The work was very fast paced, crazy at times. Over all I was ale to work at 2 different locations to make up for lack of hours."
good,"I enjoyed working for Walgreen's for 3 years. My manager did a really good job & always worked with me about the schedule & when I had health issues! We were open 365 days a year, but we're given the option of having Thanksgiving or Christmas off. Overall, I loved it & wish I hadn't left."
good,"Typical day is always customer based. Sorting and stocking products and merchandising are also daily duties, while maintaining a clean and presentable environment."
good,"Walgreens ends up being what you make of it. I have worked at three locations over the course of four years and have encountered 95% great managers and coworkers and the work has rarely if ever been overwhelming. I have done it while going to school the whole time and they have always been helpful and understanding with changing availability and time off. The pay, especially in the Twin Cities, is not competitive in my opinion."
good,It’s great that Walgreens cares about its team members. Management is highly encouraged to engage all team members and get them to perform their best.
good,It was a niceWork environment people there long enough 10 to go elsewhere if they’re in a management position if they’re in an entry-level position they stay pretty long it’s up to you
good,"I love my co workers and most of my customers. It can be physically challenging bc of all the time on your feet and stocking. There are certain people and situations that can be challenging. Honestly, I love my job, I just wish it covered my rent. It's never a dull moment and I've learned a lot about people."
good,"Store manager is a non pharmacist doing performance review on pharmacy manager.  Store manager normally does not have enough work experience to correctly evaluate Pharmacy manager function,  especially as a pharmacist.   Reviews are based on black and white numbers."
good,I loved working at Walgreen because you could float around to different stores if they needed help so you got to meet a lot of different people. I learned good customer service skills and how to use short codes. Hardest part about working there is they don't pay a whole lot and sometimes the shifts can be really long but overall not a horrible place to work
good,"I still enjoy my time at Walgreens. Like anything in life it has had its ups and downs, but I've learned a lot about customer care and going the extra mile for them. I also enjoy when all the employees can work synchronized to achieve great customer care."
good,"Working in conjecture with your team makes the experience a very smooth and enjoyable one. Customers are diverse and friendly for the most part and things are quite straight forward. The business environment remains busy through out day, serving to keep every one on their toes."
good,"Fast paced, highly demanding work. Rewarding patient care. Long days, stressful, retail environment. Work life balance does not exist for pharmacy or store managers. Promotions limited"
good,"My work Day usually consist of interacting with my customers while remaining relatable in a timely fashion ,as well as making sure I'm being efficient in cash Handling and keeping a tidy work station"
good,"I love my coworkers and team. There are the usual ""demands"" from corporate, but being the busiest in the district/legend store (original Walgreens - not buyout location) those demands seemed achievable."
good,but its life and I make the most out of my day with a positive attitude. But they are working at being more of a team as a store. So that is very encouraging.
good,Overall the culture at Walgreens is quite good. The only downsides come from occasionally having a manager that spends more time at meetings or in the office than interacting with the employees and store. Given the chance I'd work for the company again.
good,Walgreens was a job that lasted 13 years management not big on promotions the better you work the less your chances of promotions the job security kinda makes you settle
good,"Both the staff, management and customers make this an enjoyable place to work.  There is nothing difficult in this job other than getting an unhappy customer but that is typical and management with deal with them."
good,Very Dynamic workplace. There is always work that needs to get done. Invest in their people. Opportunities to move up within the company. Various areas of opportunities.
good,"I really enjoyed working for walgreens, but it all depends on what store you work for honestly. The store I worked at was amazing and the management there always try to make you feel welcomed. Being the beauty advisor was fun but stressful because there was no Advisor before I got there so I had to rebuild the beauty section. Overall I really loved working for walgreens."
good,"Most management that you meet and end up working with are good store managers, but the pay rate at walgreens could be improved. They consistently do pay raises for employees in pharmacy but the rest of the store gets ignored. Assistant Store Managers do the same job as the Store Manager yet get paid half, which is not fair at all."
good,"I have worked for Walgreens for 10 years, in the beginning i was excited and proud to work for this company. But as the years have gone by  my excitement  is gone. There has been a lot of changes over the years. Once the company merged with Boots Alliance from the UK the care and value of employees have gone down significantly. I have been a Pharmacy manager for 5 years and would like to step down due to being overwhelmed with metrics that no matter how hard my team tries we cannot meet with the decrease in manpower offered. It is literally affecting my mental health. I was told if I step down there would not be a position available for me. This to me is very disappointing, dedicated employees are not valued by this corporation."
good,"The work was nice, but the coworkers had more drama than high school. It was ridiculous. They also don't train me or others as well as I would've liked."
good,Job tends to be redundant and not a lot of room to move up in the company. People working there were nice and management was good. Their system is easy to catch on too and training isn't difficult
good,Nothing special about working there. They had problems with stuff members and worked part-time workers more than 40 hours a week. Job atmosphere was friendly though and training was very insightful.
good,Walgreens can sometimes produce a tad of stress. It's a successful business place that tends to get busy at a blink of an eye. Thats when having hard working co-workers come in to play.
good,stock floor arange backstock provide excellent costumer service. learned how to order product and to reset bays giving costumers a quick checkout experience
good,An overall friendly place with peers willing to help and advise. A hands on management team not afraid to do what they ask you to do. Quick paced and productive environment.
good,"I was grateful to have a job as the pharmacist market isn't great. Some stores are understaffed, but some are excellent to work at. The benefits are certainly fair. Wages could be higher but they are not unreasonable."
good,The job itself isnt bad at all. Sometimes its very stressful with certain things. Sometimes you learn as you go. Even with the training from the computers i find it easier to do when its hands on. Sometimes they exoect a lot from yiu even though you are only one person. Prepare for your mind to be absorbing a lot of information. I will say the best thing from this job is all the experience you will get.
good,The Walgreens/Alliance merger is still in its infant stages but longevity and advancement within the company is very possible. Salary is competitive. Great new hire on training.
good,Work experience was definitely an experience I will not forget. A typical day would be working with the general public and the occasional difficult customer.
good,"I absolutely loved working at Walgreens! The manager was fair and easy to work with, some of the co-managers weren't the easiest to get along with. I loved the customers too. The only reason I had to quit was because I wasn't getting enough hours. I really hated to leave."
good,"Overall it can be a little hectic but I loved working there, the hours were very convenient for me, my store and pharmacy managers were awesome but it's depending on the store"
good,It was good experience working there at Walgreens and I learned a lot by working there. The staff there were friendly and very helpful and I hope that I can work at Walgreens again in the future.thanx
good,I worked over 3 years in the company and it was really interesting knowing new people every day. And the training they gave me was outstanding. Customer support me as much as they see me growing with te company
good,If you are comfortable being on call and working more hours than you were scheduled for then this is the place for you. Make sure that you make it clear how many hours you intend to work because work can easily pile up and you will have difficulty keeping up if you are not honest with management.
good,"I like working there as an associate. Flexible schedule, talking to customers, active with always something to do. I would not go into management, low pay. This store is slightly sexist and favors "
good,"Walgreens I feel like Is a great first time job, for example Walgreens was my first job I ever had and I believe it’s a great starter on to how other jobs could go since customer service is a job that demands communication skills."
good,"Walgreens offered me many experiences and if you have drive, opportunities for upward advancement.  Recently they have adjust their strategy that has caused some change to the culture."
good,"The people here genuinely try. How well they do varies greatly based on personal ability and personality, but everyone is genuinely trying their best to help customers."
good,I worked at Walgreens as a pharmacy intern. As expected the workload can be challenging. The managers I had the pleasure to work with had a strong understanding of the importance of clearly defining roles to ensure that workflow went as smoothly as possible. I would certainly consider working for the company again in the future.
good,"a typical day working at Walgreens pharmacy is basically answering the phones, working the drive thru, scanning and typing in new prescriptions, filling prescriptions, and providing excellent customer service. I have definitely learned how to multi task while working there. the hardest part of the job is definitely dealing with rude customers. You have to keep a smile on your face and do your job no matter how rude they are. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you've helped someone ."
good,I enjoy the job. At smaller stores coworkers become a second family to you. Management is usually pretty good at training and staffing. In all its a great part time job.
good,First job out of high school it was a good stepping stone because it introduced having responsibilities. Little promotions were available within the store.
good,Sometimes management can be a pain in the rear and if u want any promotions it will  take a while. They take hours away from the employees and gives them to the shift leads and their favorites
good,"I had been employed at Walgreens for over 16 years. It was an absolute fantastic company to work for. When it came to career advancement, I was not satisfied."
good,"Company is ok to work for. Unfortunately, the company has been consolidating in upper management and the word is the Knoxville market may get taken over. Schedule used to be flexible, not anymore. Unable to keep new hires due to poor training."
good,It is a great place to work if you aren’t the cashier. Cashier can only stay in the front and is set to be there the whole shift. Sometimes you are the only worker on the floor if the store is dead and it makes it hard to pass the time when you have everything done.
good,"In the past, Assistant Store Managers were paid salary, but that has changed,  ASMs were down-graded, and are now paid hourly and at a lower pay rate.  Exposed to a lot of theft by customers, and you have no recourse but to not engage, and thieves literally walk away with merchandise.  Walgreens needs to pay for the security of its employees. At times, it seems like you working in a hazardous duty zone.  Many employees call in sick very often.  Assistant Managers find themselves unloading trucks, stocking merchandise, and assisting pharmacy on a daily basis.  Turn over in employees is extremely high. Assistant Managers are regularly transferred from store to store. Good Assistant Managers are often transferred to failing stores to bring those stores up to standard.  You never know from day to day when you will be transferred to another store,  This disrupts your personal life quite a bit and involves a lot of unpaid travel expenses."
good,"Everyday I would clock in, go to the front counter and see if I am going to take over for the person at the front. If not, I would face aisles and restock shelves. No matter where I was, I would run over to the photo counter when someone pressed the assistance button. The managers varied in personalities to a comfortable level. In working here, I learned patience and to ask for help when it's needed. The most enjoyable part was making friends with fellow employees and having friendly relationships with managers. The hardest part was keeping up with the coupons that would change every week and mostly have special requirements attached that would make understanding hard for older customers."
good,"Fast paced, great customer service, teamwork, pleasant atmosphere.  Paying attention to the customers needs, making sure customers are finding what they are looking for in the store."
good,"The most difficult part of working for Walgreens is that they transfer their managers to different stores every few years.  Each manager has her or his own way of doing things. Same for Assistant Managers. The job itself for me is not difficult as I am a very people oriented person and can easily talk to customers.  If you are not this way, it can be very challenging. I've worked with money in the majority of jobs I've held. I know how to keep a cash drawer straight and organized. I am a neat person so, this too helps in keeping the front part of the store that I'm in charge of CNO. "
good,"I learned how to use a register, different ways to communicate a customer to best help them, and how to use all the different tools that the store used. A typical workday for me was to make sure the store was faced and waiting to see what my manager or the list had for us to do, begin work while keeping an ear/eye out for customers entering the store."
good,"I love Walgreen's and always will,  but it does truly depend on the area you work in just for fair treatment and advancement."
good,"I love Walgreens, but it has been my boss made me really love it and stay for 11 years.  My boss really works with me and my schedule. I love the products we sell and the sales we have. I like our pharmacy and use it often. My coworkers are the best! However, they keep changing things like cutting hours and taking away paid time off for part time employees across all of Walgreens locations."
good,This job was great. The downfall was going to college and trying to get certified as a tech. You had to take a class which they told you they offered twice a year. They only offered it once for that year. I also only worked part time and did not have all the time of learning on the job. This job requires a lot of learning and studying. I also only received a 30 minute lunch for an 8 plus hour shift.
good,Walgreens allowed me to better myself without holding me back. I was allowed to transfer to improve myself and take a leadership role in all that I was doing. It allowed me to excel.
good,"Was a very good part time job. You must be flexible with your work schedule. Part time employees do not have as good of benefits as full time employees, as to be expected. Their 401k is great for both full and part time. PTO is earned."
good,"Depending on where you work (Pennsauken in my case) you will be very busy; but there were always hours, the pay is decent, it is a good job for college students but not really a career, they will pay for you to take a PTCB class and the test so you can become a CPhT. Although after that there isn't really any growth unless you want to try to become an assistant manager then a manager. The customers are the worst part some are amazing and understanding others will talk to you like dirt and refuse to understand the situation constantly blaming you for something you have no control over. If you can survive them you can survive any job."
good,Walgreens was ok to work for but you were basically  number. I  enjoyed the customers greatly but wanted to finish college so I had to leave because their hours interfered with my school.
good,"Definently not a full-time type of place! "
good,"I love working for Walgreens.."
good,"nice environment, great customers. could get a bit overwhelming but always manageable. you'll get opportunities to move up if the management at the store you work at is right."
good,"I like it for what it is, but dont particularly enjoy the style of job. The pay is fair for the amount and type of work I do, but I do not get enough hours to sustain a life."
good,I enjoyed my job at Walgreens but being on my feet 8-9hrs/day on concrete floors ruined my feet.  No jobs are offered to employees who need to sit a lot.
good,"I am responsible for overseeing all areas of the store.  I supervise 20-25 team members. I hold them accountable for what they should be doing. Also, I work to help all patients are cared for."
good,I review Walgreens as a good place to work or more as a good first job for up front team members. Management could be better and so could work ethic with some employees but we all work as a team at Walgreens.
good,"While I enjoyed my actual job as a Pharmacy Technician, the stress and push for money making, rather then patient care, was not a good fit for me. Management did little to assist during difficult situations and often complained about employees not meeting deadlines due to poor scheduling."
good,Open the store counting register teaching employees OSH watching employees apply the things that I teach them to make the company run better do payroll
good,"Poor management . They give lack of work , while others are on overtime . The bosses are very rude. The more you do the less you get paid the less you do the more you get paid. Ds and 401(k) do you say insurance and benefits. Would recommend going in the Mount Vernon area it’s one of the best jobs around locally. Would do not recommend moving to the area for this job. Drama. Once you are on top pay, they like to fire you."
good,"its a good place if you looking to make some extra cash, but the pay its nor great for the amount of work you have todo. they budget is always changing so you never going to get the same hours every week."
good,Decent place to work at. Nothing negative to say. It's especially good if it is your first job. They are also very flexible with hours. Good Management.
good,"I enjoyed working there and only left because my hours kept getting cut. I loved the customers, and most of my coworkers. Customer service is truly emphasized."
good,"The company overall was great to work at, but the hours I had to work to get a set schedule was unpleasant. Employee relations need work but overall a good company to work for."
good,"room for improvement, teaches management skills"
good,"I would give my experience working at the Central Wichita Walgreens location a 4/5 stars. "
good,Didn't like that they are always changing managers and pharmacist. Learn one way then they change management and have to learn a different way. People expect your pharmacist to be personable.
good,Each and every day had different chances and opportunities to grow and show your worth.  The hardest part of my job was being the middle person between upper management and store employees.  The best part of my job was helping people find what they were looking for or something similar.
good,Flexible schedule. Can cross train in more than one department. The pay rate was very decent. Management was very professional and helpful with new employees.
good,"I worked here with two of my best friends and had a pretty good time just stocking and facing isn’t ideal with big sausage fingers, good benefits and decent discount."
good,Very fast paced environment where having a well planned out shift will greatly benefit you. Ensuring the store is faced and properly stocked is very crucial to the general business functions. Having cross training for pharmacy as well as front end functions will help in advancing in Walgreens as a whole.
good,Growing customer base yet corporate is slow to respond to additional resource needs. Store management is inept at pharmacy operations. Typical pharmacist required to fill 400 prescriptions per self per shift.
good,I only interned here and can not speak for the benefits and job security. You do learn the ins and outs of retail. I do cherish my time learning there.
good,"While working for Rite Aid, Walgreens bought a majority of the Rite Aid store son the Northeast and the transition has been a struggle. The software is antiquated and not user friendly at all. There are positives though, some workflow processes have become better but the old software makes it difficult to excel in the workplace."
good,"I good place to meet the general public,  Employee discounts, and a friendly place to work. Good staff that is willing to help and assist at all times. Manager a very productive and helpful."
good,Walgreens offers a great place to people who really want to advance in a company. This company is very fast paced as well and works best with those who are quick learners.
good,This company is great if you really want to find out the many situations that may arise during a customer service role. This can be helpful as the front line consumer-facing employee who can provide feedback for company to adapt to.
good,The starting rate is poor with 13 years of experience they were only willing to pay 18.00 per hr. After another job was made by a competitor was I offer a better salary
good,Working as a manager I had many tasks. You get to know your customers and learned their behaviors. Which makes you better equipped to provide their needs
good,There are rules and ways to be done correctly at Walgreens. But you have Store Managers and Assistant Managers (EXA) what ever they are called now in this location that do not think they are important. So you are told not to do them then when they get in trouble with the District Manager they blame it on you. I was trained by 2 Managers on how to do things the correct way at all times. In my first 3 years with the company. They were both trained in Chicago. And as long as it was done the correct way it all ran smoothly. Then I got a couple of Managers that did not do it the correct way and everything was falling apart. Inventory was incorrect were not scheduled the correct staff at the correct time. Let gossip go on with in the store. And at this time it is still going on with in them stores as they are all still there. I loved being a shift Lead and would have loved to stayed with the company but when there are a few bad Store Managers and Assistant Managers that no one can do anything about due to know one cares you cut your loses. The company also do's not pay enough for a Shift Lead to have a Pharmacy Tech license to cover them when they are short handed. The Pharmacy Tech's make more then the shift leads and shift leads are to do more jobs at one time then the Pharmacy Tech's. Due to they are suppose to cover the Pharmacy when short handed and do Managements job.
good,Walgreen's top priority from management down to employees is satisfying customer needs at all costs. Going out of your way for customers in any scenario is important.
good,"Walgreens is an okay place to work at but dont count on being there and advancing into a better paying job because the pay is not worth it, and it doesn't really pay you bills."
good,Okay company to start at. I would not make plans to remain there for too long. There has been a lot of changes in the last couple of years that feels like the company has become less concerned about its team members.
good,Very fast paced constantly changing/adding programs with lowering operating budgets. Crews you work with are great people. Peers are understanding and helpful.
good,Years ago this company was great . Now so many changes are being made and the company has pay caps charging us more for benefits and have no gratitude towards those who work for them . Not even a gift card for Christmas. Employees who have been working with the company for years make just as much as a new staff member makes minimum wage .
good,"Great place to work. They really hone in on the ""family"" ideals. If you're going to walgreens, it's because you're not going to Hyvee. So we really had pride for the small store sort of feeling. I didn't like sticker morning Sundays though. Always try to get out of those."
good,"I enjoy working here, the atmosphere amongst my co-workers is very warm and friendly and no matter what department a fellow associates works in, if you need assistance, my peers don't hesitate to assist me. Management allows flexibility. For example, if you need a particular day off or need to come in at a later time, you're allowed to swap or switch your scheduled shift with another associate as long as you have managements approval."
good,Walgreens is a very fast-paced company and constantly trying to remain relevant in a vastly changing arena of pharmacy.  This is not the career company to work for if you are not interested in change or growth.
good,"I learned a great deal of skills. When I was pregnant I got discriminated against. Also my managers do not like  my position and think that I do nothing for my entire shift. Some managers also like to twist things around that happened to try to get you in trouble to cover themselves, aka throwing you under the bus. Other employees treated me terribly  because of my position, beauty consultant."
good,Great experience workin in all departments and receiving dedicated training in all areas. I do wish work flow was more productive but overall there is a method and daily checklist to help one stay on task.
good,"It can be stressful or overwhelming the first few weeks, but overtime it becomes easier with knowledge of product placement/ merchandising. The company likes to give thanks to customers, employees, and their family or friends with extra special discount days."
good,"I enjoyed my time at this job, the coworkers were a close nit group of people. There were many events we did as a team and or a crew. The chance to advance in the company was always available."
good,Some management seem to care about the employees. They worked with you if you had an emergency. It was a friendly atmosphere for the most part. I enjoyed my time there
good,"It was fun while i was in the business. job environment was stressful but the pace was fast, which i was always working and on the move. i love the flow of that"
good,"Walgreens is a great environment to work for. It's just time for me to look for a new career opportunity. "
good,Walgreens overall is a company that has great expectations to grow . They can show you a lot and further education in the pharmacy area . Customer service is a need for this job.
good,Management was usually helpful and pretty understanding with me being in school and working there. Some shifts were mandatory however if I needed to swap shifts I had the option to do so. The hardest part of the job was getting used to working in pharmacy and the front of the store (which is optional). The most enjoyable part of the job was the teamwork and flexibility.
good,"You will be constantly on your feet moving. While I worked in Full Case, there were many breaks during the workday. The breaks occur when the conveyer belt lines went down for maintenance, or because shipping is behind. They will say that they are staffed for the day, but in reality, they are understaffed, and their days are 12 hours. But the work you do, will carry itself to the end time, and the people who work there are great people and I enjoyed my time."
good,"It is fun to be around my co-workers, and have a great relationship with my customers. Overall good company to work for. They also have small get togethers outside of work."
good,"I worked for Walgreen for many years. Their incentives where fair. I received many opportunities for growth and developing my skills. "
good,Wish compensation was better for long term employees. I learned alot and have enjoyed it there although when new hires are coming in making the same money it's difficult.
good,"Overall I think Walgreens is a good place to work as long as you have good management. Unfortunately, I do not currently have a good management team and our store is kind of in shambles due to it. Poor management makes me not like working here. Previously we had great management and I loved working here. Other than that, it’s a easy job and you get a lot of benefits."
good,"I am a customer service associate at Spaulding and I have to say my ASM's work there best to ensure a positive experience for customers, but Shift Leads sometimes seem to lack that empathy behind curtains. As far as peers, they tend to lose interest in doing their job because of the low pay you receive while working there. Most times tasks will be half-completed by managers, who in turn arent able to do their job because of having to try to pick up after them. Machines are very outdated and tend to break frequently there. However, the biggest complaint about the company is WAGES. After about making $11-12 an hour at other locations, I make 10 here (Walgreens will try to give you minimum wage), and average to about 35 hours a week, yet only receive $500 a biweekly paycheck. Being a college student it simply does not cover my cost of living, so I continue looking for main income elsewhere."
good,"The main issue is lack of help on certain days of the week. Other than that, I have no complaints about the work. I work with a cool group of people and the customers that patron the store are friendly and communicate well"
good,"Walgreens is an excellent employer. I strongly recommend anyone to apply with this company, however if you do not have great customer service skills , this is not a job to consider."
good,My Time Spent At Walgreens Was Pleasant Its A Challenge Because Of The Environment Sometimes And Depends On Management Because The Lack Of Emotional Intelligence Most Have
good,"At the time was working the overnight shift, but is no longer available, it's a decent job that has a good environment and friendly coworkers. Would be nicer if they had nights still."
good,"I liked working at Walgreens but I knew it was a temporary assignment so I did not let myself get comfortable.  I had to do the grunge work, the cleaning and cart roundup."
good,I loved this job. Be prepared to be cross-trained. Advancement somewhat available into the pharmacy for better pay. Willing to work around my school schedule.
good,I enjoyed working there the years I was there. I became certified while working for Walgreens and learned all about what it took to be come a pharmacy technician.
good,Walgreens is a very relaxed workplace that allows you to have some fun while working but still get work done. Managers and higher ups are very nice and talk to you.
good,The friends I've made over the years here have really made my time here worthwhile. I have been lucky to be able to work my way up from cashier to assistant store manager while remaining at the same location.
good,Work could be rewarding when it comes to patient interaction but the business is mainly data and number driven. Customer review and satisfaction is highly valued and heavily counted on.
good,Great place to work.I really like their working schedule.They gave me whatever hours I need.they treated with me so well.I really like the environment.
good,"Walgreens is a great place for a first job, but not to be made into a career or a long term working place. Over worked for what the pay was. The hours and overtime weren’t well maintained example of you stayed a couple of minutes after a shift to help a customer or help a manager. The next working day you had to leave those many minutes before you shift original time."
good,"Great place to work earlier.  stressful at times but great personal experience in past.  seems to be changing now.  Phoenix was earlier an emerging market, now it is a very saturated market, hence change in company policies and culture."
good,sometimes the hardest part of the job at walgreens was trying to complete everything before the end of your shift. my store had a very consistent customer flow for the area and sometimes it was difficult to complete every task that was given you.
good,"Is a good place to work. Everyone is friendly, its a good seasonal job opportunity. Customers are always number one priority. it was a good till it lasted."
good,Overall relaxed environment with much to do. Learned to multitask with customers while tending to other duties for the store. Built decent rapport with other employees. most difficult part of job was having to deal with troublesome customers do to high homeless population in surrounding area and having to deal with constant issues and involving police at night. The most enjoyable part of the job was building teamwork to get tasks done n a timely manner.
good,"Working at 2 locations over 54 months, management attitude will vary by location. Overall, a decent place to work, with regular opportunities for raises and the company prefers to promote from within."
good,Walgreens can be a productive place to work. Walgreens will also pay for different types of school you may need to adavance in the company. Customer service is huge at Walgreens.
good,The job asks for you to take on several task with what seems like a very limited amount of time. Team members are flexible enough to compensate when need be.
good,"High, but not unrealistic, expectations are given to customer service associates. Workplace needs to be kept as clean as possible and I would need to always be proactive. Isles must be kept organized and products must be pulled forward on shelves. Occasionally, I will be required to stock the isles toward the front. This position can help those struggling with time management. Higher management is very flexible but from my experience, management can also be very poor and inconsiderate regarding sick days. The hardest part of the job is helping guests purchasing cigarettes or alcohol that an ID is required, regardless of appearance."
good,Walgreens is a good company to work for. I have been with the company for over a decade. It has a diverse culture. I have seen people with various background. I believe that's what drives the company. I learned a lot from the company.
good,this job is very hands on. it includes you getting on your knees a lot and getting dirty. sometimes the manager doesnt even know you were suppose to work somedays
good,"Nice and friendly co workers competitive  pay, loved servicing the customers. Fast paced. Standing up for long periods of time and not enough times for lunch break."
good,Walgreen is on the cutting edge of retail/pharmacy stores. They actually compensate their employees very well. A lot has change with-in the company where they run on bare minimum staff which makes your job stressful.
good,They appear to be under staffed most of the time in certain departments. I like people and get along with everyone and have learned the system. Hardest part of the job is when they are shorthanded and or people call in sick.  The culture is good and i usually am working evenings.
good,"Some people may like standing all day only ringing people up, but it's not my cup of tea. A fine job for an older person who wants a job that won't be too hard on them. The most memorable part of my job there was the online training, which took up a lot of time, but a least we got paid for doing them."
good,"My time was short with Walgreens, as it was a second job, and I discovered making too much (lol) would endanger my wife's medical benefits through the state, but for the time I was there it was pleasant. Decent coworkers and management, but pay was low for the area and my experience (hence it being only a second job)."
good,A typical day at Walgreens was taking care of the customers at the register helping customers locate product was a team player helped out whenever and whenever i could.   Most enjoyable was the customers we had a following love working with people.
good,I love Walgreens. I've almost always felt welcome at my store and we work together as a team. Things go get a little hectic every year or so when they switch out assistant store managers. The ASM is the one who makes the schedule and often has trouble balancing the schedules at first. Overall good place to work.
good,"A typical work day at Walgreens would be bright and early mornings, makeup to put away, suggest certain items to customers, and reviewing what we have and don't have. I learned how to become head over a department. the responsibility was a lot and very educational. the management was OK at Walgreens. There is not a lot to say about that. I enjoyed meeting new people and getting to help them as much as I can. The hardest part of my job was when I had to do other people's job for them. I was not always in my department. I had to assist a lot of times in other departments which made it hard to get my department ready and where it needed to be."
good,"Walgreens has been a great place to work thus far. It is fast past most of the time, depending on what your job is. Your co-workers make the job enjoyable."
good,"My days are always different, I really like talking to the customers and the friendships I have built  Hardest part of my job is trying not to do to much, they want me to stand around and just wait on customers and I want to stay busy and not have down time.  I like to keep doing anything at all but they discourage you from, like stocking shelves when the truck comes in and product it there to put out.  "
good,"Walgreens overall is a good company only real issue I have is I feel retail is not a job for ppl with children.  It is very demanding, working all holidays makes it hard spending time with family."
good,Walgreens have it's good and bad. The pay scale was a challenge for me. I think that they have some of the greatest Pharmacist in the field. Walgreens is a good place to shop.
good,Walgreens is a nice relaxing environment to work at. The workers were nice and helpful. They  trained  me and helped me get the hang of working there. I was sad when I had to leave.
good,"Good amount of work"
good,"Easy, good first job, but to slow paced for me in particular. Managers are easy going, but again too slow paced , so many times I felt like I didn't know what to do at work. I felt lost, many times we would just talk to one another until someone found something to do to kill time."
good,"Getting to work earlier to get my priorities ready, then hit the ground running"
good,"Walgreens is a great company, goes out of there way to work with you, I enjoyed all my co-workers, would recommend this company as a great place to work, very high pace, and can be very stressful, I have worked for Walgreens off and on since 1990, Due to having a family, and other personal life issues."
good,"I did not work at Walgreens for very long. I was hired as a cashier and due to me being the only cashier over the age of 18, I was moved onto the sales floor as a cosmetics department associate. I usually worked on the days when the truck came in, as I was very quick to get the freight done. One of the biggest downsides is when there is nothing to do, you have to find something to do. You cant just sit down, and wait for customers or a project to arise. Often I would just walk around the entire (small) store, and wait for something to do. I would have the entire area cleaned up, and freight / reshops done, and just wait for our closing routines. I did enjoy the cute little lunch area they had, but your lunch cant cross anyone elses so its a little hard to bond with your fellow associates. Our store manager changed so much in my 3 months there, since apparently our store was used as a training store for up and coming managers, that the person who hired me isnt the one who I quit with."
good,"Overall, this position was very interesting due to the knowledge that you would acquire every day through experiences. Its a job that is fast-packed so you have to be able to learn on the fly and adapt quickly."
good,"Job duties are fairly simple, hours are very flexible which is great for students or part-time workers. The pay is decent compared to other jobs such as the food industry."
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work if your just want to go to work and go home, as long as your do that and you do it well you won’t have any issues.  Pros"
good,Walgreens is a great place to start at for anyone trying to get into the customer service field. However the management is very vital that under the wrong person could affect your overall work experience.
good,"the management is really laid back, and the job is pretty simple and easy, but it gets very repetitive and they don't like it when you ask for different areas."
good,"Once you hit a certain level within the company, the growth opportunities disappear. On the plus side, until you reach that ceiling, they do prefer to promote from within. The constantly accruing PTO (after 6 months) is a nice plus. There are tons of discount partnerships available to employees, but there's so many that it's hard to remember them all and they're not advertised at all to employees."
good,"Being a national company,emplyees were afforded ample opportunities to transfer other locations,including diferent cities and states. Also great shift pay differentials."
good,"It's been a while but this was a pleasant place to work. Not spectacular benefits but the management and overall vibe was positive and energetic, I recall fondly."
good,I enjoy this job. The atmosphere and culture are mostly positive. They promote teamwork. Iys very community based which makes everyday different and interesting. The customers appreciate My help.
good,I learned plenty beneficial and social skills working at Walgreens that help me to better problem solve with people. Working here was an experience and I have accomplished and benefited as much as I can from this company and would recommend anyone to work here.
good,I have no complains about the company. I enjoy the atmosphere and the people I work with. I enjoy helping people and caring for them and the company to.
good,"As a trainee coming outside of the company, I did not know requirement that you have to have a pharmacy certified license to become a store manager. Most enjoyable part of the job is working with your team members and assisting our customers."
good,Good company. Easy to advance to middle management. Very hard to get to upper management. Very strict on rules.  Very easy to get a write up over very small issues.
good,Low wages for work performed. Good coworkers but management communication is poor. Corporate is limiting scheduling hours giving employees heavier workload for low pay.
good,It’s a good company for starting. Hard to promote past shift lead. They prefer college degree and hire outside for upper management.   Retail is common sense not book smart
good,"For those fresh out of a pharmacy technician program. I recommend to start working at Walgreens to learn the trade. In the beginning may be overwhelming ( like any other job) just remember to be patient and take constructive criticism well. Do not mind when customer become irate. Remain calm during the situation, be polite, and smile."
good,The people you meet are for a lifetime. This company has helped me improve on myself 10 fold. I was glad that Walgreens was my first job and a stepping stone in my job career.
good,"Easy job where you work as a cashier, stocking inventory and occasionally  work the picture booth. Compensation is ok but not life changing. The company does look to promote from within."
good,During your wait time they acknowledge you. Once they take your prescription order they advise you of the time it should take for your prescription to be ready for pickup. Walgreens is more personable. They ask if you have any questions for the pharmacist? They will try to assist you when you need help.
good,"I enjoyed working at walgreens, for the most part it was a good time with coworkers and it was a really good team effort, it instills lots of responsibility because you are given things to do, but you make time to get them done on your own watch which is great."
good,I work at one of the best Walgreens in the world in sales. I very much enjoy going to work and always have fun. Also work very hard. Only reason I'd leave is the pay but the environment feels like family.
good,"Working at Walgreens was a very good experience. As a stocker, I organized merchandise and make sure everything was in stock. The people there are very friendly and are able to help you find whatever you are looking for."
good,"Constantly changing things. you get use to one thing and it will change in a matter of months."
good,Honestly great place to work I quit becouse I was in school didn’t have enough time to work full time and do school full time. If u need a job that pay decent and offers benefits it’s a good place. You must be willing to commit 11 hours of work time and no time off during the holidays.  I worked full case pick and worked 4 10’s schedule. It’s labor intensive u will feel completely tired once the shift is over. Best part was you get a $1 raise every 6 months for the first 2 years. once you reach 3 years with the companyyou will be maxed out in pay. Overall good place and great pay for someone who doesn’t want to do college or go to trade school. Hope this review help out
good,"working as a teller/stock boy for Walgreen was not overly difficult, location of the pharmacy does have an impact on the work however. the pharmacy i worked at was inside of a busy train station, so we had constant rush hours, which left me with boring and repetitive work. if the location was less active, i would have had the time to improve coordination with my team, receive the training needed to help the pharmacist behind the medicine counter, and possibly even have a more flexible work schedule. if you decide to work for Walgreens i suggest looking for a less busy chain, although those less busy chains might be harder to find hiring."
good,I started working for company in 2015 and it 's been a roller coaster ride. My co-workers are fun and are like minded. The only issue I have is the strict schedule and hours I have to work. The amount of hours you get can shift week to week.
good,There some inconsistencies when it came to management following policy and procedure but overall and ok place to work. Human Resources was a definite help.
good,Walgreens was a learning experience. I learned how to work a cash register and how to work in the photo department. I also was able to work on the floor (i.e stock shelves..)
good,My manager at Walgreens Craig Gommel is by far the best boss I’ve ever had. He’s super nice and friendly plus he gets stuff done. He keeps the work environment friendly and competitive and always speaks to his employees and customers.
good,"typical day consist of work together as a team and making sure prescriptions was filled in a timely manner. Learn to work together. Management was fair, workplace culture was fair. Hardest part was trying not to make error while filling prescriptions. Most enjoyable part was working together."
good,"Overall, my experience has been positive. A watch-out, which is true universally, it that direct supervisors can be inconsistent, impacting the experience. A talented, selfless leader can really launch your career if you put the work in."
good,Hours at Walgreens are very flexible and willing to work with students. Unfortunately the promotion within is very limited. Overall great job but management can be tricky.
good,Productive and busy workplace. Always something to do to keep You busy. Nice working Staff whos always willing to Learn & Be Taught. Great Managers who are always willing to Lend A Helping Hand.
good,I have worked 3 and a half years for a great company with great benefits. But I have been recently gone from a full time employee to part time employee without prior notice after being dedicated to the company through it all. I feel my seniority and or experience do not matter anymore.
good,"I have worked at five different Walgreens pharmacy locations. "
good,"It was a fast paced, fun place to work at. It had some good employess and good management. Very impressed on how organized they were. If giving the chance i wouldn't mind working back at a walgreens"
good,"Started in the summer of 2017 and almost near my full first year of working here, the hours are okay, could be better for part time people, and they could move their employees around in the positions more, I’m always a cashier and hardly ever on the floor, and I like working on the floor, so I had asked my manager to put me out on the floor more and it never happened, the pay is goodish, wish was a tad bit higher but it is what it is"
good,"Walgreens has seasons. The busy season and the slow season. During the school schedule, Walgreens are busy and you can pick up overtime. Once, summer comes, you will loose hours and become part-time if your full time and even more part-time if your part-time. There is no seasonal positions ."
good,depending on the store you may either work really hard for how much you make or barely work at all. all stores run differently and it all depends on management. you can get lucky or unlucky. but overall this company is a place i grew to love and enjoyed to be at because of the store i started in. i had great management and communication was always key.
good,"In a warehouse scanting items into there location "
good,"The pay should be better due to the workload & constant issues that arise. Also with as much knowledge and certification needed to be a manager, pay increase would definitely help to keep managers around."
good,"I interned at Walgreen for around 6 weeks. During that time, I gained a lot of knowledge and experience. My coworkers were friendly and helpful. The pharmacists were eager to answer any questions that I had and taught me most of the ins and outs of the industry."
good,"i always liked working at walgreens , the people were always nice and the work wasn't hard, i worked as a beauty advisor and always loved setting up the displays and selling the products"
good,It’s retail work and retail hours and retail pay. It’s not glamorous by any means but let me tell you. I had incredible management the entire time I was there. Even when they brought new management in they hired very well.
good,"This location has a great leadership and employee team. Yet each Walgreens can feel a lot different, but the biggest issue that each store comes across is when the heads of the company attempt to integrate something they're not involved in. There is huge gap between front end work force and CEO decisions."
good,Over all the work environment is great. The benefits are a plus as well. I don't have any issues with the job itself. The work equals out to the amount that you are being paid so that is always a plus.
good,"i used to love this company i just feel the last few years i worked here the policies were not in the best interest of the employees or customers, my last few years were tough."
good,"Walgreens has been a great beginning to my career, and I appreciate all that it has given me. I am, however, growing out of Walgreens, and seeking further employment. But if you're needing a place to get your footing in, Walgreens is excellent for that."
good,A great place to work with high cultural standards. Management is always giving you input on your progress. A place  with a diverse ethnicity. Overall a good place to work.
good,"Growing a community pharmacy customer base requires the pharmacist earning the respect of his/her customers EVERY TIME you fill and refill a prescription, provide drug information and offer an OTC product recommendation."
good,Everyday you learn something new. Getting as much done as you can is the goal ea h and everyday. We interact with customers/patients each and everyday. Some are nicer then others.
good,"A typical day depends on what the store has going on in sales, can either be easy and nice or full of problems and headaches "
good,"A good place to work, friendly , interesting, challenging, good management, a good learning experience. An opportunity to help people in need and the satisfaction of doing so."
good,"My first job position was Sales Clerk when I was hired. They promoted me to Photo Specialist, then Beauty Advisor and lastly, Pharmacy Technician. In my experience, I was hired from within."
good,Good company. Enjoyed team work and quality.  Very customer focused.  Strong commitment to diversity..................................................
good,"When working retail its hard to manage work like with family life. Working nights and weekends plus holidays didn't leave much time for family. Different Store Managers will treat you different, some are kind others will walk all over you"
good,assigned hours are flexible for staff but work life vs home life is stressful for shift managers.  Assigned hours are flexible and can asks fortime off during the days you have activities outside the company. The culture is friendly and coopertive.
good,"It was a descent job, but requiters hours upon hours of barley moving around. I wish I could have a job that would have me on my feet or doing something I love not something I'm good at, but life doesn't always give us what we want..."
good,"I feel like Walgreens has excellent compensation and decent management. Lately, hours are being cut and the pace of work in my high volume store is becoming very stressful. Very team oriented job. Huge focus on metrics and performance. The schedule is okay, but not great for families."
good,"In my time working at Walgreens I really liked working with 99% of my coworkers. The SM is really great, and I still go visit her till this very day. I just wasn't able to support my family off my pay checks."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walgreens, they people I worked with were very nice, the work was fast paced and at times customers were rude but it all comes with the job. The job taught me patience and how to get work done in an orderly manner while still working against the clock"
good,"I absolutely love working here. As long have you have a good management team, the job will be fun and easy to do. For me, specifically, I have issues with my current store manager because of things she has said to be, and how she has said them. So on that note, I am in the process of moving to a different location."
good,"While this job has promoted me a few times and given me room to grow initially, I feel like I've reached the limit. Pay is NOT competitive for someone whose license is worth $17 an hour, and I've had several issues with corporate."
good,"The store manager was considerate and professional. You are trained and given a work shirt. You assisted customers, cashiered, replenished merchandise, and kept your department clean."
good,Walgreens provided a challenging work environment and the opportunity to provide patient care while gaining pharmacy managerial experience.  Overall a good company to work for.
good,"most of my time I was working as a cashier and the line was very busy. when I don't work as a cashier , I do stocking , doing reset. The hardest part working at wall greens is that when you work as a cashier ,you work alone at the front register and when robbery happens it is hard to stay safe. I was robbed three time and it was scared for my safety."
good,"It was an okay job but i think it just all depends on the management depending which store you are located at. Good benefits and gives you new learning methods and ways of customer satisfaction. Also you may be able to swtich to the pharmacy section which is very stressful. "
good,What I learned from Walgreens was that you didn't have to do just one section there. If someone needs your help in cosmetics or photo you can ask to be trained so you can gain knowledge of the area.
good,I started off my pharmacy career working here and it was a great stepping stone. I wouldn't be where I'm at now if I didn't take this job and learn more of pharmacy.
good,"Very good work balance as shifts are limited to 8 hour shifts at expense of days off,that being said Walgreens is cutting edge technology and training. Management can be a little cutthroat in preference for younger graduates. Has profit sharing rather than a 401 K"
good,I enjoyed working at Walgreens even though the pay was low and the benefits were not that great but I knew that I was not going to learn everything that I am allowed to do in accordance with State and federal law that I was going to have to get a job at a hospital so when the job offer at Hospice came up I took it
good,"Management was good at times. I stocked products, printed photos, helped customers with processing their photos, helping customers find products in the store, and also checking them out in a timely manner at the cash register."
good,When the shift supervisor should not be as hard as they make it. The shift supervisors takes on boy too many responsibilities for that title. The way that the store is rain by the store manager causes the shift supervisor to carry more weight than they should.
good,"It was an okay place to work, I liked being a pharmacy tech, but they just didn't pay very well and I felt like I had to move on.  We also never had enough staff and I would end up being a cashier, which was super annoying."
good,working with the retail business is always fun.some times its hard to satisfy the un happy customer. was enjoying the work with customer and staff.store working shifts and hours was vary. has to work in rotating shift was the hard part.
good,Once you get to work and clock in then it's time to work.  It's always something to do at Walgreens.  If you don't like to work and don't move with urgency then this is not the job for you.
good,"Filled medication orders per prescription. Ordered and stocked supplies. Input patient and insurance information into data system. Input prescribed information into system for submission to insurance."
good,Help customers with items stock merchandise on floor and prepair for special sells and setup sessional aisle.once a weeks check in all receiving and organize in warehouse
good,"The benefits are great, there are opportunities for growth and management varies by location. Overall a great job for students, retirees, someone in transition or to make a career."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walgreens, I liked the people I worked with especially management. Biggest problem was that I never knew when I was going to work except a week before so I really couldnt make plans and I was switched back and forth from working days and nights even multiple switches a week. If you know ahead of time when you need off like for vacation or medical/appointments, you will 9 times out of 10 get the time off as long as you communicate with the managers."
good,"worked here years ago, I had a great manager, pay was ok, but was in a high cost of living location, advancement was slow, worked lots of overtime during my time here."
good,"My day to day consisted of filling and handling customer prescriptions. I learned a lot of different things working in a pharmacy, resulting in my certification as a Pharmaceutical Technician. Unfortunately my overall experience was uncomfortable due to the management. When I had attempted to branch out to another store owned by her husband, she had me fired and humiliated... Other then that I loved my job and would have continued to work for the company. I was expecting a child at the time, and the steady paycheck and reasonable hours had really benefitted me at the time. If it wasn't for the management complications, which had been recently resolved, I would have continued to work for this company."
good,"Good training ground for pharmacists good technicians and excellent technical support, management almost absent and cutting cost at store level is punitive."
good,Walgreens has reinforced my ability to interact with individuals. Learned that I can adapt to any work environment and new tools to create an opportunity for myself.
good,"Very diverse and multicultural oriented. Many things to learn on a daily basis. Also a very competitive workplace, being that individuals would like to be promoted quickly."
good,a typical day at work is exciting you learn more and it's challenging sometimes. what I have learned was when you on the job for a long period of time you and your staff grow as a family . The hardest part of the job is when the staff calls out and there is no one to cover the shift and you have to do a double.The most enjoyable time is when everything is running smooth with no call ins.Also when we are allowed to have over time hours.
good,Store Managers must be pharmacy technician certified and be flexible to work as the business demands. Benefits were good. The constant change of the company was tough to deal with at times as you got used to one way of working they went and changed it or demanded different things. No two stores were the same. Dealing with shrink was tough especially in the bad parts of the area.
good,"The store managers were NEVER a problem. I worked in the Pharmacy towards the end of my time at walgreens and i found that the Pharmacy managers were very uptight, unfair, not very pleasant to be around."
good,"Technician rotation of various parts of the pharmacy. Starting with Drive through window, patient pick up, solving insurance related issues , ringing patients out at the in store pick up window, Filling medications, and taking in orders. Data entry, and filling the automated medication dispensing machine."
good,Walgreens gave me the materials and tools to advance my career and to help others. Overall I learned many things from this workplace and would definitely recommend it to a friend.
good,"coworker would call me ""black girl"" over speaker in front of customers, and management did nothing. they also called me ""cancer girl"". coworkers would smoke weed in their cars and leave me by myself in store."
good,"My retail experience was fairly average."
good,"Good place to work and help with customer service.  Can be stressful during peak times when there aren't many associates working to manage the registers.  However, you have to stand and work on your feet all day and be able to lift heavy totes to stock the shelves.   Great benefits."
good,"Based on past employers Walgreen's falls below in pay and advancement opportunities compared to NM anyway. Maybe this is average for MI I am not sure, I have a great manager but to move up from team Leader is going to be difficult based on the ability to advance. Another draw back is recognition. Everyone is recognized except management and that isn't right. We work harder and knowing your doing a good job is important."
good,Wallgreens is a fun work environment to be at.  Working and helping customers is great and the time flys by.  Low pay though and no benefits and not enough hours.
good,"Typical of retail, long hours on your feet, day or night. Very positive team environment.  Lots of variety.  Very gratifying to help customers.  Pay is typical for retail."
good,"Walgreens as a whole is great, individual stores could use better work as in the difference is huge. I went from a fast paced store to a very slow store."
good,"I feel like the floor level positions are ideal for students, or teenagers looking for good part-time work experience. If a career in retail is your interest then there is a lot of potential for advancement to asm."
good,"I really enjoyed working there. It was a nice, fun, and productive atmosphere. I always had The opportunity to for advancement as well. The managers were were very nice and very knowledgeable as well."
good,"Bad co-workers, they are petty. I liked management, the co-workers always slack off. They don't cover you when you need them to. Not the best enviroment."
good,"Train & mentor Associates in a high volume retail setting. I learned superb customer service, showcasing merchandising techniques, and driving profitable items. The management team worked together in harmony. The workplace culture was decent. The hardest part of the job for management was having a weekend off. The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to have promotional items and knowing your ideas were heard."
good,"I have been an employee of Walgreen's for nearly three years now. Since my initial Employment, I have been promoted twice after achieving my permanent state license for pharmacy, and then after passing the PTCB exam. Each of these accomplishments were accompanied by a pay raise. I have, to my great disdain, been unable to procure a permanent position in the pharmacy; although I am regularly scheduled as a technician in the pharmacy.  I hope that this brief sumnation of my situation at Walgreen's has been made clear. Many changes have occurred in a short period of time; some for the better and some to the detriment of employees. This is a reason for my passive and continuous search for other employment."
good,i have a good job but its been many years and now im looking for a new direction.i have been a great worker at walgreens always on time and willing to work any shift and any schedule i like working with the public but i feel its time to look elsewhere.
good,"Most of the staff at Walgreens was wonderful to work with, as well as most of the management. They really tried to work with me as far as the hours I was available and when my children were sick."
good,"Fun and very fast pace working environment. Management and staff are very friendly. However, feel like you are under paid and not recognized for work that you do."
good,"The management for the most part are helpful and understanding, there is 1 or 2 supervisors that could be more helpful. All the employees are nice to work with. The store I work at is a bit stressful because it is open 24 hours and the Pharmacy seems to always be busy. I'm in the process of adjusting to part time because of an injury and it's been difficult to get my Pharmacy schedule changed due to lack of staff availability."
good,"a typical work day would consist of costumer service and restocking, i learned how to use a till, do inventory, and customer service. The management was great. very understanding people. work culture is dependable. hardest part of job was hours. the most enjoyable part of the job was customer service."
good,Good company to work for.  They treat their employees well and keep a low stressful environment to work in. Benefits have good coverage and you can have family members on your plans
good,"Growing up and in high school I was one of the kids who never knew what they wanted to do after graduating or what school they wanted to attend. So I mainly worked whenever I could and then I stumbled upon this job. This was my first ""real"" job. I absolutely loved it.I loved the fast paced environment, learning about meds, insurance, laws etc, helping people, furthering my work experience and eventually I became licensed and certified which was an amazing feeling to finally have something that I truly love to do and be able to advance my education and work skills. I learned a lot about people and customer service with this job. I really got to know the community and I felt like when I woke up every day and went to work I had a purpose and I was going to make a difference that day be it big or small. Being a CPhT is truly what I want and what makes me happiest right now. I find it to be a very rewarding job and I thrive in fast paced environments, and am very fast and accurate with data entry once I get the hang of things."
good,I loved everything about working there except the fact that we were given a 21 day notice of our store closing. We were given no compensation or job offers for other positions.
good,"management is lacking, some are promoted because of family , then current manager is totally fake she pretends to care about the employees and customers. I enjoyed working with all my co-workers and customers as I enjoy helping others in any way. I got terminated because I saved a customer $80 for a wheelchair purchase because the customer was elderly and didn't want a walgreens card so I gave her the sales price without having a card. I went above and beyond as I delivered customer orders from online purchases and put them together and educated customer on how to use, went and got change from my personal bank because management mismanaged the amount of money in store or didn't submit change orders. management is a joke but I did enjoy co-workers and customers as much as family."
good,"An average day at Walgreens for me was great... the staff that I had the privilege to worked with was like family to me...some days where stressful but, for the most part of my time at this company I liked my job. They offered decent benefits ,for every store opening there was an add personal day for each employee to take at any time."
good,"The employees are great people. We do our best to help each other on the job and off. I liked the employee discount and large variety of items that we sell. "
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is being around good people and getting to know them further, also building trusting relationships with them. A typical day is just handling all managerial duties throughout the day and making sure the store is running smoothly for the customers and employees as well."
good,I am interested in this job because I believe that I can have enough time to be able to countinue my education. At Walgreens pay good but I wouldn’t have enough time to study. Thank you.
good,"My store manager and my pharmacy manager are the best of the best. They’re the only ones that make the job less stressful. Love them for sure, other than that idk"
good,I enjoyed working at this location. The environment was stressful at times but the pay was really good at the time that I was working there. I enjoyed meeting the people I worked with.
good,You work your days away.  That is for sure.  Personal growth really doesn't exist.  Hang stickers on walls and sell candy bars is the name of the game.
good,The place was clean very fast pace. In most situations things seem to be always a panic. But overall management and employees had an open door policy.
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work however the management can make you think about working for Walgreens, Not all walgreens is bad its just certain ones that have awful management that dont care about the employees,"
good,"I worked as an intern at Walgreens retail pharmacy, along side pharmacists and technicians.  It is a great job, and I learned a lot in my time.  The workplace culture is fast paced, but most of the time the team worked well together."
good,"I loved my position at Walgreens, however, had to move on after 3 years.  The people and team were great, though there was little to no job advancement or salary increase.  I wasn't motivated or valued enough to stay."
good,"Lots of wonderful people "
good,The people were excellent to work with but I did not like the non-set hours.  I worked every holiday and most weekends which got old quickly.  I do not mind working overtime but the not knowing what my schedule was going to be from week to week got old quick.
good,"Nice company to work for, friendly people, many locations for convenience, nice benefits, lack of hour sometimes depending on amount of employees....."
good,Clock in work put to work stocking intel 2 PM then to main register
good,"The hours go up & down,  there are never enough to go around, only a few get full time, company relies too much on pharmicutal sales, management inconsistent"
good,"A typical night at work would be mostly quiet. I learned how to refund, sale, advertise, and greet our amazing customers. The hardest part of my job was adapting t retail because of this being my first experience. Although this was a transformation i loved being able to expand y knowledge and help the people in my community."
good,Fast paced and enjoyable customer service focused work. Always opportunities to learn something new. Presented with new challenges almost daily. Physically demanding as days can be long.
good,I met a lot of people and helped a lot of customers find what they needed. Learned a lot about the cashier and sales department. Also did front door sales.
good,A good job to start off with to give you an insight on what work life would be like. There a lot of expectations that they expect you to live up to but nothing too bad.
good,"It is always fun, my cowokers are a blast to work with, management is always understanding. There is always something to do. The people always are friendly, or if not they are able to work around. I've certainly enjoyed it, just my commute and compensation have been lacking as of late."
good,"great starter job, just not good enough to make as a career. I would suggest this job for anyone looking for a part-time job. The pharmacy is the best place in Walgreens to work."
good,"Working in this company was alright until you start asking for advancements in the company or your position. If you are content in the position you were hired in then it is the ideal job with stable hours and good benefits offered. However, if you require quicker advancements, this may not be the place for you."
good,"I worked with many wonderful people, learned even more about Telecommunications, hardest part was being a contractor (no Holiday pay , Vacation Pay, Benefits pricey).  Loved the team work."
good,"Working at Walgreens was a relaxing job for the most part. A majority of the time I was working with pain in my leg but my boss always understood and flexed my hours if the pain ever got too bad. The most enjoyable part of the job was the feeling when I did a good job, putting smiles on my customers faces and them leaving happy."
good,"As the company evolves the minutia of the day to day changes to include more meetings, more arbitrary checklists, and more overall ""things to do"".  At the same time, at least at my location, hours are getting cut, employees are restless and not engaged, and the customer count is going down.  That said, it's not a difficult job and I don't hate it, I've been in retail for over 12 years and regardless of the changes in process the work itself is mainly the same."
good,"Relaxed place to work, frequently hires people with no prior experience, relatively easy daily tasks and responsibilities, sufficient amount of training provided."
good,Like working there into the company mad a lot of changes. New manager let ever one do what they want. A lot of the work would fall back on a few of the employees.
good,I love working at walgreens I'm just looking for a full time early morning job but I plan on still working at walgreens as a part time of only 2 or 3 days night shifts.
good,The workplace is very fast-paced and can be stressful at first. The discounts are nice and the satisfaction of the job depends on how good the management you have is.
good,"Typical day at work, opening the store, completing cash reports, releasing price changes, performing daily inventory counts, checking/maintaining safety logs, customer service issues, working as a pharmacy technician, preparing for special events, training new team members and growing existing team members, creating daily task lists for team members, merchandising to the seasons, unloading trucks, hanging sales signs for new ads."
good,"Quick paced with a lot asked of employees, but very easy to get into the groove of things. Management keeps a close eye but allows for advancements easily."
good,"Not a bad job, but there's not much growth within. All about getting their numbers and sales up. Definitely a corporate job. However, I've met a lot of good people through my co-workers."
good,"I do enjoy a great deal about working at Walgreens.  I have learned a great deal about retail and business while there.  My desire to leave stems from the fact that over the last few years their employee pay rates have become no longer competitive.  Since I am a supervisor this means the quality and experience of those I supervise varies greatly and the best of them quickly leave for higher paying jobs elsewhere and the worst of them wash out pretty quickly, leaving the leadership team to always pick up the slack. Corporate leadership claims to be committed to customer service but continually cuts hours and positions from their stores, This has gone on since shortly after I joined the company, across their entire North American Operation. I support the idea of keeping staffing at low levels and gaining efficiency through process improvement.I have managed such efforts for other employers but I do not believe that is what is happening at Walgreens at this time."
good,It was a newly opened store.fast paced and very busy.I learned a lot.The management staff was very patient and helpful to all of the new workers.enjoyed my time there
good,"very fast paced, learned alot of information as a pharmacy tech, however there was not room for advancement at my location and they had to cut hours. That is all that I can really think of at this time"
good,"This role is not my career ambition; very fast paced, can be stressful, not enough help, customers are very demanding.  I'm on my feet all day.  They don't hire the best people to be store managers"
good,"At Walgreen's the place runs itself, but the shift leaders there do what they want and treat their subordinates like children. also if you made a complaint about a manager they would not be honest, and very strict about rules they end up rude and upsetting customers."
good,"It is a very good place to work, always busy and have something to do. Good people and great staff. Always room for advancement if you are a hard worker."
good,You have a set list of task to do that can vary. You may have on customer service or you might be socking and ordering product. I personally had to be everywhere and be able to do everything sense I worked in the photo lab and the floor.
good,"With Walgreens you knew what was expected from you each and everyday."
good,It could be stressful at times but it was overall a fun place to work. The pay was low and there were no benefits for part time employees. Great managers
good,nice to work in fast faced challenging environment it was a good experience and lot of new technologies to learn and handling onshore offshore teams on the whole satiefied
good,If I had more pay I'd definitely stay but it's just not enough to live on as a mgr I only get paid 11$an hr but it is very close together the managers are always on your side if things go south.and their is usually enough time to mess around it's very relaxed. And no one is to condecending towards you. But you will have some people that get on your nerves
good,"In an ever changing field of care it can be a demanding job but rewarding as well, at least in pharmacy. You will always learn something new, meet interesting people, and build relationships. Management is different in every location and can change frequently, so i say they do there best overall with whats given to them. I enjoyed working with my pharmacy team, we were a family and everyday was rewarding even if busy and stressful."
good,Walgreens is an okay place to work. It enough to get by in life. If you work hard and you can move up and become management. Moving up is not easy as managers have to quit or get fired. They are not quitting any time soon.
good,"I loved my retail job at Walgreens! I was close with all my coworkers and everyone within the company is very friendly. Customers can be both amazing and demanding. You may even become acquainted with some of them if they visit frequently. Promotions are semi easy to achieve if you prove that you are a hard worker and can promote certain sales."
good,easy going customers. lovely co workers. not so great manager all the time but nice people overall. you have good long days of work and also short days. wish I didn't have to leave overall.
good,It's a good job while taking classes for college. Fairly flexible hours. Pay is low when compared to other pharmacy tech positions. can be high stress if you're in a busy location.
good,"While I worked there I found it was a very pleasant place to work, good pay, great management, and decent customers. If you ran into a problem generally management had your back."
good,We we’re always having fun while we also were getting all of the tasks completed. Some days were a lot busier than others but we made sure to fulfill customer needs and complete our work list.
good,"I liked working for Walgreens. The other employees were nice to each other, management was good and had a nice break room. Work clothes were relaxed( a Walgreens T-Shirt). I would recommend people to work there."
good,The pharmacist in charge or PIC of this Walgreens always had a good attitude towards techs and patient alike. The store managers always jumped in to help if needed. Walgreens is a good place to get your feet wet in Pharmacy.
good,"Tried to cut hours which I believe put patients in danger.  Expected more from techs while giving them less hours..  Also  somebody taking over the schedule who knows nothing about your department when you have all had the same rotating schedule for years then tells you it's ""because he can""."
good,"Didn't take long for me to advance in positions, not really busy until the holidays. Occasionally have just because breakfast/lunch for appreciation, it gets so slow that employees start to click up in groups instead of being friendly all around."
good,"On a typical workday you would have to go back and forth between your Isles, and customers and ensuring the customers found everything they needed. I learned how to manage my time to get my work done. the hardest part of the job was probably the resets it takes a lot of time to do. The thing I like about my job is that I got to meet different people and see how interesting they can be"
good,I was lucky enough to work at although a busy store was properly managed. Which kept everyone at work at ease. Advancement opportunities are there if you really push for it.
good,"The reason this was such a great place to work was the awesome management. It was normally 11 hour shifts, which gets very tiring. Customers are usually sick and they're coming to get medication. But I've only had a few managers since who were so efficient, yet did not micromanage!"
good,Good place to go if you're struggling to find a job. They can find you a job pretty fast. Temps do get paid less than what you're working for but its easier to get hired on as a temp than someone else.
good,"Over the last few years of my employment there, the role of the store manager changed drastically. There was no more creativity, decision making or control of managing my store. It is all corporate run now."
good,The Walgreens I work for is 24 hours and is very busy filling on average around 500 prescriptions. The co-workers are great and make your shift easy going. Very smart ladies that are very knowledgeable and willing to help you whether your a technician or a new pharmacists right out of school.
good,"I worked in a few stores in almost every department. It's a great starting job, better than working in fast food. Every store is different, but I felt the culture in most stores is very positive, but lots of ""employee relations"" drama."
good,I was a SFL at walgreens. We did everything a manager did but got paid only $11.50. We had to be able to do everything in the store. Be great with customer care and work well if our employees. Also had to be able to deal with large sums of money and time management. I loved my job but bosses were not good with working with schedules. Pay also was not reasonable. A lot of the things corporate asked of us to do was also unreasonable.
good,with opportunities to advance.  Old school culture turning into a new school approach where feedback is provided from bottom to top as well as top to bottom.
good,"I worked at a high-traffic store which meant many customers throughout the 24-hour store. Employees are taught to help coworkers and managers where and when needed and, thus, you learn many different jobs in a short amount of time. I loved my coworkers, the variety of my work, and the way in which others entrusted me to be self-motivated and responsible in meeting project deadlines. You can advance very quickly if you prove to be a hard-working individual and do your best for the sake of the store, the customers, and your fellow employees. A large concern was the lack of security, however, as this is greatly needed in stores that are open overnight and are at greater risk of theft, robbery, and other possible criminal activity."
good,"working 12 hours a day in a fast paced pharmacy keeps you alert and focused. Having a good management is vital during the work day. Overall, job security is great however, management could be improved."
good,"Overall, the culture at Walgreens is very diverse. My typical day at work includes working on the Functional requirements, Business requirement, and creating Flow Charts."
good,This was just a summer job. On the first day I went from stocking in the stock room to working the cash register. You would get 2 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch break.
good,The work environment was inside a Walgreens and a beautiful environment. The products were wonderful and thats what made the job a pleasure getting gratis and education. However the culture and works conditions were in a grey area with do's and dont's.
good,A work day Consists of Customer Service and much stock locations. Organizing while sorting making displays their best and improving services through out the store.
good,"Working for Walgreens was fun.  The pharmacy manager is one of the best pharmacists I have ever worked for.  He is very fair on scheduling."
good,"Oversee Front End operations. "
good,"I would get to work and start my day at the register. well working at the register I greet customers, check them out with their selected items. then I wold take inventory of the cigarette wall and stock the mini checkout. then I would do resets up front if I wasn't to busy with customers. the hardest part of my job was keeping an eye on customers for potential robberies. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers."
good,"I would like to inform you that due to illness of my wife i had to resign , but thank god all worked out good everything is ok. she is much better . I worked so hard for the past years in Orlando Florida & happy in each job. All in IT & PC support as well as net working ."
good,"You are required to stock shelves, increase sales and check people out when they are ready. some people have the responsibility to work photo and beauty and help out customers in those certain areas."
good,"Walgreens isn't a bad place to work once you get into leadership.  I was hired as an assistant manager 10 years ago.  Aside from the inconsistent scheduling and dealing with typical customer service and workforce issues, its not bad.  The money is decent...the insurance maybe comparable for the position, but is still fairly expensive for lackluster coverage and high deductibles."
good,"I started off as entry level, I asked to be trained in the photo lab, the young lady who did it in the evening called off every other day, so I offered to come in and be trained, at first they were grooming another, who quit without noticed, they then trained me, I took that lab from an average of 40 rolls a day to 80 rolls a shift an eight hour shift, my lab cecame number one in sales, profits and roll count, , most of the co-workers were hardworkers, most of the management were hard workers, there were a few bad eggs, and some devious people."
good,"Working as a pharmacy technician I've learned so much responsibilities. From time management to organizational skills. Everyone on my team works together to get the job done and that makes the days go smoothly. The hardest part about being a pharmacy technician is multitasking and keeping up with the work flow. The most enjoyable part is feeling accomplished when I'm able to solve a tough situation with my team. However, the pay just isn't enough to last a lifetime, realistically."
good,Great employees and benefits. Company stable if you work in the retail stores.  Corporate works together as a team. Enjoyed my years spent and learned a lot.
good,"Great place to work but too much work load. Nice team enjoyed working at walgreens in different environments.  Management was very cop-operative, learned  a lot how to manage Offshore team."
good,"If you're in high school, this is a good place to start working. It can be fast paced depending on the season (Christmas is the busiest time). If you're there long enough, you can be promoted either at the store you're at, or another store."
good,"Very friendly coworkers. "
good,Great benefits and pay. The work culture wasnt quite as friendly as you would expect though. Opportunity for advancement throughout company. I am so done writing this stinking review. Thanks indeed.
good,"I gained alot of knowledge from them, was able to ask questions, and grow in my position. I enjoyed working for them. Everything moved fast, so there was no time to waste."
good,"I remember walking into Walgreens' door that morning at 8:00am, saying to myself ""Today will be like every other day, busy"".   This day wasn't a typical day, going in seeing smiling faces and laughter being shared. Usually I lift up the store with my smiles and laughter, reminding them to stay positive. There are times my coworkers are drained, feel like work is overwhelming and management isn't listening to their personal issues, their needs. However, walking into the office seeing donuts and coffee being passed out and hearing management giving an uplifting speech encouraging us to work smart. Even though, every morning we always hear ""You guys are doing much better on truck continue the good work"" but this time this speech had a little twist to it. They see our dedication  to work smart, completing every task and make sure our customers are leaving the stores with everything they need and satisfied. Management showed some appreciation for our thrive. That day showed me, hard work pays off, even though you think you aren't being heard, there is always someone listening to your dissatisfaction and laughter."
good,better for those who are in school. Not very much room to grow in your own city. unless you know someone. Alot of random foolishness good company if store management is worth anything
good,Get to choose your schedule. Management worked around my school schedule. Medical benefits were really good. Going to one of Walgreens Health Care clinics was only $5.
good,For my first job it was pretty good. If i was working there now i probably would like it more considering i'm more into makeup and have more knowledge of the subject. Being a cashier was pretty easy except for having to learn all of the cigarettes. Management was helpful and made sure i felt comfortable doing my job.
good,"very busy with orders and patients/people"
good,I would interview and train new beauty consultants. I would go to each store and touch base with them. Talk about store sales in the beauty department. Keep data in sales in that department.
good,Even though I did not work here long I really enjoyed the staff and customers. Learned good customer service skills and became TABC certified  per job requirements.
good,Not a bad place to start I suppose. I don't really have any positive or negative things to say. My experience was blah. The employees were seemingly nice. I still keep up with some of them.
good,It was a great job because I was able to meet new people everyday. I was able to help them and tend to their needs. great place to gain experience in talking with patients.
good,People always calling out. The culture was every person for themselves. THe hardest part of the job was when we stopped taking peoples insurance it left a bad taste in my mouth because they were forced to go elsewhere.
good,"Hectic job and high volume, but ultimately I feel decently compensated. Unfortunately the hiring process is very unorganized and more difficult than it should be."
good,"mostly filling meds, unpacking ""auto fills"", and helping customers. insurance and prescription input all centralized. ................................"
good,"Better training for management and team members.  Value store operations ie truck getting put up, resets being done over customer service.  Make false promises concerning advancement unless they like you as a person.  Does not value management experience"
good,"I loved working in Walgreens, I learned how stock  shelves and list and price items. My first summer job was at a Walgreens and it gave me experience in retail."
good,I started working at Walgreens as an after high school/ college job and it was great job when it came to working with my school schedule and getting extra hours around the holidays. However what I do not like about the company is low pay versus the amount of work. As an adult the full time rate as a shift lead manager is not enough to afford living in Colorado.
good,Amazing company to work but opportunity for advancement is minimum. There's so many aspects for continuing to work for Walgreens but when you have a family it takes front row.
good,I loved working at walgreens. I was blessed with wonderful managers and coworkers.I am a competitive person and enjoyed participating  in saturdates but wish we had more store competitions. I was not a fan of how my store scheduled people!! the same staff got to work the morning shift every single day and have the holidays off. that is extremely unfair. As i moved up the ladder with walgreens the schedule never got better the same few where working the best shifts.
good,"Provide Medication Therapy Management (MTM) for patients by going through medications list in order to identify drug-related problems and make evidence-based recommendations to physicians focusing on Diabetes Management, Hypertension, Dyslipidemia, identifying Inappropriate Drug Therapies (Beers Criteria, etc.) then share safe and rational therapeutic alternatives and monitoring plans with treating physicians. Supervise the functional activities of pharmacy technicians and manage workflow, etc."
good,The management was nice and it was overall a good place to work for. If you work in pharmacy there isn't much room for advancement. The weekly scheduled changed as to what hours you work each day.
good,"Very great store just bad management.  I worked there for 1.5 years & never got written up or anything. Its very slow paced, so the day goes by slow. Overall pretty decent job"
good,management was fair they expected me to be cordial and dressed in the appropriate attire dealing with customers fluctuated from day to day customers would take to you pretty frequently and enjoyed seeing me and talking to me
good,"Arrive at work, exchange small talk with coworkers and customers throughout the day. Stock and straighten shelves and direct customers to various products. Deal with occasional shoplifters, then go home."
good,"I enjoyed working for Walgreens for the last couple of years, but was not treat fairly. I learned a lot during my time there, and I enjoyed getting to know the customers and helping them with their needs."
good,"Walgreen's was a great job to work at. The employees and management were very friendly. If I had the chance, I would work here, again. We worked 7 days straight and was off the next 7 days."
good,"Walgreens is a good company to work in when there are good workflow in the pharmacy. Sometimes, you can be working alone for the entire 10 hours shifts so it does become stressful. The working dynamics is fast-pace and must know how to handle multitasking."
good,Was promised full time and my hours kept getting cut so I dropped to part time and they pay you a little over minimum wage. Did not like some of the recent changes and the asst manager seemed to careless about the employees.
good,"The company is good, benefits is ok. You learned a lot of things inside the store. The hardest part is to deal with customers complaints.The management is not treating employees equally. very strong favoritism. salary is low."
good,"Since I work at one of the busiest Walgreens in the city of Chicago, you must be able to work in a quick paced environment, know how to multi-task, and put your best foot forward. The hardest part of the job is having to deal with inappropriate and rude customers. Overall, Walgreens is a tedious job, but it pays the bills."
good,Walgreens was a great place to do my externship for school. The staff were nice and helpful. They answered any questions I had. Everyone was great. Good place to work retail.
good,Not a bad place to work if you're looking for a nice part time job.. People are friendly and management are friendly also.. Pay isn't great but good for a part time job.
good,"If I had no concerns at home this job would be perfect. However, my son is disabled and it is becoming almost impossible to be here when he needs me. All of my absences from work have been related to him."
good,"A typical day was working on the prescriptions and filling them out, counting and finding out what needs to be restocked and rotating merchandise, answering the phone, and talking to the customers and helping in they need it."
good,Fast paced work environment interacting with customer as well as employees. Being able to multi task and understanding that the customer is all ways right.
good,This is a good job for someone in college or with little qualifications. I took this job part time to help out someone. There was a lot of promises but rarely any were kept.
good,There was always plenty to do and I enjoyed my co-workers very much.  The employees worked together as a team and made for a pleasant work atmosphere.
good,Great Co-Workers. I have been working there seven years and I must say I have seen people come and go. Its a difficult work environment but once you get use to it then things are smooth
good,"Walgreen's has good training and their Managers ""get it:"" I have worked for both CVS and Walgreen's, and Walgreen;s is better, They have better training and understanding of their employees. But, the jobs are all very physical. Be prepared to work hard."
good,"Stocking shelf's for the whole shift or working at a cash register for the shift"
good,"Usually understaffed, and underpaid. Although staff is always pleasant and kind. Pays less than competing drug stores, but willing to work around school schedules."
good,love the busy workflow there's always something to do and learn everyday. learned to be more patient and understanding to patients needs and wants. love the diversity at work. feels like a second family. Hardest part is trying to do so much if it gets super busy and may not have enough help at the moment. what I love the most is making people smile makes all the hard work worth it
good,"After retiring from the banking and financial services industry seven years ago, I finally decided after a number of years, to seek a part time job at my local Walgreen's store. I thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of the store associate position, and when I decided to move to a better retirement place, I took the job with me!"
good,A typical work day is busy and fast going. Awesome customers who care and show love to you as if you're family. Management is very nice to all employees.
good,Excellent work environment. Management works hand and hand with employees to deliver effective customer service to clients. Very slow promoting process.
good,"As a shift-lead responsible for opening store, cash management, ordering and maintain inventory. Supervise a staff of 10 employees daily, task completion."
good,Little to no room for advancement. I was in management for three years at the same rate of pay. Classes were taken often. I exceeded my training and did excellent customer service and Managing.
good,"A typical 8hr day at Walgreen i would face many challenges throughout the day. i learned to stay in your power zone, to locate, scan, and pick items from the proper location. there was good management they help and try to understand the individual. the hardest part about the job would be the time of day i would have to be up. the best thing about the job would be the people."
good,I enjoyed working at Walgreens. A small team in the business office. Supervisor was very personable and had an open door policy. The team members were easy to work with very dependable.
good,"The job overall was fine.  It was just way too fast paced for me, and they were always very slow to hire because the corporation of Walgreens ignores the needs of their employees.  I EXTREMELY dislike the corporation of Walgreens, but I did like the people at the actual store I worked at. Unfortunately, I left because I couldn't handle the pace of the Lumberton location, and the lack of help the corporation wansn't providing, only to hear that not all pharmacies are that way ( just my first and only pharmacy to work in) after I let my certificate expire.  I was very disappointed because I loved what I did, just not what I had to deal with."
good,"They care about their employees."
good,Management pay is great and lots of opportunities for advancement if you really want to grow within the company.  Bonus program is great as well.  Work was intense and rain sun or shine you had to open your store or else.  I never felt that there was a concern for health and well being of employees.  When I worked there we had to stay open if Hurricane or snow storm was coming.
good,"Good work environment, good employees,I enjoyed training new employees, working in the Pharmacy and just communicating and building new relationships with our customers on a daily ,weekly and monthly basis. I had several managers during my tenure, I adapted and created my own management styles by shadowing them. I liked the fact there was a sound organizational structure and leadership from upper management."
good,"Its a great store , at times can get busy and under staffed. Which is a great load to worry about when your the only one on the register. While on register can get annoying. working the floor is much easier because there are not much customers that need to be tended to"
good,"A typical day at work included working with costumers closely, stocking, and maintaining a clean work environment. Management was extremely friendly and flexible at times. Through this helpful management I learned the importance of good costumer service and time management. The hardest part of the job was dealing with costumers that had problems that were out of my control as a Sales Associate. Although there were some tough times the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to establish a relationship with faithful costumers. All in all, Walgreens was a great work environment and I would highly recommend it as a first job."
good,While on my Walgreens rotation I got to work with a great team. They were friendly and willing to help me. Everyone was very nice to me and all of the customers. The workflow was great and there was great teamwork with the front store.
good,"never had a big problem with any of my coworkers, or higher ups. Didnt much care for the district manager, but his boss was awesome. job wasnt too physically demanding, other than the occasional heavy lifting in the stock room.. but even then wasnt too bad. my store was also willing to work with your schedule if you went to school or had other things you needed to do on a regular basis."
good,"Each day very active, customer contact enjoyable. Management was very supportive. Work place always clean.  Work hours were lacking, some weeks only 16 hrs. Learned to deal more with customers will real needs."
good,"It's a good job to have with great benefits. But like most customer service jobs, dealing with customers can be a stressful at times. But the pay was alright."
good,Walgreens is a nice place to work. Love my coworkers and the patients I've grown close to. Walgreens gave me a chance to become more than a simple cashier and I owe them so much for that.
good,Very friendly and family oriented atmosphere to work in. Manager was awesome and so we're the assistant manager and other regular employees I would recommend this business
good,There's a family like environment at Walgreens. There are great opportunities for advancement and moving up in the company! they have flexible work hours and are very understanding when working multiple jobs.
good,"Typical day of work..."
good,"There is little to none advancement opportunities here. It can be a fun job or totally awful depending on the management because you work closely with them most of the time unless you're a cashier. They pay for all your training/certifications. The only advancement opportunity would be getting into the pharmacy because they pay for all your training and you could make it an actually career. As for being a cashier or a floor team member, it's just a dead end job.  You only get like a 10%-15% discount on snacks and such. When I worked here, my store manager was known for being great at her job but short with employees so my work experience wasn't the best, but my sister works here and has a great work environment because of the management."
good,"It feels as though the company is always looking for ways to lower raises and lessen employee hours, through budget cuts.  However, that is probably one reason why the company is so profitable..."
good,"nice place to work, always have something to do, vacation time accumulates pretty fast, rough work schedule, sometimes you have turn arounds and weekends off very.  overall a nice job"
good,"Overall, a great starting company to work for. A not to serious, easy going environment. The people are good and work with you to be sure everything is understood."
good,I loved all the employees that i worked with! I loved the 15% discount on all products. The managers are awesome and I wish i was still able to work there!
good,A typical day at work is very productive and fun. I learned how to have a better perspective on working with the public. The management is okay not too bad. The hardest part of my job was stocking. The enjoyable part was my team members working all together to get things done.
good,Walgreens is a easy going place but there is alto of rules to follow. if your a person that can take order i recommend it foe yu. the pay could be a little bit hire.
good,"Great company to work for. However, days are long and you are required to work nights and weekends. They offer a great benefit package including 401k and life insurance."
good,"My days were spent behind my counter taking care of customers,answering the phone and whatever tasks I was given for the day.It was not stressful, if you enjoy customer service."
good,"Friendly atmosphere.  Manager tries to make us feel more like a family now, which is a huge plus.  I like to feel like I'm noticed for the work I do while on the job."
good,I loved working at Walgreens.  It was great experience and  the management was great. Great customers. I would recommend anyone to work there if they want a part time job.
good,"A typical day at the job includes processing prescriptions, analyzing information from doctor's offices, insurance companies and the needs of our customers. "
good,"This job necessitates the cheeriness in customer service. Including the customer is always right method while following many rules, guidelines and laws that contradict their needs and desires. It is difficult to care much for a company that makes the work path for its employees best with a half hearted or fake smile. It is a great environment and job in many regards, but I've rarely felt like any employee higher than at my store level cared about the store level employees or the actual customers."
good,I enjoyed all of my coworkers and my managers were awesome! Very flexible with schedules and taking the time off for injuries or medical problems. Love it!
good,The companies overall culture is for the advancement of patient care. I love this idea since I like interacting with patients on a clinical level. Good company.
good,"I enjoyed my experience as a pharmacy intern at Walgreens, though there was definitely a focus on numbers which bothered me some. I prefer to have a lot of time to talk to patients about their medications and the store was very busy."
good,"Was a decent job, pretty easy. "
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with. When we started at this store, it was brand new so we all were there everyday to set it up for the Grand Opening. Some of the managers were pretty nice but some of them were power struck and weren't very friendly."
good,the workload for the job isn't unbearable on a daily basis but the just does not pay enough per hour/bi-weekly. The management are okay they just are illogical at times
good,"They make you earn your salary. Hours are kept so that in order for everything to be done, you must be working all the time. No lunch break, no time for sitting, and little time even to check your phone."
good,Job is demanding have to complete many task in a eight jour shift. You learn important customer service skills and ways to deal with people in different moods.
good,"Walgreen's was a very nice place to work. Unfortunatly, at the time I was having many health problems and was unable to complete my work on the job, so I had to quit. I would go back if they were hiring."
good,"If you like working with the public (I don't) then this would be an alright place to work.  Compensation was good, frequent raises if you are a hard-worker."
good,"The best thing about Walgreens are the flexible hours, but the worst thing is being open All day on every holiday even Christmas. Also, their focus on beauty sales has been a great positive."
good,An excellent company to work for. Encouragement to advance. Depending on location then willingness to work with personal schedules. Definitely a customer service oriented company.
good,I worked here for almost 6 years as an assistant manager.  The pay and benefits were great.  They paid for me to become a CPhT and had classes for the employees to learn.  But management was chosen/promoted based on who you know.  Some people were overlooked because they weren't with the in crowd even though they worked harder.
good,"Somewhat behind on cultural advances like diversity and HR practices. Family culture that is evolving, many ""old schoolers"" don't want to let go and grow...this holds the company back from being innovative below senior management levels."
good,"Easy going environment paired with efficiency. Learned to work as a team and as an individual. Preparing shelves for customers, ensuring they were filled and label facing the customer."
good,I love working here but there is very little room for advancement. The coworkers are amazing and customers are very friendly. The pay is ok but no raises
good,"I have learned how to handle rude customer."
good,"typical day , get to work, meet with colleagues to discuss days priorities."
good,"It is a position I would like to be in, however the company had no positions in the place where I wanted to be. A typical day was busy, but it was a kind of busy that I enjoyed being a part of. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with irate customers, but being able to figure out their issue and calm them down was also one of the best part of the job."
good,"A typical day at work would be cleaning/handling phone calls/ handling money transactions/ stocking/ money deposits/"
good,"A typical day at work was virtually smooth-sailing. Customers were normally regulars because of the pharmacy, and were usually joyful. The tasks given were not that hard to complete within 1-2 days of being given."
good,"A typical day at work for me, would be come in, and go straight to the register. I was one of the more favored cashiers, so that may have been a bit expected. Management did their best, but it was always a very busy store at my location. Overall, I learned the value of working together as a team, and everyone valuing the customer first. The most enjoyable part was the customer interaction I received from the job, and the hardest part was meeting some of the manager's criteria and some of the quotas. Although, they were efficiently met."
good,"This place is a good place to work at, there is never a dull moment and employees are friendly and fun to work with, the job is not out of this world and utterly simple, there is demand to lift heavy things especially on restock days. According to what i have heard from other employees working here is that the morale of the team depends on the leadership and is most times good."
good,Fast work day. They train you on the job. Customers are the hardest part of your day. Loved learning everything about working in the pharmacy.
good,A typical day at Walgreens would go by very fast. The store is always so busy and high paced. The coworkers all get along and create a great team. The management is great and very helpful.
good,My only complaint is the holiday hours; I ended up working several holidays that other stores were closed for (i.e. Christmas Day).
good,I get along with my co-workers and management most of the time. the hours kinda suck and so does the pay. staff and management look out for each other.
good,"A typical day is pretty much just putting products onto the shelves, working overstock into the shelves, and checking out customers. It's a great place to work if you get along with your coworkers."
good,Working here was a good experience. Some policies and procedures do need to be looked at but overall a good place to be. Lots of learning opportunities if your willing to put in the work.
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work if you want to stay busy. From the store to the pharmacy there is always something to do. Staying organized is a key driver at Walgreens. If you schedule correctly, there is always enough people around to get the job done. Everything does not have to fall on your shoulders."
good,This company lets me really be a part of my community. The people that come in on a regular basis have such a strong understanding of how I am able to supply them with the best care for their needs.
good,"In general its a good job all jobs have there ups and downs. Only true concern is the security, all the the stealing that come in and out. Besides that i enjoy my job."
good,Working at Walgreen's was fun and kept me busy. It was very fast paced and I had to attentive to my surroundings in case there was a customer that needed my help. I enjoy working there except for the management they were unprofessional and would belittle their employees.
good,"Great advancement options, and work from home options. Regular salary raises. Weekly meetings and monthly opportunities to express your concerns.  Many social activities for networking with coworkers."
good,Long hours and have to work very hard to get anywhere. Good management but everyone is promoted from within so difficult to get into management from the outside.
good,I take care of the store by making sure employers do their task. I work both morning and night shift. I learn new things everyday eg: how to fix a price on an item. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with my co-workers.
good,The company was a great place to work while going to school. They were flexible and accommodating with my school schedule. I think Walgreens is a great entry level job for people of all backgrounds and skill levels.
good,Working for this company you learn very quickly how to adapt your personal life to fit the company needs.  Although there are attempts for balance management can spend a majority of their time working during off hours.  Expectations are high to provide the best customer service but this can come at the cost of your personal time with your family.
good,"It was a long shift as a student in high school, but manageable with all the employees there who were excellent. I enjoyed my time working there."
good,"Help as much as they can to the customers and service is great."
good,The best part of this job was all my co-workers. Everybody was friendly and always helpful. I learned a lot on this job as well . The worst part of the job was having to work 3rd shift.
good,"I learned that each Walgreens is different, having worked at two separate locations, no two managers are alike. The atmosphere was different, but I enjoyed what I have experienced for the most part. You have to get used to the manager and a larger work load, but if you can take it, you will reap the benefits at the end."
good,"Its an easy job, management was nice.  Customers were ok. The location I worked at couldn't give me the days off i needed for school."
good,"Fast paced, always changing environment. Requires hard work and dedication. Cater to customers to ensure that they have everything that they need and perform tasks with a friendly and cheerful disposition."
good,"Customer friendly environment. Had what you needed all the time clean not over crowned shelves, I enjoyed working for this Company as well.."
good,"Good place to work if you like to learn and have time to perfect your job. You have a select amount opportunities to have leaders who can show you how to do select things and improve your leadership skills. There's a good flow of things to do each day, and new sales to promote."
good,High turnover rate lead to constant people in training and no consistent direction. management never communicated with each other and made basic tasks impossible to do correctly.
good,"It's a retail job. It's no different than any other retail job. Some locations you'll have a terrible boss. Some locations you'll have regularly terrible customers. As a company, much like most retail companies, Walgreens cares about you only in that you are a number. A number that comes to work on time and doesn't steal. Beyond that, not a care in the world is given."
good,Schedules are done a week or more in advance. Staff is fun and friendly to work with. Decent wages for the amount of work expected.
good,Walgreen's is a good place for a first job. It is not a very difficult job  but it teaches you the basics of work ethics. Also teaches you how to work as team to reach common goals.
good,Very influential and even though some tasks were difficult with the help of the great management team we were able to meet up to company standards. As well as advance and makeup and create neat displays through communication
good,I worked with several managers.  Some would work with you and help you to be the best that you could be.  Others would put you down and make you feel inadequate.
good,It;s a nice place to work and great staff that's willing to help when needed. Great management and their is room for advancement in the company as well.
good,It a good place to work advancement if you stand out.  Not a place to    call in sick or play hooky frowned upon. The managers are fairly easy to get along with just do your job and be punctual.
good,Very good starter in retail.Love the way customer shopping experience keep getting improved. Will always suggest other to work at walgreen's at the corner of happy and healthy..
good,I typically worked from home so I enjoyed my time. When I did work on site it was a pleasant experience with many opportunities to learn. I most enjoyed resolving claims so that patient were able to receive their medication
good,"Great working environment and employees"
good,"My time at walgreens was very interesting, I learned a lot about people who where in need of their medicine and I had a very good manager who allowed me to run the store."
good,The managers are very nice and so are the other employees. They are all very helpful and good people to work with. I learned a lot from working there because it was my 1st job and it taught me how a job environment works
good,People are nice and you end up seeing the same customers Hours are responsible. They offer health Insurance.You get a 15 minute break
good,"While at Walgreen's, I was a Cashier for the most part. I also helped with cleaning duties at the end of each shift. My former manager was pretty cool and so was everyone I worked with. There was always some crazy experiences we had with certain customers but that was part what made the job fun."
good,Workload is tough. I learned a lot though about day to day operations in a retail pharmacy. Nice experience.Having a lot of co-workers makes it easier and a better place to be in. Hardest part is multi-tasking.
good,I loved this job until I had a kid. The hours were crazy and I never saw my kid. When I was single it was perfect. I could work anywhere and everywhere and had plenty of opportunity for advancement.
good,"a long but fun day at work"
good,"A typical day at work for me would be to fill the patient's orders, assist in restocking prescriptions, labeling bottles, pulling deletes, typing on the computer, and customer service. My co-workers were very nice at times I got along with most of them and they taught me a lot while I was there. I learned how to fill prescriptions,pull expired jobs, and how to call the insurance company if the patient's insurance did not cover that drug. The hardest part of the job was typing the patient's orders because, majority of the the time the doctor's writing would be hard to read and I would have trouble reading it from time to time. The most enjoyable part of the job to me was them TEACHING me I was very greatful to them and I would never forget that."
good,"Nothing spectacular, the most important thing about that job was not necessarily the job itself but the coworkers at the particular place I was at. They were fantastic and really helped out a ton with things, very great at educating you about the work environment and getting you started on just becoming independent extremely quick. That's all I would like to say, the job itself could go from a boring day to extremely busy in just a minute and customers will be customers, either incredibly nice, passive, or abhorrent."
good,"Assistance other departments with unloading the truck. Set up new beauty display items. Stock its in the department isles. Run cashier in beauty department. Assistance customer and offer help when asked. Assist in running front register when needed. "
good,"A lot of the job is daily tasks, stock new items and overstock and then do the closing duties. I've learned a lot about time management, how to interact with customers and how to double task. I have enjoyed all over my co-workers. So far the hardest part of the job is just getting everything you need to get done before the end of shift."
good,Its a good environment to work in. Its just a little slow at times so you dont do much unless you have stocking to do. Co-workers are what makes this job fun because you interact with them a lot. Management is okay they try to help you at times.
good,"Worked long hours and schedule was always different. General manager was understanding and very supportive of the employees."
good,Typical day is working on multiple projects each day and being prepared to switch focus at a moment's notice.  Receive about 50-60 emails per day from company announcements to project challenges and accomplishments.
good,"Heavy rx volume"
good,"The hours are Flexible, Good Co-Workers a plus.  I love doing Customer Service, I like to Help customers with whatever their needs are. I'm outgoing and love to meet and talk to the customers."
good,Worked overnight. It was ok but have a baby and it became hard to maintain working at this company. Started to become mean and didn't want to do anything. Felt like I was becoming a bad mother.
good,"Handled financial transactions, refilled prescriptions, created prescription labels,"
good,A lot of hard work but Walgreens definitely leaves their employees well rounded and gives plenty of opportunities to learn more of the many aspects of the business.
good,Good company many opportunities for additional employment offers. Profits sharing. 401k. Managers and district manger were very helpful and friendly with a open door policy
good,Learned a lot about retail management and got the opportunity to learn multiple job responsibilities that can prove useful in many other career opportunities.
good,"Significant amount of Travel involved"
good,"When I first started at Walgreens, it was a joy to be there. Then they began implementing new rules which made the job much less enjoyable without any compensation."
good,"I did love my position held and duties there. I enjoyed the customers and atmosphere. The only downfall was there where to many supervisors and the were never on the same page. The store manager wasn't involved much and we didn't have one person who made the schedule so most of us were scheduled outside our availability.The coworkers were awesome most of the time except when they were fighting on the sales floor. The hardest part of my job was being task redirected every hr by different managers and then being faulted for not doing something by other managers. Typical day was pulling all expired edibles, taking temperatures for all coolers, printing orders, providing customer service to all guests within my area, ordering supplies, stocking shelves, and any other tasks given by management. It seemed only that store that operated that way."
good,Love working here have been for almost 10 years. Love my patients and the employees. Had great benefits and then went down hill. The company makes budget cuts all round leaving you short staff because hours extremely cut.
good,Walgreens is a great company to work for if you want a stable reliable company to work for. Since the recession Walgreens many companies have crashed and burn. Walgreens has gotten stronger. They way that they do this is by under paying and cutting benefits for the hard working crews at the store level. With them doing so it has seriously damaged the job culture. The new CEO seems to be trying to changes this and hopefully it will succeed.
good,"Workdays were busy between filling patient prescriptions and tending to patients' needs. This was the starting point of my pharmacy technician career, so I learned a lot from my senior technician from proper sig codes for typing prescriptions to how to handle several different insurance rejections. Management and coworkers maintained a good blend of ""straight to business"" and family oriented attitudes. The most difficult part of the job was during rush hours when many patients would drop off and pick up their medications at once."
good,hard to advance but a fun place to work. It is a friendly atmosphere to work and people are really nice. There is on the job training and managers are helpful.
good,"follow proper work flow, type prescriptions, sort, file, fill, consult, keep a clean and neat area, co workers kept up alot of drama due too alot of estrogen, but learning exp. was very good."
good,My co-worker are nice and helpful. I have learnt a lot from Walgreens. The managements are willing to teach me everything. Customer service  is the hardest part of the job because I can not satisfied all the customers.
good,"Walgreens was a great place to develop money handling skills while being in school and earning my bachelors degree in accounting. While I enjoyed it very much, I've graduated and need to move farther along in my career."
good,The job itself was fun and challenging but the people I worked with where rude and disrespectful over my disability. I loved the challenges of working there but I was not wanting to have the verbel abuse at my work place.
good,"Pleasant work environment"
good,"Bookkeeping duties, printing out eob's from insurance company etc.  Bank deposits and posting.  Answer phones.  Updating pt accounts."
good,Day to day at Walgreens you will know what to expect. Depending on what pharmacist you are working with depends on how much work you will do. A lot of Walgreens pharmacist want to stay at their PC and let the techs run crazy all day so they can do as least as possible.
good,It was a good experience i had like the retail environment.I had learn how to operate a cashier . Hardest part working at walgreens was the inconsistency with the hrs
good,"The managers would always hand me their duties to me as I had to work the register as well because they knew I was efficient, hard-working, and dedicated to my work. I was always busy from the time I got there to the time I clocked out. My co-workers were not as efficient as I was so often they would take my place at the register while I was assigned to complete the labor in the store. The hardest part of the job had to be keeping up with everything handed to me. The most enjoyable part was encountering the regular customers that loved to come visit me."
good,I get to interact with all types of people every day and I enjoy the people I work with.  Some days are stressful and some days are not.
good,"Fun place to work at, good flexible hours. Great benefits and fast paced environment, always something new to do.  Friendly staff."
good,"Productive"
good,"its not bad , but pay is only 9.00 an hour. but if u want to move up in managment its pretty good pay. The job i'snt hard and thats all i have to say"
good,"I worked at walgreens for 2 years. it was a decent place to work. I started there when I was in high school and they were able to work with me during school and also worked with me when I left to go to college. The management was fairly decent. The company kept moving people around so I think we had 4 different ASMs and 2 head  store managers while I was there. But overall, the people I worked with were really nice and it felt like a second family. Everyone was easy to get along with and there were never any problems between employees. Also giving 1 star on benefits because i wasn't full time long enough to receive any of the insurance and things like that. you do earn vacation time pretty easily though."
good,The environment is good with positive vibes. However managment will play with your hours and then lie about whether you were offered full time or part time
good,"Everyday is a learning experience. Different kinds of customers, employees and management make this a fun place to work at"
good,"It was a delight working here. I would recommend this company to anyone. The people who work here are kind, careful and caring."
good,"Walgreens gave me a great opportunity to get better with my communication skills. Also, how to do with customer service skills. The co-workers were very nice and always willing to work as a team. The management team was really organized, the hard part about the job was being able to do projects on a short period of time, I still managed to get them done though. The most enjoyable part were the customers."
good,a very famous and busy place to work with different kind of customers everyday to deal with. Team work is great and managers always there to guide you
good,"Great company to work for. Fast paced and friendly environment, there's never a dull moment at a Walgreens Pharmacy. The hardest part is managing home life with children and work. Would be a great place for students to work because of the flexible hours."
good,Fast paced work place with opportunity for advancement and helpful programs to make sure you receive training required
good,The company has great benefits.  Has a good environment to work. The hours vary for time to time so that makes it hard.  Overall a great company.
good,Working for Walgreens was great. I always received good benefits with the company. I really enjoyed working there and enjoyed working with all the people there. They promote engagement and empower their employees.
good,"I felt like the job was fairly simple but management made the job less desirable and made the work too monotonous. Thus, going into work seemed for of a dread rather than work."
good,"I loved there area of the work place. The people came into the store was awesome people to meet. I love working with the people at my job was very friendly. The only down fall about the job was lack of communication with the co-workers and managers, but i love the people."
good,"Company is stable and growing. With the growth, lack of manpower has put a load on current employees and their freetime. Schedules have changed from getting hired for a 5 eight hour workweek, to 4 ten hour workweek, now 3 12 hour workweek. Not favorable or have any choice."
good,"Co-workers are nice and caring, the hardest part of the job were the customers and the most enjoyable was the people i worked with, I learned a lot about customer service at that job"
good,Walgreens is a company that has a long and prolific history. The management demonstrate industry leading innovation and I learned a lot working for this company.
good,Walgreens is focused on growing the brand.  THis comes at the cost of the store managements (Both front and in pharmacy) life away from the store and the constant hassling from district offices to dedicate more of your time to company functions.
good,"Not many huge pros or cons.  You won't feel overly loved by corporate but you aren't treated like trash either.  Mostly, how much you enjoy your job will depend on the people in your store."
good,"Walgreens is good company to work for. They have good benefits and room for advancement. I learned a lot while working there and loved the people I worked with. You have to be willing to go above and beyond and work hard if you want to work here. There is a lot of lifting because you stock a lot, managers did too. Be ready to sweat as the workload is often heavy. There is always something to do, so you don't get bored. I would have to say the worst part about working at Walgreens is the fact that you have to work holidays which are mandatory, and your schedule can vary ALOT. You work a lot of weekends and the 10+ day stretches of working are a lot to handle if you have children. I would get scheduled for one week, Tues-Sat, and on the next schedule get Sun-Thurs and opening and closing would fluctuate often during that time.  It was crazy and I was always told ""This is retail, get used to it.""  The other bad thing was the turnarounds.  I  was often scheduled to close the store, and then scheduled to open the next day. Sometimes we would only get a couple hrs. of sleep before having to be right back in, and this happened several times in a two week work period. There is often a lot of overtime offered cause the staff turnover is so high. The pay was on the lower end of the scale for most jobs in retail. Overall, its a great job, but if you have a family, they can make it hard on you when scheduling."
good,I would arrive to work check the store make sure everything was neat. I would put out the trash then do my walk through the store and start my day with greeting the customers. I learned how to interact with others assist customers with what they needed. Direct them to the correct aisle. My supervisors were understanding and always willing to help. My co-workers were very friendly and helpful. the hardest part of the job was to watch who was stealing in the store. the most enjoyable part of the job was greeting customers and making them feel welcome along with directing them with the correct aisle.
good,"Worked for Walgreens for over 11 years.  It had its moments where I wanted to walk away but 11 years tells you something.   I started with no pharmacy experience as a Service Clerk up front, was moved to pharmacy within a month because I asked.   Trained for certification.  Test and Walgreens classes paid for.  Don't think this is typical anymore  though.  Promoted to Sr Tech about 13 months after certification.  Worked in 3 24 hour stores and opened up 2 other stores.  Overall, I loved it even though at times I hated it.  Customers can be tough but most of the time I had a good team to help deal with the stress.  Left for less stress (hospital pharmacy).  Over a decade of being yelled at by customers and told I was incompetent wore me down.  Not really Walgreens fault.  I admit I actually do miss it."
good,"Great hours , positive staff and managment, not so great policys. training was horrible and not overseen by a manager, and i had to be trained twice because the first person trained me wrong. otherwise it is a great place to work."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of waiting on guests, making sure they were finding everything okay, organizing shelves, cleaning the store, facing products, and building sets.  I learned what it's truly like to work in a retail store, and working in a store with a pharmacy I learned that people sometimes just need someone to smile at them and make them feel as if 'everything is going to be okay"".  Management seemed to be very involved, and cared about how their coworkers were doing each day.  They always had a smile on their face, and was always willing to help. Coworkers were usually willing to help each other, and always wanted to make sure things were getting accomplished to make the store look better.  The hardest part of the job was having to leave after 6 months because my husband got restationed in another state.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the team always working together to make sure we were delivering 100% customer service."
good,This is a good job for a college student.  Steady pay.  They work with your school schedule.  Plenty of opportunities to find a position you are comfortable working in.  It is a good environment to develop your customer service skills.
good,"The company was good to work for, I was raising to the top, but then we hired a pharmacy manager who had severe anger management problems and went out of her way to make everyday so stressfull."
good,"Creating daily tasks for employees to complete"
good,"Assist with all tasks in the Store"
good,"I had to stock, run cash register, clean the store, answer phones, help customers find items.  The general manager was really nice, and one of the assistants too, but a few of the managers were hard to deal with. There were a few really nice employees and a few that were not so nice to me or customers. I didn't like how I was scheduled to work a 9 day stretch. Standing on my feet for so long hurt my back. I enjoyed many of the customers."
good,"Filled prescriptions most of the time.  Helped customers get their meds, worked the drive-thru window, and typed prescriptions into the computer.  I learned how to fill swiftly.  Co-workers were nice.  Sometimes it got too busy, but just working was good enough for me."
good,My experience with Walgreens is not typical with other employees due to certain situation. It is not fully reflating the company value based on my situation. So I should not grade this company.
good,In walgreens i learned how to have a great customer service. i also learned a lot about different medicines to help customer find their needs.
good,my work day at the smyrna location consisted of counting pills and filling Prescriptions had little customer interaction at this location
good,My favorite part about being at G105 was learning how to upload mp3's to the podcast's website and receiving tips on how to produce a radio show.
good,"Typical day was fulfill patients medication orders. I learned a lot from better communication skills to working better as a team. My co workers were very helpful to me, and made me better technician after I finished school for it. The hardest part of the job was probably dealing with frustrated customers. The most enjoyable thing was helping customers and to learn the more about medications."
good,"Worked here during high school. Was fun and you always kept busy. There was always something to do whether restocking, helping customers, or ringing up customers. Coworkers were fun and hard workers, at least at the location I was in. Pay was a little above minimum wage."
good,Great pharmacists and technicians to work with and learn from! Supportive management you can go and voice your concerns to anytime.
good,"I love working with my team! Everything is very organized in the pharmacy. Patients are happy, we are happy. The hardest part of my job is if there is an issue that a patient has that extends out of the reach of the pharmacy. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with patients and being on a first name basis with a lot of them."
good,"Being that it is a retail pharmacy, you pretty much have a set routine of things go and where you need to be. I learned a lot in my 4 1/2 yrs with the company. I worked cashier and pharmacy and honed my customer service skills. From the time I started to when I resigned, the company went through a lot of changes and directions. Spending money on acquiring European pharmacies and not on the betterment of the company."
good,ok. busy store. not always enough tech help. management keeps trying to add more tasks without providing the additional help
good,Positive and friendly work-environment. All employees show up with a team-work mindset; always willing to help others accomplish goals. Management is very hands-on and helpful.
good,"Nice place to work at if you are used to a very high volume store and fast pace but not for everyone. There is always something to do. Never a dull moment. Co-workers were very friendly at work and out as well. Good relationship with all the managements of the store and pharmacy. It can be very stressful, so it does require a lot of patience and a strong mind-set."
good,"My work experience at Walgreens varies everyday. I learn a lot about many different tasks, products, and systems. The management team can be difficult at times, but are always accessible. All of my co-workers are friendly and productive workers most of the time. The hardest part of the job is the work load some days as well as achieving the satisfaction of the customers. The most enjoyable part of my job are the customers and helping them to find what they need and want."
good,I was an Assistant Manager at Walgreens.  We were responsible for the retail store along with the pharmacy.  This was a fast paced environment which required shifting your attention in several directions.  I learned the pharmacy side which requires a person to employ empathy along with patience to satisfy the customer/patient.  The hardest part of the job and also the most enjoyable was the customer service role.  We prided ourselves with our goal to offer extraordinary customer service.
good,"I come in to work and immediately clock in and see what is on the to do list with your name by it. The day consist of taking IC3's which is a cashier asking for help checking out customers because there is a line and getting everything straighten and organized on the shelves in the area you are working in for that day, also completing any extra jobs they have your name by on the to do list in the office. I feel like management could have been better I had 5 or 6 different managers who all had different styles on doing things and different opinions on how to runt he store so it confusing. The hardest part of the job to me is restocking day because we restock and shift the whole store around which takes at least two days. The best part would be meeting the people that come into the stores and developing relationships with the frequent customers."
good,"although walgreens corporate structure was sound and efficient, it did not and will not meet the needs and appreciate its employees."
good,"Overall view   great place to work if meeting and greeting the  public is your thing...Scheduling fair, salary fair based on performance, golden opportunity for anyone looking for a career in retail"
good,"What kept me going to work here were the people I worked with.  We did not always see eye to eye, and there were arguments but no bickering or back stabbing.   That also reflects on managements ability to find the right people."
good,"Company is great for those looking to fulfill a career in management.Because its retail and pharmacy, there isnt much attention on training for busier stores."
good,you get the hours you want. management is good and you get a mandatory raise every 6 mo even though its not alot but something is better than nothing
good,Great place to learn retail pharmacy business. Fast paced environment in a very structured company with a lot of learning points for a newer technician.
good,Walgreen's is a great start for any technician and its definitely a career for most people. Walgreen's displays a great teamwork effort while training and working with any employees .
good,I ran the photo lab and I enjoyed seeing peoples faces light up when they saw their pictures come to life and I enjoyed all the customers I came in contact with
good,okay place to work  great for school person or retired not for a full time job as hours are all over the place. benefits are good if you are a manager or full time. the work is mostly labor. there is no thinking involved here
good,"I like the all the  team members I  work with."
good,"Fun work place with very supportive management, helpful staff, gained a great valuable experience in customer service. Enjoyed working there my co-workers were great"
good,I really enjoyed the people I worked with and would love to work with them again. They over schedule people and it wasn't ideal for me as a student. But the people are what kept me around so long.
good,"my day at Walgreens consisted with helping people with there purchases and helping them find what there looking for. what i learned is how to deal with problems that arise when it comes to customer service,stocking shelves,doing resets, setting ads for the next week, how to print photos. Management was very helpful and wanting you to be successful in your jobs,coworkers were all ways there to help you when they were needed. The hardest part of my job was i couldn't always please everyone,the most enjoyable part of my job was working with people."
good,This company relied heavily on working as a team to accomplish tasks throughout the day in a positive environment. There was always something to accomplish throughout the day that kept you plenty busy. During my time here was given opportunities to branch out into departments and it kept the job exciting.
good,"While not what I'd call exhausting, Walgreens still expects much from its employees. Whether it is climbing around the stock room or suddenly having to manage the photo booth, you can expect a number of minor deviations in your work schedule that can keep you on your toes. You'll be qualified for any kind of retail job after working here. I worked in a location with a board variety of customers fro all walks of life, which lead to some interesting and at times frustrating moments. A flexible personality that is not averse to extra work is key. It is vital to approach customers that seem lost and non-intrusviely ask if they need assistance, as helping a potential buyer will not only encourage a repeat visit but also prevent them from growing frustrated and causing a problem later down the line. Proactive action pays dividends; the sooner I identified and completed tasks on my own the more positive my work environment became. Conversely, in between bursts of activity there were many calm moments that saved my nerves from being frayed."
good,"I spent half of my life with Walgreens, I learned a great deal on my own by doing and reading. I was a lead person given lots of freedom and did my job well. I enjoyed my time there and the people I met and worked with."
good,Walgreens is a great work experience to have and I great place to work if you are looking for flexible hours such as students
good,"I got a lot of great experience here. I learned so much, from getting the store ready to open to all the great skills I learned here."
good,A place to work where one can meet different cultures of people at a descent pay rate with minimal physical strains when picking single items from pick bays to be stacked into tots and put on the line for shipment.
good,"typical day is spent typing, filling and cashing customer out it is a very busy store and not a lot of time to socialize at least in the pharmacy."
good,"Typical day is scanning in prescriptions, answering incoming calls, filling prescriptions, running the register checkin out the customers. Hardest part is keeping up with the prescriptions and doing everything efficiently when there is alot of customers and most enjoyable part is interacting with the customers and being able to help them with whatever questions they may have."
good,Interested in making a change.  New global Walgreens-Boots Alliance company is undergoing many changes which serve to threaten future job stability.
good,"There is always many tasks at hand from the moment you get there to the time you punch out. I feel like I have learned a number of great things. How to have great time Management, handling money, broaden my knowledge on our products and I get to Feel rewarded after helping our Customers, Walgreens is always changing to stay on top of their game in the Pharmaceutical Industry."
good,"I learned a great deal from this company, however, the only reason I was able to advance to the position I wanted was because I hounded every store manager and pharmacy manager that came through my store. They honestly were too lazy to do the paper work to transfer me departments, until a new pharmacy manager came to the store and realized my potential. The company as a whole is a good company, however if you have lazy staff you will struggle advancing in this company and enjoying your job. The most enjoyable part of this job was learning new things and getting to know the regular patients that came into our pharmacy."
good,"The daily tasks at Walgreens is always changing and there is always more to do. A typical day at work is of course is customer service and getting patients' prescriptions done in a reasonable time. At times, it gets so busy they can't get filled so fast. I have learned a lot at Walgreens. I have learned to multi-task very well and also learned all the different drugs names; brands and generics in the pharmacy. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who are upset and all the stress because of the amount of prescriptions we do with little help. The job thing about this job is that I have learned to pay attention to detail and became a fast learner."
good,"The company has a lot of great people and has shown consistent growth and success. They provide very good benefits and employee programs. For the most part, people are driven and hard working with a team driven environment."
good,I did my internship for this company for a school program . A typical day for me would be to fill prescriptions and process vaccine paperwork for patients . my staff pharmacists and other coworkers were helpful.
good,Everyday I try to learn something new. I work to make the workplace a better place  for its employees and customers. I love dealing with customers and giving them great customer service every day.
good,"This was my first job. I worked here so that I could pay for college. My position here was a picker. We did a pick to light system, to wherever your light was flashing, that's the product that you had to put into your tote. It would flash, and show the amount that u needed to pick. At Walgreens, I learned to induct, how to do inventory, and how to be accurate with my picking. Management was pretty good. At the beginning of each shift they told us what to expect, gave us options to V.T.O (voluntary time off) and asked us if we had any ideas of how to make work better, if we didn't like certain things. I really didn't get to know any of my co-workers, but everybody worked together. The hardest part about the job is standing in one spot for a long period of time. And work seemed endless. The most enjoyable part of work just learning how do do everything."
good,A typical day at Walgreens Pharmacy starts by receiving prescriptions and filling them. It wasn't challenging enough to me and I basically did the same thing every day during my experience there. The coworkers were nice and supportive.
good,A respected company. Diverse job tasks.Helping customers. Being part of a team and contributing to it's success.Management will teach
good,I enjoyed working there. The atmosphere was very fun and flowing. I gained more knowledge in cosmetics and enjoyed getting to learn more.
good,i would work here again.  It was a fun place to work and the team mates were awesome.  I wish the pay was better. Management was awesome.
good,"I work overnight at Walgreens, and the hardest part of my job is just staying awake. I enjoy everything else, stocking, helping cistomers, and cleaning."
good,Handling customers with friendly co-workers and management was nice. Store was heated and cooled appropriately so working was not uncomfortable. Standing long periods of time can be demanding but the flow of various customers made it fun.
good,"I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone that isn't willing to work hard.  It may be only retail, but dealing with customers and employees every day.  Employee in particular is a hard thing to do.  Good relationships are delicate in retail and once they go bad it is very hard to fix it."
good,Great first job if your trying to get on your feet and trying to figure out what you are trying to do with your life. It is hard if you are the only one trying to do your job and everyone else is playing around.
good,"This company provided me with many opportunities to grow within the company. I started as a cashier, then moved into the photo department, and finally moved up to the pharmacy. It is a great employer to develop a career."
good,"I learned new things every day at Walgreens, it was never the same day. Always new customers and embracing customers and providing the best customer service possible. Micro management was decent but causes problems with some employees at times. My co-workers were honestly the best. Always reliable and helpful. The hardest part of the job was being short handed. The most enjoyable part of the job was clocking out."
good,"I love the fast pace of the job, you are going non-stop.  I've learned so much in the couple of months that I have been there.  I've enjoyed working with everyone including management.  The hardest part of the job is the hours.  The most enjoyable part is the learning experience."
good,"Wonderful company to work for. Data entry , prescription filling. Third party adjudication. Excellent customer service skills."
good,A normal day at work consists of pushing sales to increase store revenue. On a typical day I always learn something new and knowledgeable. Management is always striving for the best an nothing less. My co-workers are excellent to work with we all have a healthy environment around customers and workplace.
good,Good job with good co-workers but was hard to move up the ladder. Not enough hours to pay the bills.I did enjoy enjoy  my position as a Photo Tech.. It gave me the chance to learn a new skill that I greatly appreciate even up to the current date.
good,good  place to work if they would hire people  to actuality work andn not stand around and let managers fire and consul employees
good,Management is superb. A typical day at walgreens very busy with assisting guest and giving them great customer service which is what i enjoy most about my job.
good,"overall is a good environment to work in."
good,"Learned to multi task in various scenarios. Helping drive thru while answering phone calls, helping patients and typing prescriptions. Always work steady pace to prevent errors from occuring."
good,"Every morning we have a 5 minute meeting to catch up on the previous days sales goals, plan for the days task and have an open discussion on anything that needs to be addressed. As i moved up in the company the most important thing I have learned was time management. How to make sure that the customers and employees are getting what is need at the same time the store is functioning. Being with the company for 8 years I have meet people from different walks of life and have learned to utilize my people skills to adjust. Hardest part of the job is not always having the proper equipment.What I enjoy the most is being able to give my customers my undivided attention."
good,"A typical day working at Walgreen would be, interacting with customers face to face, solve many different issues like, products, sale prices, item prices, returning items and refund disputes, Helping customers or assisting them with any photograph issues like copying, printings, and correcting photos. I learned patients,and how to operate photo equiptment, product inventory, and quality control. Management at Walgreen is different and diverse, depending on the individual the management could be nice or unpleasant. with the co-workers, i had a good relationship with most of the co-workers, and some of their attitudes was not nice at times and i had a limited relationship with some that was strictly work related.There was no hard part of the job, but sometime dealing with customers that can be rude and disrespectful at times. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting different people and the different cultures i have met, and helping the customers with any issues or problems."
good,"I'd operated cash registers , stocked shelves and light housekeeping duties such as sweeping and mopping , dusting and cleaning the restrooms . I had liked the job I'd loved interacting with the customers but it was a very unsafe environment the store had lots of robberies."
good,Overall a fun and good place to work. Entertaining meeting and helping all the customers. Great team oriented work place and managers are up close and personal.
good,"My location of Walgreens was a very busy store. The management was strict on hours but it was difficult to leave on time sometimes because of the chaos. The advancement is not given where hard work is put in. If the management likes you, you can get promoted; but if you challenge their ethics or beliefs, its not likely to get promoted.  They were not strict on attendance, which made it difficult to work, when people were always showing up late or not at all."
good,"In this Job I was part-time because I studied. My work was focused on the client service at the beauty department, I was responsable for  selling and  the mantainance of this department."
good,working there is great but I think its a good way to change to my degree that I am going to school for. Working there helped me change the way I handle a lot of things in my life and career.
good,This job was fun. I was able wo work with customers and employees. No day was the same. You had a lot more good day's than bad. What I liked best was job satisfaction.
good,I meet so many nice people every day that I work. It is a very busy store. The hardest part of the job is the lifting. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping the customers. Management is approachable.
good,"didn't like having to work until 12 am sometimes, learned inventory, how to get ready for the store to open and ordering products that were needed."
good,The work environment was good but busy. They do tend to focus on numbers. They do have one of the best pharmacy computer systems available.
good,"I was a great place to work at Walgreens CPO, I thank for all the  the people I get to know and the things I learned, Receiving, put away replenish, cycle count our daily items really thank you CPO"
good,"Pretty easy job, customer service is a must. hardest part is we are open ever day of the year. Flexible work schedule is a must."
good,The most enjoyable part of working as a Beauty Advisor at Walgreens was the fact that I got to help people on a daily basis with their hair and makeup choices.
good,"The hardest part of the job is pretty much working with the public, dealing with different personalities and attitudes. Honestly, pay is not the best, definitely could be better. Definitely love working with my co-workers. They are hardworking and can definitely get the job done. A fun and even bit laid-back environment. I learned that in order to complete the task you must know how to be a team player and be willing to genuinely help those in need."
good,"In the mornings you would have to get everything set up for the day such as the cash registers, your terminal, and new prescriptions received overnight. If there were any problems from the night/day before then you try and solve those with the doctor, insurance company, or patient before customers start to come in. As customers begin to come in and the phone starts ringing things can feel pretty rushed in the pharmacy. When a customer drops off a perscription depending on their decision on pick up time is what you'll be doing next. They can either choose to wait which would usually take us 10 to 15 minutes to fill or they can come get it later that day or another day. Always making sure you ask if they are a new patient because as most know you definitely want your insurance to help you out on your prescription price. If your customer was a new patient then they had to fill out a paper stating a few personal things as well as the pharmacy giving them a sheet on their HIPAA and privacy making sure they understand their right to privacy. Once a prescription is received you scan it in the system so you or another technician can type it out. Following that you then bill the insurance, find the medication, count it out (twice), label the bottle, and then pass it down for the Pharmacist to check. This is an ongoing process throughout the day. On top of those duties you also have trash both regular and private to take out, cleaning, putting away prescriptions accordingly that are ready for pick up, and patient calls about refills and picking up ready perscriptions. Working here I learned"
good,Fast paced workday. Keeping each person happy and making sure they are satisfied with exceptional customer service. I have learned that I can't please everyone.
good,"I was able to learn many skills. I was given the opportunity to learn and advance. The most enjoyable part of my job was trifold. I looked forward to going to work everyday, I enjoyed making a difference in peoples lives, and I enjoyed learning everything I could. The hardest part of my job was leaving. I liked my coworkers except for the lazy ones."
good,"Their ""assembly line-like"" system is very effective and accurate. They are more advanced with technology and efficiency than other major retail pharmacy corporations and their benefits for techs and pharmacists are unbeatable for retail pharmacy."
good,Learned a lot about work and management skills.  Always something new and different everyday that changes the work environment.
good,A typical work day here was delivering product. I learned how to drive a small delivery truck and how to receive in food. Management was good. My co workers were great. The hardest part was keeping product in stock. The most enjoyable part of this job was working the Austin City Limit festival.
good,"As far as retail jobs go, Walgreens is probably one of the better work environments one could hope for.  As a service clerk, my duties diverse but fairly simple and straight-forward, although a constant duty is assisting customers in locating desired products or services.  On days when the truck comes in, I stock the shelves with the newest products.  On Saturday nights, I take down the expired sales tags to make way for the next week's tags.  When necessary, I perform cleaning and organizational duties as well.  As long as I get the job done with a positive attitude, things are good."
good,"good company, just come to work, do your job and go home. its a good networking company."
good,"As a member of the Walgreens team; coworkers were friendly, management was never an issue as they were quick to resolve any issues within the workplace. The Easiest part of the job was getting there and getting started with daily/nightly tasks. The hardest part was the shift, I was working third shift which made it hard to spend time with my family of which I have small children."
good,"I loved the group I worked with, we were a great team and I learned a lot from them. Working with such a small staff it was important that we all got along and did our part.  Our customers were outstanding and I developed a wonderful connection with many of them. However, its hard to only see people when they are sick or being reminded of something wrong with them. I liked the structure and the concise rules, but missed interacting with people who were having a good day!"
good,"Secure employer, great co-workers, understaffed, stressful, good days and bad days, workers try to help each other out"
good,"I can't complain much about my years with Walgreens. It has been great to work for a company that is moving forward in the retail world and that has so much to offer to employees. I am ready for a change but would recommend this company to anyone who wants work in the retail pharmacy field. Management is not the most supportive of the employees, but that is true of most places right now."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers and maintaining the customers' trust.
good,"I have worked for Walgreens since I was 16 years old, a manager since I was 19 years old. I have always loved my job. I love that there is never two days the same, that I can go to work and know that I am going to doing something I am good at. I love having responsibility and deadlines. I do my best work when there is pressure to get something done. I am in the position I am in today because I have always faced challenges with a positive attitude and have always thrived under pressure. I truly love working with customers and working with the employees. I love developing employees and watching them go on to train another employee. I have a different responsibility every day: unloading and stocking warehouse, inventory management, office work, customer relations, community involvement, team building and engagement, pharmacy duties, helping other stores, merchandising, pricing and much more. Within the last year though, I have been worried and stressing because there is so little communication from corporate to the store level. I don't know if I am going to be taking another pay cut or if my position will still be around next month and I will have to take a demotion. There has been a lot of change in Walgreens and no one has been able to kill the rumors about what is going to happen to the employees. No has been able to tell me that I am safe and my future with Walgreens is safe. I have a a family, two young boys and I feel that after all the hard work and dedication I have given Walgreens, I at least deserve an answer as to what is going to happen to me when all the changes happen."
good,Great place to work. Fair benefits. Work schedule is somewhat flexible. Great management structure. You can quickly move up in this company and they treat their employes as family. Big sense of community in the work place as well as the corporate structure. Walgreens is very into giving back to the community.
good,"Im glad I was able to work for walgreens as long as I did, my first retail job. started as a graveyard cashier when that store opened in2000 , Then I was trained in the photo department, I was trained as a SIM CORDINATOR, a year later became an assistant manager, loved being able to help and motivate the employees,"
good,Managed staffing and budget for completing and shipping store orders. Inbound and outbound process of handling merchandise and maintaining inventory. Senior management very knowledgeable in system and operational processes. Co-workers friendly and willing to be team players to service the stores for the consumers. Balancing work and home life very difficult. I do get a satisfaction knowing I am providing a service to help people get what they need.
good,"I enjoyed working about 25 years ago when everything was expanding. It seemed like the possibilities were endless.  The company now is not growing like it used to, and it forces them to put very tight controls on everything, in order to keep profits up."
good,"working day were good inventory learned to work  the hardest was learning English and most enjoyable was work with customers "
good,"Well depending on what my overly random schedule I was either working Photo department, customer service/cashier or cosmetics. if I was in photo I would print out Photo Orders and take Passport pictures, then in the evening I would do the coolers and face the drinks. when I was Customer service I would be checking out customers and or helping them locate things and usually being sent to other parts of the store due to over scheduling.when i was in Cosmetics I would stock the make up, lotions, and hair care products along with give advice as asked for by customers and answer any questions that they had for me. I learned a lot of customer service skills and found that I like to work directly with customers and people. I found the Management was lazy and/or moody and unwilling to teach. I got along well with some of my coworkers but others I clashed with after long hard attempts to have another out come.  the hardest part of the job was the conflicts with some of my coworkers and the lack of leadership. the most enjoyable part was the close relationship with the customers."
good,I have learned time management is everything and with help of other team members they make it more easier on to move into other duties. A typical day is to start the reports of the previous day and check for any mistakes that were done the day during the day if any. My team members come in and ask what is it that I need to catch up with around the store. The hardest part of my job can be that being short handed and cut help during the week because we are over on budget and manage my way to finish everything on time. But I enjoy that every team mate  come up to me and trust me when they have a question or concern they have and work in a balanced work environment.
good,"Quality time spent working on projects and helping customers."
good,"Being a Pharmacy Technician requires you to be able to multi task in between answering phone calls from Prescribers, contacting insurance companies, managing inventory of prescription medicine and a whole host of many tasks all at once. Its challenging, but you have a team to work with so if everyone does their fair share, it can be done."
good,They would call me and even if I was on my day off I would come in because I loved my job.
good,Walgreens is a stable company that provides a flexible working schedule for entry positions allowing many to balance work and school.
good,Repair conveyors and automated cranes. clear jams and affect repairs by using fork lifts and harnesses.
good,"a good work place, good management, they treated employees equaly"
good,"Walgreens is my first professional practice site where I currently work as a nighttime staff pharmacist."
good,"Walgreens is an overall good, solid company but, even though Walgreens is stable as an employer, there are certain sacrifices that have to be made for that stability. "
good,It was a fun experience an I loved every moment working at Walgreens
good,A Day At Walgreens was nothing more then customer service. I learn how to process film and management the photo lab by myself. My co-workers help me to learn all I needed to know about the department. I love seeing the looks on the customer faces when they received their photos
good,"The proper manager can make or break your experience. Normal part of the year is generally slow at the photo station, though you will be kept busy with typical retail menial jobs, ie facing, restocking, constantly cleaning up after customers and their children. During the holidays expect to stay at the photo counter, processing orders and not see much of the rest of the store. Your experience may differ depending on the store location and the local customers. Overall, I have had a decent experience at Walgreen's. Some days are busier than others, but if you enjoy retail and do your job, it is a good position with decent job security."
good,I did everything a manager had to do with out the management pay.  Helped open and close the store.  Helped customers and checked in vendors.  My position had a lot to do with inventory control.  Co-workers were great everyone was like a big family.  Learned a lot about all the positions in the store.  Hardest part of the job was knowing that I was doing everything a manager would do including opening and closing by self the fact was not getting paid what managers do but less.  Helping the customers was the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"Great hours."
good,"Great company to work for with great pay, benefits and job growth.  Co-workers are nice and work together as a team."
good,"A typical day as a pharmacy technician at Walgreens is very busy and fast paced. Multi tasking and being precise is a must in this job. From answering phones, selling prescriptions, filling vials with the correct prescribed drugs, filing the complete prescription, typing up a doctors order into our system for the pharmacist to review, to making sure inventory is on point. The environment is great, a lot to learn, and friendly co workers as well as doctors and patients."
good,Usually just have to stand at the door and greet customers with a smile.
good,"A typical day at Walgreens consists of typing written prescriptions from doctors. We count and measure medications, and sell verified prescriptions to customers. I also resolve insurance issues for customers, order medications for inventory, and help to keep the pharmacy organized and clean. My co-workers and management are very friendly and supportive. The hardest part of the job is trying to make sure every customer leave our store satisfied with our services. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that I'm helping others by doing what I can to make sure they receive their much needed medications."
good,"Scan, type and fill prescriptions with an average of 420 prescriptions a day."
good,It was a great place to learn how to become a retail pharmacy technician.
good,"The company, like most others, have changed the focus from the customers and employees to how much profit they could get. In the process of that change the employee treatment had gotten worse. Overall though the company is a good company."
good,"Walgreens is a great company to start a career. They promote clerks to leadership positions without the need of a diploma. You get to learn a lot of experience in the retail field, such as inventory management, customer service, cash handling, and multi-tasking, The most challenging part of this job is keeping excellent customer service but also staying within the policies and legal restrictions."
good,With retail in general it's hard finding the balance between family and work because the hours are all over the place. It's ideal for a single person that has no children.
good,I worked at Walgreens as part of a school-to-work program in high school. It was very easy. I learned how to use photo equipment. The managers were easy-going and fun to be around. The team atmosphere was quite evident. The hardest part of my job was I was only allowed roughly 20 hours per week. The best part of the job was working with the photo equipment.
good,"A typical day is coming in clocking in and developing photos and  attending to customers . i learn how to multitask. my managers were cool my co workers were very helpful,the hardest part of my job was working double shifts the most enjoyable part was helping customers"
good,"I had many tasks.  As a Sims Coordinator, my first part of the job, unless directed otherwise by my manager, was to do a basic outs report. Checked floor,stockroom,return desk for items that show as being out of stock.  Then correct the counts in the computer.  If damaged,call-ins,returns or empty boxes, scanned items which auto corrected in report.  Then I would review the report & post it with correct counts.  Except for truck day, filling in when they needed me in the pharmacy, etc, my day was spent counting departments, usually 3 feet at a time. Also counted medications in pharmacy. This helped find outs & overages as sometimes things get put in wrong place.  I searched everywhere, before changing counts.  Also pulled merchandise for return goods & call-ins to company & scanned them,boxed them & labeled. Kept customer return,etc table clean by scanning & discarding. Checked to make sure others knew if we had overages or new products. Pulled expired products. I learned where thieves threw empty containers,that the truck didn't always show up in some counts when there were a variety of colors,etc.If one item got put in wrong space, employees put the rest there, as they try to get truck up as quick as possible. Management worked with me, but worked most closely with store manager. Co-workers didn't understand how important my job was, but we all got along fine & the dept. heads(Cosmetics, photo,  pharmacy) kept me aware of things having to do with inventory & I did the same for them.  The hardest part of my job was the holiday season.  It was very hard to do my job & usually"
good,Walgreens is an excellent company to work for. They strive to meet the needs of their customers in the changing economic and political landscape of today.
good,"Walgreens was a good place to work and interact with patients face to face."
good,Very Fast paced environment. It is a fun job once you get the hang of things but you have to be able to multi-task
good,"I learned how to edit photos and create many different things using photos. Most days were busy, keeping up with all the photo orders and stocking/rotating the grocery items all  made the day go by quickly. The managers were very helpful and easy to get along with. Most of the other employees always made my day easier by helping wherever and whenever they could. The hardest part of the job for me was finding the time to remove the out of date grocery items, there were so many different things to go through. What I enjoyed the most  about working here was seeing the customers' faces light up when they got their orders and everything was ""just right"". Knowing I was involved in making so many people happy is a wonderful feeling."
good,"I  must say  management   worked   with you  on any problem, did not matter if it was work or personal they took the time to listen and tried to help in any way they could. As for my coworkers they were a great bunch of pepole.Miss them they were like family .The hards part of my job was getting laid off do to building closing. Most enjoyable making freinds and letting them vent out,I realy liked my job and was good at what I did.And teaching all who wanted to learn that job."
good,"A typical day would usually be the same work you did on the first day, my co workers were friendly and funny, and the hardest part of the day would be the afternoon rush"
good,Typical day at work is pretty fast paced. You learn a lot about third party insurances and brand/generic drug names. Management is very cooperative and ready to help out wherever they are needed. Co-workers are easy to get along with and reliable. Hard part of the job is being able to keep your composure with angry costumers. Most enjoyable part of the job is getting the customers what they need.
good,"Great people and management, very understanding. Only downfall was having to be on your feet constantly."
good,I enjoy working at Walgreens due to the diverse in the community. We offer alot of services that most of the Big Name stores offer but at  a slightly lower price.
good,A typical day at work goes by very fast when working with customers and working next to the Pharmacist.  The management team is great and does not mind teaching and training you on new products.  The hardest thing about the job is working alone when you are short staff and still have to meet your deadlines.  The most enjoyable part about the job is the customers and your staff you are leading.
good,Co-workers were friendly and helpful. It was great working with customers especially the elder who needed help .
good,"Worked the Beauty Department and managed the cash register. Stocked the shelves and set up promotion setups. Along with keeping the area around the register clean products on the shelves were faced and kept orderly at the end of the shift. The best part of the job was interacting with the customers and helping them find what they are in the market for, or make some suggestions that allow them to try a new product. Worst part of the job was that at times there was no communication between the department head and the rest of the department crew and some things weren't handled as they should have been."
good,Every day was a productive day at Walgreen. Working at Walgreen i learned the importance of being patient with the customer. The management there was helpful and always willing to teach you. The co-workers were always friendly.the hardest park about working at Walgreen was getting the knowledge on the products but i got the hang of it very quickly. For the most part it was a great place to work because i got to know my community on a more personal level.
good,"Provide excellent customer"
good,"Work and how it goes depends entirely on the manager on duty. Communication between managers are not always great so if one says one thing, another might say the opposite. "
good,"This is a good, solid company to work for.  There have been several changes made in the past 2 years that have made the mangement roles different and the compensation was changed."
good,"A typical day included providing customer service, handling vendors, informing and motivating team members, handle the cash report, check emails, complete daily task, maintain the conditions of the store.  I learned how to manage my time and improved my leadership skills.  My fellow managers are great people that work hard and are ambitious.  The hardest part of the job managing my time and staying focused when the store was at its busiest.  What I enjoyed most was helping customers and them leaving the store knowing they had great experience at my store."
good,"Walgreens has been a fantastic place to learn, and grow my knowledge of pharmacy concepts. Pharmacy technicians are unfortunately over stressed, and under payed. You will be mentally exhausted by the end of the day. Best part of the job for me is the people who appreciate what I do."
good,Walgreens is a great company. As with most retail customer service; half the mangement is very motivating and half the management is just happy to be in charge of people and give orders. Most of the district managers are encouranging with hours and making your position work for the journey you are taking.
good,"The staff was friendly and professional. I enjoyed going to work everyday when I lived in Jacksonville. We had good times on and off the clock, even when we were really busy or just leisurely going about the day. To me, this staff was a a joy to be around, and I miss them. Management was, well, manageable. Not every day was a perfect day, but most days were pretty good. The hardest part of the job was not being able to satisfy a certain customer, or someone having a typically bad day and becoming the source of release of frustration for said person. The best part was when we would buy each other lunch or have a laugh with a patient, or each other. I have never been able to find a better place to work since I left Yellow Bluff Rd. Thanks for the memories!"
good,"cleaning, putting in orders, stocking,"
good,This job is fast paced and challenging. A lot is required of ASMs and the work/life balance can be hard to balance.
good,"The days were for the most part monotonous, taking-in, filling, and selling prescriptions but an occasional problem could arise, from a stubborn patient to benefit changes that required extra attention to correct.  I learned to be more patient and empathetic with people, especially when someone doesn't feel well and needs more attention.  The coworkers were always in a good mood, with the occasional stressful holiday and we get along well.  My location is slower and as a result many pharmacists come and go quickly looking for a less boring place to work.  After so many years the job became very routine and easy to do, but the hardest parts of the job usually were having to calm down an upset patient and taking responsibility for work not being done to their standards, and the best parts of the job were the personal interaction with returning patients and coworkers."
good,Always doing something and helping customers. Maintaining a clean and safe work environment for yourself and the customers. Setting goals on a daily basis.
good,Awesome group of people to work with. A variety of areas to work and learn in the store along with a great customers to assist.
good,"I learned time management, with having to answer calls, doing truck and helping your employees. Typical day at work was doing refunds, helping in the pharmacy, answering questions and making sure everyone did there job in a timely manner."
good,I stayed at this company for three years. They really offered a lot for their employees. I wish there was better security protection in my particular area.
good,Managed a very diverse group in an environment that constantly changed around you
good,"I had the pleasure of working at Walgreens for more than six years.  Great part-time job, but you won't get rich working there.  A lot of the managers are great but some are very poor and uncaring or egotistical."
good,"From counting cash registers, to filing invoices, and running backups on inventory; a typical day at Walgreens is far form typical. I enjoy the job because I have had the pleasure to work with a good crew and it brings great satisfaction to me to satisfy our customer's needs."
good,"I went in, signed in and got right to work filling prescriptions. I learned a lot of good things there but didn't learn everything yet. The management there was good and I liked getting to work with the people there. The co-workers helped me out and made me feel pretty comfortable. I didn't really ever get to the hard part. I should have stayed longer.I enjoyed getting to know the co-workers and work with them."
good,"come in punch in, get my list, go 2 my station turn on the photo machine ,come 2 the break room eat something after that come out the break room do my list help other people that work their with their list do my orders that's in photo watch some one break after that watch someone else break do some more of my list and then go on my break get the manger food when I come back do some more orders wait until the next person come in for their shift and that's a day at Walgreen for me."
good,A typical day at Walgreens would consist of counseling patients and filling prescription.  I learned how to deal with working with high volume demands and limited time.  Management for the most part were helpful.  Co-workers seemed to be constantly changing.  The hardest part of my job was finding time to complete all the extra projects that was expected of Pharmacist.  The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help the patients who would come into the store with a question about an OTC product or about their general health.
good,my day start at 930 am I will start filling prescriptions the sign for the order. post it take off out of stock and partial fills. cash out coustomers put prescription in the bins by the numbers.
good,"Ive worked at walgreens for roughly 5 years now and while i have made advancements in the career field the job became very repetitive."
good,On a daily basis you inputted information into the computers while waiting on customers at the register. Hardest part of the job was trying to please all pharmacists. Most enjoyable was most of the customers saying that I was helpful and nice.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of multi tasking between daily assignments on the floor, working register or helping assist a customer. In addition, I had to use my skills in sales to be able to promote our products on a daily basis. I learned how to manage my time well, product knowledge, organizational skills, verbal communication, efficiency in any task that needed to be done within a time frame, and great customer service skills. "
good,I enjoyed my time and gained a lot of experience working in the pharmacy as well as other departments.
good,its a nice place to work however some locationssss r a little dangerous
good,"I was a photo tech and front end cashier. I loved that I got to meet different people and helped them when I can. Photo area was fun and learned how to do many things with a photo. My co-workers was amazing we worked as a team. Manager was good until he was training another manager, barely got to see him. When the other manager was doing his job she would treat certain employees unfair."
good,"There is no typical day at Walgreens, one day your on the floor, next register, next juice bar, next café, next greeting. We do it all. I love my customers, and they definitely teach you how to manage your time, great job for people starting off. You do every thing and should likely be paid more but you won't get a raise no matter how good you do. Sick days? Not happening. You have them but they will push you to come in any way. My co workers? Their amazing and half of the reason I stick around.  And management? Good grief. The only way they'd be doing any good is if I took over their job."
good,I enjoyed working at Walgreens. The co-workers were very fun and helpful to work with. The Pharmacists were very helpful and encouraging.
good,"Pharmacy staff are busy from the beginning until the end of the shift. It was challenging but manageable. Management varied from store to store. "
good,"Days went fairly fast working here, constantly busy.  Always someone there for help or to offer advice."
good,"It's a great first job, but the management and corporate are hard to deal with. They change managers every few months and being a shift lead, I am taught different ways that makes it difficult for everyone to stay up to date when there is no training after the first week of work. I enjoy that the non-management employees can choose their schedule but the company cuts hours a lot for both the front end and the pharmacy so it is difficult for people to find balance. The discounts, deals, and benefits are pretty good if you like shopping there. I have learned a lot about different people and how to deal with their personalities."
good,I love people and customers! Communicating with people from kids to elderly is truley a blessing. Getting to work in different departments really gave me alot of experience.
good,"I loved my position as a photo technician, it is really important to have a nice manager or asst. manager because most commands come from them and it shapes your attitude and performance depending on the tone of the manager for a specific task. for example if you are asked to take out the trash nicely, there is no hesitance in doing so, but if you are commanded like a slave then there is dismay in your heart for the manager. Because the department stores are small every associate comes in contact with you, so make sure to smile and be on good terms with everyone. you will enjoy working there."
good,"A typical day at work would pretty much be making sure inventory was full, isle were fully stocked,checking out customer, and making sure restrooms were cleaned. Since working at Walgreens I've learned how to do floor resets on particular products. Management wasn't very strict but lacked some management skills, and my co-workers were easy going and team players. The hardest part of this job was moving freight around the store and picking up heavy boxes. The most enjoyable part of this job was advising customers beauty products and helping them pick out makeup."
good,"This was my 1st job ever. I was so proud to have this job because I was the only teenager from my neighborhood who had a job. Here is where everything started. This is where I learned customer service, how to operate a cash register, stock shelves, address business calls in a professional manner, and learned how to be professional with absolute strangers. This is where I learned how to be reliable, responsible, independent and dependable. This place is where I felt like an adult for the very 1st time in my life. Here is where I got a taste of the real world and liked it. The hardest part of this job was being an adult at 16 and transportation. Somehow I managed and got there everyday that I had to be there. I would never forget how this job has helped me learn and grow. It's a great 1st job for any teenager and I would recommend it to anyone."
good,young didn't care to stick with it really liked the company to work for
good,print photos and stock the store shelves Its good place for part time work
good,"Anyone who has worked in retail knows the difficulties involved in this line of work.  Walgreens has the same problems that all retail locations have, long hours, busy holidays, ect."
good,"Walgreens provide me with great pharmacy skills, learned how to work under pressure and have great time management."
good,"A typical day at walgreens pharmacy include taking doctor calls, insurance calls and customer calls. Filling medications as well as bingo carding for nursing homes. checking medication as well as supply inventory daily and placing orders. Putting up daily medication that is delivered to pharmacy for replenishing. Customer service interaction with patients as well as cashier experience. Delivering medication and over the counter products to nursing homes daily. Being a pharmacy technician really teaches you to multitask and always be on your toes. I have learned to always be ready to take on a new challenge. Hardest part of the job is trying to complete all the tasks given in the amount of time you have. The most enjoyable part of the job is a satisfied customer which is always rewarding."
good,"Walgreen's is one of Americas biggest pharmacy chains. We deal with all different types of people all day. Working in the pharmacy is special because they are not your customers anymore, they are your patients. You have to make sure that their needs are met and do it with compassion because these people are ill. I enjoy seeing the satisfaction on a patients face when there is a insurance issue solved or that they were able to receive their medication at little or no cost. My co-workers and managers are like family. we get along well and work great as a team. The hardest part of the job is the constant physical demands."
good,"A typical work week is forecasting each vendor of responsibility 6wks ahead of current date based on current trend/ promotional events and  seasonality activity, Purchase order maintenance. Forecast future displays for Stores based off Plano's or Forecast sales for each unit with in the given display.  Collaborate with vendors/ merchants on forecast and create promotional orders. The work is very enjoyable with a lot of tasks and analysis needing to be done every day. From tracking orders/ adjusting baseline sales, monitoring days of supply, working daily instock reports, trouble shooting customer service issues and working with DC's on returns or damaged goods."
good,"If you have the right attitude and enjoying moving around a lot and taking care of customers, you can have a great deal of fun in this job."
good,"A typical day at work was very fast paced, had multiple job tasks and duties that had to be done."
good,"I enjoyed working with Walgreens. The staff are extremely friendly, and management is very understanding with their employees. The hardest part of the job though was the stress. I suppose the store I worked for had a strict budget. Their were always more customers than employees which made the job demanding and very stressful."
good,"Very fast paced job, I learned how to fill, type and take in prescriptions from physicians."
good,"I worked with great people, learned a lot about different departments and jobs."
good,"if asked for more training, it was provided. They would help out with any request."
good,"Is a boiling pot, where you meet all kind of people from all walks of life.I like dealing with the public.Co-workers are very corporative.Hardest part of the job is dealing with a difficulty customer."
good,"I get to meet new people of different nationalities everyday and make a difference in their life. Everyday I help people get, stay, and live well."
good,"Typical day was cashering and developing photos"
good,"I have been working for Walgreens for about two and half years. The work environment is very stressful but very fast pace. I enjoy it but honestly its about who you know and not what you know. Its hard to get better positions due to the level of knowledge that you have pertaining that particular position . Basically the more you know the more they have to pay you but  instead of paying the employee that is well qualified for the position, they would rather pay a new employee but for less and more work. Honestly over all the work environment is great. The people there make you feel like you are apart of a family not just apart of the Walgreens staff and that's why I can walk in to my job with a smile on my face each day."
good,"Sometimes, I believe walgreens corporate is more interested in the numbers than they are in the care of the customers. It's retail, number rule the view of the outlook of the retail pharmacy, than it does the care and time spent with each individual. The limited amount of employees working in such a rushed environment. Time management is differently hard during the peak hours of the day with limited staff."
good,"Work at Walgreens begins at 10:15 in the evening and ends at 8:15 the next morning. My day typically begins with creating the nightly cash report. The rest of my shift consists of projects(e.g reset and revisions, pulling merchandise from stockroom) some storekeeping duties, and checking in vendors during the early morning hours. The hardest part of the job is cash handling and the cash reporting. Any errors can make the end results off in the reports and management in the morning have to spend considerable amount of time correcting your mistakes. Resets and Revisions through out the store is the most enjoyable part of the job. "
good,"It was a busy store with a line a mile long in 2 lanes of drive through, intake window, and 2 registers. The pharmacy manager appreciated every tech she had and never failed to show it. The hardest part is making customers understand how the process of a prescription works and that waiting is involved. The most enjoyable was being appreciated by my boss because she is the only one who ever did."
good,"At my Las Vegas store, a typical day way hectic but exciting. A variety of people and experiences. Extremely busy but never a dull moment. Coworkers were amazing, management was awesome, as long as you were doing your part as an employee, things were a breeze. The hardest part of the job was trying to communicate with non English speaking customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was everything. I learned how to take life at face value and go with the flow of the atmosphere."
good,"Taking care of customers, interacting with vendors, planogram resets. I learn what it acquires to be an excellent customer service representative. I get along with all my co-workers who are always friendly and easy to get along with."
good,The job was great I was able to work in a few different parts of the store learning certain aspects that I was not expecting to learn.
good,"A typical day for me depends on the shift I'm on. If I'm opening I get to the store by myself and count the safe and get the drawers ready for the day. A little before opening time, I let the employees in so they can get clocked in. Then it is either restocking the shelves, merchandising, and helping out customers. If I close, I come in and start helping the other managers or employees with the tasks they are working on. When it gets close to closing time, I start straightening the store. Then I get the drawers ready for the next day and make the deposit for the bank. I then walk the store to make sure everything is how it should be and lock the doors and go home. So far the most important thing I've learned is how to deal with irate customers and how I can help them with their issue or complaints."
good,"A typical day would be taking doctor calls for refills or new medications for patients, I would then fill those meds while working the front counter or drive thru. Assisting patients with question or helping them around the store. I would also fix insurance claims that did not go thru. I learned how to mulit-task well there as you have to do multiple things to stay on top of things. My co workers and I got along very well and always worked as a team. The hardest part of my job at Walgreens was working diffrent hours everyday. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with the people and helping finds meds to make them feel better."
good,Great company to work for. Need more managers adjustment. People are friendly and easy to work with. I have great service skills to manage my assisgments.
good,"Here in walgreens, everyday seems to be a new and interesting day. You wouldn't know what will happen next. Your customer experience today may not be the same tomorrow. Nonetheless, people here are fast enough to meet the demands of the customers. Though I'm new in this industry, company has a good self-training program that helped me to progress."
good,"we have spirit week once a year. ie:twin day, flash back to the 90's, whacky . over all its a nice place to work. i deal with a diverse clientel on a daily, who needs refills etc. co workers are awesome and friendly, management um?? most of them are great. the hardest part is trying to move up in the company because of favoritism, so if you do join the team, stand out as much as possible, (in a good way)"
good,If I could I would recommend anyone to this location or this business alone its very helpful and awesome.
good,"Constant management rotation. Co-workers are ok, most don't stay long though."
good,"Walgreens is a very fast paced and growing company.  Unfortunately the facility that I worked for closed and moved to another state.  I enjoyed my job there very much and was disappointed to leave. The day was in ful swing when I arrived and it was time to start multi tasking right away.  I learned alot of information from management. I do believe in teamwork and get along well with others, but am also self directed.  The hardest part of the job was when there was a communication hold up that kept me from moving further with my duties. The most enjoyable part of my day was that there were so many different tasks that the day literally flew by."
good,"A typical work day consisted of customer's, price changes , resets, etc."
good,"Constant handling of monies, customers and co-workers.  Challenging."
good,This company is very innovative and constantly changing. Must be flexable and open minded to keep up with the change. Overall if you are ambitious and push very hard you can move fast with this company.
good,"My non-paid externship was  a good way to put in practice the book learning process of being a pharmacy tech which I had completed. I was allowed to fill precriptions and refills, put away replacement stock, check for expired medications, keep work areas clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful, however the experience was limited due to Walgreens policy of not allowing externs to ring up sales or take in new precriptions. This is considered a vital part of the job and one that I was not able to experience. So that was disappointing. I did see myself grow during the short time, able to keep up with the incoming fill orders and accuracy, The hardest part for me was not being able to help a customer when the pharmacist and tech were both busy, All I could do was tell them someone will be with you soon. "
good,"It was easy to work and enjoy my co-workers and employees. I learned to develope photos and maintain a photo lab. Management was fairly flexibe, kind, easy to get along with, and fun to learn from. My co-workers always gave useful tips to complete my job more efficiently along with the daily random conversations to pass the time while doing our dialy duties. The hardest part of the job would have to be having to keep up with multiple job titles throughout the course of the day. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was the social interaction between my fellow co-workes and the racially diverse customers."
good,"It was a fast paced job, being on the strip of Las Vegas. It was fun to deal with so many different kinds of people from all over the world.  I learned a lot about customer service, and the basics of retail. I always got along with my co-workers and management. The hardest part for me was wanting to do more then my time allowed. I always wanted to do more and more projects. The best part of my job there was I loved feeling the accomplishment of doing my job and doing it well. Learning new things and moving up in the company was always the best to me."
good,"learned many valuable skills, able to advance quickly, great employees to work with, lot of opportunity for learning new things at meeting"
good,"Hours can be long.  Dealing with customers is trying at times.  But overall, there is plenty of support from corporate and the job can be very rewarding."
good,"Typical work day is pretty busy, always something to do. There  is advancement with management, with pharmacy the highest you can go is Senior tech, which is a great responsibility.  With pharmacy you deal with many personalities, if your a diverse person than that's good for you.  Most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that the patient  is pleased."
good,Working there never really gave me a pain. Only had some problem with some management if tend to disagree with them at times. Other then that everything else at work was perfectly fine for me. Only left due to looking to work in other fields and was just working out for me at the time.
good,"While working at Walgreens you have to know how to deal with the public. You must also be able to have patients dealing with everyday people. I learned that things that people say to you, shouldn't be taken to the heart. Dealing with co workers has its ups and downs because if you put all your trust into someone they can turn their back on you at anytime. The hardest part about the job is dealing with managers that bring their personal problems to work. The most enjoyable part would be interacting with the public."
good,Walgreens was a fun place to work at.  They move the management teams around from store to store.  This helps create more diverse management styles.
good,"Walgreens was a very good place to work for. They helped me grow in my personal strive for customer satisfaction. Once upon arriving at my photo station most of my day consisted on helping customers with prints, collages, and posters for print. Through out the day some stock would be put up and at the end of the day we each had a different cleaning task that needed to be done before clocking out."
good,"When I would go into my shift, I would get straight to work with cleaning. My position originally in the store was a 'beauty advisor,' but it quickly changed to 'door greeter' when they found someone to work full time. I enjoyed working there for the most part because I had never worked in retail before. I learned how the store works and how inventory is controlled. It was fun going around and helping out with the photo lab and everywhere else in the store. When I was assigned the greeter position, I wasn't allowed to leave the front door (even for a break or to use the restroom). I don't mind greeting when it's needed, like in a restaurant, etc., but in Walgreens, when I would ask the customers if they needed help, maybe 2% of them actually needed it. It was an unnecessary position that had too much down time. I thrive on fast pace jobs with not too much down time."
good,"There is a lot to get done at Walgreens, but we always have fun while doing it and everyone is always treated fairly.  The customer is always most important."
good,"Great company to work for would highly recommend  those seeking to work for Walgreens,"
good,I have learned a lot through the 11 years working at Walgreens. The most enjoyable part of my job is honestly the customers. You begin to form friendships when being at one job for so long and that is something to cherish. The people I work with are also awesome and always helpful.
good,"Started with no experience in the pharmacy. They provided me with educational classes which gave me the knowledge to pass the state board at no charge. Once you reach  Sr CPhT, there is no more opportunities to advance and you are stuck at same pay rate with not even a cost of living increase after you hit""TOPOUT""pay."
good,Very laid back environment and repetitive yet fairly easy work. I like a challenge so it can get old fast. However the pay was decent for my position. Advancement opportunities were pretty stagnant.
good,"Enjoyed my co-workers and most customers were wonderful,"
good,"• Front & Drive-thru Costumer service"
good,"This was a temporary job for me and my experience was enough to learn quite a bit about customer service, cash handling and sales. Management was always present (good or bad thing) and the locations' standards and reputations were set by them. Coworkers were multicultural and skilled mostly college students. Hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers, there was at least one or two every day and working on weekends. The pay was very minimal, advancement available only to those very committed. The best part of the job is that it was mostly low stress easy work."
good,"Walgreen's was a very fun experience. I was taught very important skills for the future, no matter what the position is."
good,Managers and employees will all gossip about you keep you personal business at home. Even if you call in if it's personal lie because they will tell the entire store.
good,Sell make up and assist customers at the checkout counter stock and clean the store.
good,A day at work is great its fun learning new things and dealing with costumers is awesome. What I've learned is that no matter how hard work is it will always be fun and not boring. Management is great super understanding and caring. Co-workers are amazing everyone gets along and just we all do our job. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with rude costumers. The most enjoyble part of the job is just everything. 
good,"My typical day at work would begin with taking over the safe and cash for the evening.  I would balance the safe and make sure everything is ready for the evening or morning which ever the case may be. Walk the store to list things that need done or switched for the up and coming ad. Opening the photo department would be next each machine must be tested before we can begin to process film.  Each Register also would need the til to begin the day.  Then plan out our day but remain flexible as things in retail can not be predicted.  If the pharmacy surges with customers I would be ready to help out with filling or helping customers.  Attending to calls as the front register may need my help and any moment.  This is a fast pace environment with plenty of on hands work to do. Truck day would mean all hands available to unload the truck, organize the totes and deliver them to the isle for merchandizing.... I hope this give you a snap shot of my day but as with anything there are always those situations you can not predict and need to handle as needed. "
good,"I helped open the Sweetwater store which was a fun challenge.  Had 6 great years at Walgreens, just time for a change, more than just another Walgreens. I always enjoyed helping customers workout their prescription and insurance issues. Has made me learn more about my own, which was a good thing."
good,"Typically, a day at work at Walgreens would include a lot of customer service and cashiering. I learned how to deal with the public in a professional way. The management at Walgreens were helpful, knowledgeable and friendly with the staff and the customers. My co-workers were diverse in age, sex and culture. I got along with all of them well. The hardest part of my job was dealing with difficult customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was finishing a photo project in good quality and in time."
good,"I'm not one for the retail environment, but I've worked for Walgreens for almost 8 years and I've really enjoyed it overall.  Retail is going to be stressful anywhere you go, but my co-workers make my job worth it.  As a student working through college I had an extremely flexible management team and have overall just had a pretty good experience working for them.  In addition to the day to day life Walgreens has excellent benefits and good training programs.  As a pharmacy technician there isn't a lot of room to move up unless I would have gone to pharmacy school, but I know there is a lot of upward mobility on the store side of things. "
good,I enjoyed my time with this company. I served in a number of positions with this company. A typical workday consisted of customer service with patients in retail sales and retail pharmacy. it was awesome helping customers to find the products they needed everyday as well as making sure they were correctly informed on usage of the medications they were prescribed. I thoroughly enjoyed   my co-workers and management staff. It was a positive working environment. 
good,Working for Walgreens has been a great and educational experience. This was my first job so I learned a lot about customer service and retail work. The most enjoyable part about working here is also the hardest part which is the customers.   
good,I was responsible for day to day operations and customer service.  I had a great opportunity in building and supervising teams.
good,"Have to complete assignments, put out merchandise,greet and help customers."
good,"Making sure the Store is in clean and presentalble impression for customers entering the store. Providing friendly, courteous and efficient service to  customers, responsible for everything from cash register operations and customer service to merchandising, store inventory and maintaining store signage and displays. Love the customer interaction and help them find the products they are looking for. "
good,"We had a little family of co-workers. For birthdays, holidays, anything, we were all together and celebrated as a big family"
good,it is a good place to work. management was nice. i learnd how to operate there photo equipment. co-workers are ok it depends on who you talk to. the hardest part was unloading truck and stock shelves. the best thing about it is working with the customers. 
good,"Some boring days with nothing to do, some days, you're slammed."
good,"A typical day at Walgreen was to prep and print pictures, help customers with the kiosk to create the pictures the way they wanted, complete resets, and help customers in the store. I learned how to manage my area and fellow co-workers. The management were excellent and I enjoyed working with them as well as my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was the troubleshooting of the photo machines. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with and the customers."
good,Working at this company really helps improve your customer service skills. You are to give nothing but the very best in service. Vacation days are some what difficult to use. As a full time employee you are to be available to work a full forty hours but you are not guaranteed more than thirty hours.  
good,"We work hard but have fun, we do the best we can to satisfy our customers to ensure their return and loyalty."
good,"Each day is different at Walgreens. Granted, many of the tasks get repetitive, but that's how retail is. I'm a Beauty Advisor, so I assist in the cosmetics/baby departments mainly. One day a week (Saturdays) you put up tags (current sales, etc) and your main priority is assisting customers. My co-workers are considered my family (sometimes even more so than my blood family) and we look out for each other. Truck days are extremely busy but fun. "
good,"Depending on the day, my schedule would be 8-10 hours and I would be NON-STOP the entire time."
good,"Enjoy helping people, fast work pace, different duties, great team work and was able to work alone night shift."
good,"New managers Im learning m0re things now"
good,"A typical day at work depends on what department i am working in.  I spend my day providing customer service to our customers that walk in the doors while promoting products and increasing productivity.  The non-management co-workers are quite encouraging and make my time spent at Walgreens not only productive but rewarding.  The mangement personel are all young and push until you cannot be pushed any longer and don't take into account employees.  With that being said, the hardest part of the job is working under management that doesn't care about their staff.  The most enjoyable part of the job however is coming in contact with different people everyday and helping them in the best way possible."
good,"Stocking shelfs, waiting on customers, bringing in carts.  these are some of the activities.  The orginization of walgreens has high standords, they keep a clean store, and over all is well managed."
good,"As I have grown with Walgreens, I have gained many skills in a variety of ways. These include customer service, sales, and building relationships with employees and customers. A typical day at work consists of assisting customers in finding the products that they are looking for. Also, managing inventory and keeping the overstock organized and the shelves full if possible. The hardest part of my job was dealing with uncooperative customers, but I have gained knowledge on how to handle those situations. The most enjoyable part of my job is keeping my department organized, neat, and easy to shop for customers. Marking sale items is another part of my job that I enjoy. This allows customers to match the weekly ad to the items that are advertised."
good,"I love working with the public this is a great job, i developed photos in the one hour lab stock shelves did inventory aand ordering.."
good,Be prepared to work hard for your money! It is a good paying job but you have to work long hours and various schedules!
good,"This is not a bad job at all and most nights i do enjoy working for walgreens. i like the majority of the management personnel. cons to working there for me is no matter how hard you work and what all skills you learn to do your pay is based on how long you have been there. there are people who have been there 10 years who just meet standards and only know how to do one task and make top pay while there are people who have been there shorter periods of time exceed standards know how to do virtually everything in their department that make less or the same. to move up you cant have any write ups (and you can get written up for pretty minor things) and then you becoming a team lead which makes only a little more. the next step is manager they do hire within but with countless employees and 20 managers (and none look anywhere close to retirement age), and with my warehouse downsizing soon and not expanding moving up takes a while no matter how well you do your job. like i said it is not a bad job im just looking for a career and chance to show my skills with potential of moving up in a company based on my personal achievements."
good,-a typical day at work there was always fun for me.
good,"everyone works as a team and the co worker and mangers treat you like family,"
good,Walgreen help me better my communication skills. It also help me meet new and interesting people.
good,"A day at retail pharmacy is always basically the same. A pharmacy technician takes, enters into computer, fills, and sales medications to customers. In the pharmacy not much happens like walmart because we have to insure customers medication is filled correctly. We have many guidelines that we have to follow from state an government laws to insure customers safety with their medications. We all pharmacy technicians work together to get customers medications out as fast and effectively as possible. I enjoyed my job as a pharmacy technician because I felt like I was a professional with a very important job to help customers. As a senior pharmacy technician I was able to train and schedule pharmacy technicians under me which allowed me to teach and train them on what I knew in my position. Training is one of my up most achievements in any career."
good,it is easy open door policy. big team work balance
good,"A typical day varies because it is retail. Holidays are crazy, in between we are kept busy with cleaning and rearranging tasks. I'm presently a Head Photo Specialist, and the most enjoyable part of my job is making sure that the customer leaves with exactly what they came in for, even if we don't offer it exactly. I love special projects. The hardest part of my job is actually the merchandising and stocking out in the store. That isn't too hard, though."
good,Management was great everyone was on the same accord helping eachother outout the customer with all their needs and questions.
good,"the company wants you to give it your all , blood sweat and tear, they also want you to work in a fast pace customers is always right 1000%"
good,"Good frendly environment, fast paced, would like to work for them one day."
good,Pharmacy is fast paced everyday. You are constantly learning. Customers not understanding their health insurance is probably one of the hardest parts of job. Surrounded by very smart people.
good,"My day consists of entering and typing prescriptions,helping customers at the service window, sometimes calling insurance companies if needed, filling prescriptions. I learn new things each day with different insurances and new prescription regulations. Management is nice, also willing to work with your schedule. Co workers are nice and very helpful. The job can be stressful at times but i just take a breath and keep a positive attitude ."
good,Was really a stopping point on my career path.
good,Currently work graveyard shift in the warehouse picking store orders.
good,There a big company and they treat there employees ok for being so big. The store discount is nice. The management can either be really good or really poor though.
good,"As one of the requirements for the pharmacy technician trade I took, the month long exernship was fun taught me a lot about customer service and teamwork. I was filling prescriptions for customers and interacting with a great group of coworkers who were always willing to help and teach me the daily routines."
good,The typical day you would check the schedule to see what postion you would be working and what time you are scheduled for lunch and breaks. You get the supplies you need for your station. I learned a lot from working retail I also received my certification from working there they actually paid for it. The manangement was fine at certain locations. I got along with my co-workers as well the hardest part of working at my last location was an issue with equality that did not get the proper attention and also having to work certain holidays when you have small children. The most enjoyable part was you got a quarterly bonus and also one at Christmas time.
good,Walgreens is a good starting place to work. Management varies store to store and the pay is okay depending on what you put in. The schedule changes every week which is good if you need to change hours or need a day off but doesn't offer any continuity. Over all it is a good place to work.
good,Proud to help this business and continue learning about products and ablity to sell
good,"Tough retail work, but challenging and a good place to work. Busy work days lots a planning and time management a must."
good,"Good company to work for overall. They do very good things for their hourly employees but for the management team and executive staff it is a difficult environment because they require a bi-annual shift rotation, which in my experience is very difficult, especially on a family."
good,very quick employment didnt get much of an opportunity to learn much
good,"Walgreens was a good company to work with. You come and punch in and start your day. Sometimes the manager will ask you to do a specific project and finish it at certain time. Co-workers were okay, mostly older group but the store stayed in tact. I learned that no matter what your environment is like you stick it out and keep going."
good,"Very nice place to work. Management is a little bit on the older management style however there are changes and sparks here and there. Walgreens is primarily politics. Very difficult to move up unless you plan on playing a ton of politics. Also probably not a good place to advance if you are single, as this has been brought up a few times by managers. After about five or ten years you might get promoted. This is a great place to work if you want a stable, steady job. Promotions or advancement potential maybe questionable, especially politically, but as far as steady work, Walgreens has it."
good,"Great place to work but not a company for advancements any more. I have learned patience, better my customer service skills and learn new things about the company each day. My co-workers are amazing and we all get along. They are what make my day enjoyable and make the work day easier. We are a great team."
good,"Can be extremely busy but, yet consistantly recognized for positive work."
good,"As a photo tech, I develope customer film and take in picture orders from our kiosk system. The hardest part of the job is that it is not always consistently busy and I enjoy being busy."
good,"* Managing employees is challenging, but has great lessons in dealing with multiple personalities."
good,"Typical days of work consist of cash handling, complete and create tasks, manage inventory."
good,work with customers
good,Go in work and you be greeted fairly. Co Workers were very friendly and always willing to help. Very understandable supervisor.
good,The typical day for a Walgreen's manager is structured considering the fact that the business is retail. It is a good company that is continually growing and has been around for a long time and a company that makes good business decisions.
good,"Strong company financially. Headed in the right direction with regards to employee engagement. very ""corporate."""
good,"Working with the public always brings challanges from getting a crying childs medication fast and accurate while the pain clinic guy huffs because he has to wait even though he should have 2 days of meds left. The poor 10 year old child who is translating to his parents on how to take their medication, and you wonder if either understand."
good,"Working for walgreens was great. There was so much room to learn and put the new learned skills to work. I did the bookkeeping for the store for a long time as well as worked as a person that reset the different departments and then signed everything. I also worked in the photo department for a long time. I loved the people I worked with. We were all very much like family. Some days the multi tasking became a puzzel in my head. I really had to find good way of being able to remember where I left off with my projects that I was doing. I loved being able to work for this company, being my first real job that I had real responsablity I was able to really decover the areas that I love to work in and the talents that I have."
good,"A typical day at work will be working with the photo machine printing pictures. As well as working with costumers selling items from the store,since its a retail store. Ive learn how to deal with people concerns and how to comunicate better with each individual situation. My co-workers are very friendly and comunicative with each other, also they know how to work as a team. The worse that this job could get is dealing with the costumer, treating every situation differently takes time to professionalize.What I enjoy the most at this job is working with the photo machine, dealing with hardware and software."
good,"Great Work Environment, very fast pace, never a dull day! THe Division has been bought out and is no longer in business."
good,"From walking into the building in the morning. To leaving at night its a great workplace. Management was on call when you needed them. Co-workers were always in high spirits. Hardest part was the inventory truck. Overall, i loved working at Walgreen's."
good,Requires a lot of good customer service skills and lots of multi tasking.
good,My position at Walgreens was fairly simple. I was a checker and I also stocked items on the shelves. While working there I learned a lot about how to deal with certain sitiuations when it comes to a dissatisfied customer. That was probably the hardest part of my job; when the pharmacy was backed up the calls directed to me and I learned how to handle disgruntled customers. Interacting with people was also the most enjoyable part of my job. Having a friendly conversation or saying a simple hello could brighten someones day.
good,everything depends on the level of manager you work for and their security with helping you advance your career
good,"I only done my clinicals here, but it was an excellent work enviorment."
good,Working at Walgreens was an enjoyable experience. I learned that by just helping people can make you feel good. The managers were easy to get along with and made the job enjoyable. My co-workers were very down to earth. The hardest part of the job was closing at the end of the day. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing customers that were truly satisfied with their service.
good,"I learned a great deal from my experience at Walgreens. Chosen to attend their pharmacy management training classes, I attribute my knowledge about logistics, inventory management, people management and operational analysis to them. I was blessed to have the opportunity to work in so many different locations. It's truly amazing to see and understand the differences in management styles when everything should be standardized. This experience gave me the opportunity to become very well-rounded in operations as such a youngster in the field."
good,Most of sales team was very helpful. Management wasn't fair. Typical day included maintaining department and restocking shelves. Helped out in other departments if needed.
good,Hours are long and 2nd shift is hard with a 3 year old at home
good,My day would consist mostly of customer service. There were a lot of regular customers and some needed special attention. I enjoyed my customers. I ran the photo lab which consisted of completing orders within a specific time frame along with maintaining the developing machine so that it would allow me to complete the orders. I was responsible for covering the breaks and lunches of the other departments in the store which involved a lot of multi-tasking. I would do a lot of merchandising as well as checking in and putting away the freight that arrived twice a week. I had great relationships with co-workers and never got tired or bored with the job as long as i worked there.
good,This job gives you hours you need. Pay may be low but its a good company. well it was to me
good,Walgreen's Pharmacy was a fun working atmosphere. I learned a lot about retail management while employed with Walgreen's. The most enjoyable part about the job was working in the pharmacy. I learned so much about various medicines and drug interactions.
good,"A typical day at work--I come in greet customers, take in and process prescriptions and then sell them. Then I look at the work que to see if there are problems that can be solved with insurance issues, etc. If I have time I do inventory things like make mylars for drugs or send back expiring drugs."
good,I process film and digital prints. I also maintain and clean the equipment. Provide friendly customer service.
good,During a typical work day I was able to work many different positions in the pharmacy. Which helped me to gain knowledge in every area of the pharmacy.
good,"It was ok to work there. Management was lacking, but some good co-workers."
good,"I would open and close the store, in charge of cash control, inventory, training new em woployees, I am familiar with this type of position I have been in Retail since I was 16 years old. My Co-Workers were amazing. I loved going to work everyday"
good,"i like to work here but i expect get a high position, all my co workers are excellent and also the management"
good,Great place for work. Great place to get experience in customer service and retaill enviornment.
good,Really enjoyed working with everyone. Never really felt like it was a chore to go to work. It was a fun work inviorment
good,"work at Walgreen is fun. the tams at Walgreen is incredible, the managers are handsome and is always fun to help the customers meet their needs"
good,Walgreens is a great company and enjoyed working there for seven years.
good,"The day to day work is the same, however every day is different depending on the customers. My coworkers are what makes the days better because we all get along well, and we try to have fun. Definitely the hardest part of the job is dealing with the public. Somedays they are pleasant, and other days it's a bit more demanding. However, there is never a shortage of people to help you out with a difficult situation."
good,"Walgreens has higher standards than its competitors, and the workload is fair. There is room for advancement within the company (it is preferred), but you must be persistent and diligent. Built within each store is a sense of community, even with management. Sometimes you get under a poor or mean store manager like any other place of business. They are semi-flexible with your schedule but have certain shifts, so it is hard to work, say, a four hour shift three times a week."
good,"After start up meeting and stretching we would get our tags for assigned areas and pull cases till done.Management was tough but fair for the most part.Coworkers were good hardworking people not a bum in the bunch.Hardest part of the job was all the stretching ,bending and stooping to pull product it was also the part I liked the best it kept me flexible and in shape"
good,"Usually a busy place to work, always something to do and the crew I worked with were friendly and fun. The customers get to know you and you them and I think that is the best part of that job is getting to know your people by name and making them enjoy coming in to see and chat with us, management was fun and laid back but also made sure we were doing what were suppose to be doing to get our job done while also remembering that we need to be aware of our surroundings at all times to be safe,, The hardest part of a job would be a member who didnt like an employee because she was very sweet and likes to talk when some days you have to leave it to a minimum and be a little quicker to keep the line moving, it is not easy cutting short a good conversation with someone who is an elder and looks forward to their visiting us.."
good,The management side of the job is very demanding and it can become your life if you let it. You have to become a very strict and by the book manager to even survive.
good,Meeting new customers everyday. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to answer any questions or concerns the customers had. Providing great customer service.
good,"Enjoy retail a lot, but if possible at least one holiday off would be nice"
good,Great company to Work for. Great Co workers an a great work with
good,On a typical day I would go in around 8am and leave arund 430 pm and fill perscriptions. The people were very nice to work for but the commute was very hard since I was an unpaid intern through my school.
good,Had a lot of fun I was a photo specialist kinda slow but over all fun place to work
good,"Depending on the location of the store, can be a very busy day with not a dull moment to spare. Sink or swim idiology for most part, but with the right manager can learn marketing skills. I learned something every day. Managers work very hard merchandising, answering register calls for refunds, exchanges, and change. You will run between vendors and customers and employee calls. If you love people and customer service, you will love working for this quality company."
good,"Taking care of store, paper work, office work, employee training, etc."
good,"Typing, typing, typing all day long. Schedule ran like clock work. Training is great, some management was great, co workers were all great. I started out with a great shift."
good,"long hours, many responsibilities."
good,You need to make sure that you are prepared to do a lot of work for not that much pay. Need to be able to keep yourself busy during down time from customers.
good,"My work days are very busy. Answering phones, calling insurance companies, resolving insurance issues, keeping the pharmacy clean all ties into my daily duties. I learned how to be more empathetic when it comes to irrate customers about their medication. And when I say irrate its because of the insurance company most of the time. Managemnet and my co-workers are great to work with. I never had a problem with any of the Walgreens team. The most enjoyable part of the job is typing the prescriptions and submitting them to the insurance companies, Also the hands on filling of the medication is enjoyable also."
good,"I was responsible for correction counts, price changes, and on certain shifts, managing. This however, did not mean I was to do any disciplinary actions, almost like a boss that can't correct any wrong doings. I was to inform my boss and then they were to take care of the issue. My boss however, painted me as a tattletale and did not actually take care of the issues brought to his attention. When I would go on vacation, my boss would text me about drama going on at the store that had absolutely nothing to do with my position or my day to day responsibilities."
good,"The hardest and most challenging part of the job is communicating between, the patient's physician and insurance representative, in completing a patient's prescription. All insurances have their preferred formulary and physician's have their preferences on treatments and medications, and formularies change continuously and/or requires specific documents or procedures, before a patient's prescription will be covered by their insurance, it's a technician's responsiblity to communication these requirements to the physician, so he/she can complete the requirements in a timely manner."
good,"Due to budget cuts I am the only tech. I come in and do inventory counts on drugs, post the order, assist customers with prescriptions, fix errors on prescriptions by making doctor calls. Call insurance with adjucation iniquiries, verify insurance plans, etc. The hardest part of the job is the short amount of hours. The most enjoyable is seeing the patients get their medications"
good,"We were generally busy with plenty of volunteer and mandatory overtime. The Bethlehem warehouse was 80% manpower operated. For more cost effective reasons, Walgreens started shipping a lot of the stores our warehouse serviced to other Walgreens warehouses that were 90% automated. I was a utility team member which was skilled in all aspects of the warehouse to cover whatever area needed the most help in a day. We all pretty much worked as a team. The hardest part of the job was manually unloading a tractor trailer. Didn 't happen too often, we rotated jobs. The most enjoyable part of my job was the satisfaction of getting the job done accurately and in less time that was expected."
good,"It can get hectic at times but it makes the day go by fast. I have learned to be more patient with people because of my job. The management is good they help out when they can. The people that i work with are excellent we all help each other out. The hardest part of the job is dealing with irrate customers, and last i enjoy fixing and problems that the patient may have with there prescriptions."
good,Comfortable setting and you have the option to work from home. There is lot of interaction thru instant message from Team Leaders and Co-Workers. Shift bids are offered according to performance. And discount are offered as an incentive.
good,"you never know when your days off will be because the manager of the store never fills out the schedule in advance. it is walgreens philosophy to move assts around from store to store whenever they feel like it. the most enjoyable part of the job is generally who you are working with on your team, the people that actually do the jobs."
good,I loved working for Walgreens. They worked around my pregnancy and were very understanding of my personal life. They had small bonuses for employees pushing certain items. Only drawback was not much room to move up to higher positions.
good,Walgreens matches dollar for dollar on 401K. Leave it to the big corporations to know how to take care of their employees.
good,I did appreciate the staffs kindness but overall I did not feel any advancement in fully learning everything in this pharmacy. This area was very busy which caused no time for one on one training.
good,A good job for someone in highschool or college that wants to get work experience. One of the better drug stores out there.
good,"They try to meet budget daily, monthly and yearly. Shipping department is the hardest very physical. Full case pick is the next in line scanning the product and putting on line. For warehouse work receiving is the best department to work in."
good,"This was a fantastic job for the most part. Job security, good staff, full time hours, new learning experiences, room for advancement, but it can be very stressful."
good,"I have liked working at Walgreens. It's not the best job out there, but it has had many long term benefits, and the coworkers are good people. I never feared losing my job, and most managers are pretty laid back."
good,Walgreens on the great company you can work with.
good,"i enjoyed working for Walgreen severing the people and assisting the pharmacist as a pharmacy technician i love the work ,the multitasking and filling of the prescription process"
good,"Always keep in mind no company is perfect.  Overall, Walgreens is a good company.  They have a great mission, purpose, and workplace culture. Friendly."
good,Great pharmacists that made our team better. They were able to motivate keep us motivated. It felt like a little family. Going to work didn't always feel like work because everyone was so great and friendly.
good,"Faced paced environment working together  with your teammates,. Getting a chance to  work with diversity of customers. Interacting with customers and greeting them at the front door. Working in a friendly environment making sure the customer leaves happy by going  above and beyond. most enjoyable part is feeling like you made a difference by showing customers you care."
good,"I came into this job with no knowledge of pharmaceuticals. I never wanted to do anything having to do with a pharmacy. I never went to school for it or nothing. I was just a blank canvas. After starting this job, I have definitely learned A WHOLE LOT. I am still struggling a little, but that is all on my personal behalf. I think the hardest part is dealing with insurance issues and learning the generic names for brand named drugs. Other than that I love this job, and you should definitely give it a shot if you are interested! It definitely isn't for everyone though."
good,"A typical work day consist of billing insurances, filling prescriptions, and assisting customers. All these tasks include multi-tasking, another important trait that one must posses is patience as working with the elderly isn’t as quickly as a younger individual"
good,This is a family friendly business.   They treat customers well.   I worked with a great staff.  They really strive to treat customers like family.   Flexible scheduling.
good,"Walgreens, or any retail pharmacy, is a great place to start your pharmacy career. If you really love it, it's a great place to retire also! It can get hectic, but there's so much support from your team. It's not the highest paying job, but you can support your family working here."
good,"-El desarrollo de tener paciencia hacia los clientes y darles un buen servicio."
good,"Retail isn't easy, but I love the direction that Walgreens is going with all the new programs they have put into place. The hours are tight and there are high expectations for the senior technicians. It can be very stressful, but if you can handle the pressure you will do just fine."
good,"Great place to work at."
good,"When validating IDs for alcohol and cigarettes, Walgreens allows employees to type or scan a birthdate into the system. If you type it in, everything relies on good faith that the employee actually had a verified ID card in hand, otherwise who's to know if they're just making up dates that fit within the age rating? It's not like a manager is standing behind you for each transaction and checking to see if you're doing it right. I was fired for this, I had very many return customers and I entered one too many dates in by hand and when corporate checked they didn't like what I was doing. I suggest that Walgreens change the system to be where you can only accept scannable ID cards or else the transaction cannot happen, the current way of verifying is shoddy at beast and a definite loophole on the companie's end. I enjoyed my job and had plans to continue working for them out of state when I moved, now I'm back at square one looking for another retail job I can get fired from. :("
good,"All i can say is just work your best. Dont give any one a hard time, be carful of who you put your trust in. Be mindful of everyone and everything around you."
good,"I really liked working at Walgreens. The managers were very friendly and helpful when needed. I lived the customers that came in, especially the ones who would come in everyday. It was a really good work environment."
good,"Could be a good place to work if they actually cared about their employees and gave Christmas bonuses not $25 in points especially since you have too work at least one of the holiday because they never close.   No security , thieves and homeless people hanging every day , you cant say anything to the theft and the homeless you run off but they come rite back .   Hint SERCUITY they said we don't need. The employees are friendly and nice , fun to work with"
good,Walgreens is a phenomenal company to work for. I've had the pleasure of working both in their stores and corporate environment. The most challenging part of the job is the lack of balance between work/home life. You'll be working long hours with compensation that does not equate to the amount of work you put in. The best part of the job is the sense of purpose it provides the impact you have on others is extremely tangible and rewarding. Colleagues and management are for the most part very understanding and easy going. I would definitely suggest this corporation for anyone seeking employment.
good,"I love this company. here most customer is gentle and corporate."
good,"Walgreens gave me experience on how to interact with every demographic possible for customers. I value this as my background is sales/business administration. A typical work day involved me either cashiering, or working on warehouse and in the photo department."
good,Everyone worked together and helped each other out. The training process did not take long and the management changed more frequently than I would have liked in order to maintain a upbeat work environment.
good,"This is a very good company to work for. The customers were excellent. Management was switched around too often, miscommunication often, and I was over it!!!"
good,"When I worked there it was the holiday season. My hours were wacky, sometimes working 40 hours in seven days, with only one consecutive day off. But the people were great, the benefits were great, and they were very understanding"
good,I enjoying working in different parts of the store to help customers find what they need and the tools they need to succeed. Would like more money for the amount of work that I do.
good,I enjoyed working at Walgreen's Healthcare Clinic. The work was manageable and staff caring. Everyone worked well together. The patients are very demanding as in most clinic because the clinic is mainly walk in on a first come first serve basis.
good,"Was a cool job during the summer for Summer Youth. I got to meet tons of amazing people who I laughed and had fun with. I can’t say the experience will be the same for others working there, but for me it was a blast."
good,"Walgreen's encourages promotion from within their employees, so I was able to advance my career with them rather quickly. They are a good company to work with."
good,For the most part it's very pleasant and peaceful place to work. Normal work related activities. Room for advancement. On the job training . Very friendly.
good,"I didn't work at Walgreens for very long but from what I can tell, it's a good place to start. The environment for the most part is slow paced, and the tasks are relatively easy."
good,"I was with the company for over 10 years and have very little negative things to say about the company. They had great benefits, were same sex friendly, and accommodated to pregnant employees."
good,High stress. Not enough pay for the stress. Alot is asked of you. Takes a certain type of personality to thrive in this field. Holidays are very stressful.
good,"I truly enjoyed working at Walgreen's and getting to know the regular customers plus helping all the customers. The problem was with the store manager, 2 shift lead managers and the assistant manager quit within a 4 month time because of her. I believe that says enough."
good,"I loved being a pharmacy technician and Walgreens was a good, fun, fast paced place to work. I enjoyed my almost 10 years of being a tech. I left due to switching careers. I would recommend working for Walgreens."
good,"Was a nice business to work for. Excellent coworkers. Good for teaching others. Taught workers about how to bring more business, getting customers involved and find out what they are looking for"
good,"Very unfortunate Upper Management decided to close all the clinics throughout the US.  It was said it was a financial decision, though the clinics were never promoted or advertised."
good,"While some of my survey answers may initially make Walgreens look like it doesn't score very high, this is because for much of my time there I only worked about four hours a week. I have another job during most of the week and so couldn't work full time, and my store often doesn't have enough free hours to let me work more often. These factors may vary greatly from store to store, and my store isn't the busiest in the district. Overall, it's a good company to work for, and my managers are very flexible and understanding and get along with customers very well, with many regular customers that I see at least once a week."
good,"They will match 100% with 4% contribution "
good,"Easy retail, however you will have to work every holiday, walgreens is never closed. Hours always promised but part time is unlikely. Also once hired they will see how dedicated you are and work you 40 hours as soon as possible."
good,"It was pretty good, I'd go in, get my work done, and go out, nothing more and nothing less. I really liked the managers, they were nice people and helpful too,"
good,"I enjoy working for Walgreen's. It's time to get new experience and learn something new."
good,"Depends what your looking for. It's hard to climb up the ladder at Walgreens it's pretty much the same every day to me it became boring. Some people are ok with the same routine and comfortable with there position. Not I, I'm a person that strives for growth and I felt like at Walgreens I was not getting that."
good,they expect you to make walgreens your life for very little pay. Aside from management at your specific location its not always the best environment to work. they expect you to treat it like a full time job with benefits and that's not it. its physically taxing. I had great management which made working for them easier because I wanted to work for them. however on a whole it has its issues
good,The balance of task while they empathize the importance of customers yet push us to do all our work. They are back and forth with what we should do. I’m just going with the flow
good,technicians are expected to regularly provide basic customer service to patients or customers. This is a place you will never be bored because there are so many duties in this environment.
good,A typical day at work would be low sometimes in terms of some of the negative energy that I would receive from the customers and even my team but I still manage to get the job done. Sometimes I had days like that and sometimes I would have a good day.
good,"Expect to do everything and anything at this place. Everyday is a new adventure. Hours get cut sometimes unexpectedly and less people equals more work."
good,"A typical day at work is clocking in, then restocking, greeting customers, cashier duty, and cleaning."
good,"Might be due to my management team, but I didn't find myself happy as much as I thought I would. It's a shame too because the company is pretty great."
good,"Enjoyed working with everyone,but it would have been a lot better if we had proper training. And not feeling like we were stupid when asking a question."
good,Walgreens is company driven not employee driven.   It has a habit of overlooking the best employee for the job in favor of the ones who they don't have to pay as much.
good,"I love my team, but Walgreens as a whole is not a great employer. My store is not a significantly busy one, and I get to work with great people. I've learned a lot about working with others and honestly meeting and interacting with people has been the best part for me. However, whenever corporate is involved, it's usually pretty clear that they don't care about the little guy."
good,"Overall I really enjoyed my time working at Walgreens. I started working at a store in Colorado and had to move to Utah so my manager at the CO store put in the paperwork for a transfer instead of me having to apply as a new hire. My manager in UT was not so great. The people you work with at Walgreens will determine whether your job is great and you love going there everyday, or you won't want to work there."
good,"It wasn’t easy, but it wasn’t hard, in little to no time I got the hang of things, and the cash register became my friend, and so did the public. There were a lot of responsibilities, but each team member upholds their own part of the deal"
good,"Enjoyable place to work that gives managers an idea to plan on a daily basis. When you walk the entire place and plan daily, it doesn't allow things to pile up and makes the long term plan much easier."
good,They made sure that I was able to have my schedule work around when I needed to be at school and do my studies. I enjoyed my time working there and never really had many difficulties while working there.
good,"Walgreens is a pretty good job to have. Benefits after three months, raises very easy to receive. Plenty opportunities to move up in the company. Team oriented"
good,"When I first started it was great I learned a lot in a few weeks and was treated with respect, but since Walgreens bought rite aid. I’ve seen the company take a down wards nose dive our district manager is taking our freedom to make  decisions and threw them away."
good,I have enjoyed working for Walgreens part-time for the past 18 years. Walgreens will allow you to learn how to work in the retail pharmacy and take care of patients regarding their medication.
good,"Working at Walgreens was an experience. The hands on experience is very beneficial and so are all departments of the company. I appreciate all that was learned whilst working here, and am pretty confident the thing that I learned and experienced here will be very useful. The social skills and problem solving skills I've learned here will be used through out my life and any other job I obtain."
good,it was cool. I've been to different stores and each store is different. I would say its not much to do unless your working in the pharmacy or if your a manager
good,I enjoy working at Walgreens. It is a well know company who offer lots of services for their customers. There are several departments so they’re lots of positions and your job always varies from one shift to the next.
good,It’s been good working there for most part but the highermenagement doesn’t care about other employees and doesn’t know what we techs go through everyday. Employees/ techs  have to go through stupid laws that are not as helpful .
good,Great staff and a relaxed environment that you typically don’t see in a pharmacy. Fast-paced environment that should be expected but very efficient all the way around.
good,Loved Walgreens depends on the manager you get in all honesty my first manager was amazing but this one not so much thank you.........................
good,"Productive, excellent management, and adequate training. Got to know regulars and new faces everyday, loved being able to help a customer out and leave them satisfied once they left the store."
good,I enjoyed the fast paced work environment and I enjoyed being able to learn new skills from my colleagues and co workers. The health benefits were good and the work schedule was generally pretty good
good,I worked at Walgreens for 7 years and overall had a good experience. The location I worked at closed which is why I no longer work there. Flexibility with your schedule is great but the pay sucks.
good,aside from pay on the low end the job was fine not overly difficult or demanding the people were all friendly and there are product discounts for employees
good,Alot of great opportunities there. Only bad part is management switches every couple of months so that was really an issue but overall it was nice there
good,"There are many moving parts in a company this big and sometimes the major departments competed with each other for funding for key initiatives.  A great place to learn project management and how to influence others.  Needed to be nimble and ready to change direction, emphasis, etc. based on changes in leadership and priorities."
good,Overall the company is good to work for with just average benefits. It has changed in the time I have worked for the company. I have been with the company over 10 years. I used to be proud to work for this company but to many changes has made it feel like a hostile environment part of the time. Changes have been occurring quickly without them being ready to be implemented. Systems are being updated but they never seem to work and feel to confusing for even higher end leadership.
good,"I loved the nice environment and how I was able to work as many hours as I wanted per week. I appreciated the management, as well as, having an hour for break."
good,"Great place for a first retail experience, not so much a career. I went through many managers here due to the company being a pain. The rules set by the company are also painfully strict. Sadly the smallest mistake could land you in hot water. The people who work with you are mostly grown up, so there is a very rare risk you will be working with teenagers. Work/life balance is okay, but as people love to call out for no reason, it’s best to keep your schedule as open as possible. It’s hard to advance unless someone gets fired, quits, or gets transferred. Other than that, management was nice, coworkers were easy to form friendships with, and the customers were a nice 80/20 nice/rude ratio."
good,"I start my day by cleaning, cashiering and taking care of and interacting with the customers. Should any of my customers need anything at all, I am there to help in any way shape and/or form. "
good,Morning shifts were typically slow and can be boring while evening shifts could get busy.  Each employee only had a 30 minute lunch break but you are also allowed one or two additional 15 minute breaks  depending on how long your shift was. It's a pretty standard job and task oriented with good benefits. The only down side is that the company would relocate the managers every few months which made it difficult when everyone had to readjust to the new managers styles.
good,Working at Walgreens as a student worker it was a really good experience because it made me be more outgoing and more confident about myself . I really loved helping customers and really liked restocking on merchandise.
good,I believe if you are well educated on the information that you need to know to perform the duties of a pharmacy technician that this job will always be enjoyable for you.
good,"Working here just consists of stocking shelves, putting up sales tags and taking them down. Taking in truck and putting it away. We also deal with customers on a daily basis. I have amazing customer service skills."
good,"Overall, working at Walgreens is great but I felt that over the years new employees don’t want to be a team player and help each other out and manager rely on you on doing most of the work."
good,"Retail scheduling involves a lot of nights/weekends but they try to be fair."
good,"As a SFL I did daily price changes, scan outs, inventory, safe and cash handling, and training."
good,"a typical day would've been to greet customers, customer service, delegating work, clearing lines, inventory, ordering. what i learned is to have a strong mind time management how to work under pressure. the hardest part was mainly feeling like you didn't leave a customer satisfied. most enjoyable was the customers and the workers, getting to be around many personalities ."
good,"Most managers have a style based on their personality some are hands on others you hardly see during the day.  Most of our supervisors are very professional, however there are exceptions, some let their emotions override their judgement, almost always causes anger and resentment when our supervisors are poorly trained or are not consistently professional"
good,"Meetings with business stakeholders"
good,"The type of job where you start every morning, hitting the ground running. There was never a dull moment the entire time I worked for Walgreens Infusion. The great part about that is it made time fly by. Clock in to clock out felt like a blink of an eye."
good,"It's quite easy to advance at Walgreens with the accurate amount of integrity. There are plenty of job opportunities and all positions are required to have the accurate training. There are many resources available for not only employee wellness, but for customer wellness that employees can educate them about."
good,"Typical Day - A typical day includes 9 hours of tasks including but not limited to counting safe, check cash report and make adjustments if needed, releasing cash reports, task lists for all employees, checking in vendors, helping customers, truck twice a week, customer care takes majority of day."
good,"A typical day at work as a Intern would be really fast paced and dealing with customers on a daily and learning about new medications. In a pharmacy there is always new things to learn which would include new guidelines, medications, and customer service. The management was a great team always communicative and informative and always there to help or answer questions when needed. The workplace also had a big diversity when working which is a good attribute to have. The hardest part would be dealing with customers, knowing medications, and dealing with insurance. The most enjoyable part of work would be having a good atmosphere and team work amongst co workers/employees."
good,"It was a productive place to work. There is the opportunity to grow internally.  The workplace culture is very open and welcoming.  Management is very approachable, and willing to listen to ideas.."
good,"This was a great place to work, hours were never consistent, and the work could be a bit much on a busy day, especially if employees called-in. I enjoyed my managers and co-workers. They listen to you."
good,"I love working here, I learned so much and they were extremely flexible with my schedule but sometimes was hard to get hours because there are multiple technicians. Management was great, there was some internal drama with a few technicians who were dating but other than that very professional. It can get very busy and patients may be upset or frustrated. Loved filling and learning about medications and the pharmacists were always such great examples."
good,Walgreens was a good company to work for during school.  They allowed flexible hours for me while I was in pharmacy school.  I was able to work evenings and weekends.
good,"Walgreens was an interesting place to work, challenging at time because of the customers, rewarding because I got to help some customer better their lives. Fun because my coworkers was friendly."
good,"I would unload truck, stock the shelves, tag the shelf with sale prices. sweep, mop assist the cashiers if they needed help with anything. do nightly paperwork and make deposit."
good,"It really isn't a bad company to work for, however with the lack of hours, it makes it difficult to work proficiently. They really do take care of their employees."
good,"Very, busy work environment which kept you on your toes. Drive-thru was a very busy aspect for the pharmacy. Overall, diverse and friendly co-workers."
good,"Because the company ours are consistently cut ,it is better to have another job on the side. It is possible that you may or may not have a reasonable amount of hours for weeks at a time."
good,"I'd usually open the pharmacy and work with another technician and the pharmacist on duty. Unfortunately I bc I was the newest, I'd have to go find it and bring it back home, doggy style."
good,As a salaried manager we had to do everything that all employees did. We had to unload truck and set up all displays. There are even times we had to be the employee and run registers .
good,"They change hours too often. Now being given less hours."
good,When started what was then Happy Harry's pharmacy did not know anything about being a pharmacy technician I learned alot there. Overall a good first technician job.and and they payed for certification.
good,Delivered an enhanced customer experience as a result of product and services knowledge. Introduced promotions and cross-selling products to communicate quality and increase value. Achieved and exceeded established goals while troubleshooting system software problems.
good,"Good place to work friendly people and almost toxic free!"
good,loved the job learned how to provide great customer service and its an fair relaxed work environment! theres room to progress and i loved the entire job for the most part
good,"Loved working at Walgreens, a lot of opportunity for advancement. The store I worked in was very busy, so there was always a lot to do. Sometimes we were understaffed, so that made things difficult, but overall, good company and excellent benefits."
good,Fast paced and challenging environment. Best for someone who works well under constant pressure and able to time-manage effectively. Standard benefits. Excellent pay and 401K.
good,it was one of my first jobs out of the military it was fun and exciting I participated in a lot of store functions. started as a service clerk and quickly rose to the store inventory clerk position allowed me to move from store to store and deal with other inventory clerks and managers. its a good start but not for a long term commitment.
good,"My managers except for one were all very nice and understanding. They treat you like people instead of robots. Policies in place are okay. I think it's a good job for decent pay. You deal with a lot of weird or interesting customers. It would be a good job for a college student. The hours are okay but if you aren't a people person then this job might not be for you. Customers DON'T read fine print and they DON'T verify coupons before purchasing. You will learn that the general public is not the smartest but if you are compassionate and understand you will be alright. "
good,I went to work here in only a temporary capacity for the summer between school semesters. They allowed me to stay on as a part-time temp during school.
good,Young people working who are lazy. Shift leads have to do everything in store and try and manage team. Not paid nearly enough to work pharmacy and every department.
good,"I enjoyed working for Walgreens. I mostly had good managers, but some were not good. They were mostly flexible with time I needed off various events and such."
good,"My typical day at work is clocking in and dealing with insurance issues and filling prescriptions. I've learned many things while being there, billing insurances, dealing with all kinds of patients, learning to work well with others. One of the hardest parts of the job is having to deal with an unhappy customer and trying to compensate them. I think the most enjoyable part is when the customer leaves happy with our service."
good,Standard retail pharmacy with good benefits and pay. Positive company culture. Long hours as are typical with retail pharmacy. Challenging budget labor model due in part to falling reimbursement rates.
good,Many times understaffed and overworked. Typical day is non-stop working if not running with little relief.  Management is supportive but difficult to support overworked pharmacist.
good,"Nice place to work. Management  was great, very understanding of life/work balance. Pay is great, based on position and experience. Would recommend this company."
good,I have a great Pharmacy Manager who believes in all his people and very approachable. I have enjoyed many aspects of working at Walgreens; they believe in their employees and allow them to be autonomous.
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was the daily contact that I would run into by meeting with different people every single day. The best feeling of this job was seeing a heartwarming smile from a patient after helping them overcome the personal symptoms they were feeling.
good,This job was great for me at the time I was there. I was just out of school and was transitioning to a full time job. I started as a cashier and advanced to Head Photo Specialist within a year. The management was great in helping me advance as far as I could go at this location. When I was transitioning to leave they worked with me to drop down to part time until I was fully trained and ready for my next job.
good,"I am a SFL. The stores need more staffing, but always not a necessity. A lot of rx operations are of utmost importance. Management has a lot to deal with, but we are fair."
good,Everyday you had the opportunity to meet customer needs. Expand your skills and knowledge. Management was always available to help guide you through any challenges that may arise.
good,"Shift started at 3pm. I worked Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. Usually lasted till 10:30. All employees helped with evening shutdown. Store was always left clean. Had to memorize weekly sales circular because computer did not always ring correct sales price. Pointed customers to applicable coupons. Helped unload and stock merchandise weekly."
good,A very fun job with great customer relations and management. It was very easy to balance work and life and overall a good job. Much room to go up in the company and pretty slow paced .
good,Received additional training through externship at Walgreen's to complete trade school. Pima Medical Institute.  Trying to learn the process of a retail pharmacy
good,Worked at a very fast paced store. Friendly environment and the workers were customer friendly. The ability to satisfy and meet customer needs was rewarding.
good,This is a good starter job for teenagers who are looking for a job. I started working there to work in the pharmacy so it could be a good job for that too.
good,"I’ve worked for Walgreens for 3 years it’s a good company to work in if you’re in school full time or part time, you would have a schedule that fits your availability."
good,"management kinda bad, but the co-workers are nice and good working as a team to get through the day. as far as the pharmacy department we make it work with the scheduling if you need certain days off or need to leave early."
good,I love working at Walgreens i have grown as a person and if i move i can always transfer to another state hardest part of the job is not having enough people
good,The store that I worked for didn't have a strong leadership and caused a down fall. Losing majority of its staff from regular workers to management as well.
good,"Walgreens was a great place to work as a starter job, this provided me a great way to build up some experience and gain retail experience. management was very understanding"
good,"Walgreens in my experience has been a welcoming environment, with good work culture and the desire to accommodate employee needs within reason. There is also a desire to promote and advance employees from within the company, so there is room for upward mobility whatever the employee's initial position."
good,"As an intern, one thing i really enjoyed was management. They really empowered staff to make decisions on our own. They showed genuine interest on how we should handle various tasks."
good,"Managers are salary, so overtime was necessary until job or task complete."
good,learned very fast and love working in the high demand fast paced work place. Did daily inventory for randomly picked drugs. Also processed flu shots for customers along with other immunizations.
good,"A typical day at work varies as to which dept. i work in that day and what shift"
good,Worked there in highschool and they were very good to work with my school and sports schedule. Very friendly staff and coworkers. Enjoyed my time there
good,"The people are amazing, and I have been given multiple opportunities to further my growth as a person and employee. I think Walgreens, as a company, could be better compensating everyone accordingly."
good,"it's a busy workplace (sometimes)"
good,"The Walgreens that I am working with is a big place with big population. This store/pharmacy is always busy all the time. I enjoyed working with a busy place especially with my superiors who are so helpful and coaches the workers to be better. The only thing that I am concerned of is the number of employees in each shift. It should be given consideration (additional force) since the store and the pharmacy really has a lot of customers.  With this, we can better serve and help our customers well."
good,"Walgreens is a fairly easy job that can be fun and is good for giving someone retail experience as well as customer service experience. You'll learn how to deal with all types of customers, and most employees become familiar with different roles in the store."
good,Worked here while in high school and some college. Accommodating with schedule and schoolwork. Customer service key. Some management very nice others did not belong.
good,Store and pharmacy management need to work as a team. Store management needs to encourage and support the decisions of Pharmacy management and the team.
good,"Walgreens is awesome company , it’s a relaxed calm environment to work for . Awesome customers , great deals ! Awesome benfites , you can become along ways with the company so many career options ."
good,Coworkers and management easy to work with. Always something to do. Friendly customers. Hours were nice. Close to home. Schedule kept same week by week.
good,overall was a good place to work they never gave me a problem needing time off. we all worked together so it made things easier for all of us to get our jobs done.
good,"I had a great experience at walgreens and this experience have help me get great skills is retail, i have learn how to grow and care for out shoppers and patients"
good,"This job was a very good job for where I was in my life during my employment. The management did what they could to work with your schedule, and was very accommodating."
good,"Nothing about the job was very demanding. Most of it involved just standing at the register and facing the store when there were no customers, which was frequent because it's Walgreens. Most of the employees were pretty nice which made things nice. Working only three people a shift, sometimes two, made it very hard to get a lot done in the store which was annoying however."
good,Once they taught you the basics of using the computers and the intercom computer you were kind of on your own the majority of my work was mainly filling prescriptions. As I was only there for a certain amount of hours most of my actual learning was towards the end of my allotted hours.
good,Very good place to work at if your position is secure! If your job is not secure then the job really isn’t great. Constant change and not promised anything at all.
good,The job requires quickly completing tasks and being on your feet the full shift. The environment is very diverse and met a lot of different types of customers.
good,A great workplace and easy to learn new skills such as counting and photo and problem solving what I have learned the most was people skills and how to solve situations. The hardest part about my job is standing for a long period of time
good,There isn't much growth in the pharmacy but if you work up front they prefer to promote from within so there is opportunity to climb the ladder all the way up to district manager
good,The store is well put together the manager who has been there for over 5 years is very good at what she does . The team is very friendly and helpful in assisting you to find exavtly what you need . At times the store was almost too slow but it left time for cleaning amd other tasks .
good,I like the company and the people I just don’t like the schedule .The company has a very poor communication with thier associates.Not informed of business plans or it’s an income going to be changing settings in the schedule that might affect its associates financially
good,"It is an ok job for someone who just wants extra money. Maybe a high schooler. I hated how they force you to ask the customers the same sayings over and over, even when they were in a rush or we were busy."
good,"I loved my co-workers, the work environment was hilarious. I loved my customers and the encounters I had with them. The shift leads were my favorite. I just didn't like that I never got a raise after almost 2 years of working there, and the commute wasn't the best."
good,"I ran the IT Field service team and covered 270 stores, making sure that all the hardware in the stores, DO, and warehouses were running and took the steps to make sure my team was ready to go."
good,I enjoyed it as my first job. I went in looking for the beauty advisor role but was hired as a customer service associate. I was still able to assist customers with makeup but I slowly started working in Photo Service and I loved it.
good,"It’s fun, i learned a lot but its time to move on. I was given an ultimatum by a manager. I was asked to stop talking to another manager simply because she didn’t like the other. so. bye."
good,"Just what you would expect from large chain retail...  really depends what the store volume and staffing is like, and as Pharmacy Manager, that is entirely up to you."
good,Muy buena experiencia de trabajo en esta empresa. .
good,"I worked at several different locations throughout my time there. Some were amazing and I miss the people, other's I hope I never have to see because the location was dog-eat-dog. The job itself is worth it provided you're not above having to deal with addicts and thieves trying to get the overdose of pain-killers their farmer-like Dr. prescribed."
good,"Walgreens was a summer youth job and temporary. I can not give a specific review, but the work experience was totally different, slightly extravagant, but I learned a lot."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my 4.5 years at Walgreens. Initially, Walgreens was a great fit for me as they were able to offer a flexible schedule around my college classes. As I advanced to management, however, that flexibility disappeared. I was unable to count on when my days off would be, and I could not request time off during the holidays. Eventually, circumstances in life outside of work lead me to seek out work with a more consistent work schedule."
good,"Walgreens is a happy place to work and most offer flexible schedules and insurance. I was able to move back and forth between different stores and keep my job during college, which was very helpful for me."
good,"Loved working in Surprise, worked together as a team, functioning well together. Great work culture and environment. Management always willing to help as well. They wouldn't ask employees to do something they weren't willing to do. Constant communication."
good,"since i worked in the pharmacy it was pretty busy, and i dont think i the pay is sufficient for the amount of work the cooperation wants done... but all my coworkers have made it fun especially the pharmacy manager."
good,a typical day at work is helping the customers and making sure we meet their needs. the hardest part of the job was having to balance becoming a single mom and having to be at work on time or having to call out once in awhile.
good,Walgreens was a place for me that allowed for their workers to make thier way up the totem pole with promotions as seen fit by the staff they helped trained.
good,I worked at walgreens specialty pharmacy corporate in irving tx not the walgreens retail store. it is very repetitive but you are helping patients get the medications they need and there are lots of children who need the meds you are verifying insurance for.
good,"it's a good company to start up your career, it's just that i was just a floater and i don't get paid 40 hours a week. that's the reason i resigned and tried to get a full=time job"
good,"The day mostly comprised of standard security duties with some time for independent security analytics. IT Security management was more of the ""intimidate to get compliance of the workers"" type. The corporate culture was dated but was being brought into the 21st century rapidly after the Walgreens/Boots Alliance integration. i greatly enjoyed working with my co-workers but left because of the management."
good,"(Keep in mind this review is coming from a guy who has about 120 hours of job experience at a Walgreens in the ghetto so make of that what you will) "
good,I worked from home and it was a very good experience. There were days that were super busy some that were not as busy. Since I worked from home I did not have to go into the office.
good,"Relaxed atmosphere, but also need to get things done. Customer service oriented with great management. Flexible hours, pay raises every year, though small."
good,I worked here before going to the nightmare that is CVS. This company is fine to work for. I worked overnight 7 days on 7 off. 10 hour shifts. Management was good and I enjoyed the time i worked here.
good,"Walgreens is a fine place to work. However depending on how busy the store is, it can get really boring especially when you are caught up on all your assigned tasks.  The company has good benefits for full time employees."
good,the pay is ok and depending where you work the management is easy to get along with. as any retail job there is always drama. i enjoy working here and i have made many friends here.
good,"It is fast-paced, and it can be difficult sometimes. But you learn your own little tips and tricks to figure things out and, in the end, give the patient the best care possible."
good,"alot of patient interaction. opportunitites to counsel which is great. but there is not enough staff available to help the pharmacist.with this sad, it can be stressful to help customers efficiently."
good,"My time at walgreens was good, I don't have much to complain about "
good,A busy faced paced retail store. Value and customer loyalty is very important. Very little stress and teamwork is key. There is ongoing training as you grow with the company.
good,I had a great experience working at walgreens they made me feel welcomed and always offered assistance if i needed and i had good time getting to lnow my co workers and work along side them.
good,While working at Walgreens there was always a manager on the clock. This was key since there were situations where a manager would be needed for assistance or to answer questions I did not know.
good,"Working at Walgreen's  is challenging, its hard work you need to be able to lift at least 50 pounds.  Working with customers is fun and challenging at the same time.  You need to be able to multi task on a daily bases.  My co-workers and I like to have fun with each other we are like a family."
good,"For me Walgreens was a different experience. I loved my coworkers and job itself. My only few complaints I ever had was with scheduling. All of the senior techs would get weekends off. I would get the odd shifts because of my open availability, which is totally on me, but that being said it would've been nice to not have to ask for weekends off. I did have one incident with the management when I informed them of a funeral for a family member and they insisted on having me come in right after. Other than the two issues above I really did enjoy my time at Walgreens. The store was high volume so I stayed pretty busy. Now I do know my experience may differ from others, every store is different. Overall it was a good time."
good,"Management depended on who was working. Never offered promotion after years of services. As soon as I left, multiple people were promoted. Overall, it is a great job for high schoolers or entry level employees but advancement is hard."
good,"They had good benefits package. They matched money put in to a profit-sharing program. Paid sick days, holidays and vacation. They even give you a day off for your anniversary ( day hired) to use when you liked. Would let you do overtime when needed or to help put other stores, if you volunteered."
good,"By far the easiest job however had a lot of tasks to get done. Typically would do the job of three people. Setting store up for ad sales for customers, running the photo counter,helping cashier with customers when lines are long, help pharmacy with long lines also. Management did not seem to really care for culture just getting the work done. Hardest part of the job was when I was pregnant and expected to stand entire shift and lift things seemed unrealistic."
good,Ive loved the opportunity to grow and expand with Walgreens. You don't work somewhere almost 14 yrs if you didn't. But I'm looking for something different.
good,"I work the earliest that's from 6:00 AM to 2:00 PM. If I am assigned at the front-end I make sure all things around me are organized and cleaned, It is somehow tough setting the mood for the day as early as I work but could managed it and was able to do understand and help attend to each of the early customers everyday."
good,Working at walgreens was great. Fellow employees and management very friendly. Flexible schedule for my family. Employees and management were helpful.
good,"I enjoyed working there.  IF you know what you want in a career, then you will know if this is the company for you.....almost immediately.  Every portion of position was intricate and detailed.  Compassionate, yet full-forced of what was expected of my role."
good,"While the current theme of Walgreens as a company is to promote a happy and healthy community, it would be great to consider the pharmacist as well. The patient care goals of the company would be more achievable by allowing scheduled lunch breaks for the pharmacist and adequate professional support with work shift overlap."
good,"I only worked through a temp service. "
good,Many opportunities to grow in the company.  Consistent in training and making sure you feel secure and knowledgable at the tasks required through day to day activities.
good,"Depending on who your manager is, it can be a great place to work.  My fist manager was probably the best I've ever had. Always willing to mentor, drives people to success, helps strengthen weaknesses. Advancement given to those who worked hard and showed initiative"
good,easy job fast environment. many areas to grow a career. i miss work for this company and would consider working here again. love to see the direction the company has gone in the last couple years
good,Most of the management staff seem to truly care about their employees.  The benefits are a little pricey but worth the money.  After a year you get stock options.  It is a great place if you want to work for a living and the chance for advancement is great.
good,I enjoyed working for Walgreens for a couple years but then the company changed for worse in my opinion. I wasn't able to advance my career so I left.
good,"Being a customer sales representative isn't difficult. You make sure that you tend to all of the customer's needs in a kind and friendly manner. Anything that is out of your knowledge/power, you can have anyone from leadership assist you. The customer's experience at you're store is what's most important. Management at my store is great. They are understanding of everyone's needs and are flexible with vacations, emergency situations, and other responsibilities. Leadership is always trying to have every staff member be engaged and have their own initiative. The company goals and plans for the week are always discussed to better inform the staff on what types of sales are going on and how to communicate that to the customers"
good,"I was very good at the job and it kept me busy. I enjoyed very much what i did there, and would definitely enjoy working there again. Plus, expired candy is tasty/"
good,I worked with Walgreens for 8 years like every work place there will be issues but overall I loved working with everyone especially the patients u get to help with all of there issues with over the counter to prescribed medications.
good,I had exposure to learn new applications and improve my skills to ensure quality in the health care clinics. The new team seating was challenging at the beginning but felt more comfortable  as I worked with teams I was not familiar with.
good,"I would recommend working at walgreens distribution center for many reasons , they do pay well , the benefits were good but could be better and more affordable,"
good,The workload varies and payroll budgets are decreasing across the industry but Walgreens pays you well for your time and encourages you to develop your support team to help make your life easier as a pharmacy manager. Over the past few years Walgreens has become more metric based (industry standard) which is not surprising but still be frustrating to keep up with
good,Everybody was reallu friendly fast paced..wage a little low but decent.. Great training programs and benefits for new pharmacy technicians great company to start career
good,They wanted to work you hard without paying you. Some of the manager  were really sweet and some you hated you have to work with them. If you get the right manager at the stores it would be great to work there.
good,"Great team to work with.  End of the month company deadlines."
good,A cashier job is a challenge I say that is because a person is constantly multitasking every minute....from transaction to keeping the front of the store free of debris and such thing as shopping carts. but first thing first is the customer and listening to their needs because they are the one spending the money. The enjoyment of it all it when the customer is satisfy with the shopping experience and that makes it all worth while.
good,"Typical day at Walgreens was. Get to work 10 minutes early, Managers motto was ""If your on time your late"" clock in, count the safe, check to see who you have working with you, conduct five minute meeting, Read P.O.A(plan of action) then get started, change requests, pull excess money from cashier drawers, help pharmacy if needed, customer service, delegate tasks to cashiers, beauty consultant. Stock, receive trucks, handle merchandisers, inventory scan outs, sweep, mop, etc. if you have worked retail before you know what the job consists of."
good,Walgreen was good for me especially for a student like i was then. They helped me to get some experience and pocket money while going to school. I will recommend it for young students and even adults whose careers are geared towards retailing.
good,Its a good place to work for. I am constantly pushed to do my best everyday I come to work. Also my Supervisors and Manager are very supportive with team members on their needs to do better in the in the work place.
good,"I liked it there, but they should raise their pay. Management was alright, but they are very clique-y. It is nice that they offer an employee discount."
good,They are flexible with your hours. They will work around your schedule if needed. They work with you as long as you’re committed and reliable. Some weeks you get more days then the other weeks.
good,"The company has changed dramatically since I began my career with them, but they do compensate their leadership staff well. There are so many strategic changes that take place, you must be able to adapt."
good,"To be ""My Walgreens"" for everyone in America - the first choice in health and daily living... owning the strategic territory of ""well"". At Walgreens, our values are based on the same principles that the company was founded on more than a century ago:"
good,"In my experience, this job is fast paced, which makes for a short work day.  There is no time to watch the clock and wonder if the day will ever end.  The schedule is ever-changing (morning, noon, evening & weekends) and the scheduling managers always work with the employees to ensure they get off on their requested days. The variety of tasks to do in any given day are numerous and different from day to day depending on when certain vendors deliver products, what department you will work in (cosmetics, photo, pharmacy, etc.) and what the customers are requesting, so you will never be bored."
good,"* A typical work day starts early with a good game plan that sets the day up right for others to follow with as much ease as possible."
good,A great company. I have many fond memories of people in this company. Vision of company changed over the years but top management team was very solid.
good,"I learned how to manage my time while I was on the job. I learned how to multitask, to do my job while also helping customers find items in store or deal with certain questions a customer may have about a certain product."
good,"independent, healthcare clinic, provider sets tone for work day."
good,The hardest part of this job is the sheer volume of prescriptions that you fill on a day to day basis.  You truly need to become efficient and careful.
good,Keeping up with all the changes that come down from corporate so that it does not interfere with your workflow and customer relations.  Trying to keep staff engaged in the company goals when they are not compensated appropriately for their work.
good,"Opening the store, you always have the regulars coming in. I got to know the customers by name and they always felt welcomed. "
good,Fastpaced atmosphere but fun and convenient if you're looking for a moderate customer service job and to make a little money. Great for highschool seniors and young adults.
good,I love the staff I work with! Management is awesome at what they do. Working in the pharmacy is a great college job to have when you want to make a little more than minimum wage. There's no real room for advancement besides getting certified and moving up to Sr. Tech. It's a great learning experience for those wanting to get some beginner's experience in a medical/patient field.
good,"This is a good first job, or a good job if you're looking to eventually become a pharmacy tech. The management was amazing but sadly they all left and got replaced with mostly mediocre management."
good,Worked for Walgreens for 7 years it was a great experience and taught me alot about business and managing people. Walgreens also worked with me to get my Kansas State pharmacy license
good,Walgreens Pharmacy is a wonderful place to start your career. They are extremely flexible and work well with you to make sure you can attend school or study for the PTCB. Great place!
good,Working for Walgreens is a great place if you don't need a lot of money. It's good for maybe high schoolers or people looking for some extra side cash. I was always treated well.
good,"Great place to work could be stressful at time but bearable."
good,"Must be okay with multitasking to thrive in a a management position. Most stores will have you as the only manager/floor person so it is a balancing act between helping customers, completing daily tasks and being available to troubleshoot."
good,"I really loved this company they really cared about their employees and patients, Great place to work and so much room for advancement and growth. I would recommend this company to my friends and family."
good,I enjoyed Walgreens but there were not many hours that compensated my needs. The hardest part of my job was dealing with customers that tried to get me to do things that were beyond me and my manager's control.  My team at Walgreens was very cooperative and enjoyed giving input on what our store needed.
good,The managers attitudes were sometimes belittling to the employees.  Lack of respect for employees from some management team members.  Very short notice to having to work Christmas day.
good,a fun place to work I gained a lot of knowledge along with my previous experience. made new friends on a daily basis . lots of hard work but it pays off
good,"During my work in Walgreens, I encounter so many different types of customers. I've been very patient to them. I learned a lot especially during phasing and being in the register taught me a lot. The management were nice. For me, the job was very light compared to my work in Assisted Living so it's okay for me."
good,This is a great starter job. I worked here for 3 years and loved it. Had to leave because the pay wasnt enough but the environment and my coworkers were fantastic. I loved coming to work everyday.
good,"Walgreens "
good,"This company is good and they have a lot going for them. The systems and products are good, but the location I was working at had terrible management."
good,"Walgreens was a very fast paced and very educational environment. Everyday, the technicians would come in starting at the cash register, and every hour would rotate to different positions of work, such as medication filler, medication puller, etc. The store I worked at was very busy, so there was always something to do, which I enjoy very much so. I like to keep busy and on my feet. I learned a lot about customer service and patient care, as well as how different medications can be used and the process of taking in prescriptions and selling the medications. The hardest part of this job at first was trying to stay organized with all the tasks we were given as technicians. It was difficult to juggle so many different tasks, while also giving great customer service. Overall, I really enjoyed working for Walgreens, and I am grateful for the opportunity of being able to take on that experience."
good,"Good job, especially when you're busy throughout the day. A few friends of mine have advanced into upper management positions at a young age and fast, so opportunities are definitely there. The pay has recently increased as well, so i would recommend this company to people looking for part-time or full-time work."
good,"Very nice company to work very nice people but I don’t understand what this has to do with me applying for this job, it seems real weird but I would definitely recommend to anyone who’s looking for work."
good,I really enjoyed working for Walgreens. I started at the age of 17 in the pharmacy in Milwaukee. They had an on the job training program. I worked along side the pharmacist. I really enjoyed working with the public and customer service! Walgreens was also very flexible with my schedule when I got married and had children. They were a great company to work for!
good,Walgreens offers various employee assistance programs to help during hard times and provides necessary time off and financial assistance to employees. Other employees are easy to work with but salaries could use some improvement.
good,Overall a good place to work do seem to play favoritism a bit they will train you and give you paid time off and sick time off but be careful with sick hours they dont let you know what you have left
good,"I feel it all depends on the store that you work at. My store we were a family and we knew that. We have a very positive store and everyone tried to help everyone out whenever possible. Some stores can be a little stressful, when you have a high theft store or no team work. Sometimes it can be fun and sometimes its just a work work work kinda day. At the end of the day you know you did a good job and you can go home happy and stress free."
good,"In my eleven year tenure, Walgreens has shifted from its single focus of opening stores to becoming a dynamic incubator of retail concepts and deploying them across 10,000 stores. To do well here, one must be thorough in thinking and planning and persistent in execution. The scale is large, and so are the risks and rewards."
good,"Working on the floor: "
good,"The people are great, customers are mostly great, and the work is great.  Management is hit and miss depending on the store you're at but mostly the people picked for management are good choices and are good managers.  Pay scale is not fantastic, but not horrible either."
good,It was easy and I was able to get better at talking to people. Wanted to move around more. Kind of boring being stuck behind a counter. I restocked as well.
good,"Store location is accommodating to more elderly customer clientele. I mostly enjoy the connections I have built with many regular customers to make work most enjoyable."
good,"Decent place to work. Relaxed atmosphere and reasonable pay. It can be hard to move up in the business, but other than that it is a good place to start while in school."
good,I learned everything I know now in customer service from this job. I also learned how to manage my own crew. great place to work. typical work day was busy.
good,"I loved working there. I left to go to school. Advanced very easily and training was easy.loved working here until i began school, i worked there about a year and advanced after working there 5months."
good,"Walgreens is a fun place to work at. A day at Walgreens is going in, pulling your bays. Doing resets and putting away merchandise from the truck. The most thing i enjoyed about my job is doing resets."
good,It depends on the location you work at. My store has a lot of young adults who were about my age and we had a lot of great times. But some stores have different people. Find a store that works for you
good,I liked the company!!! I was a seasonal worker. Good pay. great staff. Amazing over time opportunities!!! Easy trailing always paid on time. Good communication and procedures in place.
good,I was a summer management intern at Walgreens and they pay their interns well. The manager at my specific store really wanted me to succeed. DOn't think all get so lucky in all store.
good,"Overall Walgreens was very pleasant and had great management. My only complaint was my boss as they were pharmacy management. Outside of the pharmacy, everyone worked together well and had great attitudes."
good,I worked at a location in downtown which mainly served day-time office workers. So usually day shifts were very busy and i mean busy. I could easily just cashier all day long without having a slow patch. That being said. The manager was very understanding and accommodating when you needed some time off or wanted to switch shifts.
good,"A typical day at work was busy helping customers and moving to different areas. I learned how to unload, sort, process photos and manage and lead a photo team. I also learned cash handling skills. The hardest part of the job was managing customer service as well as getting job duties done. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning to operate the photo machines and interacting with the customers."
good,"Your opinions actually matter and you're treated like a valued member of the team not just a number or metric. it's a very team-oriented, goal-oriented place to work"
good,"Day to day was different, it could be anything from store visits to training to everything in between. The company is always looking at ways to make themselves better which is exciting to be a part of. "
good,The work was not hard.  Very entertaining place to work at.  I have no complaints except for the pay and the cost of living. The people that I worked with were very nice.  I would recommend working at this place for those who are just starting out in the work industry.
good,"Working at Walgreens is a busy but fun environment where you are always interacting with customers and coworkers! The day to day responsibilities include customer care, billing insurance, filing paperwork, computer work, answering phones, multitasking, filling prescriptions, and caring for other needs in the pharmacy. The hardest part of the job is adjusting to the fast paced environment while learning hands-on training. The most enjoyable part of a technicians job is to look forward to seeing regular customers that often the pharmacy!"
good,Good company overall but could improve. Front end team members and Pharmacy do not get paid enough for the work. Needs better scheduling. Managers are kind to everyone but have a hard time sticking to new rules/ideas together and therefore it causes confusion with the team sometimes.
good,"A typical day is pretty good. Some rude customers, but most I developed a great relationship with. Management leads by example. Collaborative work culture."
good,"A typical day working at walgreens can be a very fast- paced experience. As the day goes by business would pick up and remain steady for 6 to 8 hours at a time. one good thing about it is that time goes by before you know it. most of the management staff  are good people, while some others can be quite difficult ."
good,"When it comes to accepting a new job, I find that the work environment is the most critical aspect for me when deciding whether to stay or whether to leave."
good,I sincerely enjoyed tenure with Walgreens. They provided me a great  opportunity to learn the complete pharmacy operation. Compensation and benefits are not good.
good,The company does like to promote people very often. I started as a cashier and worked my way to ASM in just two years. They could give people better schedules.
good,It was my first job while I was still attending Cuyahoga community college for my pharmacy associates degree and it was a good starting job just to pay was very very low But I really liked it and I learned a lot from it
good,I think Walgreens is a great place to start. The job is easy to learn and pays well for entry level retail work. Standing in the same place for 8 hours being under-utilized just is not for me hence my wanting to leave.
good,"Walgreens has parts to it and every part is different but in an good way. You learn about so many different things, people and, yourself. It’s worth the experience!"
good,"Enjoyed my work there, People were friendly. Management was friendly and fair. Could not live on $9.00 per hour, Had to change jobs for increase in pay to $12.00 per hour at CVS."
good,"Working in the Walgreens pharmacy has been an interesting and educational experience. As an aspiring psychologist, this was an excellent first step into the medical field. Walgreens is very warm and welcoming and they helped train and prepare me for my position as a pharmacy technician."
good,It is a fairly light work environment that pays well. Management will typically work with your schedule. Work tasks are never excessive. The culture of the store focuses on customer care and empowering the employees.
good,"This is a great entry level position and like all stores it depends on management."
good,Typical do less with more mentality typical in retail environment today.   Co-workers are generally very good/committed.  Taking care of most customers in this environment is very rewarding.
good,"Clock in 7 minutes before the hour"
good,I have never had a boring day at this job. There is always something to do. I really enjoy training new employees and teaching them the company culture. I have a great relationship with my customers that I really enjoy.
good,"I started Walgreens as a part-time job when I was in high school. I worked 3 more years there while I was in college. It is a great place for beginners and people who want to learn and gain knowledge about a work environment. My co-workers were great and we had a family like connection and the Managers were great for the most part. However, the pay is mediocre and the chances to advance are really slim."
good,"Each Pharmacy department takes on the personality of the department manager, therefore each location has a different vibe when you work within it. Some departments are run efficiently and some are lax"
good,The quality of the job really depended on the location and the skills and ability of the store manager. For the most part the stores were run efficiently.
good,"Had good work schedule "
good,I really enjoyed working there. The only bad thing was that some of the customers get angry at you when they get asked for an ID. Pretty straight forward job. working  partime doesn't come with any benefits but I heard the full time people say they liked their benefits. I really liked the discount.
good,I enjoy the interaction with the customers and I have developed good customer relations with the regular customers that visit the store on a regular basis.  I have developed my verbal and organizational skills in the time that I have been employed with Walgreens.  I would say the hardest part of the job is if a customer is asking for a particular product and our store location may be out of stock ...in those situations we can locate the product at another location for the customer to satisfy their needs.
good,I enjoyed working everyday. I got to meet a lot of nice customers and most were even my favorite people to see. Even thought i was part time the compensation was fair. The hours it was what hard sometimes. there needs to be a fair way to rotate shifts and weekends between the staff.
good,"Walgreens allowed a person to learn the basic skill set in customer service. The management wanted every person to succeed. Typically, I would work photo and then at the end of my shift I would go through and restock shelves while pulling products forward. I enjoyed how each store had few managers and few employee which made it feel like a close knit family. Even though I enjoyed working at Walgreens, the pay was only okay and there was little advancement available."
good,it is relaxed. however can be unorganized and management at time cant decide what they want. If the pay could be more. My supervisor is more realistic
good,"A shift lead consist of working in different departments with different staff. This helped provide a learning experience in all departments of Walgreens making management a jack of all trades. Being able to lead  team members and getting a task done feels very accomplishing. The hardest part of the job is when rush hour traffic for the store hits, the many departments calling for help, but the most enjoyable part is meeting new people and getting to know the community."
good,"Nice work place, good managers, quick pharmacy checkout, clean, good products, good customer service, nice products, good prices, reasonable prices, good seasonal aisle"
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work.  The management is good and the people there are nice.  You can choose to learn a diverse number of tasks that will help you advance.  However, the hours are not always consistent and the pay could be better."
good,"All about repetition, it's the same task(s) each day. Easy to adapt and learn what is expected of you. Separation from competitors is obvious as far as customer service goes."
good,"This company truly invests in their employees. They spend the time and provide the resources to adequately train you, for the position."
good,Being an employee at Walgreens was an amazing experience and I would recommend it to anyone who would like a easy start into/or wanting to improve their skills within the customer service field. Since you will be doing a little bit of everything you have the ability to improve the skills you already know while at the same time learning about new skills that may want to push you into a different field within that company.
good,I enjoyed working at Walgreens but I wanted to try something new and have a new working experience. The management was great and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job would be working with difficult customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my friends.
good,Coworkers and customers become family. There's usually time to develop great customer relations but it can get extremely busy in the pharmacy. Walgreens is a good company to work for.
good,"Several transformation initiatives in flight - provides opportunities to learn different areas "
good,Good company to work for. Great advancement if you put in the work. days can be very long depending on the location and store manager you work for. can be overwhelming at times.
good,"I have worked in both the pharmacy and the front of the store, so I will tell you about both.  The biggest problem in the front is that you are isolated from your coworkers, which makes collaboration difficult. The pharmacy is just stressful.  The things you can do for a patient are limited, and they tend to get upset.  Add being fast-paced on top of that, when you want to help someone, you don't necessarily have time."
good,"its retail, always changing. Amazing team and pro employee shift leads. one of the hardest part of the role Beauty consultant no being able to do task, on a slow day it can be boring. other than that walgreens is a great employer."
good,"Learning something new every single day. Helping patients get the knowledge they need to know about certain medications they're on. Also, speaking with doctors and insurance companies and problem solving."
good,I enjoyed my time at walgreens. It was a very good environment with minimal drama. I was happy to get the employee discount while working there.  I enjoyed working with management as well.
good,"Leadership was above par compared to other companies and training was continual. Enjoyed working in this atmosphere and learned a lot,but compensation is a little lower than most, especially considering the responsibilities you carry (speaking of a Lead position). "
good,This is a fast paced workplace with a never ending challenge.  My team is great and is always trying to help me and the customers.  We are challenged daily with increasing sales with less help.
good,"this place taught me more about customer service. because I was able to develop a clientele being the beauty advisor, I was able to interact with people on a semi-personal level."
good,"Fun place to work.  In the office that I worked in, we had a family atmosphere, we covered for one another if one was out.  I enjoyed working with my co-workers.  My boss was a very mild mannered and understanding."
good,Your typical everyday retail customer service job. Great entry level jobs for high school kids and great for people who need the flexibility to do other things.
good,If you are a shift manager you are paid a few dollars per hour more than cashier but are expect to be at least three times as productive as cashiers. There is no consideration of personal life.
good,"reading and understanding sig code. accurate filling of perscriptions. calling insurance when there's an issue filling a perscription. calling the dr to verify perscriptions, request refills, request therapeutic equivalents if needed. working directly with patients verifying personal information and when applicable referring them to the pharmacist for evaluation. making compounds accurately."
good,"Making customers feel like someone cares for them is honestly a great feeling and being able to satisfy there needs. Greeted customers entering the store to ascertain what each customer wanted or needed. Described product to customers and accurately explained details and care of merchandise. Answered calls from customers and addressing customer inquiries, solving problems and providing new product information. Politely assisted customers in person and via telephone. Provided an elevated customer experience to generate a loyal clientele. Developed reputation as an efficient service provider with high levels of accuracy."
good,The store for which I was a traveling lead would have been a very nice place to work had it not been for the newly appointed Manager and Assistant Manager whom neither had ever worked those positions before
good,Walgreens as A whole was a wonderful place to work it really helped build me as a adult. its a great place to grow. Under the right leadership anything can be great.
good,The work is great and easy to catch onto. Good first job(s) as you learn many new skills easily. The day gets easier when you are comfortable with your surroundings and coworkers. My favorite job/task to do is resets or revisions. Super fun.
good,"Walgreens (store that I work at) is a very fast pace, stressful. I love typing and filling scripts, ordering drugs and cells for the yuyama.  Most of the customers are easy going and plesant.  I dont like the part  when customers swear at you because there insurance doesn't work or it cost too much.  Co-workers are great"
good,A typical day at work had involved me assisting customers in different departments like the beauty and photo department. The most enjoyable part of the job was the repeat customers coming back in for their shopping experience.
good,I worked nights so my experience was very specific. The most frustrating thing about this job was frequent change in programs. One day they wanted you to log one thing and the next they had you focused on something different. Priorities changed too fast to keep up.
good,"Walgreens is a place where people come in and shop for all sorts items. Therefore, you will always have a varied group of people coming in and out. I learned quickly that you needed to be helpful to people and to be very attentive. I feel the customers want to be able to get what they want and leave as quickly as possible. The job gets done as a team everyone has their role and if everyone is doing it we have a good day. The hardest thing about the job is to continuously be of help to everyone sometimes is hard to do that."
good,"As a Pharmacy Tech I was mainly responsible for entering prescription and insurance information into the system, filling prescriptions and helping customers at the counter."
good,"I put in 17 years and went as far as I wanted to go. I wanted to stay in the store closest to my house and be left alone. All they wanted was to keep sending me to stores over an hour away, trying to advance me, promote me, so I quit. I'm flattered they saw my potential, but I'm a mom, not a career woman. The pay was great for me though, I had to take a pay cut to start over again. I do feel like shift leads should be paid better to start. It's a tough job being a leader but not an enforcer. They have little respect from employees."
good,Very busy depending on the time of day. Deal with many different types of customers throughout the work day. Long work days. Employees are friendly and easy to get along with.
good,Great place to work in a very fast paced environment. Great associates and awesome management team. Will get trained on forklift operation and learn many skills which can be used for career advancement.
good,"Needed to respond quicker to employees in need of help, when they were aware they were in crisis and did not provide intervention in a timely manner by the time it was recognized it was to late, being a 15 year employee, and them noticing the change in work habits and depression, they did no referrals or intervention before the fail of me"
good,"My employment came before the franchise was actually open for business so my coworkers and I spent a lot of time stocking the shelves, inventory control, and making sure the Broad and Chestnut location was ready for business. "
good,"Operating a cash register, while multi-tasking transactions and accommodating customer needs. Exchanging money from customers. Maintaining a clean and safe environment for customer and employee safety. Stocking shelves and operating a scanner to order inventory. Taking and maintaining inventory."
good,"I loved working at Walgreens! All of the managers are so great, easily approachable and responsive. The scheduling is fairly flexible, but the pay wasn't great."
good,"The Job is very routine each day has has assigned tasks to be done, Customer Service is number one priority. I learned to work harder not smarter, have fun when applicable, always be one step ahead i =n everything, and to think critically about certain aspects of doing things. Management is fair and understands there is more beyond the four walls. Hardest part of the job is low labor hours and plenty of work to do with so little resources. Most enjoyable is creating a family atmosphere with both coworkers and customers."
good,"Walgreens is building a great and lasting culture currently and we have worked on it for a few years now.  It is a great place to work and advance your career.  Unfortunately, I may have gone as far as I can go."
good,"As a person who mainly works in photo, its pretty calm for most days, if your young they tend to schedule you more and have you do more tasks becase in my case most other workers tend to be older frailer women and thats understandable. some days especially near busy holidays it gets real busy and you feel like all the time you need to do imortant tasks get taken up by ""unappreciateive"" but most of the time it's fine. if your coaperative and not a jerk you'll go far."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, buenos supervisores, y aprendí a dar buen servicio al cliente, ya que fue mi primer experiencia directa con clientes."
good,If some one is looking for a start in customer service then walgreens is great to start. Being a people person and be willing to go above and beyond to make a customer happy is the key to success in retail. Be willing to be a team player is great too. Opportunities are there at Walgreens if your willing to work for it.
good,"Go to work, clock in, review what you need to accomplish for the day, based on whatever the manager has asked. Most tasks take your full shift to accomplish so by the time you are done with everything , it is time to clock out and go home."
good,"My store manager is one of the best Supervisors that I have ever had. Most of the people that I work with or supervise are responsible and a lot of fun to work with.  The job can be stressful, but I thrive under pressure so that's OK with me."
good,"Showed respect, and positive learning culture. Hours extremely tight and controlled. Needed more training to be effective in inventory and pharmacy structure, But very clean and organized location"
good,Walgreens is very customer service oriented. The team is very friendly and is more than happy to help you out if you have any questions or confusion. The work is fairly simple but requires good effort.
good,A typical day at work is running the front register or maintaining the photo department. Other days you are on the floor stocking shelves and helping customers.
good,"fast-paced, fun and easy job"
good,There is always something to do at Walgreen's.  It can be a friendly trust worthy place for customers. On the other hand it can be a cut-throat competitive work place. Love doing season resets though.
good,"I had a great time working at Walgreens, there is job advancement if you are interested. Fun workplace with lots of teamwork usually at least at the store I worked at. Suggestive sales competition to get people pumped up about selling suggestive sale items. Long hours for those who want them. Some stores are open 24 hours so you may get overnight hours."
good,Get to be part of the local community and help the local retirement homes. Management is swapped and replaced every month. High turn over rate of fellow employees.
good,Working at Walgreen's was a learning experience for me. I have learned to work with managers that gave goals each day to work towards. They each show different ideas and ways to deal with customers and other coworkers. This job have taught me things that i will continue to take with me for job opportunities in the future.
good,Fair environment to work in. Managers were fair and friendly. Most of the regular customers were pleasant and job duties weren’t stressful but demanding.
good,A typical day at Walgreens would entail checking out a high volume of costumers. Unloading large quantities of inventory from the shipment of the week.
good,"The company as a whole is honest fair and competitive. if you want to make it a career you can but you are gonna have to work for it. Some days you will face heavy lifting, angry customer, sick and dying individuals which can be emotionally devastating, taxing deadlines, long hours, and mind numbing monotonous tasks, and a constant need to be vigilant to protect patients and their information. other days are really satisfying helping people feel better, finding just the right solution to their problem, finishing a masterpiece in the photo gifts, bringing a smile to someones face and the company empowers its employees to achieve those ends."
good,"Helping customers finding the right product, answer any questions, making sure the company have the product that the customers were looking for.  I also  handle cash for a large part of the day."
good,Walgreens is a good company to work for. I learn a last on all leaves of retail there. The customer service standards are very high which I enjoyed. Most of the employee where nice but there are some that you just had to work with.
good,Walgreen's is a great place to work if you can get enough hours to make it worth your while. They did not have sufficient hours for me. So I chose another job that did.
good,"Working for Walgreens is very simple and easy, since it is primarily retail and business at the front end of the store. Pharmacy is, at times, a different story. I learned much from working for the company, such as how to work large scale poster printers and how to properly fill prescriptions (full process), but I could have learned much, much more. In my experience, the hardest part of working for Walgreens was the environment (both on the floor and in pharmacy) as well as the inability to advance in position and in wages."
good,I enjoyed working along side some wonderful people. I got to know many customers by name . I learned almost every position while I worked here. Every manager I worked with taught me something new.
good,"Have learned a tremendous amount while at Walgreens. Co-workers are very nice and make the day to day job much more enjoyable. Overall, Walgreens is a decent place to work."
good,It is a really good job if one is going trying to work through college. Offers competitive wages with benefits yet allows flexible hours. Business casual atmosphere with a push for ethics in business and with employees.
good,I am quite content with the work ethics at Walgreens.  Friendly environment and quite flexible.  Walgreens is open for suggestions and allows for growth as needed
good,If you can stand to deal with that many people in a day and people complaining it's a good place to work at comparatively. The management and your employees are entirely subjective but my store was great.
good,A well chosen staff that will make your work day much more enjoyable. The tools given to do your job are functional but lack quick replacement when damaged.
good,"My time at Walgreens was temporary due to me being in school and working just to have some cash for any unknown expenses, But walgreens was a very understanding and laid back job. I enjoyed the other employees and we did stuff as a family. The hardest part of time at Walmart was when i had to close only because it kind of crossed over into my studying time."
good,"I would pick Walgreens over CVS anyway of the week. They have a bigger selections of goods. However, the dress code for employees has become more strict which I am not a fan of. This was a fun job and create people work there."
good,Great place to work there is always room for opportunity. Location is great and everyone works as a team. The engagement is awesome and the different activities makes the job fun
good,"Retail is stressful by nature.  If you work well under stress this is your place.  Benefits are very good, but some years no raise.  Seems like every year some previos benefit gets taken away so beware."
good,"productive in sales . wonderful place to advance but limited "
good,"I was trained from the beginning. I came in with no experience, I started as a Pharmacy cashier and then became Pharmacy Tech when I received my license."
good,I enjoyed working for Walgreens. I felt like they had decent employees that were easy to get along with and all did their jobs with out much supervision. I believe Walgreens is a good place to work and they give you opportunity for advancement.
good,The experience here was pretty good. I started off as a photo technician and quickly moved up to a pharmacy technician once I was provided the materials and classes necessary to pass the exam. The career advancement is there for employees that wants it!
good,Pharmacy Manager was very warm hearted and the staffs were very friendly. Enjoyed my time at Walgreens. Learnt a lot of things from my internship there.
good,"Walgreens was my first job right out of high school. It was more than enough for an 18 year old but looking back at it now, the pay and just working there was stressful at times."
good,Walgreens is a fundamentally sound organization that is quickly growing into a world leader in the Pharmaceutical and health care industry. With this rapid growth come cost cutting initiative which are rsulting in a migration of IT positions to India and Mexico.
good,"Very fast paced environment. Most times it's one manager, one cashier and one member on the floor. The member on the floor is  handling their daily ask as well as customers as well as maintaining almost all the other departments. If you're like me you wouldn't mind because it helps time fly by."
good,Upon clocking in to being work i would have to attend to the inventory being delivered by a semi truck. organizing each and every tote to ensure the product delivered would be placed in the correct spot on the shelf.
good,"Great benefits.  Learned a great deal about management. Walgreens is a solid company!!  Hardest part of being a pharmacist at Walgreens is being able to multi task, juggle phone calls, patient questions, MTM, etc"
good,"Stock shelves that required more items to be put out. I dealt with customer service, money count, and handling the cash register. The management was very team-player oriented."
good,Very fast paced.  Have to learn to multi-task.  Understanding insurance and helping customers understand there insurance.  Dealing with the community and medicare.
good,"enjoyed helping the customers from photos, to cosmetics, to household goods. just love helping people. had wonderful co-worker working with me. kept a clean atmosphere."
good,"Not bad place, management was fun and great to work with until new managers cam e and made it not fun and had issues.  Mangement was not understanding and were only caring about themselves"
good,"Management is wonderful. Pay is low for the job. Great people, great place. "
good,"After working at several locations for Walgreens over the past 17 years, I can say that your overall experience with Walgreens on a day to day basis will depend heavily on the specific location."
good,"It was my first job in customer service. I think I learned a lot about working with different types of people."
good,"I usually work go to work around either in the morning or the afternoon, depending what day it is.  I learn how to stock and organize items, check for items that has expired, and help customers it they need any help finding the product they need.  Their management and workplace culture is as normal as the other retails stores. The hardest part of the job is that I have to stand for long periods when stocking and organize items. I find the breaks to be the most enjoyable part when working in Walgreens."
good,this was a great job while i was in school. easy going and simple to grasp. my favorite part was setting up for the holiday and decorating the store. the employees were all awesome and layed back.
good,The Staff at Walgreens Was Great. The Managemnent at my location  wasn't so good to the staff at all. I would Love to go Back But Just an different Location
good,Walgreens was a chill environment. I was young when I started working her and the whole store and staff were great. No complaints. I left here because of college
good,"At high volume stores, this job can become stressful very easily.  However, with the proper training and management, it is attainable and easy to handle. You just have to know how to move around quickly and when things come about, you may be moved to a position that you are not very familiar with.  You are able to advance in this company so that is a good thing."
good,We we’re always having fun while we also were getting all of the tasks completed. Some days were a lot busier than others but we made sure to fulfill customer needs and complete our work list.
good,Very fast paced and need to understand the culture of the company. People are very friendly and easy to work together. A typical day is one where everyone is working together.
good,"Walgreens paid the most, trained you more, and made tactical investments in developing people and the advancement of there career. If I wanted to go back into Pharmacy General Management they'd be the only company I would consider."
good,"If you apply yourself you WILL have the opportunity for advancement.   Although  there are politics, as everywhere, if you focus on yourself you will steer clear of drama. "
good,I worked a midnight pharmacy shift. The store changed to a non 24 hour location leading to an involuntary separation for myself and the other midnight pharmacist. We didn't do anything wrong -  it's just business.
good,"great customers and a great place to work, but too low of pay and you can only go up so high in the company. they had us running around like chickens with our heads cut off filling scripts for only 11.00 an hour"
good,"Positive work environment where customer service was of top priority. Had the opportunity to work in most areas of the company and expand my experience and knowledge in these areas such as beauty, photo, and customer service."
good,"I had previously worked at Walmart, and this is loads better. While of course it's not the best job in the world, it honestly gives some room to grow."
good,It was a fun and enjoyable place to work. The days can be long but the people make it fun and enjoyable. You can get your job done but you have to watch your time.
good,"Walgreens was a good place to work for, the only problem I had was with the constant turn around shifts and the fact that we were truly understaffed but corporate wasn't willing to hire any more people."
good,the most enjoyable part of the job was customer satisfaction and increasing the net profits of each store I was sent to. I was given my choice of stores to work at due to my passion and self-initiative of the job.
good,Good place to start out at if you’re not seriously interested in making a career out of it. Depending on the location management will either be a detriment or a huge benefactor to your growth within the company.
good,"I am working here from last 7 years......."
good,The job is very active and also it's an easy working environment.Also it's an opportunity to interact with new customers each day coming to work. The crew is pretty helpful.
good,"I worked at Walgreens during the summer while I was in High school.It was pleasant place to work. Very nice co-workers, good managers. Occasionally, you would get a difficult customer, but it wasn't so bad. Overall a good place to work."
good,most people where enjoyable to work with. Management and my store where awesome. most of the time you did not get a full 40 hour week as full time you had to average at lest 32 hours.
good,"Walgreens is a wonderful company to work for. They are enthusiastic about helping their employees to grow and advance in their career paths. They offer regular training to all team members. I personally have benefited from these programs. However, your store is only as good as it's management team. If management is not all on the same page and working together then your store will struggle and it will be obvious to everyone watching, including your customers. I find that lack of communication is a huge problem and because of this there is often a lot of confusion. It is important to that not all stores are like this."
good,"It is a great place to start out. I learned a lot from the pharmacists that I worked with and it helped me get through nursing school. Management was always flexible with my schedule and there is room to grow, but you have to prove yourself a reliable and trustworthy employee that can be a productive worker."
good,"Working at Walgreens is retail and customer service, with all that that entails. I enjoyed working there for the most part and found the work fulfiilling. The company went through many changes while I was there, and I felt like too often I had to invest time in figuring out what this week's grand strategy was rather than actually implementing it."
good,Good for part time or during the summer while in high school. Easy job but the manager was a little uptight. As long as you do what your told it's pretty good.
good,"I had a good time working at walgreens. It was fun stocking watching the store come together for the grand opening. I ended up working graveyard. I cashiered, cleaned stock."
good,"Loved the store I was in as far as my co-workers and store management. Corporate side of things was the bane of my time there. Steady work, for not very much pay for the work done. Worked full time with a lot of job duties and barely able to pay bills. Find the right store, with the right manager and it's hard to leave. Decent benefits, willing to work around school/personal life schedules. Overall it's an ok place to work."
good,"The job is Retail, it has its ups and downs day-in and day-out.  A bright side is you never know what you're going into, but that can also be a down side, too.  Have patience and understanding when going into this job, as you should with any retail, or customer service job."
good,"Working with Walgreens for almost 3 years taught me one thing and that is that the customers are the most important. You broke your leg? Well did you get the item for the customer? No?! "
good,Most if not all workers are friendly and management that helps you with lots of work in  which they help to catch up on were things need to be in it's a team work   Environment
good,"It was nice working but  new management had there favorites and try making a name for them selves instead of going by work ethics."
good,"Easy job, just do what is asked of you. A typical day at work is doing truck, restocking the shelves, ringing up customers, then cleaning the store afterwards."
good,"Management has lots of pressure to work hard and make customers happy.  But, the pay is fair and there are lots of promotion opportunities. Anyone under store manager level will have to work holidays (all stores are open everyday of the year). It is rare to have a set schedule until you reach store manager level."
good,Have enjoyed working there for the 15 years.  Hard to staff store when hours get cut but amount of work stays the same.  Low starting wage makes it hard to find good help or keep the good ones we hire.
good,So was very fast tempo. Multitasking was a must. Great staff members. Never a dull moment. Learned so much and how to handle customer care in many situations.
good,I worked at Walgreens as a pharmacy technician while I was still in college. it was always a temporary job but I learned many things that have served me well in the present day.
good,"A company that you get what you put into it. Worked for them for over a decade, moved up and was offered better pay/positions after demonstration of work ethic/potential"
good,"Working in the community provides a satisfaction and reward that's often underappreciated. I loved the accessibility of healthcare to the patients and this was something I always wanted to promote. The work can be somewhat tedious at times but a positive frame of mind can always overcome that. I learned a whole new meaning of the words patience, compassion, and reward through my work at this position."
good,Day to day tasks are involved and requires detailed oriented individuals. The opportunities are rewarding if you have an abundance of time to dedicate to this company. Requires much work that is not compensated and home life is often interrupted.
good,This was a very busy worker day on most days. You were on your feet and had to be on your toes with customers. This job was way different than I thought it would be. hardest part was learning to type scripts and calling doctors.
good,"The best thing about working for this company was the opportunity to express your awareness of your customer in merchandising of the store.  I saw many lines of merchandise carefully tested and measured with often amazing results.  The company is very disciplined and organized in its internal processes.  So as a manager,  I had to work hard and often long to make sure the store was being operated in the same way.  I discovered here that I really enjoyed the analytics of operate a profitable business.  What made it possible to have a good work-life balance was all determined by the strength of your team."
good,"Typical work day: Slow, repetitive. Managers don't bother challenging you. Just get your work done and go home, according to them. No opportunities to advance unless your manager favors you."
good,"A typically day at Walgreens included preparing ones work station, taking out pallet loads of boxes and bagged plastics, and standing at ones station for the 6-8 hour shift. "
good,"Typical retail job. You get what you make out of the experience, was here for a short period. Good compensation. No lunch break for Pharmacists, and 8-10 hour work days"
good,Its a face pace pharmacy where you learn a ton of stuff about the pharmacy. Its the pharmacy that leads you unto whether or not you continue your pharmacy education.
good,"I thought it was cool. I am not really sure why they are asking me this question yet. I'm assuming it is because they want to show it to the other individuals who are looking for jobs here, but it is something they should have saved to ask me later. Like after explaining everything."
good,La empresa tiene excelente plan médicos con diversas aseguradoras y también muy buen plan de visión y dental.
good,A typical day Was when its warehouse day and we are short staff and we cant get to put out all merchandise that had arrived on that day another typical day is when and night we are understaffed and we Always seem to make the day work out with just a few people we have
good,"Walgreens management was very encouraging and helpful at helping me grow as an employee. Just like many places it really depends on management and how well they work with others. Under the four different store managers I experienced most made the work days very enjoyable. The hours of working are not ideal since they are open every day of the year, but employee's are paid time and a half on holidays. Ideally being paid a higher wage would have been better."
good,I enjoyed working at Walgreens. Coworkers are great and good people come in as customers. The hours made it easy to take care of my children and take time out to enjoy the whole family.  I experienced the company's different work culture between the west and the south. I enjoyed working out in the west of the the United States but the culture wasn't as pleasant in the southern part when it comes to how you treat others. It made it hard to stay with the company.
good,"I learned a lot within my time with the company as an extern, overall it was a great experience and I was able to learn how to input data into the computer systems and interacting with customers."
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work at with much room for advancement. My particular location is very fun, my team members work very well together alongside management. however it is not a good place to work  if you have younger children at home and you need a set schedule."
good,Walgreens is a Great place to work. Never a dull moment and a great place to see a lot of different people. Definitely a good place to get some steps in.
good,"I enjoyed Wallgreens because I like people and my boos was real good. I made star of the month 3 months in row, most sales. I liked stocking and helping people"
good,"I am forever grateful for the experience, knowledge & skills I have gained while working at Walgreen's.. I have created bonds with not only my fellow employees but with all of my Patients. This job has been my platform for many years & I am beyond ready to embark on a new journey giving myself the opportunity to become even Better at what I do.."
good,"It's a very good job, good people, good management, good pay and benefits.  However with seasonal hours being lowered it became difficult to staff even in busy hours, so skeleton crew hours are difficult."
good,"a great place to grow and expand as a worker but management needs to work on a few things,such as communication and leadership. as role models and people in higher positions there are things that they should know better about."
good,"Customer service, stock, returns and exchanges. Customer service, how to print photos. Management was awesome. Laid back, busy. The job was not hard, everybody chipped in and helped eachother. The customers and employees."
good,"Very easy job, depending on the location and the management. Some customers are easy to deal with and others just pay them no mind. Very friendly work environment where you'll meet new friends that have a lasting impression."
good,"I would go in for the overnight shift and first walk the store to see what is going on. I learned how to do displays, set isles for different holidays, work on truck when it came in. mainly making sure store was ready for morning customers. everything stocked and clean. my boss was hard, but you learned if you made a mistake, not to do it again. hardest part of job was cleaning up after earlier assistants who would leave their projects for me to do along with my stuff. enjoyable part was my regular customers who would come in late nights after work and vendors who came in early because we were a 24 hour store."
good,"Walgreens is a decent place to work. After several years there, it can get old, though. The scheduling is not the greatest in 24 hour pharmacies, and technicians should receive better pay for the work they do. However, working up front or in photo, you get paid a decent amount for the work you do."
good,"I began my career with drugstore.com as an inbound customer care representative. Received incoming calls from customers wanting to place an order, check on an order, requested instructions to return orders, track orders, take payments, provide refunds and complimentary rewards and credits. I eventually worked from home as email support. Doing the same as before, but only by email. "
good,"If you're looking for a part-time job or something to hold you over, this is a fine place to work. However, don't bet on getting full-time. Trying to make a long-term career out of this job is not easy."
good,Walgreens had horrible district managers! Pharmacy manger and store manager! Other wise same type of learning environment for retail pharmacy. They do not promote a lot of advancement for a pharmacy tech career.
good,There was always something new to learn. Your shift passes by quickly as there is many things to complete on a daily basis. Co-Workers all felt more like family than co-workers.
good,A day at Walgreens involved making sure customers had a positive experience while making a visit to our store by greeting them and checking to make sure they found everything they came for. As a photo specialist I assisted customers with uploading and printing their photos. I also assisted customers taking passport photos. On days when inventory came in I was responsible for helping unload trucks and organizing the warehouse properly.
good,A typical day at work included your routine job assignment in a fast paced environment. Walgreens paid for me to take classes to become certified in pharmacy and also trained me. The most enjoyable part about my job was interacting with customers and building relationships. Hardest part of the job is it can become stressful during insurance enrollment and dealing with difficult customers. But it is doable and rewarding. Management does listen and have an open door policy.
good,"When I started working at Walgreens I didn't know what to expect. As time went it got a little easier and easier. It is very calm working there, all of my co workers are great. I would definitely recommend working at Walgreens."
good,I would recommend this job to entry level employees that need to get their foot in the door. It is a great place for future pharmacy technicians and managers to train and learn.
good,"Walgreens was my first job and overall I do not have many complaints, the management worked with me on my schedule and they were flexible with my availability as a student in high school. Everyone I worked with was super nice to me. As my first job Walgreens taught me so much about retail!"
good,"A great first or part time Job, but unless you are management not a career. Customer service is the primary task regardless of department. Holidays are the worst when dealing with customers."
good,"Friendly staff"
good,i like working at walgreens as my work place it is flexible with my presnol life so i can balance both. so over all it is good place to work. special in pharmacy lots to learn
good,Flexible with schedule and good atmosphere. The customers there are easy to manage with and the staff is usually fun and energetic so the work does not seem as bad.
good,There is an extraordinary amount if time to work with and for people around your community in this position. At times it is very reward and others bring many challenges. Overall this is a great place to work while going to school or balancing a busy lifestyle but you may not move up quickly or get paid enough if you are not minimum 40 hours a week.
good,"A great place to work, but undergoing a lot of changes and restructuring.  There have been so many cuts to staffing that it is virtually impossible to meet the high standards of customer service with so little staffing.  It is a real challenge."
good,"Challenging never boring, you can find all types of job experiences at Walgreens.  These include clinical advice to patients, business management, being part of one of the top retail businesses in the US."
good,"I would come in set up the registers for the cashiers with the money.  Then check any emails for any task that had come down to do.  Delegate the task to the staff of what needed to be accomplished for today.  Follow up with staff if they needed any assistance on the task as much as possible.  Also, follow up on conference call notes.  The culture was very good staff members where motivated and loved their job.  The hardest part of job was if he had call outs, but it didn't happen much.  I enjoyed the staff members and customers having conversations with them about the store and the company."
good,"A typical day was assisting customers with their purchases and helping them find items they could not locate. I helped with putting merchandise on the shelves when it was truck and during the week to keep shelves stocked as best I could. "
good,"I liked working at the pharmacy , but I felt like store management sometimes forgot the importance of the pharmacy. The pharmacy brought in the most revenue but got the least amount of hours/employees."
good,"I started off at Walgreens Pharmacy as a intern. I worked there most of my senior year, while working there I learned lots of important things that helped me during my pharmacy class."
good,"This particular Walgreens Pharmacy in San Leandro nearthe San Leandro Hospital, is completely un organized.  Only because theyhavemuch of the majority the the workers, traveling workers.  The traveling workers do not care about the organization, so the workers that are there end up having to do double work to keep the pharmacy efficient as possible."
good,"It was a place of work where you constantly had to be moving around, and if that is what you're looking for then perfect. You need to  have knowledge in different prescribed medications as well as your communication skills needs to be refined."
good,"Typically my work day is routine, very rarely do we deviate from what needs to be done. We see the same customers, answer the same questions about 10 times a day and get a message or 7 from corporate about how the company is changing."
good,"I worked at a 24-Hour store in MN and it was very busy and understaffed. Was a good job for getting some experience. hard to transfer to other stores, but overall very good company to work for."
good,"My stores management team is a good team, but I have heard horror stories of other managers from surrounding stores...so its a coin toss.  My position as lead is just shy of the duties of an assistant store manager and yet I am paid significantly less.  They make you wait 6 months for any holiday pay or paid time off.  And the insurance is to expensive to afford being the only one working getting the salary I am getting.  If a promotion is not in my near future then I will not me in theirs.  I have a family to support and this just isn't cutting it."
good,"Easy going managers with very flexible schedule. Everyone is fun and willing to help along. Learned how to work within a group, task handling and time management. Hardest part of job is when someone is absent and you have to cover two spots at once. Enjoyable parts include how laid back some managers were to the point where we would laugh and joke but take work seriously at the same  time."
good,"Good place to work when in school. There is chance to earn promotions by working in the pharmacy. Easy job with decent pay, but dont try and turn it into a career."
good,"There is no typical day in retail. Always a new adventure to be had everytime you show up to work. I learned many new skills, including the photo department. The processing of photos, and correcting any problems with photo orders. I learned the register, both basic and manger functions. Management experienc is now closer to three years. This includes a more in depth look at register procedures and the proper way to help customers in multiple situations. I was also able to learn some computer work, which included the tracking of sale numbers and business operations numbers. I learned a more detailed cash handling experience."
good,"hardest part of the job is the balance between job and life balance, company throwing so much at you at one time and with not enough of payroll hours for you to get it all done"
good,"Walgreens is a really good company to work for when it comes to Retail Pharmacy.  They offer the best pay and benefits, and have the highest technology, making prescription filling less stressful"
good,"Learned so many drug names, could talk to any insurance rep, handled every problem and never felt like I was appreciated for that. Instead, they seemed to just take advantage of my skill-level, expecting me not to voice my frustrations."
good,"Walgreen's is a good employer and one that is easy to ""get comfortable."" That is not to say that one easily gets complacent or that the job is boring. Rather the company is heavily investing in pharmacy distribution and European acquisitions. As a result, unless you are looking to pursue a career in the pharmacy then the opportunity for advancement is much more competitive, particularly if you do not live in a metropolitan market with numerous stores. That said however it is still easy to ""get comfortable."" The company provides excellent health care and PTO benefits. Additionally their Profit Sharing (401k), VIP (Roth), and ESPP programs are all highly competitive with the market and well supported by the company, Additionally execution of marketing and merchandising at the district, regional, and corporate level is very well organized. If there are errors they are quickly addressed and corrected by the central office and solutions are pushed out from their offices rather than them expecting you to simply work around it. Everything is well structured, routine almost, it is a great environment for someone who enjoys knowing what to expect before even arriving at work."
good,"The best part of my job was meeting and knowing my customers and their children and then their grandchildren, the hardest part is loving them and seeing them get sick and having to go to a lot of funerals.."
good,Just a normal retail store that consist of check outs and stocking product. Nothing too special but a great start into retail for people with no experience.
good,My team and I were able to complete our day's work with maximum efficiency. My pharmacists always encouraged me to be the best intern I can be. They have full confidence in my abilities as a future pharmacist. I am very grateful for them.
good,"a typical day at work involves developing photographs via the Walgreens app.and helping customers with the in store photo kiosk, also working the cash registers, and working inventory in the store and stock room."
good,"Some say thank God it's Friday, but a typical day started with me saying thank God it's Monday, etc. Rolling into the office knowing that your day would be filled with serving patient's with their health care needs is a service, not a job. I learned an even greater appreciation for life and good health in serving patient's of all ages who had critical issues that some would not survive. Management is professional, not overbearing, willing to listen and be engaging. "
good,Walgreens provides a nice job with regular task assigned to you. The issue being your expected to do everything perfectly but if you don't they dont tell you they just complain about it around you. They dont teach you how to solve it.
good,Okay place to work at . Very fast paced high in demand with products in store . Management was okay could've been better a little unorganized at times .
good,"Walgreens can be a little busy at times and it can easily pile up the amount of work you have to do in a day, but it is a good overall place to work. There are a lot of benefits if you so choose to use them, but they are mostly for the employees that intend on being there for years and years. If you have a good team to work with then your job will never feel like a chore. Advancement opportunities are there and so is the recognition. The environment is great, there are just a few silly policies here and there. Whether or not you enjoy the job itself most likely depends on the people you work with. The things you actually are tasked with doing are fair and will take up the time in your shift."
good,"Walgreens is an easy and simple place to work for if you are looking for somewhere that doesn't require much out of you. There are opportunities for advancement but this typically requires more effort on your part. Overall, nice company to work for but not somewhere I saw myself having a career."
good,Would recommend to anyone but have to be flexible with schedule. They do give lots of hours. The breaks for me where a little short and sometimes the tags that were places were out of date. Making the prices incorrect.
good,"A good entry level place, some opportunity for advancement. Management is capable and provides good direction and guidelines. Great opportunity for customer interaction"
good,"Great place to work as a part-timer. Also a great place to start if you are going in the direction of a Pharmacy assistance. As long as management doesn't get changed too much, this will continue to be a great place to be."
good,"I worked at Walgreens for 10 years, as cashier, beauty advisor, and finally Senior Pharmacy technician. They work with your schedule and you earn plenty of PTO. I loved all the people there too. Ultimately, the only reason I left was to make more money, but I still keep in touch with everyone there."
good,"All the while, I thoroughly enjoyed the staff of the pharmacy and the rest of the store. There were incredibly down to earth, and hold conversation very well. They were understanding and truly tried to work with you and your schedule if conflicts did arise. The only negative comments I could make about this job are sometimes the patients (I worked in the pharmacy as a technician) could test the limits of your patience, but that is nearly completely reliant upon the location in which you work."
good,Woking at walgreens was a great experience. It was like having another family at work. The hardest part of the job is honestly dealing with angry customers. But that wasn't a common day in walgreens. Its definetly a community of people you will see often and it's great to get to know them because it makes the job 10 times easier.
good,Retail has its up and downs what's most important is the interactions you have with loyal customers that can make any retail job worth having. Walgreens
good,"I Loved contact with all my  customers; became friends with them.  Also had a good working  relationship with other employs and lower management. The hardest part of the job was that at times, I was the only cashier in the store (except management) and was expected at times to handle all other department, at the same time, not being able to leave the front cash register. Also schedule was posted weekly and/or biweekly and this made it hard to make plans for other things from vacations to Dr. appointments, this was standard procedure, not random."
good,"Managers always ensured their customers were satisfied as well as made sure to have a strong customer service team. They ensured both were receiving fair treatment by always looking into each one's needs."
good,"Working at Walgreens Pharmacy is not easy, and there are many responsibilities for the Pharmacy Technician. The customers are very nice and the area is great. Working with people who know teamwork makes the day much easier, Management doesn't know how to manage, which makes the job more difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people, and the funny co-workers."
good,"Walgreens was  avery productive place to work and they worked well with me with my schedule due to me being a student. The management, team, and most of my customers were very nice and a pleasure to be around."
good,"Walgreens was my first job right after school. I learned a lot of managerial capacities and enjoyed working for a company that rewards its employees. However, the working schedule and job duties were not aligned with my professional career so I decided to start a new job."
good,"Management can be handled better, so employeee can perform their work better. Company, rather than individual advancement. Should give more training to employee in all aspects of the job so that they can gain knowledge and experience in the company at large. Better assist."
good,Great fast paced job to work for experience in Photo and pharmacy experience. Management that would be unprofessional is gone. Fun Coworkers and team to help each other.
good,"Enjoyed my time working for Walgreens, had the chance to work at multiple ones to pick up more hours. Met good co workers at the time being. After having my daughter I wanted to go back and work there again but wasn't able to because of the season."
good,"I started Walgreens after High School as a first job."
good,"working the cashier, helping customers any time help is needed. replenishing floor for all the products the company carries depending on your assigned isle"
good,"As a Shift Lead, you are paid hourly, not allowed to receive any overtime, and are not allowed to be off of the clock for any time during your shift unless another manager is present so there isn't always a chance for you to sit down and eat. Overtime starts after 10 hours in one day or 40 hours in a week, and flexibility of schedule is required. This means sometimes you will not receive a weekend off for months at a time, may not have two consecutive days off for extended time, and will have to be willing to work any shifts. "
good,"A typical day involves cash handling, customer service, managerial duties, and occasionally custodial duties. I generally work in the front of the store but if the pharmacy requires help, I assist them."
good,I enjoyed working here and most of my co-workers were great.  My management teams were good about coming in and helping you get whatever job you needed to get done.  I do think morale changed there when they changed the structure of the business.  I would work there again
good,I learned a lot working at Walgreens. I worked in each department spending the last few as the camera department manager. The managers were friendly and helpful. Good 401k plans.
good,"advancement opportunities are few and far between, no development plan. youll be stuck in the same few roles that you see everyday no matter how hard you work or how good you are with customers"
good,"I would clock in 8:00 am usually and make my way to the Cosmetics front desk to see what the daily list of tasks had in store for me. Furthermore completing those tasks in an orderly, timely fashion with a 30 minute lunch break in between before completing my 8 hour shift."
good,"Busy busy busy  I have learned that u get out what you put into a company.  "
good,"Customer Service is my priority. If a customer visits us, is because he needs something, so Im going to make sure he gets it from our store."
good,"Working at Walgreens was productive, and at times, even fun. Often times we were busy and short staffed; however, it helped build character. Overall, I would say I had a relatively good experience working at Walgreens."
good,"Educate patients or caregivers about the proper use of medical products, devices and OTC drug usage"
good,"This was a great place to work, I really like the management they had. Mainly did stocking and tags and helping the customers,they were flexible on the schedules and let you pick up hours as needed."
good,"I worked at Walgreens for 4 years and whenever I walked in, I never knew who would be gone. Managers came and went without warning or explanation. But if you want to manage a store, you can move up quickly, as long as you are willing to have the job be your life. It can be frustrating because the store will be obviously understaffed but the upper management cuts hours if the store doesn't meet sales goals. You can't give the customer service people want with a short crew. Overall, it wasn't bad, since I was not interested in moving up. We had some great managers and they were a pleasure to work for."
good,"Your duties are lined out for you but there are always things that need to be done. The company will teach you the basics of how to do your job before you start working. After you start, however, you learn new things along the way. Depending on what department you work in that day, the duties are different. Generally, you have to be willing to multi-task to meet daily quotas. Customers always comes first and you are expected to make sure that all customers are taken care of before resuming any assignments given.Working at Walgreen's has taught me how excellent customer service skills as well as time management skills. The store has a very friendly work environment. Teamwork is emphasized to help maximize the daily completion of duties. The hardest part of the job in my opinion, would have to be holidays. With a constant flood of customers coming in the store, you have to find ways to take care of their needs and wants as well as handle your daily duties on the floor or in whatever department you work in that day. It is very rewarding to receive recognition for what you do. They make it a point to recognize your strengths as well as point out your weaknesses."
good,"Interacting with customers all day non stop until the time you clock in until you clock out would be a typical day working at Walgreen. stocking merchandise to help the needs of the customers, being able to multitask with being at the cashier and also answering phones and making sure that customers leave the store with a smile on their face. The hardest part would be truck days when we have to load all of the merchandise from off the truck. The enjoyable part about working at walgreens would be the amazing co-workers I had, they were all so sweet."
good,"Don't expect any regular raises, they are very few and far between. You can usually get time off when requested. You get the 10% discount the very day you start working, which is a huge plus. And 25% off of store brand items."
good,"Working for Walgreens for almost 2 years gave me the opportunity to really expand my skills personally and in the work force. "
good,"Walgreen is a good place to work, the hours are flexible and store managers are able and willing to accommodate the needs of employees. "
good,Good place to work  with friendly people and co-workers. This is a fast paced pharmacy setting that keeps all employees  working together as a team. This enables all time deadlines to be met.
good,"When I first starting working for Walgreens they were a great company. Walgreens paid well, had excellent insurance and benefits, the after about 8 years they rolled out a new policy and motto and everything changed. Walgreens was no longer worried about their employees and definitely not their patients."
good,"Being the front cashier has taught me about stress management and  the ability to think on my feet quickly."
good,My coworkers were great. Always quick to lend a helping hand and patient while teaching me the computer system. I was there as an extern for school and they helped me learn a lot
good,Working for this company gave me a lot of experience with customers service along with giving me a chance to learn how to manage products. All together the experience was great.
good,"Easy to built career with special programs Walgreens company provides to young managers. Great team, nice work environment, good benefits.I had great time working there."
good,Good overall company. Good benefits and 401k. Lot of room for advancement. Hours are hard on a family and you work a lot of holidays. They are open 365 days a year
good,"Walgreens has its issues but it's still a good job. When I get to work, I am usually the only worker other than management and they want you to accomplish so many things at once but don't want you to leave the Front register. We are a small store so we don't have a lot of hours to give out but most workers even on full time only get 21 hours a week, and the part time people get maybe 15. There are good days though, when there's multiple people there to help get things done and to keep you company."
good,"Walgreens was one of my few overnight job experiences. Although it interfered with my home life, there were many benefits. I worked as  a photo Technician and Cashier. The connection I had with my coworkers was timeless. I am still in contact from past coworkers today."
good,"Great Company to work for. However, be careful on who you decide to associate yourself with. The company has great benefit to reap from and if in management role, pay is decent"
good,i really enjoyed this job. very laid back but productive. Considering we are one of the busy stores in Las Vegas. The amount of work was fair for amount i was getting paid. My coworkers were awesome and we all got along for the most part.
good,"They are a place where you want to further your career in retail, they will help you grow. They try to help people grow, and help there employees. They are crazy about there customers."
good,"I really respect and admire the management at Walgreens. However, the other employees were visibly unhappy to be there. I felt uncomfortable interacting with coworkers. Customers were also particularly undesirable. Homeless individuals would loiter in the store."
good,A typical day at work consists of assisting a decent amount of customers in various departments and all with different needs. I learned that retail during the holidays does get extremely busy and that it can sometimes be overwhelming. Some of the management staff was easy to talk to and somewhat understanding when there were any issues brought to their attention. Majority of the co-workers I worked with were personable and helpful to either me or the customers. Some employees would go above and beyond to help out other co-workers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with upset customers that no matter what you or a manager does for them they are still so unhappy. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers and meeting their needs and having them thank you or having other customers notice the patience and compassion I had with helping an elderly gentleman with his shopping list and retrieving all of the items on it.
good,"Night shift duty , working by myself always for about 7 years however you are the boss, it's a good shift since it gives you a little bit of vacations through the year."
good,Great place to work.  Management is good.  Easy to move up in the company.  Main issue for me is salary.  Great training.  Mostly hands on but I learned a lot about the pharmacy and medications.  I
good,"I worked the midnight shift at a 24 hour Walgreens for just over a year. I loved the shift, I felt like I could be more productive with less customers, and I was. The general management didn't seem to understand the activities we did every night though, and often equated the amount of customers we serviced directly to the amount of work they could add onto our nightly list of duties. Often I felt overwhelmed with all the extras. Tried to communicate with general management, often got shut down with ""We know everything that happens on your shift."""
good,A slightly stressful job like every other retail job yet with a goal and patience you can grow very quickly with the company.
good,It was the perfect place for me to get my start there. Especially since I was just starting college at the time so they were able to adjust my schedule around to the appropriate times. If anyone wants a place to get their first job Walgreens would be good for that.
good,Loved working for this company.  Customer Service is very important at Walgreens. Loved all of the regular customers that visited the store.
good,"Putting a smile on your customer's face, after they came in, not feeling well, not knowing what medicine to buy and knowing they will be a return customer, is a good feeling."
good,"Apply online and then do a in store application and assessment and a drug test. Walgreens where i work recently raised its minimum wage to $9.00 an hour. If you have any management complaints go directly to HR and save your time. Front of store is busy but easy, photo is busy and moderately difficult, and cosmetics is slow and easy. holidays and work parties and fundraisers help you enjoy work more. You are allowed a more flexible schedule with a job like this with so many employees"
good,"I enjoy working at Walgreen's, I am at a fast-paced store which has a counter and drive-thru. I am the inventory control specialist there, and I love that part of my job. The most difficult part of my job is assisting patients with their insurance coverage of non-formulary medications."
good,"Overall it's a decent place to work,it has its ups and it's down,certain stores have their security and some don't ,making it the flaw. The pros of this job would the discount,the cool coworkers,and the experience and the cons,lack of security ,the customers and the loss of profit when they steal. If you make great hours the money is great. Great starter job,as it was for me."
good,"Everybody I worked with was very helpful and kind, I always felt welcome and never felt uneasy about asking questions or asking for help."
good,"On a typical work day the pace would be fast we would receive prescription back to back to enter into the system to be reviewed by the pharmacist. During my time there I learned how to carefully read the information written on the rx by the prescribe and transfer that information into the system. I also learned the importance of understanding ""sig codes"" and being to write them in a way the patient could understand. The people I worked with were very friendly and easy to work with. Management was very hands on and very helpful."
good,Great place to work. Managers are personable and fair.  Schedules were adjustable and work was rewarding. Would recommend as a great place to work.
good,Everyday I built customer relationships with customers.  I also was titled number one in the district in sales a couple of times.  It was a great atmosphere however the pay was very low. I looked for other oppprtunities
good,very nice place to work  However job security seems to be low as they continue to change in respect to Clinic Hours and have closed several clinics in the last year.
good,"It is a great place for someone to learn the basics of retail. Being in that kind of environment also will help with money handling skills, and interacting with customers."
good,"Walgreens is a workplace that cares greatly about its customers and it's work culture. It makes bold claims to appreciate it's employees and has pages open to employee suggestions, but they are seldom followed. While the benefits Walgreens offers are excellent, the wages offered, as well as raises, are not competitive."
good,"Friendly staff, and learned how to work the photo machine.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the customers. The hardest part was working till 12:00 AM and turning around and having to be there the next day at 7:00 AM"
good,"I want to be on days and it just isnt happing. I enjoy the work I do, I would just like to be on a day shift! The turnover rate is very high here because they are not as competitive with salaries as they should be."
good,"Greeting customers and receiving written prescription or refill requests"
good,Worked for Walgreens for over 17 years met some amazing co-workers and customers. Company has changed a lot since I first started working there but overall a good company to work for
good,"I am a current employee, I am overall happy with the company and my job, but recently they seem to be caring less about their employees in general. With the new law concerning salary requirements they are hesitant to promote above ASMT."
good,I love the kind of work I did and I loved the hours and days I worked. I couldn't ask for a better shift. I just wished I would have continued working before getting laid off before the holidays coming up.
good,The customers are what makes this job. I like the challenges I make for myself. I really enjoy my job. It's been a fun 4 1/2 years!
good,"Very high paced, professional work environment. Stress level very high.  High level of public contact with high volume of pharmaceutical and counseling output on daily basis. After many years in this profession, I learned that I could function very well in this type fast-paced environment.  My co-workers and I were supportive of one another throughout the daily operations.  I have to say that patient (customer) contact was usually the most enjoyable part of any shift."
good,"I love what I do, retail is a fun place if you can handle the pace. Key is to hire and develop a reliable team and create a positive atmosphere. The challenge is intense but the payoff is great and the feeling of accomplishment is beyond satisfying!"
good,"Go in speak open the store, count the safe make sure deposits are ready for pick up, count the registers and put then in the draws before opening the store to the public."
good,Learned alot how to deal with a very busy environment and maintain a healthy work ethic for me the employees and customers. With transitioning from management to pharmacy technician the experience with being management helped me balance the busy atmosphere in he pharmacy and maintain structure as well.
good,"Every job has its pro's and con's. I loved the customers for the most part, and alot of my coworkers were great people. The tasks were not too difficult."
good,The people are kind and supportive.  The main focus is driven at extraordinary customer care.  The goal is to ensure the customer leaves with the products and service they are searching for to the best of the company's ability.
good,Great place to work. The staff is helpful and always willings to help. The program is easy to use and can be quickly learned. The time goes by very quickly.
good,"We strived for perfection and achieved many goals over the course of the 8 years I was employed. "
good,This job is ok if your are mainly looking for part time work. It looks well for employers to see but there is not really room for great advancement. Managers worked well with schedule.
good,"Working at the corporate office was a great experience and everyone in my department was great to work with.  I connected with managers which I had worked for in the past, so it was great to be working with them again."
good,"Very fast pace with customers coming in and out. Restocking the backroom is an all day job. While working i experienced customer's service. Communications skills improved. Very intellectual people, out going persons nice to be around with and make sure the job is done right. The most difficult time of the day would be closing, making sure everything is the right place and right shelf. Pricing is something they take really serious there. At the end of the day the most enjoyable part would be getting to spend time with your co-workers allover again."
good,Walgreens allows you to obtain goals in healthcare and also develop friendships with co workers and customers...... I have been able to learn process photo orders and continue my education in pharmaceuticals
good,Best place to work. I love my co-workers. They are all so helpful. Everyone enjoyed working together. I love that they are do nice and always there whenever you need help with anything.
good,The company was evolving due to new management. There was a lot of turn over. Flexible hours and very nice campus with a state of the art work out facility.
good,"Walgreens is an excellent starting point, or general opportunity, for anyone with a drive for results and growth. This job entitles the capacity to stock, problem solve, communicate, multi-task, empathize, and cooperate."
good,Its okay for now. A typical day at work would be chatting live with patients. Management is not all that good. They need to be a little more organized.
good,"A typical consist of a full list of daily task and various projects that consumes a lot of time and takes you away from the register. I've learned how to do scan outs, pull bays, how to organize better, how to adapt to tough situations, how to work better with a team, and how to perform various projects.  The hardest part about my job is the store manager.  The most enjoyable part of the day is when I laugh with the regular customers and co-workers... good times."
good,"Hardest part of the job is staying productive, there are times when you have nothing else to do but when you are a go-go-go person it is hard to just do nothing."
good,"Coming to work is enjoyable.  The day always starts with a pep talk from management, along with what the daily focus of the day is i.e...stocking merchandise, warehouse cleanup, and unloading truck."
good,"fast-paced, difficult to balance work and life, the distance to travel as a floater was burdensome. Best part of the job was interacting with the customers."
good,Its a nice place to work overall its ok...u get constant drop off and pick up all day long from open to close. When u open its always ppl standing right there at 8am.....
good,"Beauty.com is very a professional and productive work place. Everyone in here is helpful, friendly and nice to work with."
good,Walgreens is a job where you learn how to develop skills and work as a team. Walgreens also show us about safety how should we work and how to be a self motivated person to others.
good,"Good Company to work for"
good,"A typical work day consisted fo filling prescriptions, stocking inventory, making sure the robot was filled with medication, I leared how to call certain insurance companies to find out why a prescription could not be filled, or the cost of a prescription. I've always worked with the greatest Pharmacy Manager always avalible for questions or help at any time.The most enjoyable part was dealing with customers an making sure the had there medications."
good,"The crew is amazing, management not so much. The 2nd shift at a 24hr Walgreens has it bad. Morning shifts are the easiest. The job is simple and the same everyday."
good,"I love working in a high-paced atmosphere with many challenges and deadlines. This job makes time fly and creates a tremendous feeling of accomplishment upon meeting deadlines and completing projects. Its hardly work, more like a day-to-day competition in business for which you get well compensated. I enjoy coming in to work each morning and pushing my staff to greater heights. Maximizing work output is key."
good,"I worked at a store that was new. We were all hired to stock it, and fill it up for the grand opening. It was a nice store with a great store manager. I worked in the photo department and at front checkouts. I also stocked shelves, worked in the stockroom and waited on customers."
good,"Working with Walgreen's is a great experience, however some of the management lack empathy toward workers. Morale is important, but some of the managers do not do their part in boosting it."
good,The work flow is busy all day as it's of the nature of the job.Tech is complete data entry and filling scripts. The pharmacist is busy with customer for counseling. Team work is a key point to get the workflow run smoothly
good,Learn alot fast everyone does there own thing the customer comes first always will be something to remember security needs to be a bit better though
good,"A typical day at work consists of greeting customers as well as fulfilling photo orders and stock up on items. Not only that, but also answer phone calls from customers and keep the store clean and tidy  every night for the next work day. Co-workers are like family, as well as leadership."
good,This Company is very active with both customers and employees.They other a very comprehensive insurance policy as well as a nice retirement package.
good,They will definitely help you in regards to what goal you need to accomplish in your career. Very good with transfers and accommodating. You have to be flexible with your time but its an awesome learning experience I recommend new technicians to work here first.
good,Walgreen's was a professional environment which allowed me the opportunity for many on the job training experiences.
good,"We get along well at my store. We can talk about topics like wrestling, magic the gathering tcg, pokemon, anime, or the latest episode of walking dead. We can joke around and still get work done. I've learned how to work with any vendor representative that comes in to the store and talk about what we need and how much or product to order. That is now one of my core responsibilities at my store since i manage the cooler/freezer departments."
good,I enjoyed working Walgreens because I was never without anything to do on a work day. I picked up some skills that I take pride in such as my customer service and time management. My co-workers were great. We were a great team. The hardest part about the job was the language barriers with some customers because we didn't have anyone that knew the language. The most enjoyable part of the job was the tight knit team we had.
good,loved working there. typical days at work were always different. I learned so much about management and leadership while employed there. management was always wonderful. coworkers varied but overall were nice. hardest part would be covering when alot of people cant make it (ex: a blizzard). I loved the customer service aspect of walgreens.
good,I loved Working for Walgreens. They offer great benefits and I think Walgreens as a corporation care about their employees.
good,My time at Walgreens was short lived due to them taking away shift lead positions. I was offered to be a Pharmacy cashier but i have no interest in pharmacy.
good,"In working for Walgreens I had a great team that I worked with when I started out in the Durham location.  That was a 24 hour store and as a technician at the time when working the night shift you had to stay sometimes until 10pm.  This was often draining and stressful if it was just one Tech and the Pharmacist on duty.  "
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was attending the quarterly beauty advisor meetings and building a relationship with the customers, some who I still see and talk to today."
good,"Customer focus was always the main goal from keeping items in stock to answering any questions or concerns all the way through the check out. Constantly engaged with customers, other co-workers and management throughout any shift."
good,There is always a lot to do in this company. You do have an advantage to grow but sometimes you have to make a lateral move to be able to grow in the company. This company rather everyone work from the bottom up. Instead of being able to bring experience you already have and develop that within the company.
good,Great place to work. I have learned a lot in my time working here and will take my acquired skills with me wherever I go. Great management and advancement opportunities.
good,"A very intense job, some good days and bad days. This job was all based on the customers you encounter, if you can make them happy then its been a great day."
good,"A typical day at Walgreen entails working the drive through, answering phones (conferenceing with doctors, nurses, insurance companies, answering questions for patients), taking inventory, managing your time, taking in prescriptions, filling prescriptions, all while having excellent customer service. The hardest part of my job was the work load and limited amount of staff. The most enjoyable part about my job was helping patients get prescriptions filled that were difficult for them to obtain because of availability, price, prior authorizations, and numerous other reasons. My co-workers were always there to assist me when needed, and help answer questions that I did not have the answers too."
good,"In the pharmacy I learned many important real world skills including data entry, file maintenance, and a greater knowledge of the pharmaceutical field. My experience at Walgreens pharmacy is a busy fast paced setting which some may not like. I enjoyed always being busy and the wonderful people I have the pleasure of working with."
good,I enjoy working for Walgreens. My coworkers are all really great. A typical day is busy with customers asking for help and keeping the store clean and looking nice.
good,Ensuring the patient is given the correct medication after visiting hospital or doctor's office. constantly learning new drugs that were on the market. generics there were soon to be available.
good,"If you're going the route of retail, Walgreens was as good as it gets in my opinion. Great environment that allows many growth opportunities and treats it's employees well."
good,Management seems to be a problem most of the time.  The Pharmacy Technician job in general is a fun and rewarding job.  It's not too complicated once you've learned all of the processes.  The job is a very busy and demanding job though.  Constant customers and prescriptions.
good,"The job in general was simplistic, and as a result, somewhat boring. I would perform a variety of tasks throughout the day, such as stocking shelves, assisting customers, running the cash register, or doing chores in the stockroom. These mundane tasks were made infinitely more enjoyable thanks to the easily approachable management and my friendly co-workers. I found it easy to make friends inside of the store, and I always felt accepted and welcome in the environment. I learned the value of teamwork by cooperating and learning from my co-workers, and I experienced the fulfilling feeling of working hard to do a good job. This was simultaneously the hardest and most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"typical day at work would be taking care of customers , and working the cash register. We also had daily jobs like working on resets, overstock, out dates, ad tags etc. We always had to face the store when we had time. "
good,"Walgreens Boots Alliance has eliminated many long term positions and the job culture has changed.  Many good, loyal employees are gone."
good,"Most days were slow, but there were fast paced intervals. Management was a little disorganized and the co-workers sometimes difficult. Hardest part being scheduling. I enjoyed helping the customers and had a base of people whom specifically sought me out for assistance."
good,"In my 5 and a half years with Walgreen it has been interesting. While opening the store to having fun with the team members to make the workplace and good and fun place to work. there are the responsibilities of making sure that the safe and registers are counted to make sure that there is no shortages. Then helping team members stock shelves and unload the trucks which we have to make fun, so that it will be go by fast and they have fun and not just be there to do a job. The hardest part of the job would be to disciplinary reports on employees that don't like to do their job. but other than that Customers are where the truly hard part comes in. It is to make sure that their needs are met and that we provide great customer service."
good,Walgreens was the greatest place I have ever worked in my life. I stayed with them for 13 years and I had great experience. But some of the co-workers could really be offensive to other co-workers and they could be extremely busy but the give great benefit and you feel more secure to work for them
good,I really enjoy my time with Walgreens.  I always feel like I'm learning new things and being encouraged to take control of my department.
good,"What i like about working at walgreens is they work around my schedule. i was a full time student and had other things that came about in my life. they were able to adjust my days to work based on my lifestyle."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Walgreens, and during the years I met many people from all walk of life. Although my title was Beauty Adviser, I was mostly in the front until I learn photo in my last year."
good,"The job overall was a very caring job. the company and its managers gave me a open arms, and listening ears. i was able to get some hours, and go to other stores when i felt as though i needed more."
good,This job really was beneficial for me as a student. My boss was flexible enough that I still made a decent income and was still able to focus on my studies. This was a good temporary job for me as I pursue my search for a career in my field of study.
good,I work for TCS and Walgreens is my client company. The work culture at TCS is good by the management needs to improve bit. Also the compensation is low
good,"I learned lots of things new.Its fun job if you are smart.Everyday is challange. I learned in past years how to take care shipments,work with schedule."
good,"Long as you have a great team you're bound to succeed."
good,"Very challenging, need people skills. I learn to be a leader, to do inventory, work the different job reports. Good relationship with the co-workers."
good,"the job can be hectic at times but what job isn't? the pay isn't great for the amount of work we do. we are short staffed alot so we have the workload of 2 people sometimes, but the coworkers i have are amazing and help me see past the cons. it depends on what store you work at, but overall i guess walgreens is a decent place to work. alot better than cvs."
good,"I enjoy my job. I work mostly on the back end of prescription billing. I submit Prior Authorization forms to doctors and insurances and I take care of the medical billing for Medicare and Major medical billing for Blue cross of KC. I have learned everything I know about pharmacy from this location. I only worked in the retail setting for 2 months. I am the youngest person at my location, age and time at Walgreen. The hardest part of my job is trying to explain billing to patients when its extremely hard for me to understand. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping patient in what most places would consider impossible situations. We specialize in HIV, Hep C, Transplant and Oncology medications. These patient have very sensitive lives and issues. I work along with doctors, nurses and case managers to make sure they don't go without meds, regardless of insurance issues."
good,"This was the first job I had ever worked at that required me to work holidays. I was in school at the time, so I was just working seasonally. I came home for winter break and was told that since I did not work for Thanksgiving, that I had to work Christmas Eve and Christmas day, as well as 38 hours per week while I was home for break. This was the hardest part about my job because I was 19 years old, working full-time when I planned on being with my family those three weeks. It was just something I wasn't expecting to happen and caught me off guard."
good,"Constant distribution of products through vendors and other stores, some pharmacy overlook, management skills, and greater customer service skills only begin to explain what I got from working at Walgreens. However, I had some issues with management in which they would handle issues and address employees."
good,Helping customers find what they need in the store and sometimes they just come to talk to somebody. Great company to work for if you are young.
good,Provides excellent customer service and creates a work environment that promotes growth. Promotes team work and lets you create and environment that is fun to work in.
good,"It's a nice, fast paced work day, I make everyone smile or leave laughing.  Coworkers and management make the workplace fun and relaxed.  The only downside to Walgreens, is the fact that they pay minimum wage, which isn't bad, but I would think that all the hard work and time put in would pay off.  The hardest part about Walgreens is trying to get a task done throughout the day, only because of the fact that when you work as a cashier, you have to run back and forth to attend to customers, which I don't mind, but something simple turns into an hour long project. I enjoy making people smile and letting them leave happy and with laughter, gives me joy."
good,"Working for Walgreens has given me a lot of experience. I would help customers find what they were looking for offer my help and promote selling products within my department. I have learned to timeliness, productivity, and awareness. My co workers were great supporters and were great at offering help. The hardest part of the job was to meet a goal to sell our selected products, however it was achievable because I would meet the goals set and I enjoyed doing it. It gave me a chance to explain to the customer what our product was really about and give the customer some insight."
good,Walgreens allows room for continued advancement in their different department. I have worked for them for over six years and started at the bottom. Currently I am a shift lead manager which allows me to solve problems creatively and teach others the tips and tricks I have learned along the way. I love that they have a great profit sharing program that will eventually match what you put into your retirement fund. Each store becomes a little group of friends and family and it is pretty easy to adjust. Great stepping stone for high school and college student as well as those looking to go into medical fields.
good,"While working at Walgreens Infusion services I learned how to provide patient's with all different types of backgrounds with the best in customer service. I was able to multi task, and utilize many of skills in a fast pace environment."
good,New tasks arose every day along with new skills needing to be learned with new tasks. This job taught many helpful skills that will follow me through every job I have.
good,"Walgreens was my very 1st job. I did not know what to expect. Walgreens is a great company. The management staff was fare, the pay was reasonable being my first job. Being a beauty advisor was a great position for me seeing that I love cosmetics. I was able to learn about the history of different brands. Obtained a lot of customer service and selling skills."
good,"A typical day at work was we came in and had our tier meeting then we go to our departments and did the job on hand."
good,"Fast pace environment filling many Rx, making calls and dealing with guest. Pharmacist well trained and gave advice when asked. Can be challenging with guest sometimes when dealing with insurance coverages."
good,It was ok overall. All of management was friendly and coworkers were great. corporate was horrible. I learned how achieve my goals in a timely manner and how to bounce customers and work
good,"Positive work environment lots of communication between staff and customers. Trained new employees on sales floor and stocking procedures. Assisted in stocking products on the shelves and into stock room on upper level of building. The constantly changing weekly schedule was something that I did not particularly like, I would have preferred to have a set schedule. I enjoyed being able to test out the make up/ body products that were being promoted on a monthly base."
good,This is a great job to get teenagers used to the real world. It shows the good side of business and the rough side. The managers always wanted me and my co-workers to reach our full potential and couldn't stand to see us fail. The hardest part of my job was scheduling. Working 2nd shift seemed to take most of my day away. I would rather have a 1st shift job. I loved getting to form friendships with my co-workers. These relationships really helped us get things done quickly and efficiently.
good,my typical day at work was mostly restocking and organizing around the store. the least enjoyable part for me personally was restocking the freezer just because im not good with cold anything. but aside from that everything was good. all my co-workers were friendly and all had good and positive vibes. i did really enjoy my time working at walgreens.
good,Making costumers happy and want o come back to store.Working on things to make my job a better place for people to come shop at
good,This is a good company to work for and there is plenty of room for advancement. Excellent profit sharing and other benefits.
good,"There is no ""typical day"" which makes everyday interesting. The staff is very supportive of each other. My new location in Colorado has broadened my knowledge due to different state rules and regulations. It is also a different culture of staff and customers. I am the only certified technician so I share my knowledge and experience with other staff. The hardest part of my job is trying to provide complete customer satisfaction to everyone. The most enjoyable part of my job is dealing with different people and challenges everyday."
good,"A typical day at Walgreens, associates participate in the daily five minute meeting and gain learn what were the number for the store for the previous day. We then are assigned out individual tasks. From then on, we set out to complete our tasks while maintaining good customer service."
good,"Walgreens can be fun to work for but there tends to be a high turnover rate so the staff is overworked.  The people who work there are wonderful and everyone tries to lend a hand but some days are harder than others.  The closer it gets to the holidays, the worse the customers treat you."
good,"Even on a bad day, you'll end up having a good day. The customers are usually very friendly. I was a cashier up front most of the time, but I also got the opportunity to work in the cosmetics department. The only bad thing about that department is that you're assigned to cleaning the restrooms each night and emptying all trashes, but I still didn't mind it too much. The music is very random and enjoyable. I would recommend this job."
good,Friendly co-workers with supportive management. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people.  The company provides good benefits.
good,The co workers are fun and the work enrivorment is very chill and relaxed. There sint much work to do so its pretty easy. Just when it comes to scheduling you need to make sure the manager knows your available and unavailable days weeks ahead of time.
good,"a typical day consist of consistant work, Ive learned to be more responsible, Management is amazing and co-workers are very helpful, the hardest part of my day is muti-tasking between customers, lastly, the most enjoyable part of my day is knowing i made my customers smile."
good,"I enjoy my time at Walgreens. The environment is safe and fun. We always make work fun and makes the time go by quickly. However, we always seem to get the job done and complete everything that needs to be done on a day to day basis."
good,"every thursday was extreamly bad because that was shipment day, how ever other days could get slow so bad that u coud sit around for about half an hour and now one would say a thing because it was that slow"
good,"I have been staff pharmacist at a Tampa location for 12+ years before relocating to Lilburn, GA. Although being staff pharmacist, I have learned many management skills during the time pharmacy manager(s) was/were absent. I have worked at multiple Walgreens locations including wellness stores with different settings. I am familiar with most of their hi-tech robotic filling stations. I am well trained in MTM services and billing procedures. I also perform many health tests such as glucose, cholesterol, BMI, A1C, and blood pressure."
good,"My overall review of Walgreens is a positive one. I have worked alongside valuable people, that I foresee lifelong friendships with. I have built upon many existing skills and even mastered new ones."
good,"Normally I work the later day shift and depending on which department I'm in is how my shift starts. If i'm in cosmetics i start by reading the daily task list on what needs done then I go to pull stock.    If i'm in photo I start pulling pop or back stock. I've seen a new perspective of retail. Going from a farm and home store to a health convenience store. It's smaller and has a different customer base. There really is not hard part of my job retail just comes naturally to me now, the most enjoyable would be solving customer issues/questions and planograms."
good,"it was a nice place to work but the rules that should apply to everyone only apply to certain people. You get a lot of costumer service experience and depending on your manager, there are flexible schedules available."
good,"Easy going co workers. Customers can be rude but there are some fun, and understandable ones which also becomes regular customers."
good,I worked as an extern at Walgreens and I enjoyed learning new things however the communication and compensation that they offered to me was not enough for the rigor that Walgreens experiences.  The other technicians had a problem communicating on prescriptions and mostly stayed at the computer while I filled.  So I didn't want to stay there for long.
good,"Walgreens is my first full-time job after high school.  It allowed growth & development, not only as a worker, but for me as a person.  It has given me the knowledge I need to move further in my career and expand upon the training I received from school."
good,"Worked one on one with pharmacist to fill prescriptions and assist customers. Clean work environment, when you need a short break they let you take it."
good,Start my day off Greeting Customer when they enter the store. Assist customer with their questions about any product or services. I made sure the customer was satisfied before leaving the store. Employees were very friendly and Management was very Helpful.I most enjoyed the customers calling you by name and being friendly.
good,"Very fast paced in the store I was at. Must be great at multitasking and customer service is the main focus. Always room for advancement as they promote from within alot.They do not lack in the training area, and are great at keeping all employees engaged."
good,"The hardest part about this job is that the company is going through many changes currently in order to mainstream it to be branded better. While a lot of the practices are understandable and necessary, some are lacking. It is hard to maintain life and work at times."
good,"Working as a service clerk, photo specialist, and cosmetics specialist definitely was a great experience. I learned to be observant and to always confirm sales and prices with managers when dealing with a difficult customer. I really enjoyed the customers conversations, personalities, and being able to provide the best support and help for a customers needs. I had really great and hardworking co-workers who always brightened up my days each day I attended work. I also enjoyed the fast pace and hard work, in the stockroom, in getting the items placed in the right areas of Walgreens."
good,Working for Walgreen's was okay. I gained a lot of needed experience like cash transactions and building customer relations.Staff and employees are still good friends.
good,The company is fast paced and good for anyone wanting to challenge themselves in a new career field. Typical work days include providing customer service and dealing with insurance companies.
good,"Very easy place, but the pay is extremely low. I loved my managers and co-workers, but I will have to move on because I can't afford to go to college if I keep working at Walgreens."
good,"Always busy, time flies, management was always helpful, co-workers easy to work with, always very thoughtful, hardest part of the job, hours cut so lack of staff, more workload on team, but hey we got it done! The people I worked with, the ease of Pharmacy Software, the good work flow and system, it went smoothly."
good,"Walgreens was a great place to work. Learning new things will never stop, so many different departments from a photo lab to the pharmacy. Great place to work."
good,"Fast pace environment."
good,I have learned self confidence. My managers most of the time are great they are willing teach when they have time. And the most enjoyable part of my job are my customers.
good,"always interesting dealing with different customers "
good,"Management was great and always supportive."
good,Supportive local management but unsupportive corporate structure. Company has changed a lot in the last 11 years of working for them.
good,Most days are easy. Customer service is Walgreens' number one priority. Management is always helpful in any situation.
good,Large workloads and small staff but a nice environment and friendly coworkers. There is room and opportunities to advance but it takes more time than it should.
good,Great company with excellent benefits that promotes from with in the company. I worked there 26 years and learned so much about the warehouse industry.
good,I enjoyed working with my co-workers and managers. Everyone was friendly and we were able to work great together. I also enjoy helping people and customer contact.
good,Walgreens is a decent company to work for. It really depends on the store and your manager as to what your experiences will be.
good,customer service is # 1 The company is strong. and it will continue  to strive to be #1. The benefits are good. My co-workers are good to work with. I enjoy learning everyday about day to day operations. Been with the company about 15years.
good,"Walgreen's offers many avenues to advance if you are driven.  The culture in the store is close to family like.  The store schedule requires working some odd shifts and very late hours quite often, so be flexible if you are looking to work at the store level."
good,The typical work day consists of printing photographs and assisting customers with their purchases as well as stocking shelves
good,"A typical day at work would include coming in, counting the safe, communicating with the others managers about any new corporate information and the goals for the day, plus any issues that may need to be resolved or had occurred through the week."
good,I loved that I had the opportunity to work in diferent departments. I learned how to help customers with products they were wanting/needing and also how they could save money with Walgreens instant coupons and mail in rebates. The enjoyable part of my job was my frequent customers. We knew each other on first name basis and at times they would ask for me personally. Working at Walgreens made me feel that both the customers and my co-workers were family
good,I've learned how to proactively resolve customer service issues before they can happen. The best part of the job is knowing you've done all you can to solve an issue.
good,"walgreens is a daily school when u learn to deal with different situations about the customer service culture , when multitasking is the key , management is always for explaining any situation and provide support and encouragement, overnight shift is the hardest part of work , but there is no more satisfaction than the smile in a face of a customer after you provided the help they needed"
good,"A typical day at Walgreens consist of doing numerous tasks that are listed and by me being in photo, I may have a tons of orders. The work is easy but it can be too much if the store is packed."
good,Good place to learn. Competent people. I enjoyed my internship at this company. A typical day work is designed by the pharmacist who then  looks after each employee to see the work done. Co workers are of all ethnicity who work in a team. A great place to work.
good,I've been at this job for a very long time and it was a pretty decent place to work. I felt like I had a really good job security and never had to worry. It was almost impossible to move up within the company unless you had some connections. The benefits weren't very good but it was better than nothing.
good,"Job is very enjoyable when you are working with the right team, the job is very fast paced depending on season. Management is very nice, and schedule is flexible to fit your needs."
good,Loved working in the liquor store. Terrific manager to work side by side with. Great schedule but the store manager did not like tattoos
good,"greeting customers is great, cross sale is very easy, manager and very fun to work with side-by side , closing of the day is the hard part of the day, enjoy seeing my everyday customer"
good,This was a great first job they worked around my schooling and they appreciate all the thing I did the management was very understanding and nice great way to start your work experience
good,assist customers both non pharmacy and pharmacy on fulfilling there needs open /closing duties oversee employees training
good,"The pharmacists and technicians are fun to work with.  This made my work day much more enjoyable than it could have been.  It seemed that we were not allowed as many payroll hours as we needed.  This taught me to use better time management and enhance workflow.  The hardest part of my job was dealing with time and staffing constraints, while finishing all of my duties for the day.  I enjoyed interacting with the customers and patients the most."
good,"Walgreens was a good place to work depending on the rest of your co-workers.  Some stores have employees with knowledge of customer service, while others' did not.  Some managers did not help the situation all the time either.  Long hours, and a rotating schedule that kept you away from family times."
good,"A typical day at Walgreen on a day to day basis, is a busy but exciting spontaneous interaction with customers and employees alike. Diversity and culture definitely plays a role in our workplace as well as ethics. I've learned this from first hand experience, that teamwork and communication on the sales floor is top priority above all things. Making sure that the customer comfortably and needs are meet, and that sales and customer satisfaction are granted to each individual that enters the store. To me, that is the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part of the job, is completing a task with less team members on the sales floor or at the cashier, when there is a busy business day, or a day before a ""big"" event or holidays."
good,Walgreens use to be a family like business. The district manager knew your name and cared about his people. All that has changed and is just a money cranking machine like a lot of places  today....
good,"Not a bad place to work at. Smaller local pharmacy with a much smaller employee base than most other retail pharmacies, but the pace is always quick and people are fun to work with."
good,"The ability to multitask is essential as I was often tasked with 15-20 objects in a work period. These responsibilities would range from opening the photo lab, to running a register, and to speaking with the independent vendors that stock our store. It was enjoyable that there was always something that needed to be done yet challenging, on occasion, to appropriate resources and time to do a superior job."
good,"I would stock shelves, deal with customers, organize products, and was also a cashier. I learned how to handle different personality types as well as diffuse an angry customer. Management was great and very fair to me yet was inconsistent with their humor. For five minutes the manager would be laughing with me and telling jokes but immediately after would scold me for not completing the task he was distracting me from. The hardest part of the job was understanding some of the different ethnic accents that inhabited the area and trying to make them happy while not being able to really know what they wanted. It was a lot of trial and error. On the other hand, the most enjoyable part of my job was the laid back style management carried. They also gave me a good amount of autonomy and trusted me to get certain jobs done."
good,Management was very flexible with my daughter's daycare hours and scheduled my shifts around the daycare. Walgreens is a great company to work for if you plan on moving up in the company.
good,"I would arrive to Walgreens usually ten minutes before my shift would start. Before I would clock-in I would check my task sheet to see what I needed to accomplish before my shift would end. I would do things like: straighten aisles, wipe down dirty shelves/counter tops, put the newspaper out, stock products on the shelves, answer customer questions, showed the customers the item they were looking for, etc. I learned how to get tasks completed in a timely fashion. I learned how to meet the needs of my customers. I learned that I am held accountable for my scheduled shifts. I loved working with my co-workers as a team. They knew they could count on me, and I knew I could count on them. The management at Walgreens helped me grow into a hard worker. Overall, I loved making a difference, but most importantly making a difference in my customers lives."
good,"There were two different shifts for management within the company. If I opened the store, I would start off by balancing the safe and cash reports for the prior night. Afterwards, I walked around the store and assigned tasks for the employees to finish before the day ended. Once the list was prepared, the day proceeded with managing inventory levels, applying price changes, and scanning in vendors and making sure the invoices were accurate. When I closed the store, the tasks typically involved were developing claim orders for damaged items, items on call-ins and recall, and items that were returned from customers. When these tasks were completed, I would either help out the employees on the floor with their assigned tasks or help out in the pharmacy with anything they needed such as filling and scanning prescriptions, counting drugs to ensure inventory levels were accurate, and assist any customers with questions or concerns."
good,"cashiering, cleaning, stocking and doing inventory. learning how to run the photo lab. which was why I was hired. my co-workers were mostly nice. the most enjoyable part of the job was learning the photo lab. the hardest part of the job was when the changed my hours."
good,"I assisted guests, performed cash register duties, did stock, other duties included unloading trucks, inventory, & some light maintenance"
good,We've all worked a retail job at some point in our lives. It's not the greatest job but I sure do enjoy it. I am a people person and I get to enjoy 20 seconds of someones time hundreds of times a day. The staff is very friendly and I enjoy working with them. I see the managers as friends rather than just superiors.
good,"Use to be a fun place to work until about 6 years ago , when a new management format was established . Pharmacist are looked upon as being at the same level as an hourly employee who reports directly to a store manager who probably doesn't have a college degree ."
good,You have the ability to develop yourself and advance your career in the retail arena.  Enjoy the opportunity to participate in community outreach efforts.
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work while you are in school or if you have a second job.  The hours and scheduling are flexible, managers are understanding, and the work is fairly stress-free.  They don't pay very well, but neither do all other similar retail positions.  Hardest part of the job is cleaning up the toy aisle after someone's poorly behaved kids have wrecked it.  This happens on a daily basis.  Best part of the job is joking around with your co-workers and enjoying a stress free part time job to bring in some extra money."
good,Have daily tasks that we need to complete. If they are not accomplished than it is reflected in our reviews. It is sometimes hard to supervise the other employees but I have to remember that it's my responsibility to get tasks done.
good,"Good place to work , Pretty good benefits , pay scale to low to make it in this country. They get a lot out of their employees. Deal with all kinds of people from good to bad."
good,It was usually busy. I learned to communicate with my co-workers and customers effectively. My co-workers and management were pleasant to be around. The hardest part of the job was finding time to get everything done. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping people feel better.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Walgreens #12934. I learned that I am able to do anything I put my mind too. A typical day at Walgreens involved scanning products to determine if the count was correct, pulling items for other stores, customer service first and foremost. The hardest part of my job was being on concrete for 8 to 9 hours at a time as well as unloading the supply trucks because the totes and items were extremely heavy at times. The most enjoyable part of my job at Walgreens was making someone happy and seeing that they enjoyed coming into our store."
good,its great any one would love to work in this type off place everyone is nice and smart working there helped me gain experience which ?i needed
good,"After working with Walgreens for a while now, I feel like I can make a good judgement on this company as whole. It's one of the better paying jobs and they're generous with you and when you can work.. However management is a little all over the place."
good,"Good work environment. Got along with everyone. I printed photos while working out on the sales floor, helping customers and stocking."
good,"I worked night shift with one or two other people. Although I worked alone, I was able to complete my tasks in a timely manner. I enjoyed my job."
good,"Typical day at work:"
good,I love the fact that their is always something to do. I love a job that keeps me productive where I'm learning something new everyday with the company.
good,I only worked their for a year because I had to relocate to Bakersfield from Los Angeles. I liked the job a lot. I was helping opening up two new store throughout the los Angeles area. also got to help out other stores when help was need. I think that it was a good experience.
good,"I learned how to work on the Assembly as a team member and getting along with others. I worked with very good people. I was respected by my management. Keeping my numbers up and working very late hours. my coworkers and  my salary and the"
good,"It was a very enjoyable job. Being able to learn all the different products we offered and pushing them in sales. I learned a lot with data entry at this job. I had to log the customers in for each visit, call when they needed to renew their membership, and also maintain a trustworthy relationship with each individual to keep them coming back to receive the best experience."
good,Working here taught me a lot about retail being it was my first job in this department. My co-workers were great and the environment was great for the most part but I felt as if management was very strict. I was often stressed that I would lose my job after doing one wrong thing. They weren't as flexible with my scheduling as they had promised and they didn't schedule me the amount of hours they had promised which often times it was hard to make ends meet.
good,"I had a wonderful time doing my externship at Walgreens, the pharmacist was very helpful to me and my education and my peers welcomed for the time I was there."
good,"A typical day at work (Walgreens) would be following tasks given by the manager that must be competed at the end of your shift in order for the store to please the customers as well as producing money for the store. While trying to get tasks done there were many more other small objectives that had to be done, such as assisting customers and answering phone calls. I have learned a lot from working for my several jobs especially Walgreens. I have learned how to finish objectives in a productive and timely fashion.  I also learned from observational learning from my manager and co-workers how to manage others if needed. For example, training new employees and telling them what needs to be done in order for them to flourish as well as the company.  The hardest part of the job was managing time, because when the store becomes busy you have to do a great job multitasking.  If I was not able to multitask I would not be able to please the customers as well as finish my tasks in a timely fashion. The most enjoyable part of the job was building relationships with my co-workers and customers on a friendship and also business level."
good,"I love to work for Walgreens.I did learn alot  about Retail."
good,"Never a dull moment at Walgreens, from off loading the truck, receiving vendors to the employees and customers.   Always moving and always something new.  Fast paced and fun.  Taking care of accounts payable and opening and closing paperwork, counting tills and handing out assignments.  Keeping everyone on task and on time.  Handling customer complaints or praises in store.  Problem solving and helping pharmacy when needed.  The manager is always encouraging and wants to promote us, and gives us the tools to do so.  Having to kick someone out for bad behavior is the hardest thing, and helping customers is the best part."
good,"I've received a great amount of education at Cystic Fibrosis Services before becoming Walgreens. I've obtained knowledge such as posting patient and 3rd party payments via the Carepoint software, Adjusting various accounts from write offs to debits and credits. I process and reconcile credit cards daily as well as make weekly deposits into our bank account online via the electronic teller check system. I enjoy working with my manager and supervisors,  I have nice coworkers as well, I've always been a team player to everyone within the organization as a whole. I hardest part of my job is trying to close out the month with all the cash posting and other daily task due at the same time but at the end which we've always seem to accomplish, again as a team. the most enjoyable part is coming to work in general. I love my job!"
good,very smooth job with great staff and a management team that is willing to train you on the ins ands outs of the company great schdule 40 hors work week depending on shift great pharmacy also
good,"This company cares alot about its customers, its very busy but things are always being done, the customer always comes first."
good,Worked there to start my employment career while transitioning to the military.  Work was conducive to learning and I advanced quickly while  being offered promotions if I had stayed.
good,"This is a good company to work for, thou job security is at a low. Making it hard to enjoy the better qualities of the job and company."
good,"I adored my job for the first two years, the past few months have changed a bit since our old manager quit and a new one was hired. The difference between his and her personalities are so vast and they had polar opposite ways of running the pharmacy. The staff has become more laid back and less eager to do what needs to be done."
good,The job is great. Management is well trained and great to work with. My only issue with the company is the low rate of pay
good,"A typical day at work included but not limited to:"
good,Management is awesome and they care if you do a great job. Its a little demanding with changing plan-o-grams and restocking but its rewarding. It was the easiest job I ever had but growth options are slim.
good,"Great for learning, and entering a career in health care. Dealing with managers was enlightening and was fluid. Co-workers did well in their job and allowed you to develop a supportive network with them to achieve better results. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping patients in need and was personal development.  The hardest part of the job were dealing with limitations that were set on you when trying to help patients receive their treatments."
good,"Enjoyed the Customers, Co-Workers and Management. The job was very enjoyable"
good,"•	Work closely with pharmacists and use medication input software to safely an accurately dispense medication."
good,Budget hours being reduced forces managers to work longer hours.
good,Working at Walgreens has made work a healthy life experience for me. We were taught to take a comprehensive approach to promoting health and wellness. Supervisors display interpersonal skills which I have been appreciative. My co-workers have been fun to work with. Most of them have been very helpful and we have cultivated working friendships. I feel like a part of a team. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I get appreciated or get good remarks from customers. I enjoy hearing and reading the great comments they made about me.
good,"The job is a decent one to have, the main downside being the shortage of workers to keep up with such a demanding workflow. Working here i learned great customer service skills and interpersonal skills. My favorite part of the job is talking to funny coworkers and getting to help all the friendly customers that come into our store."
good,Good place to work. Had to leave because of health issues. Very busy.
good,I liked working for Walgreens as an asst.Manager and learned a lot while there.Most of the knowledge was how to manage and hire employees.I also learned a lot about human resources.
good,"A typical day at Walgreen consist of me ringing up customers, taking in returns, issuing refunds, maintaining organization of the store, and handled minor customer disputes as well. When working with Walgreens I learned how to do returns as well as worked very briefly on a couple of revisions in the store. Management was very good, each manager had their strengths and weaknesses but where on person lacked something another manager would make up for it. My co-workers and I loved to have a good time and the majority of my co-workers worked really hard as well. If one of us were falling behind on a certain night my co-workers would help the co-worker that was falling behind. They hardest part of my job was to satisfy the store manager, no matter how well of a job we may of done the store manager always had something to complain about and rarely thanked us for the great job we had done. They store manager never really had anything positive to say."
good,A typical day at work would involve me assisting customers and making sure they find there way threw out the store. Also maintaining a clean store area. The management there was ok i guess not to say anything bad about the company. My co workers were all friendly and love to help with a friendly hand whenever needed. The hardest part of the job would be the stocking also as my first job i wasent sure what to expect. The most enjoyable part of the job would be having my first actually job.
good,Great place to work and can feel like a family if you find the right management team. Advancement is not always easy. Hardest part is if you have a not so experienced manager telling you a priority that is not the same as the store manager.
good,"The general manager is one of the best I have ever worked for. He is honest, caring, and has excellent people skills, with both associates and customers. I enjoy working with the older customers."
good,"I have learned what kind of manager I want to be by working under seven different store managers in the last 8 years.  A typical day at work consists of dealing with customers, coaching employees, checking in vendors, making a list of things to do for the day, and managing payroll.  The hardest part of the job is disciplining the employees who do not follow instruction and firing. The most enjoyable part of my job is coaching and developing my employees."
good,"Working in Walgreens was very rewarding & satisfying experience. Equipped with top notch software & robots/machine to carry on day to day activities allowed me to give a top quality performance & customer satisfaction. I learned a lot through trainings & working with employee's who were very friendly & helpful. Overall, had a very positive work culture at Walgreens."
good,"typical day consists of customer service, working the register, answering calls, stocking shelves, organizing the stockroom, and receiving merchandise deliveries .  I learned how to work with a team and to train new staff members. I learned patience and how to deliver good customer service in all situations.  The hardest part of the job is having a different schedule every day and every week. The most enjoyable part is working with a team and getting to know people."
good,"Walgreens was an okay company to work for. long hours and always had employees who wouldnt pull their weight so it was tossed on everyone else. Management was terrible, only cared about suggestive sell (for their yearly bonus) and never showed appreciation for employees who went above and beyond their job duties."
good,"The excellent training starts by a hand on experience. The sales has a computer to practice the training for the cashier. It has a very good step 1, step  2, step 3 process and after the training, then he or she will to used the cashier to ring up items for the customers. It is a excellent idea. Using a practice register it helps the employee feel better on using the register."
good,"A nice to start off if its a first time job. I was a key holder and did the work of a manager but without the pay of one. I learn how use a texlon, A/S 400, pharmacy, cash handling. My co-workers where awesome people to work with. Hardest part of my job was closing and opening he next day."
good,a typical day at walgreens is very busy and everyone working together to make the day go smooth. I love to help customers and do my very best i would say the most enjoyable part of my job is knowing i am helping
good,"Work environment was safe, co workers where nice, I always has always had all the supplies I needed to do my work effectively"
good,A typical day at my job is definitely challenging .  It can be very stressful most days. However the customers and the people I work with can make it rewarding.  I have a really good crew at my current store .  it is satisfying to know that I have a part in their success to make our store the best .  The hardest part of my job currently is the lack of support from management .  Also from corporate as in major budget cut in hours and expenses. Even with these major cuts the team at my current store has been able to stay on top of all tasks. The most enjoyable part is definitely the customer experience I enjoy interacting with them.  I have satisfaction when they leave happy .
good,"This company is great to work for, it offers great benefits but it is not easy to go up, they do not promote within"
good,"The management was always confusing, the pharmacy manager and the store manager were never on the same page, both were friendly but they never agreed on anything so there was always a huge communication error between the store and pharmacy. The pharmacy was always packed and that made it impossible to create decent work schedules with everyone working the same hours every week, budget was always too low and always understaffed because of the budget. Other than that it was a great place to work, co workers were very friendly and we were always big on customer service which developed a great relationship with the community."
good,Learned a lot from Walgreens. I worked for quite a few Store Managers; and they instrumental in my progress and growth as an individual and as a Manager.
good,"Good compensation.   Not really allowed to say much more as I currently work there,"
good,"Although tasks are ever increasing, it's a rewarding company to work for at the moment considering what the culture of pharmacy currently is."
good,"Worked side by side with store manager, aided with look of the store. Merchandised accordingly with seasons as well as company standards and marketing guide. In charge of the $3500 - $5000 safe, book keeping and balancing previous days drops with cash, credit, & debit transactions. Dealt with hiring and disciplinary actions when needed as well as termination of employee’s. I also did payroll, adjusted, payed out, and fixed any incorrect punches made by employees. Inventory management for the store, stocking or restocking of shelves, ordering, scanning in new merchandise and send back products for credits & daily maintenance of my own department within the store. Price changes, in-store promotions and clearance discontinued products. Aide the pharmacy when needed with taking in new prescriptions and selling prescription with proper verification. Sweep, mop, clean and disinfect public restrooms and other store maintenance issues that would arise."
good,This company was productive and a great place to advance if desired. Co-workers and management were exceptional in helping new employees learn the basic skills need to perform work tasks. overall positive atmosphere.
good,It was a decent company to work for. They had good on the job training.
good,A typical day ranges from 8 to 12 hours consisting of various jobs at any given time. I could be covering any department  depending on the needs of the store. I have learned great customer service skills as well as use of RF devices. The most enjoyable part is the job is working with the various employees and vendors.
good,A typical day would be walking into a shift and communicating with co workers and superiors on the days challenges. Assessing the work load and prioritizing what areas need more immediate attention. The Pharmacy manager at the time was awesome in communicating on what needed to be accomplished and would usually allow flexibility in workflow as most all the staff shared in a customer first approach. The hardest part would have been during a rush hour where there are people waiting in store for their prescriptions and we would receive systems issues. I enjoyed being able to help others both internally and externally on a daily basis. I love problem solving and being solutions focused.
good,"Great place to work, and learn about culture. Very open and inviting staff working to make curriculums entertaining for the younger students. Work with helpful and nice people."
good,"I found Walgreen's to be an exceptional place to work - good compensation with a generous bonus plan and benefits, supportive culture and lots of opportunities for advancement. I had the pleasure to work with and learn from some exceptional people."
good,The overall was good. I worked at the drive through window and help get the drugs off the shelves form the Pharmacist. I wanted to get some retail experience. It was interesting. I also stocked shelves in the front of the pharmacy.
good,"Working for walgreens was a great experience. It was a busy fast paced environment. There were some customers that were hard to deal with but the regular customers and their postive attitudes make the day much better and to go by much faster. I learned a lot working for walgreens. I learned how to present myself, gained self esteem and positivity in my work ethic.  There was never a dull moment. Plenty of room for advancement, but it takes a lot of time and effort. I really enjoyed every aspect of working for walgreens and am sorry I had to leave the company."
good,"This job is hard work driven. Your main goal is to always attend the customer with his or her needs. Management makes sure everything is done according, precise, and efficiently"
good,"great job for getting to know experience in work related, where your store is located at depends on the type on service you will receive! not known for moving up the ladder quickly. a job to get you started on your feet for fist timers"
good,"Working in a retail pharmacy is quite demanding and has broaden my range of skills and increased my efficiency in a work setting. Multitasking and problem solving are definitely key components to a successful working environment. Walgreens has given us all resources needed to work efficiently. Customers are not the only people Walgreens cares about, the employees are too."
good,"A typical day at Walgreens is fulfilling. You get to help great friendly customers, learn about health and wellness products, clean working atmosphere, great co-workers for the most part, community driven business, and many benefits. I learned how to be a manager at Walgreens. Co-workers are friendly as well as the whole nature of the company. The hardest part of working there is the pay/compensation however benefits are great. The most enjoyable part of working for walgrees was the wonderful people."
good,No to Bad But Alot of b/s with mangers are very lazy they over work you also
good,"Was a great place, a lot of good people, I loved working with people. Was a very long drive to work every day from Barbourville to London."
good,"Challenged with continual changing and evolving environment in pharmacy operations and reimbursement as well as integration into Walgreens systems. Learned third party pharmacy reimbursement challenges and wholesale drug purchasing, pricing. Co-workers faced many growing pain challenges with professionalism and understanding to meet common goals. Most difficult was trying to integrate into Walgreens systems and manage processes with limited personnel. Helping patients, solving problems and making a difference."
good,"Learned more about Retail Pharmacy. Earned my certification as a pharmacy technician. Management very friendly, loved my patients, never a dull moment. Learned new things all the time."
good,Great place to work where the prime objective is to help patients.
good,"When I initially started hours were plentiful and it was truly a great place to work. My coworkers and management were fantastic. Then the hour cuts came and pretty much ruined the store. We lost a lot of wonderful people due to the cuts. All our senior techs burnout and it was just a sad situation. The promise of more hours was constant but never came."
good,I was able to grasp the knowledge of HR policies and procedures. Great place to learn different things.
good,this job was new to me. The drive through was scary at first but got the hang of it later. So much was going on at once. Too busy at times. Lots  to learn in a fast pace pharmacy.
good,"I would assist the customer and fulfill the customers needs, I learned how to use the cash register and identify items by the mylars. Co-workers are okay, I didn't mind them. There was nothing hard about this Job."
good,"It's productive and fun workplace.  The employees are very helpful to each other.  Managers have good rapport to the subordinates, considerate, and listen to workers feedback.  They also help the employees in solving problems with customers who have complaints."
good,"would recommend to work there , it is a good and friendly enviroment"
good,"I have learned a lot about customer service and how to keep the customers returning to the store. "
good,"Great customer service. Great relationships. Learner new products, sales."
good,"Always plenty of work to do, so time goes  by quickly. Co-workers are friendly.  Management philosophy  is you can always learn more and do more."
good,Job consists of split case picking products into a tote in a assembly fashion. Great people to work with great personalities.
good,"always something new "
good,They train you very well and you learn a lot from them. I met some great people and walked away with great lessons.
good,"I loved working here at first. I have made many friends in my customers. However, now that I'm getting older and taking on more responsibility I need to make more money and that just isn't happening."
good,"I loved working here, but my unfortunate luck struck and I needed to have surgery for something irrelevant to work. After I recovered I wasn't allowed to return because they wanted me to come back without restrictions and the doctor only needed me to be on the ground floor at least a year. Not that hard if you ask me, but they thought it was the end of the world."
good,"nice place to work, i drove a bus. Kids that i transported were so sweet. Pay at this job was not good."
good,"My job entails counting a register til to begin my shift. I then process photo orders that people have submitted using our photo equipment, I help customers put in their photo orders and I answer their questions as well as stocking our fridge/freezer section, unloading trucks and merchandise, pulling expired product, restocking shelves, straightening store displays and shelves and I also cover the front registers by ringing out customer purchases, counting money and accepting payments etc. My management is good but don't communicate with each other on a regular basis so there is sometimes confusion over what projects take priority. My co-workers are good as well- I appreciate that we have people cross-trained on all areas of the store because any one person can fill-in if needed. The best part of my job would be the customer interaction on a daily basis. The worst would probably be the confusion and mixed-messages from the management staff."
good,great company with an excellent benefits package. I would come in and get the stock guys together and we would bring in our warehouse shipments. I just hated that it was so early in the a.m.
good,"A Field Service Tech at Walgreens is the backbone of the company, without them no store would be able to operate/open new. A typical day at work can range from anywhere to working on a new store construction site, doing a remodel/acquisition with ridiculous demands to sitting in the shop calmly repairing printers and pcs. The manager is easy going but instructions from above management are unclear to even the managers. The hardest part of the job is sometimes understanding what is needed because there are constant breakdowns of communication from corporate. Co workers are great. The most enjoyable part is being able to make my own decisions in the field, having a sort of control over what happens because your are the person on site. Almost everything need to get the job done is provided for you."
good,Got paid great but had no time with the family.  Expect to work all holidays weekends and miss family functions.  Overall a good place to work.
good,Walgreens is a great place for someone looking to start an entry-level position.
good,"I liked my job here because I had a variety of jobs to keep my busy."
good,Walgreens helps you learn to respect others in public. Working there will increase you people skills.
good,"Working as a Walgreens employee is not all that exciting, but I do really enjoy working as a team and with my customers. The other thing that I appreciate most about my job is working in the beauty department and learning more about my role as a beauty advisor."
good,"I began working with Walgreens in 1998 while in high school. The flexibility of the environment and the friendliness of the people is what has kept me on board this long. "
good,High energy environment that will keep you thinking of how to do things better.
good,"While I worked for walgreens I understood how a career was different than an average job. Working as a pharmacy technician really showed me how to pay attention to detail, and defuse a situation involving customer dissatisfaction. I also learned how to maneuver my way through phone lines and customers not only dealing with insurances but also questions that a customer may have had. I realised my multi tasking potential in the short time I worked for wal greens. It may seem like a petty thing to say, however being able to multi task in a work place is something that I've noticed will take you a long way. I believe the hardest thing about wal greens would have to be the insurances and breaking bad news to customers. The upside to it though would deffinately have to be answering any kind of questions with the confidence that you know your products."
good,"I loved working as a Pharmacy Technician. I took the required training, having no experience and did great. People I worked with were great. I thought this job was going to be my future until they were forced to have to down size."
good,I enjoyed my time there with the staff while completing my extern hours for my PhT license. I learned a lot from the staff in the pharmacy. I wish I could have stayed longer with the people and learned more.
good,"Fast pace store, great managers, and loyal customers. The location is right next to city park and on beautiful days you can walk over and enjoy the sun on your break."
good,"most of the day was spent greeting customers, typing labels, filling prescriptions, resolving insurance issues, maintaining stock inventory levels"
good,Suitable work condtions. Alot of work with very little to no recognition and horrible compensation.
good,What I liked most about this job is being able to help customers get what they need in a timely manner.
good,"Give good customer service, work on the cash register, work in the photo lab, assist customers when they need help finding items.  Work hand on hand with my manger have a good communication.  Everyone in this store gets alone we all work as if we one big family.  The hardest part of this job would be that we can never help everybody in everything they need.  The most enjoyable is that I love the fact that I always see different people and always learning something new."
good,"The Walgreens I work at is a good place to be. Its a pretty laid back place and its pretty simple, you get your work done and get there on time there wont be any problems. Management are pretty lenient and are easy to get along with. I'd recommend this place (:"
good,"A fast paced retail environment with multiply opportunities for working in different areas within the store. A day in the life of a manager would include, making daily notes for your team members, delegating, inventory control, and assisting customers with their daily needs."
good,a typical day at work was busy. i learned how to scan and print price labels for my manager and learned how to regulate and manage the flow of Alcohol and tobacco threw the store. the hardest part of my job was dealing with frustrated customers late at night who were merely frustrated with the Pharmacy. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting business professionals during the morning shifts and getting to know them and what their mornings were like. talking to happy customers simply coming in for a morning newspaper and tobacco for the day was the best part because it made the job even more enjoyable.
good,My store manager will always make sure that all employees were able to go to school and have flexible  schedules.Working with people is always a life changing experience you just have to always do your best at all times.
good,"Excellent Work People, great management, never a dull moment"
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers. We have alot of regular customers that come in the store and they're very personable. I enjoy helping them find and shop for what they need. The main part of my job is assisting customers. I've learned there are many types of people in this world, and you can get along with someone very different from yourself."
good,Every customer that comes in I love to talk to and see what I can do for them. I like the busyness and the responsibility of my job.
good,"Walgreens provided a lot of options for growth and opportunity for advancement.  If you are an entry-level college grad, expect to work hard to move up.  If you work internally with an educational background, prepare to pray work even harder just to move up from grunt work to management.  It is a great company still and taught me a lot about organization, delegation, teamwork, and leadership."
good,My time working there was okay. management was great & helpful
good,I started Walgreens as a cashier and they have given me all the opportunity in the world to make my career what I want it to be. After working both in the store and Pharmacy I was able to promoted once I earned my degree. The only negative is being moved around from store to store. You get the opportunity to work with many people and learn from others.
good,A very good experience to introduce me to the world of gainful employment
good,fast pace work environment constantly busy learned a lot of jobs while working here management is good co workers fantastic most enjoyable part is helping customers over all I like this job.
good,"Walgreens has provided me with the opportunity to learn an abundant amount of information on retail and how it all works. Of the many things I have learned to do, a typical day involves Extraordinary Customer Care (Customer Service), ordering products, pulling the overstock, and maintaining cleanliness in my department. Aside from the every day-to-day basics, I have learned how to properly reset a department, scan in a truck, correctly price products, and how to keep an accurate inventory."
good,Days range from crazy to boring but everyone works hard and gets along.I learned to love and take pride in everything I do even if no one notices.The management team here is very professional yet personable. The hardest part of my job is when we are understaffed and can't provide quality customer care. The most enjoyable part is helping people.
good,A typical day includes cash handling and time management. There is always something to do whether is be merchanizing or helping with inventory.
good,"I come from one of the busiest stores in the district. There is never a dull moment; there is always something to do. Pharmacy falls behind at times due to some overwhelmingly high business, so I am expected to help when needed. Management is going through a reconstruction so there is a stress level on them there but they remain approachable, Customers can get a bit unruly when there are more customers than employees on staff in the store per shift but time management is key. Overall, a great place to work."
good,can be very stressful but with the right crew it all flows smoothly
good,Everyone I know who works for Walgreens is super nice and will go out of their way to help you.
good,I enjoyed working with the customers. The hours were okay and there is always something to do as far as jobs that need to get done.
good,I got my first experience here with customer service. Here I learned the in's and outs to helping customers. I was a cashier and worked in the Cosmetic dept as well as the photo dept. My co workers were awesome and most of the management was too. The hardest part of my job back then was picking up the slack from other co workers and feeling under appreciated. The most enjoyable part to my job was assisting the many customers with their needs
good,"- working well together with your teammates to create an excellent working environment."
good,"Walgreens is a decent place to work, one of the better pharmacy companies. Has the same issues as almost all major corporations"
good,My day was filled with many jobs  from cleaning the pharmacy to filling of scripts.  The main thing that was expected of me was good customer service.  If the patient isn't happy then usually they do not come back.  The main store that i worked at was very near my childrens school so I was able to see them and help them if needed after school.  The hardest part about the job I think was keeping up with all the insurances and how they change all the time.
good,"A typical day at Walgreens involves opening the store for business. Preparing team members with the tools to give successfully complete their tasks.  Training, coaching and mentoring team members.  Engaging team members to grow with the company.  Building an environment of excellent customer service."
good,"A typical retail environment with the usual budget constraints, that is, do more with less, every day."
good,"Having worked at double-digit stores around the district, it is apparent that there is a very wide variety of leadership within each respective store. That said, working like I did and mainly picking up shifts from vacations/call-offs (which there are a TON of) provided a more positive atmosphere for me, where I was appreciated for helping out day-to-day. My home store was tremendous with the managers understanding my hectic school life and allowing me to schedule accordingly."
good,Walgreens is a great place to start your career in healthcare.
good,Walgreens is a great company to work for with great employees as well.
good,work was live i learnrd to really put my caring in to my work more the customers are first.Management was super they helped and assissted in every way.The coworkers were kind helpful and fun to work with daily.The hardest part is nervousness .I enjoyed being apart of there team
good,"Great benefits, ability to move up in the company, and equal opportunity"
good,My 11+ years of retail experience has taught me a bunch of lessons and has made the person I am today. I would like to broaden those lessons and take a different journey to further advance those skills and apply them another strong company.
good,Job was good with lots of long term employees.  All but a couple of co-workers were very easy to get along with. Only real negative was the low pay for the amount of work expected.
good,"A typical day consisted of filling patient prescriptions either in person, by phone, email, or drive-thru. I learned a lot about brand/generic drugs and what each drug is for and how it works. Management was great and very helpful when asked a question on how to do something. They would go above and beyond to make sure you understood everything and were very fun to work with. My co-workers were fantastic and always made it fun to be around at work. The hardest part of the job was learning all the details that there is to know about working in a pharmacy and the drugs we worked around. Once I got the hang of the job it was very fun and exciting to go to work every day."
good,The typical day is busy you learn to manage time accordingly and manage by example. You learn the capability of each employee and their weaknesses. The hardest part of the job is adapting to sudden changes that the company make. The most enjoyable part are the customers. Forma employee
good,They offer good benefits and mgmt is always willing to help you succeed.
good,A typical day at work is come to work in the morning do my daily opening of the day. Like the register make sure the area is clean the displays are where they are supposed to. Make them pop out so the customers look at them when they come in thru the door. So time to open the doors for the customers. So I go on with the daily tasks that I have from my manager to do for the day and take care of customers in the meantime when I do my daily duty.
good,"I worked at Walgreens for 2 years and it was absolutely a wonderful experience. We worked as team to keep the store running smoothly. I started off as a cashier and then was promoted to the pharmacy to work as a pharmacy technician. The hardest part of the job was lack of help due to store hours getting cut, so it always took a longer time to get simple tasks done such as stocking. The most enjoyable part about working here was that I got a chance to meet a lot of people from my neighborhood and found a second family at Walgreens. Great place to work!"
good,I enjoyed working there and also enjoyed meeting and making friends with my co-workers
good,While at Walgreens I was a temporary employee. I enjoyed working there and there were many nice people that I had the opportunity to meet. I can not comment on compensation and benefits because I was not eligible.
good,walgreens is a fast paced busy environment. you will be busy all the time dispensing prescriptions.
good,"Greeting customers assisting them with any questions they may have, as well as running the photo department. Developing and processing film as well as digital photos, passport pictures, photo albums, and anything else that relates to picture processing. Working along side my co-workers and managers to create amazing customer service for our customers. The hardest thing I would say about my job is trying to satisfy the customers when sometimes what they want you to do goes against the policy, and you literally cant help them. The most enjoyable part of my job would be the delight on the customers face when you hand them their perfect order with pride knowing they have memories that they can keep for ever right in the palm of their hand."
good,I enjoyed this job quite a bit.  I was one of the compounding techs.  This was my first real technician job so i was very new to the experience
good,"Working at walgreens is fun, however, the pay has decreased and the ability to advance in the job has cut back. The company is based on making the customers happy."
good,"A typical day of work consists of filling and filing prescriptions, data entry, insurance calls and excellent customer service. Management is very helpful and understanding while pushing you to succeed and meet your potential. the most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I'm helping people to live well."
good,typical day your pretty busy and there are always things to do.I have learned a lot working for this company .Management is for the most amazing there are so many that will help you in growing i the company.Most co-workers are amazing have made so long term friendships because of this company .The hardest part of the job is when things are slow keeping yourself busy .Most enjoyable is being able to bring out the best in you and being able to show all you abilities especially during the holidays.Wish i still worked there .
good,I enjoy working for Walgreens.It is a great company.I have wonderful co- workers. I get a thrill off helping our customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customer leaving satisfied because i know they will return.I have regular customers that come in Walgreens nearly everyday and ask for specifically for my service. I have learned many techniques and strategies working for Walgreens. There is no customer that is the same so your approach means a lot. Working here I learned how to handle the must aggressive customers  and they too leave with a smile.I believe if given a chance I can work and learn in any atmosphere.
good,"As a pharmacy manager, I work long hours on my feet all day.  I am given opportunities to grow in knowledge and leadership.  I have built strong relationships with my co-workers.  I enjoy helping my patients educate themselves about living healthier lives."
good,"Low pay, but they are very flexible and many location nationwide to transfer to."
good,"A typical night involves dealing with approximately 100 customers while processing photo orders, replenishing stock and coolers, performing cleaning duties. There's never a dull moment but management does not appreciate the physical challenge of overnight work: several night managers have fallen asleep on the job--which I have never done. Furthermore, as the lone sales associate, I must constantly run from one end of the store to the other: 50-100 times a night while performing my tasks. I've learned to be efficient under fire and to manage my energy levels. The most serious hardship: my position is hard to fill and I'm good at it. So management is reluctant to transfer or promote me."
good,"Hands-on management, steady stream of work for most of the day and great communication between technicians and pharmacists."
good,"I like working in the pharmacy at Walgreens and have established a respectful relationship with our patients. However, Hours are inconsistent and also unreliable. A typical day at work would usually be a fast paced and sometimes stressful environment. I have been working with most of my co-workers for some time now and they have become a second family."
good,"Enjoyable workplace, good management. I enjoyed selling cosmetics and helping the customers on a one-on-one basis. The hardest part of the job was stocking merchandise as the department also included hair, lotion, bath and shave needs as well as cosmetics.  The cases of products were very heavy.  Many of my co-workers were always willing to help me should I need it."
good,"A typical day working at Walgreens is dealing with customers concerns, providing great customer service and always willing to lend a helping hand to your customers. Time management is highly important in this retail field. For my positions as the Assistant Store Manager my duties consist of handling all operational functions of the business/store. I'm responsible for all hourly employees, hiring, training, front end sales, overall condition of the store. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping others and taking care of there concerns."
good,"I work all day at the register greeting customers and saying good bye to customers.  I love helping them to save money.  I have learned patience with the elderly, management is committed to the Corporation.  Co-workers are wonderful team players, hardest part of the job, none I can think of and the most enjoyable would have to be the customers."
good,"I started this job as a teen and within a year, i was able to move around the store and gain knowledge in every department. It gave the opportunity to perfect my peopl skills and work with the public. The management was great and overall my co-workers were always helpful and easy to relate to."
good,"I was taught a lot about cashiering, stocking , and managing displays and most important customer service."
good,"good leaning experience. minus a language barrier with some of my customers, I had a great time."
good,"Walgreens Co. is a very solid company with very structured long-term planning goals.  The company is very innovative and is re-inventing how your neighborhood pharmacy will greatly change the healthcare system.  By improving medication therapy management to acute illness treatments, your neighborhood pharmacy will be a primary source for your everyday health and wellness needs.  And, Walgreens is well-positioned to lead this transition in healthcare."
good,For the most part i liked my job there. Of course at any job with multiple managers you had one ring leader that stirred  the pot all the time. but the others were usually very nice
good,I worked overnight cashier.  It was slow at night so I was able to do other things like stock and make displays.
good,Upon first working for this company things were very organized and the workload was shared among all. Prescriptions were done in a timely manner due to a strict workflow. Pharmacy management was very dedicated and strict but in a good way that lead to the success of the workplace. Co-workers shared responsibility so no one carried a heavier load. The hardest part of the job came when the company made changes that led to pay caps and in turn several employees leaving. The workload then became especially heavy on specific employees. Not all management worked with integrity and honesty. The most enjoyable part of the job was staying busy with a constant flow of work which made the day go by faster.
good,I work at the front register and spend most of my time assisting customers and maintaining isles. All of the employees are very nice and the management tries to help with any problems that may arise.
good,I love working with people and serving them so i enjoyed working the front end.
good,"I loved retail, however the hours and the lack of management keeping my coworkers accountable for their work made it not as pleasant at times. To be fair, the environment and work load varies by store, so my experience would be much different that other well managed stores."
good,"A typical day at  work is usually very hectic, however , I  enjoy being a pharmacist especially helping people with information on their medication and what they need to understand about adherence to therapy, making sure that understand the goals behind while they are on certain regimen. Basically medication therapy management"
good,"I learned through this job that I enjoy putting together displays, promoting new products."
good,"High number of patients would walk in and the team worked together to achieve maximum proficiency in completing those orders, while still providing great customer service. I learned how the pharmacy's daily activities are conducted, using the computer for prescriptions, filling prescriptions, filing those orders, using the registers, and following procedures with Class 2-5 schedules."
good,Typical day working here at walgreens will be meeting new people and learning something new everyday.
good,"Daily tasks vary by day of the week. Every day brings new challenges and experiences.  On Monday we may have a lot of deliveries that need to be tended to immediately, yet on Tuesday we may have none.  Each day brings new challenges and new problems to solve."
good,"Working for Walgreens as a contractor has been an interesting experience, like any large company, structural changes are abrupt and the contracted employees are typically not kept in the loop. "
good,"really enjoyed helping customers as they came in, worked with great people."
good,"I worked at walgreens for just under a year I enjoyed the work environment and co-workers there, the pay was minimum wage and eventually I was doing everything there was to do in the store with ease. "
good,"Evening associate, mostly front register sales, but also have worked in cosmetics and have worked in photo area. Also have work as a mid-shift associate. I walk into the store looking to see how the daytime has gone, I observe the mood and the atmosphere I am walking into as I walk to the break-room.  I say hi to the associates I pass or sometimes give a head nod if they are busy. I walk around the perimeter of the store to continue to observe what my coworkers are doing and so forth then i make my way to my position for the night. I enjoy working with customers and like putting out a positive energy into the stores atmosphere and dynamic of the crew. The hardest part is having to rely on other team members who don't share the same philosophy. Even though there are differences I do my best to maintain an enjoyable place for customers to shop in. General manager and Assistant manager are very professional and I do enjoy working with them.I will use their influences to become a professional manager within the three levels of management divisions in any business settings. Along with their influences I enjoy working with people who are business orientated first in providing excellence customer service. "
good,The store and pharmacy is a great environment for me. I work in the pharmacy for the first portion of my shift and for the second portion I work as a sales associate. The management shows me that they are appreciative of my work ethic and were always willing to work around my school schedule.
good,"Walgreens is a easy place to work, but the company trys to pull as much from you then they can, co-workers most are friendly others are just starting out and its the first job. The hardest put is having the feeling of dont being heard in the work place."
good,"All essential pharmacist functions, teaching technicians, drug drug interactions, drug allergy detections. My co-workers were great- they even came to my wedding. The hardest part of the job was not having enough technicians needed to run a pharmacy. The most enjoyable part of the job was able to make a difference in patients' life."
good,Walgreens was a good place for a first job. The managers were all really nice and the other employees were very nice. 
good,"very professionally equipped company."
good,"As an analyst, I worked with the IEX software platform and AVAYA CMS for tracking inbound call queues.  We were a team of analysts using these tools to make quick decisions to ensure that we had the ""right people in the right place at the right times"".  Communication with upper management was good.  I was salaried and would work an average of 60 hours a week.  The organization of the department needed work, because everyone was stressed out."
good,Walgreens Specialty Pharmacy provided a good work environment.
good,Get to work with many customers and coworkers. The job is challenging with new things everyday
good,"Usually, Dundee wasn't very busy. Management was very laid back, understanding and helpful. One of my favorite jobs."
good,"We have 3 different shifts, the morning, mid, and night shift and we are rotate.  For example, a person who work morning shift have to check the order, fill the prescription, make phone call, and complete partial and out of stock.  I learned a lot from the job, such as customer service and we would all work as a team.  We communicate with each other really well and we understand what work need to be done priority. The most enjoyable part about the job is we are helping patients feel better."
good,"Walgreen's is a great place to work, but not much advancement in  Loss Prevention."
good,"The action never stopped at the pharmacy.  It was always important to maintain a sense of pride, for if you didn't the results were extremely detrimental.  If one did not focus on the task at hand then the potential for reprimand or customer error increased.  I learned that the only way to create workplace respect was to pay attention and dive right into the pool of prescriptions.  Management allowed for  moments of relief but demanded an intense coordination within the employee system.  Co-workers became friends based on time spent within the organization.  The hardest part of the job became the intensity and how it would wear on one's psyche. The most enjoyable part of the job was the knowledge gained."
good,"Working at a 24 hour Walgreens is pretty tough. You learn how to manage time efficiently while keeping accuracy at an even level. When I got hired, the manager who hired me transfered to another store the next day gaining a new manager. Seems the manager is under a lot of stress in her new position, but she makes the best out of the situation and tries to help all employees as much as possible. I believe we sometimes lack as a team. Each works alone for the most part, which is quite disappointing, so teamwork definitely needs to improve. The best part about my job though is engaging with my patients and knowing I did a job well done when they leave satified with the provided health care. They put a smile to my face on a gloomy day. That's my job and they make it the best."
good,counting and selling medications keeping a saitary work place for furthter detail please see resume
good,"I loved the people I worked with, pretty good job, I had great hours but need something new."
good,Typical day at work is pretty good. You learn a lot in a typical day.  The people i work with are amazing.
good,i was happy to worked with co-worker.i liked to work as beauty advisor.
good,a typical day at the hospital was the same routine daily such as filling patients meds for that day. Putting up inventory and filling hourly meds as they were ordered. One thing I learned is that the pharmacy runs much smoother when you and your coworkers work as a team and everyone helps each other when necessary. To me the most enjoyable part of the job was feeling the accomplishment that you had a role in helping people that are sick. The hardest part of the job was probably not in the pharmacy but in the actual hospital when you see the people that are sick and suffering but all I can do is my job and that is the way I help.
good,8 hour day--5 days per week.
good,"I enjoyed the roles I fulfillled in this fast paced call center. The training is very thorough & agents are provided with ""coaching tools"", An interoffice Internet which also links to a Resource Guide to have quick, easily identifiable answers to FAQ's about the products we service and the compatibility of specific DME equipment necessary for blood glucose monitoring of Walgreen clients."
good,"A typical day at work would be go to my start up meeting, figure out what department I'm going to be helping out such as receiving, stocking, split case stock or shipping. My co workers and the fast pace make the day go by fast. Pay was really good too."
good,It was nice to work and make sure customers were getting there product on time and co-workers were great to work with we all had the same goals
good,very good place to start out or even get management experience. Good place to work in a recession. Good job security. bad hours though...
good,I would come in on a typical day and work while seeing the same faces of the same customers but everyday it was always a challenge and I learned to stay calm and to be patient. My co-workers some were friendly and some were not... while the hardest part of my job was just to stay out of drama and stay focused.. my most enjoyable part of my job was to see different faces and to meet new people every day.
good,"I would go into work and start my daily maintains on the photo lab. As i was there i learned to be patient with then customers and help them through every step if needed. The managers had there ups and downs like most bosses do, but, all-n-all, they were fun to be around. My coworkers were cool people...most of the time. i would say the hardest part of it all was being there because it was the same thing everyday, but the best part was the smiles i would put on customers when i made their stay at Walgreen a great."
good,"The customers were great people, and so were many of my co-workers. Everyone in the store got along fine, except for one of the managers. Her mood was constantly changing. I'd say trying to deal with her was the worst part of the job. The most enjoyable part was the customers. A lot of our customers were regulars, and they were really great people."
good,"I liked very much working at one location (Radcliff, KY) , but when I moved from one state to another and transferred to the NY store the people were not as pleasent to work with."
good,"We work on 8, 10 and 12 hour shifts. Work load is moderate to heavy and tech help is minimal. Technicians are usually well trained but hours for them are limited at times. A very good atmosphere and the people in pharmacy you work with are usually great. It is a little micro managed but not at all a bad place to work."
good,Great place to work! Training is excellent and it's a productive company.
good,Ive been with the company for a little over five years now I can say the managers try to work with you and your schedule as far as the children go and everything. A typical work day I would look at my managers notes and dee what he wanted me to do for that day. I learnes that being nice to customers and doing what you need to do to complete your tasks for the day is very important. My co workers evryone tries to help each other. The hardest part of the job is all the lifting we have to do sometimes. The most enojoyable past of my job is I get to work independently most if the time.
good,"Typical day is getting the department going, talk about the day before and then what is expected for today. Part of being management is all the coachings, productivity metrics, and talking with all of the team."
good,I liked working with my co workers most of all. Got a lot of good customer service awards. Nice fun to work with managers. The hardest part of the job had to be the when the customers didn't get what they wanted(discounts or short prices).
good,I worked at an extremely fast pace doing several different jobs at a single time. You get used to it after a while and I really enjoyed it. The worst part of the job is the management. The pharmacist work at their own pace and you do nothing to change that. Some are pretty nice and try to accommodate for being behind and others don't really care and work at snail pace making it hard on all the pharmacy techs dealing with the patients.
good,"I was determined to fill the soldiers box with candy, the box was to the middle of my stomach from the ground. Not having any idea that there was incentive for it, that came later."
good,"keep the store in a good and friendly environment for the customer to have a pleasant shopping experience, order sock, do planograms for new items, work in seasonal for new holiday, communicate with managers to have a better view of the problems"
good,"job security, somewhat fun place to work, more opportunity for advancement"
good,"A typical day at work involves communicating with customer's and co-workers. Customer communication consitits of helping the customer to find the items that they are looking for, and if we don't have it to locate another location that does. Communication with co-workers involves relaying messages about what has happened during my shift, if a project was not completed what is left to be done. The hardest part of my job is the transitions made between the holiday display's. The most enjoyable part of my job is the interaction I get with the customer's both the regular customer's and the ones just stopping in on thier way out of town."
good,"Walgreens felt like a family-run corner store when I started. The people were great, and the management was not only encouraging but helpful when I needed it. It is because of this forth-coming nature that I was able to learn the ins and outs of store operations and take a promotion in less than a year. There are new people at the top now, and the culture has changed since I left so I can't comment as to where it's at currently. It was a good place to work while I was there."
good,"a typical day at walgreens is very dull and stressful. I've leaned that retail is not where i need to be because my personality and skills are better. Some managers are good workers and as for others, they are very lazy and rely all the work on the fellow staff besides working as a team to get some objectives done. i love my co-workers and they are a joy to work with. really isn't a hard job and there's no enjoyment"
good,My most enjoyable part of working here was the customers. I got a joy out of helping others and seeing a smile on their faces that I helped come out.
good,"The job could be very stressful, its alot to do especially in retail."
good,"Great Place to work an the pay was also good , Great Company to work for."
good,"I like my job because the work environment is very comfortable, my co workers are fun to be around, the manager's are understanding, and do their best to help you understand why your service is important to the company. The most difficult part of my job is having to deal with the cranky customers even if it is not your fault they can still have a negative disposition towards you. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping people get what they need and to have them come back and say, ""This young lady was a big help"". A typical day at Wal Greens is based off what shift you work if you work in the morning you will make sure manager's choice is filled with the proper items you will turn on the photo machines make sure they have the right amount of water and other chemicals to keep it functioning then you'll eventually get customers; at night you just assist the customers with their photo purchase and when it is time to close you shut the machines down properly clean the photo area and help assist your co workers with the rest of the store."
good,you have to think quick on your feet. understand what your doing and love to enter act with customer services
good,"I learned to fill and count prescriptions,enter in patient contact information and insurance information,assist customers with any questions or concerns ,translate prescriptions. These responsibilites would be performed daily. Had a great relationship with co-workers and Pharmacy management. Hardest part of the job was learning the different parts of the computer system because of the many different ways of doing the same thing. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers and staff."
good,"Maintaining the photo machines, cleaning my photo department, assisting my customers, doing assignments given by mangers. I learned how to do monthly inventory on the photos that have been processed, ordering for my department, clearance items using the as400, printing signs for the store (pricing). My mangers were laid back, helped on the sales floor and anytime I had a rush in photo.The hardest part of the job was running out of time to do certain projects I like to have my list done by the end of the day. Assisting four or five customers at a time was a little challenging, but I am always ready for the challenge. What I enjoyed most about the job was having a family outside of my family, I enjoyed having fun with everyone and helping those who wanted help."
good,"i had good friends who worked there, its was more like a family feels."
good,"Pay was good, hours were okay, management had its flaws but otherwise good. Would have to straighten three aisles and dust the front. So not much to do to keep busy"
good,"Great co-workers, very stressful work conditions. have some areas that are hard to deal with. great store management not so great uppermanagement"
good,"I learned quite a bit working for Walgreens. I started my day doing cash reports for the previous day. I wrote notes for the employees that needed to be done that day. I hired, fired, disciplined, praised and trained my employees. I loved going to work everyday and greeting my customers and pharmacy patients, I have a PTCB Certificate which allowed me to fill prescriptions and help in the pharmacy."
good,Local drug store that is right in the heart of the community.
good,I personally like working there the people are overall nice just wish they paid more.
good,"I enjoy working for Walgreens. Management is very nice and as helpful as they can be. The customers are wonderful, they enjoy talking with you and become regulars. On a normal work day, I clock in and check with head photo to see whats needs to be done. I process any films, clean up and take more orders. I also do floor work as well. Helping with set ups and preparing for the different holidays and seasons. My co-workers make working very fun."
good,"Walgreen is a great compant to work for, however, they want 105 % every day."
good,Customers can be very rude
good,"Great company to work for with plenty of room for advancement. Benefits were above market average. Management style was different, and lacking, in certain regions of the nation but that is the same for all companies."
good,The store i worked for was wonderful but the demand to do more with less was overwhelming. pharmacy and store management was great together and the customers were like family most you saw everyday and knew. the brief coworkers i had were great and my pharmacy manager always treated everyone like we were a team which was very rare.But as the demand grew the amount of help lessened and it left everyone drained and exhausted.
good,Loved working in retail setting however the pay was not enough.My management was great and I also loved my patients and co workers.
good,"Truely,"
good,i enjoyed my job at walgreens. i did my job to the best of my ability and beyond. i feel i was let go on unfair grounds.
good,I worked in the pharmacy and it was stressful. But the people there made me love it and I am now very good friends with one of the employees there after 4 years later.
good,"Once you work there for a couple of months, a typical day at work is pretty routine. You have to do daily tasks such as keep the shelves stocked and still help customers out at the same time. You rarely learn something new"
good,"I started working with this company June 14, 1999, in Deerfield Beach, Florida. As my mother's health declined, I made the choice to move back here to Virginia to be closer to her. Unfortunately, I had to drive for 8 months (without mileage pay) to the next city of Roanoke while the store in Lynchburg was being built. Once the store in Lynchburg was finished then I transfered."
good,"This is a great company to work for lots of helpful people, Great envirement, Pay could be better, managment outstanding to work for."
good,"Lots of hard work, mainly a job to pay the bills. Was able to use my college degree some on the safety action team."
good,The management team is great the employees are good. Everyone helps each other out and everyday is a different experience. The hardest part of the job is probably truck day because a lot of inventory comes in and there's a lot of heavy lifting that needs to be done. The most enjoyable part of the job is the environment. It's a teamwork environment.
good,"Customers would come in and ask about asesthetics like how to apply it, colors to match skin tone, how often should they change it out, etc. I learned a lot in this area. Management was always there to help. Co-workers made it a great job. The hardest part of the job was remembering where everything was, because it changed a lot with the different seasons, but that was also the most enjoyable."
good,advising make up products by showing the product and handing out samples.
good,"greet customers, help them find some thing communication skills, organization skills"
good,Great place to work in a great location. The staff was great. my favorite part of working there was the facing and restocking bays
good,Very good experience for those who are first time job holders. A typical work day would be to pack out and stock my aisles count my products and put up displays. Change out sale prices and advertisements. Reset the aisles when needed.I learned the ups and downs of retail and what it consist of. Management and co-workers were good to work with you had your down days but that's with every job. There were no hard parts once I was trained for everything. The most enjoyable part was being in charge of my own section.
good,"Ability to make my own schedule, Love teaching aspect, and continuity of care."
good,Great company to work for especially if it is your very first job. teaches you how to give great customer service!
good,many days when i came to work i had to immediately get busy because a lot of times some employees were late and the work was building up but it was nothing too hard to handle. i learned how to be more productive especially working here where i had to deal with all range of customers and customer conflict which helped with my customer service experience. work days with my co-workers were typical but there was some complications i had with a couple of them. there wasn't anything really hard about the job it was pretty much a breeze. the most enjoyable part of the job was that i got to interact with different types of people.
good,"When I walked into Walgreens for work, I see regulars, and new people who might recognize me as an employee and ask me any store-related question.This particular location is fast-paced, so sometimes it can be a bit frustrating if you do not know what you're doing. We would always help each other when needed, and get along very well with customers, as well as each other."
good,A typical day at work was very laid back. The interaction with the patients was the best part of the day. The hardest part of the job was first starting and learning the operations of the store.
good,"Fast paced enviroment, Constantly learning new things, My job always keeps me on my toes and leaves me with a feeling of accomplishment at the end of the day."
good,Most of the stores I worked in were managed well. The upper management was pretty good about making sure managers who didn't pull their weight were removed. The only issue I had was the loss prevention guy and the store manager would act as a hr department. Very ineffective.
good,"-Most days are unpredictable, but it keeps things interesting"
good,It was a good job at the time but needed a different time schedule due to having a newborn and there was no position available so they let me go
good,Greet and Check- out customers
good,"Walgreens is the company that gave me opportunity to grow and learn to make me what I am. I graduated from Woodland High School. I decided to find a full time job and take classes at Woodland Community College as I was still settling down in the United States after immigrating 2 years ago. Few years later, I decided to go to DeVry University to obtain my Bachelors' in Accounting. Walgreens let me make my own schedule to go full time college 30 miles away from my town. After I graduated, I applied for SAIL coordinator assistant/MPB position and I was selected. I would not forget that what walgreens means to me. However, I like to go move into my next level of progress and work as an Accountant."
good,"Come into work clock in go over daily tasks that need to be completed for the day. On truck or smartfill day stock shelves, multitask by still maintaining sales and completing tasks. I learned how to really up sale at this job and learned lots of things about skincare, haircare, and makeup products. My store manager was great and was always ready to teach me new things. The hardest part of this job was making sure you met your sales goal and finshed all assigned tasks. What I loved about Walgreens the most was everyday I got to connect with people and help them I always got compliments for going the extra mile for them and it was very rewarding for me."
good,A typical day at Walgreens is just busy. I liked this job & helping the customer was always good.
good,The best part of the job is when we did things for the community. The co-workers were great and I learned a lot from working here.
good,"I feel the company's mission is important to them, they strive to give the customers services not found at all pharmacy locations, BP checks, Diabetic checks, and Flu shots. We feel the customer is very important and their shopping trip should be easy for them with having a one-stop-shop."
good,"Productive workplace, there is a family atmosphere, the growth opportunities are becoming very limited."
good,I manage anywhere from 4-8 employees and am responsible for just about every aspect of the store.
good,"I love my job because you are always learning new things everyday, you also get to meet amazing people too. I do a lot of data entry and customer service. I work with a good group of people, they are very hard workers. The hardest part of my job is my hours. I am a single mother of 1 and with my job i have various hours which range from 8am to 10 pm. The most enjoyable part is learning new things and seeing friendly faces everyday."
good,"I love working at Walgreen's store in Oxford, MS. Hoping to apply"
good,I enjoyed this employer very much but there was just to much gossip and cliques and thats not the type of environment I wanted to work in.
good,"I liked working at Walgreens. My supervisor was great! I liked my schedual, and most of the customers that I would deal with were friendly regular customers. The pay was not as good as it should have been, but retail workers are very under-paid in general anyway. Also, when I told them that I had to resign due to the fact that I was moving, I told them that I would like to be transferred to a Walgreens store in the new city I was moving to. They said they would do that for me, but they never did. Overall, it was a good place to work."
good,Walgreens is a fun place to work for. The benefits are pretty good. The environment is also good. The people I work with make it that way. We always work as a team which makes are job easy and fun at the same time.
good,A typical day at work would included addressing customer concerns and issues in a timely and courteous manner. This job also involved stocking products on shelves and aisles.
good,"during my work history at Walgreens I was always treated with respect by the shift leads and the store manager however, the assistant store manager sometimes would ignore the pages we would send out over the PA and sometimes if we called them for help, they would call us at the register to see what we need help with before they come out."
good,I enjoyed working here lashell the manger is really nice and professional they give good hours and just a nice work environment great area nice customers
good,"Great company to work for , they offer good benefits, health insurance and you’ll have chances to work in different locations. ! Great opportunities to grow and develop."
good,"I enjoyed working with and helping people.  Interacting with managers and employees coming into the area office for training or picking up supplies needed for job fairs or community events.  Answering phone calls to assist customers looking for products, helping them locate the closest location for their needs.  Helping employees navigate the HR portal to find the answers they needed concerning leave, payroll, etc."
good,"Walgreens was a great company to work for, I learned a lot during my 15 years working there. I started working there as a stacker, to photo specialist to Assistant Manager."
good,"Management is great and hours are very flexible. I enjoyed working here and helping customers on a daily basis. Walgreens helps the community and gives back which I love. can get boring but overall, I recommend this job."
good,At least I learn that I can carry more than 30lbs. That employees are really nice with you and a maneuver too. They al very support by telling you that you getting better.
good,Enjoyed working. Learned a lot working in retail. Benefits and Vacation were good. Worked with some great co-workers and management. Hours were felxible being it was a 24 hour store.
good,"It all depends on the store. My store was fun, cool co workers and managers. But as years went on, it gets repetitive and boring. Not a bad job, but will get tiring"
good,"Had great relationship with colleagues. Management were flexible when assigning tasks. Most enjoyable: great colleagues Hardest part: rude people. No time for boredom. Always busy with many things to do. Had a great relationship with regular customers. Would tell me how they appreciated me being kind and happy, always smiling. That always made my day. Was also the reason why I enjoyed giving 110% to the store and the customers. I loved making them happy."
good,"While working at Walgreens, I was able to have fun and be very productive at the same time. My superiors weren't too demanding or hard to work with. They simply wanted us to be as productive as we possibly could be. With that attitude towards us, we were able to come into work and feel appreciated and actually want to come to work and not feel like we ""had"" to come to work."
good,"Great Job it pay well"
good,"For this I volunteer  it was after my school, I want not paid for anything because I was only volunteering. The program is called Vtap; while volunteering here I love it because they help me get better and on my goal. This program is for student to learn how to work and make goal out of it, I really did wish they hired me but they have said they were full and had no hours left for me. However it’s  was a great job to volunteer."
good,Very welcoming. At times can be hectic but other than that it was the best job i could have ever gotten. Helped me go up in the company and also helped me go to school for pharmacy technician.
good,"This company works to encourage job advancement for employees, and the driven employee will find many opportunities for promotions and movement in the company."
good,"Really great place to work for a first time (student) position. Pay is a little over minimum wage, however, be sure to negotiate pay during interview process!! Walgreens offers decent healthcare coverage but other options may be more suitable depending on your wages. The beauty of the Beauty Consultant position is that your department works independently of the stores sales floor. Weekly meetings with the store manager are extremely important to go over goals and to discuss any issues (areas of improvement). My SM was great at addressing whatever concerns that I may have had.  If you establish a great relationship with your customers then they will be sure to return to you every single time. Just remember to smile and inform them of the satisfaction surveys!!!"
good,Great Company! Very Innovative and a leader in the industry. The company strives to improve on the delivering quality product on time to it's valued customer.
good,"Company respects their employees well, and teaches them something new every day. Build one-on-one connections with their employees to create a friendly environment."
good,"Customers treat me horribly, all of my coworkers act like highschoolers, sharing peoples personal information, spreading rumors, and created drama every day. I am currently looking to find a new job so that I can quit."
good,As far as a job with opportunity this  was it! you could start out as a half- Witt cashier and come out a Pharmacist. Walgreens would help you get into the programs give you the schedule you needed. even study your flash cards with you i worked at 4 locations all with the same hope to see each other grow as the last
good,"All in all a pretty good company to work for, terrific benefits and decent pay. Personal departure due to location grievances but the company it great."
good,"A good starter job for the most part. The pay should be much more competitive for the workload and responsibilities that are required. Also need more holidays off, because everyone loves to be with their family during the holidays."
good,"I love the people i work with, it's like a huge family. They genuinely care about me outside my work! They always prioritize customers and make sure they are able to gain what they need no matter what!"
good,I worked here for 5 years. 95% of the people I worked with over the years were awesome and we had a great team of managers. I left because I was getting burned out and it was time for a change
good,"Great place to work for a first time job. Managers were amazing and they made my transition from Rite Aid so much easier. Also, co workers helped everyone out if they needed something"
good,Walgreens distribution is a good place to work. It is fast paced but the pay is fair to accommodate the work that you do.  it does get repetitive but even so it's one of the better jobs around this area.
good,"Once again, my time at Walgreens was an internship that was apart of my Pharmacy Technician Program. "
good,"A typical day could be doing a variety of tasks, cashier, stocking shelves, cleaning, computer based training, unloading trucks, working in pharmacy, setting shelves for various holidays/seasons, repricing/sale tags for products, assisting customers in locating desired products"
good,Very diverse and pretty relaxed to work at. No one rushes you but during the holiday season it does get very busy. There are normally many employees who work those days to help assist the customers.
good,I enjoyed working at Walgreens because I liked helping customers find what they need. I like putting merchandise up. And just love the atmosphere around me both in customers and employees.
good,"Great company to work for, stable environment. Employees get variety of opportunities for work on different projects. Training and further education opportunities are available. Great benefits."
good,"This Walgreens I worked at had lots of people coming in since it was a busy area. I would get yelled at sometimes, people would steal, and it was always busy and crazy."
good,"Walgreens gives you ample opportunities to advance and grow if you choose to do that, they are very open to diversify and give chances to those who want to continue"
good,It's a hard place to work for its very demanding you have to be tough and are able to work hard but overall it's a good rewarding job. This job is not for the weak and lazy.
good,"Walgreens was a good place to work for a second job, pay was not that good should be at least $10+ an hour. But overall a good company to work for. Most of these companies still pay wages that minimum wage almost 15 years ago. Cost of living in Pinellas Park Florida is high and wages are lower than what is needed for cost of living."
good,I started school while working at walgreens and their scheduling changed and it made it impossible to work what they needed me to and go to school. I would go back after i graduate if needed.
good,"innovative company. Also allowed me as a student to work at different stores, one specialized in fertility drugs another HIV and my favorite stores were ones that made specialty prescription,medications by compounding."
good,Walgreens is a fun work place but once the work is done there is little to do. Other workers are kind and very helpful if needed assistance. i recommend this job for others are looking for a part time job
good,"Liked the job, we stay busy and busy is good. Don't get me wrong, working retail pharmacy is a stressful job but my workplace had a decent team that formed a fairly cohesive unit that got each other through the rougher patches."
good,Good work environment and great working with customers. The management is pretty good the only problem is it is a big corporation and they hire more part time employees then full-time so they don't have to offer the benifets.
good,This company does it's best to take care of its employees. Sometimes you get a bad manager or maybe some bad coworkers but the company as a whole try to make this a great place to work.
good,When I first joined Walgreens I started as a photo specialist and after a couple of years I was promoted to assistant manager.I was able to work these full time positions while working toward my undergraduate degree.
good,I was 17 and couldn’t get a job due to lack of experience. But I got in through a job center that only gave me a couple hours for experience. Loved working here and co workers were nice.
good,"The walgreens I work for is paced at a perfect speed for those who like to keep busy. Work is very hands on, customers are quick to get irate but management is very well."
good,"Overall, Walgreens is a great place to work. There are a lot of opportunities for advancement because they prefer to hire within. You could be a shift lead within the first year of employment if you don't mind switching stores. They also pay for pharmacy training, so if you're looking to move into that field this is a great way to get started. However, it is a retail job with long holiday hours, they are open until midnight on Christmas Eve and someone has to be there."
good,Wonderful management team all the way up to corporate. Management actually cares about employees.  Your voice is heard as a regular employee. Decent benefits with affordable insurance.
good,"mandatory stretching, picking, packing and shipping of online orders.management appreciated employee participation and feed back.hardest part of the job could be the required lifting weight."
good,"The workplace was very organized with onset goals and achieving success. I loved working for the company but because of my own personal endeavors to move on with college dreams, in my bachelors degree it was time to leave."
good,"Depending on the store manager, Walgreens provides a comfortable, team-oriented work culture centered on outstanding customer service. Its one-stop-shop philosophy demands attention to detail and policies/procedures, flexibility, and openness to continuous learning. The Customer Service Associate job is not easy, but it can be very rewarding."
good,Good company to work for with many benefit offers and incentives but some of the employees are not team players or have been there so long they are way too comfortable in their position and lack many qualities of a good employee.
good,Its not the people who work there...its some of the people who shop there. They treat you very poorly and when youve been mean to you start to believe your worth less then people who dont work there.
good,It was a great experience. I enjoyed working there. Everyone was friendly and very informative when training is in process. There was always smiling faces.
good,Discount was pretty nice. I was a beauty adviser before they got rid of that position. Everyone was very professional and nice. Corporate was also very pleasant.
good,"Fellow employees were always very patient and kind and attempted to help newer recruits learn easier. However at the time of my employment there was a bit of of crazy going on with management,"
good,It was an ok job. Flexible  schedule fun work environment nice location mostly friend customers paid time off management was good coworkers were nice.
good,"I loved working at Walgreens, I got along with everyone most of the time. I was promoted which felt great. The managers for the most part tried to keep everyone happy."
good,"Flexible, hardwork, stressful, customer service, low pay. Manager was friendly but stressed all the time. Employees weren't happy. There was a lot of standing with little breaks."
good,"The only things I hate are the cameras in the trucks and trucks don’t go more than 63 mph. Other than that this is a pretty laid back place. The job is easy but if you peddle stores, it can get really hot during summer months. If you are lucky enough to bid on a relay route it’s just driving and switching trailers with another driver. You may be asked to layover every now and then but it’s no big deal, they pay for the hotel and once your ten hour break is up you can leave."
good,It's a descent retail job that heavily encourages teamwork in order to get through the day. A very family-friendly atmosphere where everyone is doing their part to make customers feel welcome. You're always encourages to be the best that you can be and look out for your community and in turn the community you serve appreciates your hard work.
good,"I love my job at Walgreens.  Good company to work for with great benefits.  Management is easy to work with, appreciates my input.  Great quarterly training events with gratis.  I get to cultivate relationships with my customers.  The only downside would be when the store is slow there is not a lot to do.  I spend that downtime cleaning and educating myself on new products and techniques."
good,"A typical day at work . Wake up every morning and hesitate getting up and going to work, arrive there and real instantly feel welcomed and happy I got up. Customers awesome 👍. I really enjoyed this company."
good,They engage with the team members and give them a voice that can be heard and they treat people with respect like they matter and not just another body or number.
good,The new environment of this particular store is on the West side of  Town and at first I was very unfamiliar with its challenges.and some Safety issues.. I feel my co-workers are friendly and helpful as I am a Senior worker...the hardest part of the job is at the End of shift Clean-up and mopping of floors...
good,Hardest part of the job I would say is dealing with insurance company . I learned how to be patience and do multiple things at one time. I love to pace of the job you always moving around.
good,"Overall atmosphere has been good, great development opportunities with the right leadership, but the company itself is frustrating at times. Maybe it's just retail or customer service as a whole, but the atmosphere of just give the customer anything they want even when they're wrong can be hard. Sometimes it seems like there could be more training on in store promotions or troubleshooting particularly with the app. Aside from those issues, the pay is fairly competitive for the position and as a shift lead I am guaranteed full time hours. Yearly raises, but generally not much. Assistant managers seem to be worked harder than Store Managers most times and aren't rewarded or compensated enough."
good,"From the moment you start to the time you leave it is non stop.  Manager is great .  Hardest thing about job is making sure to keep you composure when customers are being belligerent and totally unreasonable. "
good,Loved working for Walgreens the only issue was that I was injured on the job and Walgreens tried to tell me that it was my fault originally and that they weren't going to cover anything. I thought that was ridiculous that the fire extinguisher that y'all had just hung on a metal pole not in a case or properly inspected that I bumped while closing the store and doing my go backs my shoulder hit it and the fire extinguisher fell on my foot and broke my toe in 3 places..oh ya I wanted to permanently impair myself because I had to have surgery to somewhat save my toes. I can't ever run ever again. Had a boot on for 6 weeks and had Walgreens picking the worst doctor in all of Texas. Who gives their patient tramadol for the pain from surgery and tells them that they are only experiencing phantom pains. I should have sued but I honestly wasn't prepared for that plus I genuinely loved my customers my patients and coworkers
good,"All the employees in the pharmacy that I went to extern in for school were so welcoming and helpful. It's a stressful environment, yes, but I love working in the medical field and if you're trying to work in a retail area for Pharmacy Technicians this is the place to do it."
good,I enjoyed working at Walgreens. The support staff was amazing and friendly. They did not make non management employees feel less. Schedules were posted at least 2 weeks in advance. We celebrated different achievements or holidays
good,I enjoy working here. My managers and coworkers are the absolute best. Worst part of working with Walgreens is occasional rude customers but I'd recommend Walgreens to anyone.
good,"Working at Walgreen's helps you build your skills for successfully handling customer service. Although, if you are a customer sales associate your schedule is very overwhelming. There is definitely favoritism involved."
good,"Flexible hours, you are able to get discounts mangers are understanding. It’s busy so your hrs go by fast. As well you can communicate well with your mangers but Doctors note for sick days add up to one call out"
good,overall a great place to work. to start a career in pharmacy Walgreens was a great stepping stone to learn all about all the different kinds of medications and what they are used for .
good,Great job to advance up great team motivation and sometimes gives you the opportunity to make decisions for the team there is once a week meeting Walgreens does keep losing hours
good,Walgreens provided a huge growth opportunity for many years.   Growth has stopped and opportunities have changed.  The expectation now is to get the most out of less.  Our budgets have gone way down and it is hard to accomplish all required tasks.
good,"A typical day at work for me would include the following.. Coming to work signing on to Work flow, Making sure customers are satisfied, stocking and Filling medications, Billing insurance, Receiving and Placing calls to Doctors offices and insurance companies to insures our customer are satisfied and handled with the highest level of care."
good,"Good corporation to work for entry level or management positions. If motivated and focused, opportunities for advancement are available. Company culture, interactions, and communications if management in store practice good ethics and conduct. How the above information applies to applicant, depends on store management personnel."
good,Worked for the company since 1995 to 2014. It is easy to be very loyal to a company that caters to your work needs. Good customer service was my number one priority which in turn benefited healthy and happy customers.
good,I learned how to be a good pharmacist and what is the exact work as a community pharmacist. the experience acquired working in walgreens would help me for the rest of my career.
good,I was employed on a part time basis during the summer break. It was my first job and found it interesting to learn about the retail business. I stocked and maintained the shelves as my primary job at Walgreens.
good,"I worked with the company for 11 years before the portion I worked for was sold off. They are an old company that has a lot of history. Sometimes that makes things slow to change. There also can be a lot of politics involved. That being said, they are good."
good,The people were super nice and chill. Overall great experience. The managers were very nice. The work load was alright. Very fast paced and busy but overall good
good,"Work at Walgreen's at times was hectic due to alot of customers. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and the Manager's were strict, but fair. I could always approach them if I have a question. They were also flexible with my school schedule. I was referred to them through an SYEP program for the Fall to Winter.The hardest part of the job was the stock and me learning where everything was in the store. I learned how to be patient with the customers, to respect what the manager tells me and help anyone when necessary."
good,"busy workplace but i learned a lot which helped me further my career. i learned to multi task and about customer service."
good,Team members at this location try their best to share positive energy despite the hurdles that rise. Hours are typically flexible and the opportunity for promotions are easy to come by.
good,It's a great place to work if you like standing for long periods of time with sometimes nothing to do. You could be at the register one day and tagging the next or stocking.
good,"Wish I would have never left Walgreens. The people were great to work for. I enjoyed the entire staff, pharmacy and front end. Walgreens’s is definitely a great place to work!"
good,"This is not a job for the young. many of the employees are older, as well as upper level management who make the schedules. They are not understanding if a young person has a schedule of other activities. This workplace is for those who will make work their only priority."
good,"I love taking care of patients,  helping them get there medications. Contacting insurance companies for them an the people I work with have become my second family"
good,I like greeting the customer and helping them find the items they need i like stocking the shelf and putting out new merchandise and giving them good customer service
good,"This is a great starting job for pharmacy experience. I learned how to handle medications, talk to providers, and take inventory. However, I could not handle he pressure of the job long term. It was draining working in an environment where we where constantly being hammered by customers who didnt have health insurance or if their doctors wrote something incorrect. I have been threatened over opiods and long time I didnt think it was the best fit for me long term."
good,"My experience with Walgreens is that this job makes you feel like you are welcome into family, we really do help each other out. We definitely work as a team, this job gets chaotic due to pharmacy overflow of customers needs, but once that is once over its not that bad."
good,"But it was closed. I don't have much insight into the one that's still open. It's definitely bigger and they're open all night, but I never had to deal with that."
good,Assistant manager sucked tbh. He was messing around with another co worker who was allowed to do whatever she wanted. Lots of favoritism there. Co workers were okay and a-holes.
good,"The economics are only getting harder in retail.  The new age addage.  Do more with less,  and less, and less. "
good,"This company was amazing to work for, loved the training i got, great management, was trained to be a pharmacy tech from cashier. Flexible with school ."
good,A shift lead at Walgreens has a versatile day.  You handle everything from safe handling to receiving to merchandising and lets not forget about customer care.
good,"This job is not hard to do. As long as you are doing your part in keeping up with daily tasks, greeting and assisting customers it will be a breeze! The customers are the highlight of my day"
good,You have opportunities to advance but have to go through hoops to obtain them. It takes forever to see a increase in pay but the management team on the store level really helps along the way.
good,Offered me an opportunity to manage in 2 settings: retail and infusion. Fair schedule and decent technician hours although they are trimming hours from I hear. I feel they trained me well and gave me the tools to be successful. I was not happy overall with management in Infusion setting. Generally there were nurses managing Pharmacists which led to some questionable decisions and battle of wills. Management not focused on importance of customer service and how we built the business. Too concerned about a few bucks here and there at the sacrifice of patients. This is the reason I left the infusion setting. Overall though it was a learning experience and provided great clinical opportunities.
good,"I have learned to multitask and developed great interpersonal and customer service skills. The most rewarding part of the job is to be able to help others. The hardest part , is that working environment often time is very stressful  and with no break for lunch."
good,"Taught me everything that I needed to know. Paid for certification and license. High stress in retail pharmacy and only got worse with several merges of local pharmacies. Pay is really great for a tech with no experience as it paid way more than CVS or Walmart. Opportunity for growth is there but can't really go above certified, senior pharm tech. Good overall experience over the almost five years I worked there."
good,"good place to work but the manager was type man that ""told you what you wanted to hear"".....he struggled with being honest about promotion possibilities...due to him not wanting to hurt ones feelings. I was thinking for several months that the next available position was mine then was presented with the new assistant...no explanation to me. I only thought I was due one since he had promised so much. Otherwise, I am aware that no manager owes me a thing."
good,A typical day at work kept the employee busy. I learned to work well with others. The management was great. The workplace culture was competitive. It was pleasant to work at Walgreens.
good,I enjoy going above and beyond for the customers and helping them save money. I enjoy the interaction with coworkers and patients. My pharmacy manager is an amazing boss which makes working there even better. We all help each other out and work well together.
good,I love the fact that I can go to work and have the opportunity to raise money for charities. Customer Service is my number one priority. I love the team of employees at my Walgreens. Together we make a difference every day and to me that is what it's all about. That is what I am passionate about.
good,"I have been employed by Walgreens since 1997, when the Walgreens family still ran the company. There have been many changes since then to keep up with the ever changing times. Technology definitely upgraded with many software updates and along with these updates, were neverending training programs added into employee accounts. Its structured ideal for the workplace is expected from a large company but not necessarily attainable or user friendly. We were constantly adapting to daily multitasking and fitting in bathroom and lunch breaks here and there. It forced us to be efficient and hardworking, but the high stress of completing tasks according to upper management expectations without errors, made it hard to achieve with their tight budget. We often worked with little or no staff during various times of our shift. The timed task meter on our computer screen was unrealistic. The best way to get thru was to cultivate a good strong staff and work environment within each pharmacy unit. This bond allowed us to provide great customer service as we fulfilled our jobs."
good,Great summer job. I worked here during a time I was transitioning to college. Very professional work environment. Learned many things about good customer service.
good,"Walgreen was my first pharmacy job, while in school I had the opportunity to complete my internship time there and was hired later  on once my hours were complete."
good,"If you are a teenager or young adult, I have some advice for you: don't tie yourself down to a job if you don't enjoy it. Walgreens isn't a terrible place to work at: management is fairly helpful, and you have plenty of opportunities to work lots of hours. I've just realised that I don't like working in retail. But if retail is your thing, then I would definitely apply to Walgreens."
good,"Your quality of life at Walgreens is going to be largely dependent on the people you work with and your manager. Friendly people and a great manager, you will have a great time and advance. Stuck-up people and a mediocre manager, you will absolutely hate your job."
good,"Mgmt. tried to keep things exciting by having regular meetings and appreciating employees by having recognition of achievements."
good,"I worked here for many years and enjoyed every minute I had to leave because I had a child and had to devote for time to her. However, the other thing about Walgreens when you retire they don’t take care of the ones that devoted so many years to them."
good,"It all depends on the Manager you reporting to.  It can be a great place to work,  if you work for a great leader"
good,A typical work day at Walgreen's included the team members stocking shelves and assisting customers. I learned patience is a virtue and management helped out when needed. the hardest part of the job was dealing with the drunk public that comes with working on Fremont. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people from across the world.
good,Company looks after it's employees and works hard to be very progressive with current offerings.  Open floor plan helped engagement.  Pay is fair and bonus is a good perk.
good,"Store employees may have different experiences, but I worked in a separate (mail service) facility for over 10 years. Walgreens benefits are pretty good, salary is on the lower end. (Unless you're a pharmacist, then you easily get into 6 figures.)"
good,"Responsibility"
good,All I did was write scripts. Job was not too hard. Only hard part was deciphering the handwritten scripts. If you work fast with a keyboard this may be the job for you.
good,"Working at Walgreens has been very productive and a great experience. The people are friendly, the job is nice, however it’s not what I want to do with the rest of my life."
good,"Working at Walgreens was easy, over the course of two years Ive been told continuously to keep up the good work and I could be eligable to get into the pharmacy. Two years later after continuously asking I still never got it."
good,"Very stable company to work in. Relatively easy to transfer withing company. Job culture depends on how approachable store manager is,well,that is like everywhere where you working for a BOSS lol.  If good team members are leaving -usually means currently they have not too professional or  pleasant  store manager .But managers do change! So it is not forever.Team members are usually friendly and helpful. Pay is  minimum,raises are rare and insignificant. But i have been very lucky to work with very good team members-it makes all difference and worth working there. Usually we have loyal and nice customers who feel like a part of a family.."
good,"Walgreens provides a nice, quiet atmosphere for their employees to work at. They provide all of their employees with plenty of vacation time and paid vacation time. They even let me go shopping when I was on my lunch break!"
good,"Its a good place to work.  But it is retail so it has its retail problems, i.e. rude customers.  Management is good.  Holidays are busy.  Its even worst if youre closing because people just leave everything messy."
good,Working with Walgreens was an ideal job for a Pharmacy Technician just starting out. Teaches you and gives you hands on experience for the field of pharmacy.
good,Walgreens is a good company to work for. There is opportunity to move up in the company and has insurance benefits. Managers are very helpful with anything you need.
good,Worked there for what it seemed like quite a while. I worked with many fine people and enjoyed helping customers as well as making the store look presentable.
good,Great company values and customer service. Definitely ahead of other pharmacies when it comes to retail and customer service. Growth is difficult to achieve.
good,"I think walgreens are the best place who want to working with challange, dignity , carrierr build."
good,"i did all the inventory for the beauty department and i was a good job and i also did all the stocking in the department. i enjoy my co workers when i worked there, till today when i go in there my old coworkers give me hugs. The bad part of my job there was catching a thief in action its like you dont need to steal."
good,"Its a job pay is ok room for advancement if you can take pharmacy tech classes, Only benefits are health care, life insurance, and 401k. I use  to have more benefits but the company has taken them away over the years there."
good,"Team members are encouraged to champion for customers, collaborate with others and bring innovation."
good,"There is a lot of negativity at this particular location.  It seems to me most of the employees do what they have to, to keep their job.  There is a select few employees that go over and beyond their duties.  I personally like working at Walgreens but I am pretty good at tuning out the negative.  Life is too short to hate life, more individuals should feel blessed to have a job."
good,great work environment for part time students. I just did not get the hours I needed as a full time employee and did not want me to move up in the company.
good,"Walgreens was a good job for retail work at the time. The hours varied from days,night,weekends,holidays, yes even Christmas Day. The day envoled taking care of the store, manager of employees, setting product, stocking, helping in the pharmacy , all in all managing the store in all aspects from moping up spills to filling a perscription."
good,Learned quickly how to multitask. Management style varies from location to location. The technology is top notch. No other company can compete with it.
good,"Management was good, however there was a lot of change in management. The store was pretty busy and sometimes we wouldn't have the staff number we should have had which made it stressful. I loved the people I worked with as it made it enjoyable."
good,"I really enjoyed working for the company. They promoted patient care and seemed to care about employee well-being. I enjoyed working there for many years.  One district manager came in and changed the atmosphere for awhile in my district, however. She was vindictive, vicious, and divisive. For some reason she assumed most workers want to appear to be performing well, but were secretly covering up problem areas. She was determined to find them. If she was questioned, there would be consequences. Sadly, I left for this reason and there was even an attempt to sabotage me after I had given notice. It was unsuccessful because she was the only one willing to be underhanded and unprofessional in her circle.  Great companies can be tarnished by such foolish people.  No company can prevent all bad apples. The only thing you can do is get away from those apples."
good,"typical day is more relaxed "
good,"Throughout my 10 years with the company, I learned how to be more productive, leadership quality, and customer care. I would work primarily on the sales floor, photo department and unloading the weekly truck."
good,"Walgreens is not a bad company to work for especially because they offer good benefits and Paid Time Off (PTO). However, some customers can make it stressful and the flexible shifts really take a toll on the job work/life balance. Nothing is guaranteed with this company, but it is a means of income."
good,"I always worked at a store with a high volume and in a fast paced environment, there was great workflow organization, and the staff was usually great to get along with."
good,Working at Walgreen's was an easy paced job and not to complicated at all. My coworkers were very friendly and offered to help me out if I ever needed it.
good,Boots is changing the Walgreens culture and it is too bad. We are losing benefits as being full time employees. A lot of good team members are looking for other places of employment.
good,It’s a job. Co workers and customers were the reason why I stayed so long. The company has changed so much since the boots alliance merger. Corporate cuts hours and expects more work to get down. Raises are rare.
good,I do enjoy working at Walgreens.  I continued to work on a part-time basis when I accepted my full-time job at Weld County School District.  My manager is very flexible with my schedule.  I usually work truck day and help stock shelves.
good,Working at Walgreens was a positive experience. Management was supportive and encouraging. Coworkers worked together as a team. The only setback was the inconsistent hours which is pretty typical in retail.
good,I did split case pick and than went to receiving driving fork truck and clamp truck breaking down pallets and sorting items into appropriate place. we also covered shipping breaks
good,Originally was a company taking care of the people and team members being recognized for there work. Suddenly became primarily about the share holders leaving not only bad results for their company but their employees.
good,"Most everyone has been very nice and willing to help on learning their ways.  You don't have a set schedule it changes from week to week.  You can be scheduled from 7:00 am to 11:00 pm and they are open 24/7 365days so you will work holidays, weekends, etc."
good,"This company has great technology.  They were years ahead of the competition.  Management could be a little harsh.  If you are a christian, your beliefs may need to be left at the door."
good,"I loved working at this job but it was only for a short period of time. The customers were always sweet, my coworkers were cool. The management would actually help if there was an issue or teach you how to deal with the issue."
good,Working at Walgreens is very simple as long as you're under the right management. In my case I was managed by a shift lead that had the store managers ear and she was a very mean shift lead. She abused her power and was very bossy and tended to belittle me. I am glad I worked their because everything else was fair.
good,"Most enjoyable part of working in this establishment was the flexiable work hours, especially for me since I was a student at the time. The management during the night shift was outstanding and very charismatic making those shifts a joy to work in."
good,Working with orders is a pleasure for me. Help the customers around the store makes me feel great. I like to know that every customer is satisfied. When the customer is happy I am happy.
good,"Consulting at Walgreens through Cognizant. •	Work very closely with the merchants to determine what impact there is in the downstream process and determine the best course of action to implement the changes. This includes changes that flow down to the store and need extra manpower to correct.  Example is price changes and store counts."
good,"Difficult holiday seasons, but pay is good. Hours are consistent with full time, sometimes more. Good benefits. Company offers PTO. Structured management."
good,"Although most days working in the pharmacy were stressful, the people I worked with made my work better. the management team were very fun and friendly, yet professional when they needed to be."
good,"I only work with about three people that were there two years ago when I started. Walgreens has gone downhill a bit with their company policies and they like to mess with their employees. "
good,"A typical day is fast paced and  enjoyable . I learned to accommodate "
good,"Very quick paced, I really enjoyed this job. The problem was the pay was not enough for today's standard of living. I was only working part time and there were no full time positions available."
good,"Walgreens was by far my favorite job. I loved my coworkers, they were very helpful & nice. I loved going to work every day. It was always so laid back and peaceful, not too much drama."
good,Walgreen was a great place to work. my manager was great was good at professional development. Walgree's treated me well at the start of my career out of school
good,My job as a pharmacy technician at Walgreens was somewhat overwhelming at times. Our workflow was ahead of our coworkers therefore we always were rushing and had errors. I believe that it is a great place to work with enough help.
good,"Walgreens was my first job at 17 years of age and is still my current job over 5 years later. I was promoted to Pharmacy Technician status within 2 years working with company without prior relevant experience aside from in-store exposure and training. Therefore, if you are decent worker and follow protocols while trying your best to do the right thing, you will have an adequate chance of advancing in the company if desired. Management is subjective because every store has different people and they all have different styles of managing and have different personalities. You may click with some and not so well with others as any other job. Pay was low compared to competition retailers but was increased steadily and at a reasonable rate now. Structure of the company and how corporate runs their stores needs improvement as it can be very inefficient to work the way that they mandate. Wlagreens was a great place to start working but now that they are slowly ccutting away benefits, I would stay away until things are a little more clear."
good,"Working with Walgreens is very encouraging. The managers are very accommodating, understanding and flexible. They strive to make all employees as successful as possible and to be knowledgeable in every area. Walgreens has taught me to work consistently and not be tired at the end of the shift. The hardest part of the job is working on a busy day with a minimum amount of staff. The most enjoyable part of the job is working as a team and reaching goals."
good,The workplace is great. I love my co workers and my assistant manager along with my manager. However the pay for a pharmacy technician is not that much and i need better pay to stay a float.
good,Overall this a very calm and peaceful place to work at. The lunch breaks are normal 30 minutes and then two 15 minute breaks. My management team is great and very respectful.
good,its a good start up job that can provide leadership skills that can benefit down the road. i appreciated how its diverse my position was to really learn many skills while at the job.
good,"Company was known back then as Olsten Kimberly Home Health, management company for Columbia Home Health.   Assistant to VP overseeing 5 branch locations in home health field, building patient census, financial reports, payroll for locations."
good,"Walgreens is a very relaxed workplace. Everyone is treated like family and I would recommend the job to a friend. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers, but everything else about the job is easy to comprehend."
good,Throughout the work shift one would be assisting customers by either helping them locate an item or ringing up their items.  When a cashier was not busy they would straighten or stock products on shelves within visual sight of counter.
good,Overall a decent place to work-not very busy-you can get alot done-most of the employees are nice and you become friends-prices are good-dicsount is acceptable-breaks are not paid
good,With it being busy at Walgreens it makes the day go by so much faster . You don’t even realize that you’ve been working all day which is a good thing because you aren’t worried about what time you leave
good,"The typical workday was easy and calm. As a stock clerk, I learn to know which aisle has a certain type of products. Management was good for most of the time, and the only hard part of the job is to carry heavy boxes and making sure all products aren’t expired. The most enjoyable part of the job is doing maintenance and being able to help customers out."
good,I am not going to say anything negative about Walgreen's.  It was a great place to work. But however the management that was there was not an easy person for anyone to get along with and that particular location has had 5 managers since I was there.
good,"We had fun setting up displays and helping customers.  Cashiering, pharmacy, receiving truck and sending  items back, photo was really great to learn and process pictures."
good,This was a great place to work. I had guaranteed hours and was cross trained to work in the photo department relatively quick. Management was very professional.
good,"The Walgreen Company is an good place that operates as the second-home to a great work life balance in each United States based store. Trying to better wages and work hours is always a priority. It goes into filling prescriptions, health and wellness products with customers and managers sometimes getting antsy over human omissions like one person on five customers at once. Learning about ones self comes afterwards."
good,The staff at Walgreen's work together efficiently to make sure that the job is completed. All employees work together to provide good customer service.
good,I didn’t know just too much about leadership and what it means to lead until I came to Walgreens. I truly fell in love with taking care of customers while at the same time training new employees to be the future leaders that I inspire to be. The hardest part of working at Walgreens is having consistency in training and moving up through the company.
good,A typical day could be fast placed. Working with other employees is learning and getting to know them..like becoming a family. Stocking..building displays.
good,"Being a pharmacy technician is a lot of the same, but it really doesn't have to be that bad. If you come to work with a great attitude, it can be contagious to your peers and customers creating an actual fun environment to work in. There will not be any fun if you come in with a pessimistic attitude not ready to put time in to get to know your co workers."
good,"When I first started with Walgreens I went through a training process which prepared me to deal with customers and insurance companies, I was promoted to Lead Technician within the first 3 months of my employment with Walgreens, which allowed me to be a more integral part of running a pharmacy and be responsible for 4 other technicians that were under my supervision."
good,There are pros and cons to working here in several positions. One can learn many skill sets and enhance his/hers customer service skills. Time management is a big plus to work and improve on at Walgreens.
good,Walgreens is a productive place to work and my boss is very friendly..The benefits working is here is also amazing and we get 15 percent off every trandaction.
good,Awesome people and customers. Encouragement to be able to successfully move up within the company. I would recomend working with walgreens to others. Great benefits medical and investments.
good,This job was fine.  Customers were 90% hispanic which made it difficult to assist them but I taught myself basic words to help them.  It was one of the busiest Walgreens in the area.
good,I worked as a management intern at a store so the day was very fast-paced not knowing what each day was going to bring. Loved my manager and the culture! Having a varying work schedule can be a negative or positive depending on what you prefer.
good,"Healthcare is a stressful field to work in, but Walgreens provides healthy compensation, benefits, and job security. It can be hurtful when patients diminish the knowledge of a pharmacist and pharmacy intern, however, Walgreens teaches you tips and tricks to become a good healthcare provider, plus, they have extensive PPL training videos and guides for their employees to utilize as a resource!"
good,The work environment is good. Hours availability are not consistent as with any retail location. Promotion seems to be a little hard to attain. But overall good job especially for those first entering into the Tech field.
good,"My experience with them was great. I learned a lot as an intern, and acquired several network connections. The fellow employees were helpful and fun to work with. Supervisors were caring and committed to teaching me the ropes."
good,Walgreens as a company is a great company to work for. Some times its management team looses track of that. Overall a good work environment. I stared in cosmetics and moved into the pharmacy. Walgreens has a ptcb certification class that is awesome.
good,"its a job where you don't get to sit down, its a go go go job."
good,Great growth opportunities. Be ready to be busy all the time. This was a great experience for me. I have no issues with this company as a whole and they are great work environment.
good,I loved my job at walgreens. It didnt matter what store i was managing or working as technician it always felt like family. It was never hard to get up and go to work at walgreens.
good,"They did not want to work with my class schedule, and would schedule me to work during class. I would then have to find someone to switch shifts with. Management was often rude. Their training was lacking. The best part of the job was their pay. They do have decent benefits."
good,The hardest part of the job is doing resets until you get the hang of it. Also you have to remember to refer a customer to the pharmacist for any recommendations about their ailments. You must remember to card customers if they are purchasing alcohol or cold medicines that may have alcohol as an ingredient. The typical day at work is to attend an employee/ manager meeting or briefing. If you are the head cashier and are in charge of stocking the manager’s specials for that week it’s important to stay on top of that as well as asking customers to donate to whatever cause Walgreens is supporting that week or month.
good,"The employees themselves were the best part of the job. They give some benefits like teaching you on the job, giving you resources, and paying to get certified as a Pharmacy Technician but other than that, not great health or insurance benefits. The hardest part is that the people from corporate do not show that they rally care about their employees, they often cut our hours and demanded that higher goals be hit at the same time. Giving us more work and less time to get it done. I get that people want to save money but things like that are not the answer. It is a very positive environment though, the managers try to keep everyone in good spirits on a store level but corporate moves have alot of effects and not that much incentive."
good,"You need to know how to work a register as well as unload a truck and stock. Be willing to learn different departments, the more you are willing the learn the quicker you can move up with the company."
good,"You need to have patience with customers. You will have your regulars and they will treat you with respect. Others will give you a hard time. And other times, there will be thieves."
good,Walgreens is a slow paced work place and a very easy job to do. You will have a lot of regular customers that come in and they are very nice. Also the employees are easy to get along with
good,Can get very slow with little to do. Other times can be very fast moving depending on the volume of customers. Very little chances of overtime. Highly focused on healthcare and vaccines.
good,I personally loved working there. I haa a good experience and really nice/understanding managers. Its not hard or stressful. Easy job. Customers are very nice. I liked working as a team.
good,"Scheduling was consistent, same type of work cycle through the week. Regular check ins from managers and supervisors. Customer experience is the most important."
good,Nice place to work . It’s a lot of employees and a nice customers .i got a. Lot experience and learned a lot of new things .. help me to improved my english
good,"It is a nice to work, I had good frinds their and I learned a lot of neww things. "
good,"This company is a great place to work, I enjoyed my time there I unfortunately had to relocate where i was living, and could no longer make the comute"
good,"I worked for Walgreens for 8 years and it was the best decision I ever made. I held several positions throughout my time there and as far as retail jobs go, this is the best place to work. I loved my boss and the communication the team had. I learned a lot and it is partly due to my time there that helped me land my current job. Like retail though, there were the downsides of being open 365 days, we never shut down, so we had to work holidays and weekends. The job did offer benefits were actually pretty good, the 401K package was amazing! If you are in need of a retail job, I would highly suggest trying out Walgreens. I love them."
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work in the retail field. With the right leadership staff and cooperative crew, the team will be successful! They're very good about working with your schedule."
good,I was at one store so they cut hours and sent me to a different store I just think altogether they just did not like me so then came along this span ish manager he was the worst there was he did not like me tried every angle to get rid of me he cut my hours he was very rude he should be reported .it was awful.
good,Good company that generally takes care of it's team. Plenty of opportunities to grow and move up within. May have to travel until something close to you opens up.
good,"A typical day consist to basic things, starting out with checking out dates. to assistant customer through out the day. The best thing I think I learn at Walgreens is the vast different in people. I enjoy working with people and different attributes. Our working cultures is engagement, that goes for customer as well as employees. If you encourage employees to accept ownership in something, their more likely to enjoy working. The hardest part of my job, is to have leadership care as much as I do. The most enjoyable part, again is the people.  Weather its a new customer or a regular, that is in there 2-3 times a day. Of course, it's my employees, they make the day go faster. They know I'm always smiling, therefore it makes them smile."
good,"A good place to work if you have the right team, hours and motivation. The fast pace is what kept me going, I could not do slow pace stores. Other places may have more flexibility"
good,A fact paced retail environment. While employed at Walgreens I started as a Service Clerk and was able to advance to an Assistant Manager position within 3 years. This allowed me to understand business management at a higher level.
good,My first store manager and RXM had no issues if wore scrubs that were different colors as long as they were blue.  My second store manager noticed if they were even a little off.  I liked my job however there was no real standard as and the job title did not always reflect the duties that had to be performed.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Walgreen, my hours was on 3rd shift. I loved my Job,I thought that I was going to retired their, not enough security hours"
good,Definitely can be a high stress environment because it's working in customer service while also trying to deal with the medical industry. You are often the messenger in many issues with prescriptions or insurance. Thankfully management is really good of backing up their employees.
good,"Good company.  Went through a lot of changes, but seems to be stabilized now. Some areas invest in information technology innovation and some do not ."
good,Busy at time and stressful. Good management. Learn how to deal with people of all nationalities. Laid back environment. Most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. Hardest part was stocking.
good,"Working at Walgreens can be a little unbalanced at times. You never know what to expect from the moment you step through those doors, but overall it was an enjoyable experience."
good,"Walgreens was a nice work place, I had s set schedule and always knew when I had to work. The management was always nice and cared about their workers."
good,I love the company and I can’t see myself with another chain. I started with Walgreens in 2014 in North Carolina where I transitioned from a pharmacy technician to the Senior Tech.
good,"Walgreens was a good working experience being a full time student and having to travel two hours to get to school, moving up to become a manager was really something I thought I could handle but they are flexible with hours and understanding fun work place"
good,Worked in all stations of the Pharmacy. I loved working in the drive-thru due to busy and fast paced atmosphere. I worked with insurances as well to help patients receive best health care coverage.
good,"the job could be slow-paced or fast-paced sometimes. The customers were horrible at certain time of the day. Somedays we had a lot of warehouse work, and somedays we didn't."
good,"Learned the ins and outs of pharmacy from imaging prescriptions to insurance and  scheduling patients. Pretty laid back tight knit place to work, when I was there. Just needed more pay"
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with and the work I did. Customer service can be very taxing but the peopel I worked with made it much easier to be productive and meet customer needs.
good,"A typical day was to clock in on time, make sure your uniform was appropriate and to take breaks on time. I learned a lot since it was my first job, how to handle returns, front items & overall basic cashier work. The hardest part of the job was when the lines would get backed up or coupons didn't work correctly. I felt like I was valued and did receive a bonus and a higher position for great customer service."
good,"Find a manager who wants you to advance your career and things fall in line for you pretty fast as long as you are dedicated, positive, and take on challenges."
good,"I made a food wage here, plus the benefits we're good. The only issue was the schedule. It was suppose to be a few shifts of nights and a few shifts during the day. Well I ended up working all second shift for months and sometimes working 13 days straight without a day off."
good,Its all about the customer and the service you provide.   Walgreens is fair with their employees and customers.  They offer good bargains for the employees and customers.
good,I believe Walgreens is a great place for a first job. I watched employees come in with this being their first job and they love it because the pay was decent for a first job. Once you're eighteen you can become a pharmacy tech which will help you find a job in just about every city you end up moving to.
good,Walgreens is a great company if you like to have an opportunity to move up within the company! I received great help and encouragement from my managers.
good,"Despite the fact this facility was very chaotic due under employment,  I did enjoy working here. Working at Walgreens allowed me added experience and knowledge. ."
good,"Working at walgreens has been a wonderful experience. I love the team I work with on the daily, however the way management is promoted is discouraging. I did make it into a shifted position and trained hard to get into the ASMT position, but when openings came around the hired from outside the company.  hours are also getting cut and the expectations for the store and time are still set the same. with is stressful and unrealistic."
good,While working at Walgreens I have made a lot of friends in our employees and customers. Walgreens promotes keeping our patients and customers happy while working to ensure the employees are happy as well.
good,"Every shift I had worked, I never had an issue with management or my coworkers. I had done everything from cashier to work the photo center, stock shelves, help customers find what they need, and help with customers regarding Western Union."
good,"My job was mainly as a cashier, and overall it was fairly easy and laid back as the store was rarely busy.  The pay was fair for what I was expected to do, but there are few benefits for a part time position.  The manager's were friendly and accommodating, and the store itself had a fairly small staff."
good,"Company ran better than other chain retail pharmacies, but retail is retail. There is always much more work to than can keep up with. They seemed to do a better job with training staff and keeping help, which is more than I can say for the current company I work for..."
good,I learned how to manage my money and time. I also learned how to cope in a social environment and help customers with issues. the most enjoyable part or the job was talking and interacting with my fellow employees and discussing options to improve store life.
good,"Management was friendly, hours were flexible, only problem is when you are already scheduled and you realize too late that you need a day off, you'd need to find someone else to cover your shift otherwise you'd get written up for calling out. but that is what you'd see at any store."
good,"Greeting customer at the door, organizing the front end, having multiple tasks throughout the day, learned to manage time, work place was very diverse, hardest part would have to be inventory since you have to keep it updated each month, enjoyable would be getting the hands on experience within the store."
good,"Please see comments in other for reason I left the role. Good place to work, If your systems had been programmed to prevent employees from selling products requiring ID without the actual ID I would most certainly still be employed at my Walgreen's. Please consider embedding hard stops in your system to force the employee to check I.D. When the line is long and people are frustrated it is hard not to feel the pressure and move as quickly as possible with the aim of providing good customer service while maintaining quotas."
good,"The most enjoyable part about my job was the opportunity to work with customers. I liked helping them as they are the reason we are here. May times I would be leaving for the night, after my work day, and I would ask customers if they were needing help or if they were finding everything they need as I was walking out the store for the night. I never hesitated to stop and take care of them."
good,For teenagers walgreens is very average as far as first jobs go. It doesn't pay a ton but there is some room for advancement and most managers will work with you regarding what days you can work. It was easy enough and it was clean and I felt safe.
good,The location I worked at was very busy and fast paste. I worked the late shift most of the time and every weekend. I didn't have a personal life getting off at 12:30 AM
good,"It's a neighborhood store. This store is very productive and fun workplace with coworkers, shift leads & managers. It's an enjoyable working environment. Customers are nice. They also give us good feed back."
good,"Good clean environment for part time work, full time employment opportunity limited.  Corporate and management policy to maintain staff at alternate locations or reduced hours vs layoff is excellent.  "
good,"8 hour shifts with 30 Minute lunches and a 15 minute break"
good,"A typical day would include working the register most of your day. I learned to deal with all types of customers. You eventually move up to the photo or cosmetics department. My managers were real helpful in my growth. I learned something new almost every day. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the negative/unfriendly customers. But, working with a team is super fun and a great start up job."
good,management was great customers were kind and understanding. easy to work with coworkers. scheduling was very flexible but bi weekly pay was not the best method of paying employees
good,"Everyday you would clock in, go to the manager and be told what it is you are doing for the day. Mid shift take your break and the manager will check in from time to time to see how the work is going."
good,Afternoons and evenings were busier. I have learned to mult-task between several jobs given to me at once. I got along with all the co-workers. Managers tried to accommodate family life and would try and not schedule every weekend. Hardest part of the job was it was only for a short period of time due to Christmas help. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and being able to help them.
good,Task oriented
good,"As a cashier you are mostly by yourself and the only cashier, you will have small tasks to complete during the day as well as keeping up with the rush of customers. Pharmacy technicians have probably the most stressful job of keeping up with people's demands and battling with insurance and other obstacles. The photo department is a very fun position, yet very stressful during the holiday season."
good,Fast paced environment that is driven to serve customers. Enjoyable seeing regular customers and meeting new people. The most challenging part of the job during peak hours when it was very busy.
good,"Easy job overall, only issues arise when coworkers don't pull their weight and I had to pick up slack which got exhausting. Management was great and helpful. Not a fan of pushing so much for customers to do surveys but I enjoyed my time working for Walgreens."
good,Doesn't really matter what your job is you will end up doing pretty much everything in the store in all the departments. Good job if you can get promoted early otherwise the pay isn't great.
good,Walgreen's is pretty easy to work for and I really enjoy the managers that I have worked for. The job is pretty monotonous and gets very boring over the years. This is good for a temporary job that someone might want to make a little extra money for not a lot of hard work.
good,"In retail, 'busy day"" is always a typical day at work. I have learned how to manage time and resources in order to make the tasks done and make things possible. The hardest part is there is a shortage of staffs and still we need to work on those tasks that need to be accomplished. All in all, tasks are still manageable and I have fun doing it."
good,"I loved this job and the people I worked with.  I learned quite a lot about the retail industry.  All management was wonderful to work with. The thing I disliked the most was working nights, weekends and holidays. It was nice to work the different departments.  I started as a customer service representative then advanced to a pharmacy technician and the promoted to a store floor lead management position."
good,Had room to grow and advance career options. Was given chances to voice opinions about pharmacy and store operations openly. Had weekly meetings about pharmacy goals that made achieving them more practical and easier.
good,Bad working environment.  Long hours with poor benefits. Very stressfull work place.  I would never recommentd anyone to work her. Go somewhere elwe. j
good,"I worked at Walgreens all throughout high school and the managers were always so great about working with my schedule. Even after moving 4 hours away for college, my manager rehired me over summer and winter break if the store had enough hours in the budget."
good,Walgreens is a good place to work and you can move around in the different departments there. They will train to work in each department including the pharmacy if would like to learn.
good,The Walgreens that i worked at was a very busy store to where there was not enough help. With there not being enough help it makes the job very stressful and management staff didn't want to hire anyone.
good,Se debe evaluar el sueldo de los tecnicos de farmacia esa fue la razon por la cual despues de varios años renuncoe a la compañia
good,Good people..good customers. Everyday brings new people and opportunities Management are friendly and understanding. An over all good place to work. Good Environment.
good,"At Walgreens, since its not the size of Walmart or Target, you get to try almost every kind a job out there in retail. Depending on how busy the store is, you can be assigned as a cashier, photo specialist, stocker, and a customer service associate all at once. Yes, it seems stressful, but it's really not if you work smart.  I would say the hardest part of this job is interacting with customers that has little english or stubborn and the most enjoyable moment is when there isn't a lot of customer and all your task is done.  Also at Walgreens, even though I didn't work as management, I really got a glimpse of what running a business is really like."
good,"It's quickpaced you always gotta be doing something, but it's also fun cause you get to talk to alot of new people everyday. The managers are very well trained and know how to do their jobs effectively."
good,"A good opportunity to learn customer service skills, network, develop people skills and experience a collaborative workplace environment. Organized and well balanced company with the mission to provide excellent customer service and help teach other employees."
good,I learned a lot working for Walgreens and would suggest working there. There are many different positions that you have a chance to grow into if you put the work in.
good,"Walgreens was the first job I ever worked (other than babysitting). It allowed me to understand work ethic, and the environment was great. My co-workers were helpful, and we all worked as a team. Would recommend."
good,"Working with the public when you're handling their drugs and their money...well, 'nuff said. Can be stressful, especially when short-staffed during busy times of day. Corporate leadership keeps demanding more and more but giving us less to work with (i.e. budget for staffing). LOTS of information to learn, in my opinion it takes about a year to be fully trained and comfortable as a pharmacy technician back there."
good,"My experience at Walgreens was very positive for the most part. I originally needed any job since the company I originally was working at was bought out. I was able to advance quickly as performance is how promotions are based off rather than seniority. For most people, it's absolutely a great place to start and work up the ladder if the plan is management."
good,Company overall a decent company to work for. Work family balance not easily maintained. When in management work load is heavy and hours are long. Everyday is a different experience due fluctuating variables in the workforce.
good,"Decently quick-paced job, but pretty laid back. Generally they just like you to stay busy, they want you to always be doing something to improve the store. The employees and management are usually very helpful if you are unsure of something. Pay is pretty decent, but if you're a part time employee, it might be hard to live off of if you're on your own."
good,"All in all, a great job for a college-student or someone who doesn't have a lot of experience in working other jobs. Good management, not too stressful. Fun, and enjoyable"
good,I enjoyed working there very much. The drive was far for me and the hours could be a little crazy in the pharmacy. My manager there was helpful and tried to make sure I felt comfortable in my daily tasks.
good,What I loved about working here is the community outreach we did. The volunteering and help for many fundraising activities the community fairs we attended it was a blast.
good,"During my tenure with this company i learned quite a few new things.I learned how to prepare photos ,and operate a cash register .The management is quite different than what i'm accustomed to,with a shift lead,assistant manager ,then general manager .Too many bosses for my taste.Great company overall ."
good,fast paced and you get to have a lot of 1 on 1 conversations with your customers who are very appreciative great team members loved all my employees there
good,"This is an ok place to work. My managers are accommodating. I was not trained a lot, I was put out on the main cash register alone after only 1.5 hours of training. It’s pretty much learn as you go."
good,working in retail can be stressful but you enjoy giving great customer service then it won't be too bad. The pay for an ASMT isn't too bad. You do learn a lot  about managing a store and the daily operations of running it. hardest part of the job would be being the only manager on a really busy day. besides that the job is not bad. Great for young professionals who want to have a career in management. Career advancement is there for management people.
good,In my experience at Walgreens it is a quick-paced environment and work place with other great employees as well as floor managers. You are faced with a ton of customers on a busy day.
good,"Its a great company to work for, I mean its a really great company to work for. What makes the job a slight bit frustrating is the advancement opportunities. I've been working with the company for about 6yrs at the same positions. No offered advancement opportunities, I've even seen people come in to the company and work for about 2-3 months and get moved up immediately. So that's the only weak point working with Walgreens, I've felt that I've put in my time and deserve some type of recognition for it. It doesn't take a genius to perform the task of a store lead, and I've even found myself on many occasions doing the job of a store lead. However it's still a good company, I get a good feeling when helping others to get well."
good,If you want to have good team help and make friends through the way I think walgreens is one of the best ways to go. I feel like it helps you in so many ways but due to poor management I feel like it sometimes makes you feel suffocated.
good,"I've been working at Walgreens since my senior year of high school. They have worked with me on my ever changing schedule for school and make sure I'm able to get some hours in to make money."
good,"Great structure and support for stores"
good,In management I was moved around like other places but I kept getting moved farther and farther south from home the closing and openings were harder with the driving distance.  Everett to Kirkland.
good,It's a nice part-time job while in college. The hours are pretty flexible and it's a very easy job. The paid was okay for a small expense while you are in college. But i will not recommend this company for long-term career.
good,by far the easiest job ive gotten into but unfortunately theres a lot of shoplifter so you kind of put yourself on the front line. I was unfortunate enough to experience the crazy San francisco hoodrat that pulled gun.
good,"I had never seen a store manager help out at the pharmacy register, before working at Walgreens.  I loved working at Walgreens. Lots of support, nice, clean work environment."
good,Walgreens has downsized  Just the slow down in economy now a days  It is a very good place to work for   But 8 hours a week just isn't enough.   A lot of other employees work two  jobs.   Insurance companies have made their customers go with other pharmacy's.
good,Always busy and something new to learn everyday. Always room for advancement. Management was helpful when needed to step up and help out. Understanding that dealing with a sick customer is never easy but rewarding in the end.
good,good company to work for. recieved benefits after working there 3 months and it was very affordable. it is a really great place to work especially if you enjoy retail.
good,"Working in the pharmacy at Walgreen's is great. I've learned so many new new things and gotten experienced with dealing with patients, doctors, and insurance. Its a very fast paced and can be very stressful. We deal with unhappy customers all the time and sometimes they're very hard to talk to. Throughout my time at Walgreen's, I've learned to be more patient and not take things personally. Overall, I believe that working here, is a great way to gain experience."
good,Management were cooperative and supportive of staff members to provide appropriate care to patient. The workplace culture was professional and conducive for all members.
good,Walgreens provides pharmacy technician with a good environment to learn every day. The hardest part is to lead with customers and the most enjoyable is all the resources you have to do your job professional.
good,"Team supports through and wonderful co workers. We strive , inspired and winning together."
good,"beautiful work place, you feel like a family. management is awesome. I don't have to stand all day like retail. I have my own desk. you can see your friends everyday. it is fun place to be in. people are nice there. I learn new skills everyday with a good training."
good,It's a great place to start if you've never or barely have any experience in retail or customer service. The pay and benefits are not that great but at least it's something.
good,"The job was great in terms of compensation considering that I worked 30+ hours while an undergraduate, I expressed my concerns and the manager was able to be a bit more flexible for me to balance my work and school out well."
good,The management is great and the coworkers are always willing to help. The workflow is stead with enough help. The hardest part of the job is when we are short staffed.
good,"A typical work day is very busy because as a staff pharmacist sometimes if the pharmacy technician is running late the pharmacist will have to run the drive true register and fill prescription. That was before store managers were trained to be technicians  I guess with the days you are trained on the computer before working in the store, helps you get ready for challenges and emergency situations. Good benefits."
good,"its a pretty great job, it can be overwhelming and pretty stressful at times but the managers there are  great and really understanding most of the time, and if you wanna work and get hours definitely easy to come by"
good,The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers and trying to find a way to please them in a form that made them happy. The store is open 365 days a year so there were holidays that you had to work. Some days were long and boring but others were fast paced and flew by. The most enjoyable part was all of the different customers that came in and the relationships made with them and the other employees that worked for the company.
good,"Unfortunately Walgreens has cut so many hours for so many people and I am forced to leave nobody had over 32 hours at this point and it is unacceptable for me and everyone else when we have bills to pay. Pharmacy tech’s here are so u despair compared to CVS and Rite Aid. But the people are so wonderful, I will miss them all."
good,"- Competitive benefits and pay"
good,"It was a good experience working at Walgreens. Coming in I had a preconceived notion as to what community pharmacy was, but after working there and getting to know the pharmacists and other technicians, I was proved wrong. The first couple of months were hard as I was new and didn't know the procedure of what should be done step by step, but with time I gained knowledge and accuracy."
good,A typical day at work for me is averaging 200 plus calls to some very happy or upset customers. My manager assisted me on what she could and the work environment was fun. The only thing I dislike about the call center is the super strict reg emend and your life is on a timer.
good,"Walgreens pushes their technicians to get certified and ultimately become Senior Technicians.  My major issue with the company is the lack of hours for techs.  I left a full-time job (guaranteed 39 hours/week) to come here and although my hourly pay is better, I'm averaging less than 30 hours.  As an adult, I've never worked part-time and 30 hours or less per week is not enough to pay the bills.  My store has hired MORE pharmacy staff and doesn't even have enough hours to give the current techs (all who are 2+ years at the company) even close to 40 hours a week."
good,Very fast pace and requires you to multi-task. Hard work and not enough pay. The people you work with everyday makes your job a little easier. Good managers and work environment
good,"If you are looking for a career in Retail this is a good company to work for. Work life balance could be better though, so if you have a family think twice before applying. Assistants must be willing to travel to a store up to 50 miles from their home."
good,"loved my boss, great place to work, but not enough salary... Pharmacy Techs need a raise, dealing with the public is very rough & Techs are highly under appreciated"
good,Great employee engagement focused workplace that helps empower and develop its employee to the next level. While providing great customer service to its customers.
good,This working environment was very different. I was not familiar with this industry but Walgreens provided excellent training that last for two weeks. After training the company provided the opportunity of job shadowing. Great tool to use to lower the chance of mistake
good,Myexperience here was positive overall. They are a very quickpaced workplace with the intention of providing customers with most convenient shopping experience possible.
good,Everybody was friendly and had great customer service which was our top priority. I got constant positive feedback from shift leads and high management.
good,"If you're into retail or retail management, this is a great company to work for.  There are a lot of opportunities for advancement.  Fast paced and always kept me busy."
good,"Typical day at pharmacy = hard working till last minute"
good,This was my first job for over 15 years love working around the people if the build would not have closed down I would continue to be working there supervisors and managers was good to get along with
good,"I am very grateful to have been able to actually get into Walgreens but that was only because I knew someone who could get me in. All of the times I ever applied before, I got no response but my friend was able to get me in. I stopped working there because I had began to feel unfulfilled especially because I had been there so long."
good,"Hardest part was continuous rotating schedule, which was not known much in advance. Workplace culture is OK. Floating between stores was a challenge too"
good,"*Typical day at work consisted of filling a high volume of prescriptions and assisting patients and phoning physicians and insurances for verification."
good,When I started I had planned to retire from Walgreens. After 5 yrs they had restructured their management and those that had been Assistant Managers had to reapply for their jobs and take the title Shift Leader (SFL) which resulted in a pay cut of several dollars and a wage cap for each position.
good,its a okay job but will not be a job I want to work for my whole life with the company. walgreens is a place I like to challenge myself to see how far I can get through the company but paid rate is not so good. love to get to meet a whole butch of new people and personally get to know all your customers and employee like a family and friends.
good,"My overall experience working with Walgreens was great, the company as stated has excellent benefits, pto time, and a open door policy. I worked there for 17 years, management was a challenge because there was a different manager on board it seemed like once a year, (store managers and pharmacy managers)."
good,"Be careful of management, some say they will promise you promotions to get you motivated but then they promote someone from outside with no experience."
good,"Walgreens was an awesome company in my 25 years as an employee, Assistant Manager and Store Manager. I grew with the company, that provided training in all areas of management. I very much enjoyed working with various people in a wide range of demographically different stores. 90% of the employees I know are incredible people with good hearts and hard workers that take pride in their company."
good,"Walgreens is a good place to work, the manager gives your work sheet of chores do to every shift, which includes cashier, stocking and facing, the manager always make sure that customer service comes first."
good,"there is no slow passed days , the day goes by very fast with multiple task to do during the day, the pharmacy is always full it is agreat place to work in"
good,"Usually opened the store "
good,A very relaxed work place. They are not as many customers coming in and coming out so it is easy to track and also makes it slower paced. I guess that can also be translated as a negative thing as sometimes you can feel the hours go by.
good,"It is a retail job. You get exactly what you can expect from it. Odd hours, unstable work schedule, low pay, dealing with some very toxic people. People at my Walgreens were good, though I recommend this job only to the mentally sturdy. some very odd things happened to me working there."
good,"I started out as a part-time photo clerk. Within 9 months I was promoted to Assistant Manager. A yer and a half later, I was promoted to Executive Assistant Manager (salaried position). 6 months later I left to care for my elderly parents."
good,"heavy customer service during the seasons, Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving, school holidays.  In pharmacy constant and also during the winter months or new enrollment periods."
good,"Walgreens over all is a great company to work for. It can really vary store to store on how fun the atmosphere is. Some rule with iron fists and others are hard workers but make the job fun by joking around and getting to know each team member. Walgreens has good benefits, the down side is the pay of course."
good,"I loved working here but after awhile I had to upgrade to something better for my college major. The only bad thing is when your the manager tells you to create shelves or work on a project for some holiday coming up. Overall, great place to start off at."
good,"A typical work day can be sort of hectic, the manager of the pharmacy and the staff pharmacist are wonderful people, always help, and wouldn't ask you to do anything they wouldn't do! The hardest part of the job is dealing with costumers on a daily basis who want to drop everything you're doing to appease them. The most enjoyable part fellow co workers who help you out, and are just all around good people."
good,"The job was simple, most of the day consisted of standing behind the register. Outside of the register consisted of stocking/restocking products, taking in inventory, and writing orders for the shelves. My only problem involved a promotion that I was promised, yet was never given."
good,My work experience at Walgreens was good.  Enter acting with the customers was wonderful.  Management was great at the Store I worked.  Unfortunately I had to resign from the Company because I had to go and take care of my ailing father in New Orleans.
good,"It was hard work, But i've never had a culture where the managers got down and did the hard work with you. Its a retail job so don't expect the ""best"" job in the world but out of any others I'd go back to them."
good,"Great place to work. Challenging and fast paced. Also, company provides furthering of education in the pharmacy. Great staff and scheduling was flexible."
good,"the best thing is that they train you to become a registered pharmacy tech, management is good too, i love the environment, typing the prescriptions is a typical day at work, the hardest part is that you keep doing the same thing"
good,"I loved working for Walgreens.  Learned new things on a daily basis. Management wanted us to be robots., always telling us to say, thank you and be well, If we didn't, we would be told about it. Loved to learn to do end caps and resets. worked with a telzon. The hardest part of the job was, management would say one thing and assistant store manager would say something else. They were never on the same page."
good,"Can get very busy, but the setup and system is very efficient. Staffing is sufficient to get everything done in a timely manner. Overall a good experience."
good,My pharmacy team members and I worked together as a family and ALWAYS communicated. That is a big key role in pharmacy. I had great team members! The workplace energy was high and we always took care of the customers. Went above and beyond to help. Learning new things almost everyday! You can never learn too much!
good,"You will learn how to type quickly and efficiently, typical day of work includes typing prescriptions and sitting at a desk for 8+ hours a day, management really does care about how you are doing both on and off the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is the welcoming feeling of the team."
good,"It was a fast paced, stressful but rewarding place to work.  SOme pharmacies were understaffed, which resulted in having to multi-task more than a RPh should be doing."
good,I give walgreens an awesome review and i hope to be able to work there again. I had to leave due to the fact that since i have 4 children i could no longer work 3rd shift and at the time there were no transfers or day shifts available
good,"Enjoyed helping customers make there photo memories into paper, books, canvas,etc  hardest part is not having enough help when needed for example during holidays"
good,"Had a great manager and a good team for the most part.  I truly enjoyed every aspect of my job until they began rearranging titles, essentially forcing me to either accept new title/position, or be demoted and take a cut in pay.  As Shift Floor Lead, it became extremely stressful."
good,It was a good part time job while attending MACC. I enjoyed working with the public and I appreciated them working with my college schedule. I could do well at my job and study and do well in my classes too.
good,"Fast pace, Task oriented, goal oriented. Gained people skills. The most difficult part was splitting between the sales floor and pharmacy. Always enjoyed helping the customers and assisting employees."
good,"In my 9 years at Walgreens I have learned a lot and have enjoyed learning about the many aspects of pharmacy healthcare. However, my time at Walgreens is coming to an end as I am completing my bachelors in business with a minor in healthcare management."
good,"Working at Walgreens, your day can vary from working on the register all day to being out on the floor all day. Sometimes you can even float between placements depending on your shift hours."
good,I enjoyed working for this company it was a great experience for myself. I really learned alot of great idea's and customer service skills in the workplace.
good,"Good work environment.  Everyone was pretty friendly.  Management willing to work with you personally and professionally.  Narrow, cramped aisles can be difficult to work in."
good,"Productive workplace where customers come in to buy things that they need or want. Good customer service. It is important that customers come first. When the difficult ones come in, you do what is needed to try to make their visit a good one."
good,"Worked for the company for almost two years and found the work pleasant and the people were very fun, and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job is learning to trust your decisions regarding patient care in an autonomous setting."
good,This is a very active job and I enjoyed working here there where some days that was annoying because of the manager but I never really let it bother me.
good,"A typical day at work for Walgreens was being responsible for the day to day tasks that were assigned, managing the money in all registers as well as the safe, checking in all deliveries of merchandise shipped to the store from various companies, assisting employees with all forms of customer service and checking on employees regularly on the progress and production of their daily tasks. My experiences with Walgreens helped me learn how to interact with people as well as how to be firm but reasonable with the employees. The hardest parts of the job were dealing with management, finishing certain tasks on time and dealing with some of the employees."
good,I enjoyed working there while I was attending school. My coworkers were nice people but my team was always changing. I also enjoy the personal interaction with the wide variety of costumers that I interacted with.
good,"Conversing the customers, learning things about different people is interesting to me. It's really satisfying to have someone express delight in my customer service. I feel like I have a purpose."
good,"A good transition job while attending school, It allowed me the opportunity to gain experience in a retail setting. As I am completing my degree soon, I have decided to seek other employment."
good,"This company offered a lot of products and services to employees.  Also made employees feel engaged by providing training and a recognition program.  It was easy to work with other departments on projects, always formed good partnerships internally and externally.  Unfortunately with change, comes transformation which results in job elimination."
good,"a typical day at work for was interacting with the customers and co workers and doing my job being social and outgoing but then doing my work and do what needs to be done, hardest part of the job was just dealing with people who comes in and steal merchandise and then dealing with rude customers. But the most enjoyable was to make every customer I interacted with and made happy cause that what made me happy."
good,it was good for the time i was there. learned a lot from good managers able to pick my kids up great with being flexible with a lot of things. it was an ok place to work. need to pay more.
good,"Not a bad place to work. Culture is respectable. Sometimes corporate is rather unorganized and sloppy. Typical days depend on volume of store. Company claims to be customer service focused but constantly adds tasks rather than taking them away, leaving little time for customers."
good,"Management depends on location. Most Managers have been great and really concerned about helping you reach your goals. But if you get in a situation where the management doesn't live by the culture, it is hard to get out of the situation. Upper management doesn't always see the bigger picture and rely on lower management for feedback. Not open to addressing issues below their chain of direct reports."
good,Working at a store like this taught me the proper way to interact with customers. Being able to professionally communicate ideas helped me to become a better employee. Also having encouraging management staff helped me grow as an individual as well.
good,"this job is extremely fast paced and busy.   I love it."
good,Everyone on the Walgreen staff is every helpful. They would be more then willing to help/teach a newbie or a trainee the ropes. They are also friendly and patient.
good,I enjoyed working at Walgreens because I worked at 2 different locations and liked working with the customers. I was given the opportunity to work in all departments except the pharmacy.
good,"Enjoy interacting with customers, typical day work is i get start stocking shelves and taking care of customers as the come in. I work with a lot of very friendly nice people from the managers to the tech everyone gets alone and its like being apart of a family"
good,Very fast paced. Knowledgeable Pharmacists. Wealth of training information and education for the employees. Multiple locations. Specialty Pharmacy opportunities for employees to transfer.
good,we clock in at schedule time. on a typical day it's neither busy nor slow but regular pace depends on the day of the week. we learn about product placement in the store and how to use equipment that help crete sale tags and mylars etc.
good,As a beauty adviser I was able to help my customers keep up with the latest trends while helping them feel good about themselves. The stores are kept very clean the management is fair to all employees.
good,It’sgood if you’re looking for a stable job. It’s was to get the hang of. I always got a lot of hours (I requested) and they were always super understanding if I was late or something. Best job I’ve ever had
good,The job environment was great however management kept moving around and we never had on manager for longer than 3 months at most and it created a very hectic environment.
good,"Having a solely responsibility of the store gave me an important sense of ownership,  a tremendous challenge to compete in a very high pace atmosphere, also, dealing with different customers gave me a talent to exceed my expectations in customer service and having total control of my employees a very high responsibility that led the success of the store."
good,"Fast paced environment at various times of day; encouraged to learn other facets of the workplace, such as helping out in the pharmacy (especially during peak hours)."
good,"Fast-paced and challenging as well as exciting."
good,A typical day at one store I worked at involved inventory management and customer service.  The job can be very stressful but under the right circumstance it can be rewarding.
good,"I learned the computer systems, as well as managing weekly orders, and ordering seasonal merchandise.  I assisted in managing the pharmacy, and promoting pharmacy services."
good,Walgreens is work place that is relaxed and enjoyable. Walgreens provides daily discounts as well as employee discounts. Walgreens also provides free yearly flu shots.
good,You would honestly never know how your day was going to be until you actually got there. On good days all employers would work together in customer service and stocking merchandise. On bad days you would be short 1-2 persons and suddenly all tasks would fall on to you. Certain managers would help you out but they would mainly stay in the office.
good,Some of the workers are awesome and some its hard to get along with. I enjoy working there but I want to expand my career and use the knowledge I have in the health care to help people
good,"I loved working at Walgreens, the managers treated me well without using negative coaching and I responded to that really well. I however only had one drawback and that was anybody hired after me at the time were making more money. So I left for a higher pay, which I regret as the environment has always been like a family and less cutthroat than most places."
good,My experience as a pharmacy intern at Walgreens Pharmacy was a positive one from which I learned many long-term career lessons.  I would recommend working at Walgreens to anyone seeking to work in community pharmacy.
good,"Typical day start with everyone speaking to each other. Ive learn how to read UPC numbers, how to better help customers in a fast-pace manner. My store management works hard on helping us learn. The workplace culture is very nice with great personality. The hardest part of my job would be leaving great managers. The most enjoyable part is helping customers find a product that they might have over looked."
good,Arrive 15 minutes prior to shift and work 6 to 10 hours (as scheduled)   with little to no overlap with partner depending on location.  Management being turned over to younger PharmD associates with little experience.  Professional atmosphere with a diverse staff of Certified Technicians and Designated Hitters(when needed).  Continually assigned learning/training to be completed in a timely manner.  Hardest part of the job is completing all duties with too little technician support and often using other store personell to supplement.  Most often little to no time for meals/breaks.  Best part of job was working with friendly and caring coworkers. Saving lives and stamping out disease.
good,"I started out part time as a cashier and worked to learn more and take on more responsibilities.  As a company/store they were willing to train you in other responsibilities if you showed interest.  I learned photo department, resets and inventory and then was promoted to a opening and closing position.  Your direction is up to the employee."
good,great that they pay the classes for and offer chances to become a CPhT. Classes were offered in various locations as well. They want as many CPhT's as possible
good,"i have learned so much i walgreens, i have got to know more about micro service based approach in walgreens. Explored No SQL functionality and  active active configuration techniques"
good,This company offered competitive wages and lots of promotions. They are quick to help you move up. The benefits were excellent. It was relaxed. Worked scheduling fairly.
good,I really liked my years working at Walgreen's but eventually I had to put in my two weeks notice and seek a job that gave better or more competitive wages. I was unable to make a living off the paychecks I received there. Had the job paid more it would have been perfect.
good,I have worked at Walgreens for a little over 2 yrs part-time and love it. I started working at my store in Lafayette Indiana in May 2015 and then transferred to my current store in Palatine IL in june of 2017. My Lafayette store was like my extended family and I knew about 80 percent of the customers by name as our store was a real neighborhood store where most people walked to the store to get what they needed.My current store in Palatine is not a real neighborhood store so knowing the customers by name is not a very realistic goal. The management at the South St location in Lafayette Indiana were awesome I actually started crying when I said my good byes to the store Manager Dwight and my Assistant Store Manager Michelle was glad my favorite shift lead Ashley was not there because I would've flooded the store with tears as her and I had an awesome working realationship and I still keep in contact with her.. My store in Palatine the jury is still out on management though Brendan is very nice the Asst. Manager has only been there for like five months so she is still green. One of my shift leads however at the Palatine store has been with Walgreens for 38 years have to wonder why she is not an Assistant Manager. All in all I would have to say if you are looking for a pt job no more than 30 hrs per week then most definitely apply especially to the store in Lafayette Indiana
good,My Manager and the culture at this job were great. I learned a lot and I appreciate the opportunity.  Restrictions on approval to cover certain locations was challenging as was the need for patient and customer training.
good,I enjoyed working at the company. The staff was friendly and nice and the management was good too. I enjoyed my time there but had to leave due to health issues and the company rules not allowing me to have enough time off due to it which was the biggest downfall of working there. The company is good when it comes to filling prescriptions for pts due to fast and good service.
good,"Work a 7 hour shift and you have to remind them you have to take a lunch. A minute worked over 6 hrs requires a lunch, but neverrrrrr do you get any other breaks. First day, orientation, someone was stealing from the store. As did this trend follow on the third and sixth day. No security and only one door in or out of the pharmacy. Severely underpaid for high volume store and daily duties. I could make $4 more working at a call center, sitting all day getting yelled at."
good,"Work register, stock, photo, cosmetics, each day I was assigned a different department or area , I would do stock and customer service, worked in photos lab"
good,The hardest times were holidays. A lot was expected of managers and employees alike. Not much option for holidays off. Training classes to stay updated.
good,"Would take the prescription and scan it into the system. Then would type it up and make sure there was no mistakes. The label would print out after the pharmacist would review it. Fill the prescription with the correct medication, label the bottle, let the pharmacist check it. They would bag it and I would sell it to the correct patient. Would also stock shelves, fill other prescriptions, type other prescriptions as well.  Would greet ever customer as they came to the counter and help them if they needed something also."
good,the job in it's self was great work environment. i personally would work there again. the benefits are the best part honestly. great company to work for.
good,CPO was a challenging job where metrics were always analyzed. Speed in performance was rewarded on a monthly basis and there were regular evaluations.
good,"Job was cash register,cash handling,scanning coupons,sell cigarettes, answer phone,use intercom,stock shelves,help customers, work at photo and beauty counter,or pharmacy put tags on shelves, fill coolers,put shopping carts and baskets away, do returns or refunds."
good,"basic knowledge of retail, and how to effectively communicate with customers. Gave me experience in reading store plans and performing team work operations."
good,Customers and knowing you make a lot of elderly ppl happy. There full of appreciation. Always smile and receive any knowledge gave to you. Companies change often
good,Walgreens has been a great store for me to improve my overall social skills by bringing me in contact with a wide variety of customers. The majority of our customers are regulars and it is easy to build a repertoire with them. There is usually plenty to do in the store to keep you busy and it is a very easy job to learn how to do. Working the front end of the store (versus the pharmacy) is a great entry level job or transition job for a hard working young person.
good,typical day consisted of re-stocking shelfs or working at the register and answering customers questions. the culture of the job was very good and superiors were very reasonable.
good,"A typical day was refiling prescriptions for callers, addressing issues they had with medication and sending the calls to the proper department whenever needed.  management was ok, and it was hard to sit all day constantly on the phone talking to people that were either sick, in a bad mood or rude. I enjoyed the learning experience of being quick on the screen, thinking fast and the benefits were great. I liked the company just not what I did. I would have enjoyed handling calls for other matters like beauty department questions. etc."
good,"Quick Training Class, assistance from Supervisors and staff to ramp up for expectations. Opportunities for Advancement are there.   Normal 8.5 hour day with 30 min lunches and 2 scheduled breaks."
good,"The Leadership Team is completely in touch with the business. This is by far the most employee friendly company that I have worked in. Professional, hard working, top notch employees."
good,Walgreens is a fun place to work at and the experience I had will forever carry on with me in life. I enjoy all the things I've learned but at this point in life I feel like I should be doing more to better myself.
good,"Every shift was different. I took parts in different departments. I""ve worked the main register, photo department, cosmetic department, and floor. The hardest part of the job was helping customers during busy days while having to finish a list of work duties by the end of my work shift. I enjoyed this working here because the employees played as a team. Everybody helped each other when it was needed and it was a friendly environment among workers"
good,Really enjoyed working here. Loved meeting new people and loved my job and the people I worked with. The only reason I had to leave was for better pay.
good,"The days are full of work as the store is very busy, but the days really fly. Some really good people work there. Will definitely teach you customer service better than most places."
good,All the co-workers were helpful and they kept the work place organized and fun. They stayed on task and were helpful when it came to me asking a question.
good,This is a great place to work but can be stressful at times. It can be challenging to work with ill or injured customers but it can also be rewarding to help those in need.
good,Walgreens as a whole is a good place to work. The pay is not where I think it should be for the work that is required of you. The management is very helpful and empathic.
good,"I like to work in walgreens."
good,"The life of a retail pharmacist can be described as demanding and stressful. Compared to other pharmacy retail chains, however, I feel as if Walgreens takes greater strides to support their staff."
good,"Okay place to work. Coworkers are cool, good environment to be in. THey pay for your training to be come certified unlike cvs. Customers can be rude at times otherwhise not bad."
good,"I loved working at Walgreens. It was never a dull day except for slow days, but overall there was always something to do. I would take out inventory to place in the isles, I would help customers find an item, or attend the register in my assigned department. Everyday I had things to do. I loved working there, however my boss was never understanding of my religion and needing Fridays nights and Sunday mornings off or even when I asked for days off in advance she would tell me to take other days after the days I asked for. She was never understanding in that aspect. Other than bad management, Walgreens is a good place to work."
good,"Good company. Pays very well for each position. Depending on location and management staff are shown appreciation for their work. Most store participate in outside events such as aids walks, community basketball games between other store members. Fun company."
good,"•	Merchandised store displays to keep store environment visually appealing and optimized for equipment promotions."
good,"it was a very good place to work, I enjoyed the regular customers, all the co-workers were friendly and caring.  The medical benefits provided are great"
good,I really enjoyed working with the Pharmacists. They were both extremely helpful when it was needed. Most customers were great except for a few bad eggs
good,great company with good benefits.  The upper management really seems to care about you and what you do for the company.  I really enjoyed my time with the company
good,"The best thing about Wagreen's is the peopme you will work with!  They are like family.  It is very busy.  Being a shift-lead you have to work in all departments of the store, including pharmacy."
good,"a typical day at work at Walgreens was nothing out of the usual. restock, chores and then register nothing really changed much. The management was nice people who knew who to get job done, while the culture had low morale it was fun. hardest part about working at Walgreens was working truck. tons of crates to work were pretty tough to do with limited time."
good,"Typical day is getting together with you supervisor and discussing your goals for the day. Helping customers being as friendly as possible, while completing tasks. "
good,"30 minute lunches with 2 15 minute breaks.  Purchases must be made during these times.  Not enough time to eat and enjoy the breaks.  Refrigerator crowded and microwave was always in use."
good,I would normally work 3:45 to midnight as a photo tech. It was in a bad area and shrink was high we were not aloud to catch theives. Other than that the company took care of you
good,A great place to work if you're in school or want a part time job. Not so much to make a career out of. Not every can advance and if you want to make a career out of Walgreens you must work harder than anyone in your store and even then the opportunity might not be there.
good,"This company has routine standards for the sales floor and customer  service. This aids in the golden rule of practice makes almost perfect, on the sales floor and in the general workplace. The face-to-face interactions with customers also aids in building customer relations and the chance to make a good social impact on the services that are provided to the customers."
good,"Overall, Walgreens is a great company to work for. They support Corporate responsibility by actively participating in charitable campaigns such as Red Nose Day."
good,I completed my 120 hour externship at Walgreens. I learned a lot from a great team. It was very high paced but a great environment which made it easy and enjoyable.
good,I learned how to manage about the store. Management seemed too into they're personal lives in the work space yet did an excellent job. the work culture was magnificent. The hardest would be restock of entire store. Working close with the employees and customers was the most enjoyable part.
good,"I work with a great group of people,   Most of our customers are very pleasant,  however we do get a few customers that try our patients. The work day is pretty fast paced."
good,I would actually work for this company again. I actually loved it here. They were very understandable. they believed in giving their employees hours and was a overall great company.
good,Very high paced environment but a fun staff made it enjoyable. Paid time off was a nice commodity once achieved and schedules were mostly fair. Great communication.
good,"After working as a pharmacy technician for 30 years, I have worked with many different managers.  It was hard for me to work with some of the management team at Walgreens because they were not customer oriented."
good,"Flexible shifts"
good,"this is just a standard reatail store, if youve worked at one youve worked at them all, the only difference here is that because of the pharmacy you tend to get older customers which can be both good and bad at times"
good,"I worked at Walgreens on an internship, it was one of my first jobs. I would do outdates and stock shelves, along with clean the store and organize. Pretty Easy job, outdates would get tedious, the manger was nice she was a female. I did not like having to stock freezer, it bothered me."
good,I loved this job the managers were helpful and understanding  the were will to help in many different ways. Was unfortunate couldn't stay here longer.
good,Walgreen helps me balance everything with providing me overnight work opportunity. I wish i had more hours and more opportunity for advancement. I appreciate my job for the most part and I am always available to come in and work
good,I have fairly rated the company but choose not to give so many details. I will say that I personally that I  am not opposed  reapplying to work for the company. I encourage folks to apply if they are interested in working for the company.
good,They are fair when it comes to scheduling. I went through their training program to become certified. I learned quite a lot  about inventory and returning products.
good,"*The employees were very professional and respectful."
good,"Fast paced, productive shift, enjoyed the customers and being able to help with products in the store. Hardest part of the job was no security and we stayed open until 12:00 am."
good,"A typical work day includes being in all depts. and managing time and employees accordingly. "
good,This was a great job. Did not stay due to in order to advance to management I would have to travel anywhere from 40 minutes plus. That was not ideal for me as I was young when I held this position. The PTO and 401K benefits were fantastic. Only downfall was they are open for all holidays and that can interfere with family time.
good,Give good customer service always be on time an try to learn every position an try to work well with others an make sure you always pay for your merchandise
good,"It's okay place for working when starting of. if you are the type person who wants to learn, walgreens is the place. They teach you everything you need to know."
good,"A typical day in any retail pharmacy can be hectic. Particularly when the company is trying to become a global pharmaceutical giant. Change is constant, so you kind of have to roll with the punches. No one is allowed to work a set schedule because of some ""fair scheduling"" rule. Management is supposed to assist the pharmacy whenever necessary, but from what I hear, that's a rare occasion at any pharmacy. I've learned that some pharmacists only do the minimum required of them also, which piles the load onto the techs. We're always either short on trained staff or short on hours, so the work is already heavy, and techs rarely get to take the 15 minute breaks that we are legally allowed. The hardest part of the job is dealing with sick/angry/rude patients who don't understand the workings of insurance processing, doctor-pharmacy interaction, or what it takes to actually fill a prescription. The most enjoyable part (which could be horrible if you don't like your coworkers) is that you're confined to tiny quarters with a group of people. You learn to communicate and collaborate effectively so that things can go smoothly."
good,"It is very fast paced working environment at Walgreens pharmacy. However, every one is nice and working hard there. I have learned from my direct boss which is an pharmacist who is very acknowledgeable and understanding."
good,"Promotions were mentioned but never received. It was hard to get time off, even months in advance. Breaks were short, lack of employees. Too much work was put on one person"
good,"Because, the people attended is calm, is very good because helped all costumes . My intention is helpful every people in the store. Orientation in need shop, and talk for experience in ours store."
good,They have really good benefits and there's a lot of opportunity to move up in the company. However they're changing a lot with hours and locations and stocking and how they do business. Who can know uet if it'll be for the better or not in terms of the employees.
good,"I've been here for 2 1/2 years. It's a good place to work, they challenge you to give 110% in every shift and I can honestly say that I've grown up 110% But this is definitely a stepping stone job, they give alot of opportunities to advance here and work with you if you're in college. Hardest part would be working with people who don't want to be there. Most enjoyable part is gaining a great, highly dysfunctional family"
good,This employer is one of the greatest that I have had the pleasure to work for. Walgreen's offers a wide range of positions in store and is up and down when it comes to the work environment. Some days may go by slower with less workload and customers and others may have you wish you never applied. They do give great health benefits and compensation for work performed.
good,"Working at walgreens has been an awesome experience. I think the company is really strong and has a lot of potential to be the leader in drug and convenience stores across the United States. The management is decent, however it depends greatly upon the store you work at. I have worked in multiple stores and have found that stores with good, friendly, and open managers are the most fun and most productive work environments, while stores with mean and strict managers only make their employees hate working there."
good,this job helped me develop excellent customer service skills but the pay was horrible. It is a great college job because they work with you with hours.
good,"good place to work, great team, understanding management, everyone is willing to learn and complete their assigned tasks as they should, and go beyond if needed"
good,i learned a lot working at my home store and bouncing around to fill in at other locations.  I enjoyed my job as a technician at walgreens but unfortunately the pay is not great. i met a lot of good people at my time working for walgreens.
good,"It was manager trainee so each day here was difficult. f I was working here and going to school, and this became too much.I also worked in the pharmacy because I was training for all positions.  This was a very unique job."
good,The store I worked at was small but there was always something to keep you busy. Everyone pulled their own weight and always made sure the work was done before their shift ended.
good,"Opening the store or coming in a few hours after the store opens, then doing all of the smart count (checking on hands of certain items that a member of leadership has to check. After that working on price changes and markdowns throughout the store. Followed by doing whatever my manager has for me to do that day. However there are days that I have to close the store so coming in at either 2 p.m. or 3 p.m. and working tell 10:30 p.m. or 11 p.m. and doing the tasks that are given to me and then facing the entire store and making sure that the employees are doing their closing tasks, while also pulling and counting the drawers to make it so that the safe is balanced at the end of the night."
good,I enjoy my job mostly because of the people I work with. It's easy to get your work done when you all get along and others are willing to help if you ask for it.
good,"I loved working at working at Walgreens.  Overall a wonderful company.  I stocked, helped customers, conducted meetings, trained employees, ordered inventory, rang up customers, and cleaned.  They do move the mangers from store to store twice a year.  I had six mangers out of my time here and only had one really good manger.  They move up individuals who have not been trained due to personal relationships with the hiring manger.  I learned a lot of things at this job though and really loved coming into work.  I like the responsibilities I had and helping newer employees learn how to do things in the store.  Everyone is mostly nice and the store has a good culture to it."
good,Walgreens was a good day to day job it gave me good customer service practice working on the floor i was able to help customers with their needs. It gave me cash handling experience as well. Management was great and very knowledgeable. Workplace culture was not in the best part of town so it made some days a challenge.
good,"A typical day at Walgreens is just checking customers out, answering the phone, and making sure the store and our assigned isles are nice and neat and straighten."
good,Good pay for what I do. Autonomous. Nice coworkers. They seem to keep everything well stocked. Training is thorough and computer based so you can move through it reasonably quickly. good things to shop for that is needed good sales
good,Good job for someone looking for part time work. Schedule is very flexible. It is a usual customer service job where you will have to solve problems and help customers.
good,I would work 10 - 12 hours a day. I would occasionally have a day off. When I would go to work I would work with my team to set up displays effectively. I would handle money and order new things on the computer for customers. The management was wonderful and helped when our team needed it. The hardest part of my job was balancing school and working so much. The most enjoyable part of my job was communicated with a variety of people each day.
good,Walgreen is an amazing place to work. On a typical day we wold help customers with photos and basic customer service. Most enjoyable part during my time working there is seeing customers walk out with a big smile.
good,"This was my first job, aside from mowing people's lawns. The hours are flexible and they don't need you to cover for other people too often. You sometimes get long periods of time with nothing to do. So be prepared to look of either tasks to keep your manager happy."
good,"Working at Walgreens has its pros and cons. If you work full time i hope you dont mind giving up your social life including your family. A typical day at walgreens consists of ringing up customers, helping customers with photo prints to helping them find a specific item. Cons are minimum wage starts at $9/hr which is not bad especially if you work full time, They pay every two weeks."
good,Walgreens is a good company to work for. If you put the work in you'll get the promotion you deserve. If yourv a studen tthey'll even accomodate your schedule.
good,"A typical day at Walgreens consisted of me working with merchandise, photos and interactions with customers. I can say that I learned a lot while working there as far as interaction with people and how to communicate with the outside world. The culture was very homey because of how close I am with the employees. The hardest part of the job was probably the communication with management at times, the most enjoyable being like I said before the interactions with customers."
good,"I would definitely recommend working for Walgreens as a first job. The culture and the friends that you make their last a lifetime. They really do a good job of making the employees of their store feel like a team. "
good,Walgreen's is generally pretty relaxed with occasional bouts of quick-paced work. Nothing too difficult. The hardest part is probably dealing with rowdy customers.
good,A great laid back place to work. The people were amazing at the Pickerington Ohio location. Just didn't pay enough to survive. No adult with actual bills can survive off of $9 an hour. Sorry. If it paid more I would've definitely stayed longer.
good,"Working for Walgreens, I've learned valuable attributes such as communication, the importance of good customer service, and the ability to adapt to any unpredictable possibility the job may present."
good,Loved working here  great people and customers.  schedule was good and it was easy to move up would still be there if the pay was better  and the benefits were better.
good,"It use to be a great company to work for. Now it is like a lot of companies, only worried about money. They are still a good company to work for. Just not as good as they used to be."
good,"Overall the job is nice, I enjoy my responsibilities.The pay could better and the upper management needs work. Promotions are based on who you, not what you know."
good,Some stores are run well. The store I was at there was no training for new employees or training for people who recently got promoted. So ask employees that are there to give their input about the running of the store.
good,Was good but not a lot going on.  There was a lot of standing around as a cashier.  I would have appreciated more things to do and a more clear way to earn a promotion.
good,"Working for a Walgreens provides one with the opportunity to help people through customer service.  This is not the easiest thing to do as some people are harder to please than others, however it is the duty of the store associate to make a customer's trip to Walgreens a positive one.  Everyone who works with you at a Walgreens understands the stress of customer care and knows how to help make the work day more enjoyable for all.  Management is not always consistent with how shifts operate and were not always understanding when it came to employee needs but always made sure the work that needed to get done did get done."
good,I like the fact that with hard work and dedication it pays off and there are many opportunities to move up in the company as long as you are willing to work for it.
good,"Retail can be very high stress, but the employees make coming to work enjoyable. Taking care of people in the store gives you a change to build a relationship with customers."
good,Its a great starting place for a student. Flexible hours but cutting hours compared to where you work. Its hard to progress when hours are not giving.
good,"How this job goes depends greatly on management. If you have awesome managers, you will have an awesome job. Pay is not awesome, but it's not bad. above minimum waging starting off, yearly raises for there. "
good,"Fast paced retail work environment.  Many locations to choose to relocate to if moving.  Friendly coworkers in most locations.  New layers of management make the company no longer great to work for as an assistant manager, other than that no complaints."
good,"I was only an intern here, but I loved the staff. They were all very friendly. It influenced me to get a job in pharmacy. I loved talking to customers and helping them with their problems."
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work.  Excellent career development, upper management is focused, profitable, and fair.  Co-workers worked as a team and I was compensated appropriately."
good,"Great company to work for in my opinion. Hours aren't great with it being a pharmacy open 364 days a year but overall great work environment. I just had manager who accused me of thievery while telling employees; Only to apologize to me, but not inform employees I was innocent."
good,I enjoy majority of the customers who I have come to know personally over the 18 plus years I have worked with the company. The staff in the pharmacy has remained steady and I have developed close relationships with the people I work with.
good,I like working at walgreens the people you work are nice. but once your on the phone its worse cause the calls dont stop you will get 200 plus calls with a 30 percent of call u can not pass being transfers. Also shedule bid are the worse.
good,"Good company to work for if you posses a grade-A work ethic, Offers good benefits and great amount of PTO for vacations or leave. Also we have a great management team in place!"
good,"Typical Workday included filling prescriptions, taking prescriptions, waiting on customers, putting away prescriptions, making doctor calls for refills and calling the customers when their RX's were ready"
good,"Walgreen's is a fast paced, team work focused company. They have many positions available in different departments and offer you a chance to be responsible for your own objectives."
good,Not your typical retail work place. They care about your opinions and want to make your job better as well as the company. Room for advancement and they reward hard work.
good,"Honestly, I didn't always like the job because well, that's being an adult but at both of the Walgreens that I have worked at, I have never seen a group of employees so close. I love all of my coworkers and they make the job more bearable."
good,"As receiving clerk, there is a lot of variety, not only in duties but also in the people worked with.  It was a very supportive environment to learn new things in.  I appreciated how they expected everyone to treat each other with respect."
good,everyone is like a family. great store to join if youre part time or in school. The managers are kind and they are always willing to have an open ear if you ever have problems with anyone or anything.
good,i was hired in as a customer service rep and i really liked it. it was bad pay but the people were good to be around and it was an easy job. just had to make sure every customer left with a smile
good,"This is a good job for when you are not focusing on your career and need to pay the bills. I enjoyed the people, the work, and the customers. I am just ready to move on to something more serious."
good,"Performed cashier/customer service work. Worked in other departments as well, Pharmacy, Liquor, Photo, helped in warehouse, stocking, cleaning, always had good management."
good,The managers are friendly and are willing to work with employees on their schedules. They do a great job of providing training for their jobs and are patient with employees.
good,Walgreens consisted of a busy work enviroment. Beginning with cashiering and stocking the shelves.  The hardest part of the job is being on your feet for multiple hours at a time.
good,Management is easy to get along with. Fast-paced and stimulating environment. Room for job advancement. Opportunities to learn new skills from job professionals.
good,"you are just a number. if you work in the pharmacy be prepared to be there slave.no lunches, or breakes, very stressful job. they do not care if you are sick .you are still required to come to work"
good,"Overall Walgreens was a great place to work. I enjoyed the atmosphere, the only problem I had were the very long work day. Typical shift is 9hrs on your feet for most of the day"
good,"I loved working at Walgreens, the job was easy and the hours were flexible and they were understanding usually with personal issues and worked around my class hours, but I had huge problems with how management treated employees."
good,"Working at Walgreens was a far better experience than I was expected depending on the location of course. The managers was easy to work with as well as encouraging, hands on when called upon and goal driven, but in a lax atmosphere. They will take the time to work with you, but as for the co-worker; it comes down to timing and getting the major task done before their shift is over. I've learned about finding reasonable solutions to take care of the task at hand within a reasonable time. The most difficult part of the job would be multitasking with less than desirable colleagues as well as few co-workers in between, especially during the closing hours. All in all, I get satisfaction for helping out customers during my time at Walgreens."
good,Starting out the it was good. They helped me get certified by taking classes . I wish the pay was more. You do a lot of work for way less pay. I believe they should have more room for advancement
good,"Good Benefits, able to obtain cross-training in all departments. The customers are overall very nice. Good neighborhood."
good,"this is a good place to work however very hard to advance your career. I enjoyed all the departments I worked in. I worked in receiving, shipping and split case pick."
good,"Friendly and Pleasant Place to work"
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work. However, it is retail so it can be difficult to have a schedule that will work with your personal life. In order to be promoted you have to show initiative and start from the bottom, once you reach Assistant Store Manager that is when you are able to make more money."
good,"management was great. it was just hard to advance. they showed appreciation towards their employees, great work environment, believed in cross training so you could learn as much as possible"
good,This job consisted of taking many phone calls during your shift and some calls felt like a counseling session. The breaks for the bathroom were timed! Overall you did learn about the different types of pharmacy benefits.
good,Management changes in the last year. Bit of difficulty to adjust. Hardest part of the job is dealing with short staff and getting tasks completed on a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers. Great interaction with customers on a personal yet professional level. Cash handling fairly easy.
good,"Typical workday would actually be enjoyable because you're not usually stuck behind the counter just ringing people up. I enjoy learning from our 5 minute meetings every morning and night. The workers are pleasant and the boss is easy going. We all know each other well enough to know how the other works. So, overall, it's a pretty great place to work at."
good,"I have a verity of jobs that I do at Walgreens. I run the register, I work on the sales floor and help customers find what they need. I also work in the pharmacy. The management communicates very well with the employees. The most enjoyable part is being around the customers and helping them with their needs."
good,"I love my job due to flexible hours and i like the retail environment, definitely keeps you busy. The only downfall is that you cant walk a customer to an item they are looking for because someone must stay at the front of the store so you have to point the way cause most of the time theres nobody there to cover for you."
good,"Working with the public to provide excellent customer services, working on improving the store during the seasons to basic needs and wants, providing assistance in situations, keeping a positive attitude and focus."
good,"Great job, alot of responsibilities, the only issue is that there is no set schedule and the raises are very poorly. You can barely get any requested days off."
good,It's a nice quiet place to work at . The customer are sometimes really nice . I would like to work here ore but the hours are not good with my school schedule.
good,"Great advancement opportunity if hired from outside of company instead of working your way up. I was hired under the premise that I would be placed in the next management training courses. Unfortunately, it was an inaccurate pitch"
good,"I was quickly thrown into work, they don't require you to pick things up immediately but you learn the ropes within a week or two. Everyone was always positive and friendly."
good,"Management and Co-workers were great, be sure to have a thick skin since customers will be rude on a regular basis.  Walgreens Corporate office feels the need to send down revisions to the store layout multiple times a month so that's a never ending process.  Overall not a bad place to be employed."
good,"Having only worked for walgreens for a short period of time and Having family in corporate I know a lot about the company and its a great place to work if you want to work retail. There is always the option of moving up and advancing in Walgreens, but the one I personally work at is one of the worst Walgreens in the district so, it happens."
good,"I would work in the morning, so it was slow most days. But on the weekends it would really busy, since most people were home. I built upon my people skills and learned how to be more caring to folk that came into the store. My managers were really nice people.They taught me how to deal with rowdy customers and what words I should say to grab their attention when I needed them. My co-workers were amazing. They felt like family the entire time I worked there. The hardest part of my job would be dealing with the rowdy customers that would come in, because you wouldn't even know what they were going to do. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the customers reactions when I would come up to them and ask what they need."
good,I enjoyed working at Walgreens. The company really enjoy their employee. Everybody is nice and easy to work with an for.
good,"Great staff and customers"
good,they work you too much. They give importance for small things rather than big things. i worked there for 10 years and did not give  any appreciation.--
good,Walgreens is an upbeat place if you are an outgoing and friendly person. There are many kind customers and fun workers. You can have a good balance between work and school. I like this company because they work with my school schedule.
good,"Is usually able to answer customer questions."
good,"I've been with Walgreens for almost three years now. Management is management. Some are good, others are terrible. Team members come and go and usually you have an entirely new staff at least every other year, excluding the few who never leave. My typical day as a shift lead includes doing daily duties (smart counts, price changes, mark downs, 1506) and anything else that's on the list. Usually your district manager stops in once a week to see how things are going, etc. The store I work at has such a busy pharmacy that many days upper management (store manager and sometimes assistant manager as well) will spend half their day back there because we simply need the help. Again, it is what you make of it."
good,this is a great place to work. offers a lot of growth for individuals and makes it easy to accommodate to vigorous schedule preferences. great place to start retail career
good,"My typical day at Walgreen started with counting my register money, setting up my work station, making sure I had enough photo paper for pictures. I also enjoyed working in the cosmetics department."
good,"I was going to college while working as a part-time employee. I was able to rise quickly by working as an intern which led to a full-time shift-manager position, all while in college"
good,"I worked at a high volume pharmacy, taking on managerial duties and other aspects of being a pharmacist. I learned how to manage people of different personalities and create a good working environment where everyone worked well together."
good,"A typical work day there varied on how busy it was . It was a great first job experience. I learned lots of things such as dealing with both nice and rude customers, register work, ware house and more. The management there is good they help you succeed on what you need work on, along with the coworkers. The hardest part of the job was remaking the aisles, but once you got the hang of it, it came easy."
good,"Being that I am under 21 it was a hassle to work upfront because a lot of costumers would lose there temper and get very angry because i would have to wait for someone to come up and scan their badge. My managers were great and always there for me, most of the co-workers were amazing ! The hardest part of the job would have to be the rude costumers but you learn to handle them very easily. I enjoyed the people i worked with as well."
good,"Good company to work with, steady schedule, lots of opportunities to advance also. Fair pay and helpful resources. Very accommodating and opportunity to move up."
good,"Marvelous opportunity to learn a lot about the retail drugstore industry.  Progressive company that is constantly reinventing itself.  Great opportunity for professional growth, but you must learn how to manage a healthy work vs, home life mix of time management."
good,"Working as an assistant manager for this company was not only rewarding financially for someone my age, at the time but also mentally! If it wasn't for Walgreens I wouldn't have the mind set I have today. Only con was constantly getting a new store manager and being put in difficult situations, not company targeted but the location I was at definitely."
good,I enjoyed thoroughly working for this company and would return to the company in a heartbeat. The management of my store was very respectful and very courteous and worked along side you instead of delegating from the office.
good,The customers got to know me as much as i got to know them. Everyone knew me by name and came in almost every day to shop. I can never complain about rowdy customers or anything bad about the store or the way it was ran. I was happy working there.
good,"Very much depends on which location you are at. I was a pharmacy technician at a high filling count location, the pharmacists and other technicians were not nice and it was not a healthy work environment, but when I transferred I loved my new location."
good,This was a great job while I was in school. They worked with my schedule way more than anyone else would while giving me an amazing amount of hours. I loved the management. My co workers work ethic left something to be desired. All in all it was a great place to work I just didn't make enough to pay my bills when the time to move out came
good,"A typical day at Walgreens can vary, but it depends on the location that you work at and the staff that you work with. Some stores have a highly experienced and trained staff while others are short handed and require more hands on by management."
good,"Since i worked mainly graveyard, my routine was different from morning/swing shift. My shift starts with help with the rest of the customers. Once that is done i spend my time restocking, setting shelving for merchandise and out dating product. "
good,is a good place to star working the manager are nice guys and you will  get nice treatment very professional place  and nice place to star working like a part-time job
good,"I started out as a normal cashier but then I had the opportunity to train as a BA or a Beauty Advisor. Some who focuses not only on helping customers find groceries, household items etc but also specifies in helping and checking out customers in the beauty department. It was enjoyable and I loved interacting with the customers. My coworkers were well trained and whenever I needed help I could be sure to ask them. I learned so much about customer service; and the how to give your all when your helping a customer. The hardest part of the job was the lack of communication; because there are several managers and every has their own set of rules and it got very confusing at times. Other than that it was good."
good,"I always was busy working  with a customer or otherwise. I learned how to assist people, how to make signs and use the cash register, how to be efficient with my time and how to best assist customers. The hardest part was that the schedule would constantly change. But i got accustomed to it. What i most enjoyed was helping customers, they put a smile on my face, also the sense feeling like i accomplished a lot on that day."
good,"Although I was an intern here, I was able to learn a lot from other colleagues. The employees provided a very friendly and enjoyable work  environment."
good,"- customer service and organized products. "
good,"Overall had a good experience if i could go back i would. "
good,"Pharmacy Job wise everything is GREAT! Learned a whole lot about data entry, insurance billing, customer service, and learning new or all types of drugs. Management wise was great! Maybe reach out to the workers and listen a little more. Co-workers were ok. Some were great some weren't. Wished everyone worked more in a professional matter and not speak their minds out to patients. Especially putting your patients first was important to me but it was hard communicating with peers to cooperate. Being one was hard since a lot of them were doing their own things like touching cell phones or answering personal phone calls or listening to music. The work flow wasn't as great here in Milwaukee to my prior Walgreens in Wausau WI. The hardest part of the job was communicating with peers and cooperating to be one. Communication was lacking and I couldn't really say anything without getting an attitude or talked about. Everything was enjoyable, everything about working in the pharmacy was great! The job itself is GREAT! Just wished the peers I worked with worked in a more professional matter, talked in a more professional matter, and not use slang or profanity in front or to the patients. Other than that Walgreens is a great company to work with!"
good,"Great place to work, Great Benefits! Would Recommend to friends and family to work here. Positive atmosphere and great work environment."
good,"A typical day at Walgreesn consists of, helping satisfy customers, keeping area and store clean and organized, and preforming daily assigned duties. Management is amazing and works very hard to keep customers and employees happy"
good,"Fast paced work environment, insurance calls, calling Doctors offices, calling patients, filing scripts, pulling expired drugs, ordering outs, posting received orders, customer service"
good,"You really get the feeling that you get to help people,I loved working at walgreens until they had there alliance with boots since then a lot of benefits and positions have been cut out."
good,"As a pharmacist in a retail pharmacy, you're required to perform the basic functions of prescription processing, while continuing to meet performance metrics and community outreach. There are never enough tech hours or help to make each day run smoothly. There's a lack of communication from members of management, which makes task completion difficult. I have learned to be self sufficient and driven to create action plans and meet performance goals and to help motivate my staff to do the same."
good,"Working for Walgreens has been a life-changing experience, personally and professionally. "
good,You are required to work in different departments and I think its better that was because you get to learn about the store even more. It's makes you better at customer service. Co-workers are very friendly!
good,"A typical day at work was assist customers at the register, assist customer in finding the product they wanted. Made photos, and took orders from the kiosk, Inventory control, stocking from the bays, warehouse."
good,"The first Walgreens store I worked at I absolutely loved. I had a great manager  who encouraged his employees to be their best and the people I worked with were more like family. It was a great environment. I got promoted twice from cashier to Beauty Adviser and then to the Sim's Coordinator position that keeps track of all inventory counts in the store. The store was clean, organized and had helpful employees. When I transfered my position to Florida, they first didn't have my position and put me back on register, the store was dirty, the inventory counts were off, employees stood around talking more then helping customer's, it was disorganized and there was no encouragement for promotions or growth within the company."
good,"When you are hired as an external applicant, it is very hard to find people that are truly willing to train you. Everyone seems to feel that you should already know how to do things according to company policy as most of the management that you work with are internal promotions."
good,"Through out my 5 years of working with Walgreen's I have learned a lot about how to handle high stress situations, and how to better communicate with my customers.  Being that every person is different it is sometimes difficult to accommodate everyone's wants and needs.  I have learned what it means to be a true team player, and that to keep a company running smoothly we must recognize that one job is not one person's responsibility; it is all of ours.  Working along side with every person that I have met these past 5 years has helped me become the person that I am today, and I am thankful for that opportunity.  My employees and my co-workers are more than just the people that I work with, they have become my family.  I love the feeling that you get when you know that a customer is genuinely thankful for the service that you have provided them.  That is my favorite part about working at Walgreen's.  The hardest part of my job is not necessarily hard, mostly just frustrating.  My last 2 stores have been high in theft, and coming up with an effective solution with out inconveniencing our customers can sometimes be a tedious task.  Also, transitioning from a Head Photo Specialist to a Shift Manager was somewhat difficult because of the fact that I had already worked with my employees as their equal.  Some of my co-workers had a hard time adjusting to me being the one to give them direction.  This changed relatively quickly.  My experience as a whole working for Walgreen's is wonderful, and has taught me so much about people, retail and life in general."
good,"Walgreens is a good stepping place, but it's not to be made a career out of if you want to go further in life. You learn alot of valuable skills and lessons to take with you on the way to success."
good,"I always had a great time working at Walgreens. Especially the one in my location. The worst part was that we had to switch managers often, so when you got to know someone well it seemed like they were transfered."
good,"Decent place to work. Management can work around your schedule. However, shift lead does not pay as much as it used to. Co workers are pleasant. A lot of responsibilities fora  store manager but its not an overload. Helping pharmacy when its busy can be stressful."
good,I enjoy giving 100% in customer service. In this job field it is all about helping customers find what they need. I also enjoy cash handling on day to day basis. Being a leader and guiding other employees on the job makes me happy.
good,"Amazing impact on appearance of the pharmacy and improved in KPI stats for customer service. Where able to work with few questions asked which in turn improved workflow. Very well organized, diligent at job."
good,Walgreens is a great summer job while in college. They follow through with scheduling concerns and the managers are wonderful people. Very laid back environment.
good,"A proven track record for leading/motivating/coaching the store team to increase sales and ensure efficiency.                           •   Responsibilities include but not limited to: product returns, complete voids, customer refunds and cash handling."
good,"Working as Senior pharmacy technician as a lot of perks and responsibilities, I believe I work with one of the best teams and all together we make the day possible. In the mornings I usually do the most multitasking work such as; filing,typing,third party issues,inventory,and calling patients. Every morning is a challenge, making sure everything gets done before the next technician comes in. Overall, I enjoy working as a technician and helping our patients."
good,"The management is, for the most part, nice. A few bad ones, however, You will find that anywhere. Otherwise, It is a very nice place to work."
good,"Properly filled and dispensed an average of up to 200 + prescriptions per day. Effectively resolved insurance rejections and other billing issues.Managed drug and supply inventories.Managed approximately several thousand dollars in cash and credit card sales daily.Monitored the medication dispensing machines within the pharmacy to ensure supplies were readily available to clinical staff."
good,Very productive days and vary on the day how it will end. The most stressful part of the job would have to be dealing with angered customers daily and finding a quick enough satisfactory solution to satisfy the customer. Have a great relationship with all co workers including management. Having my regular customer and getting to brighten each other's days is the most enjoyable part the the work experience as a customer service clerk.
good,"I loved being a cashier and a photo lab technician. However, when I advanced to Shift Lead, the stress and work load were almost unbearable. I loved my co-workers and customers. The hardest part of the job was meeting expectations of the corporate managers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the relationships that I got to build with customers and staff."
good,"A good place as far as I'm concerned, although it's my first job in retail so I really have nothing to compare it to. It's a high energy atmosphere - you're constantly meeting people, and there's always something to do. Co-workers are really nice, and the occasional store potluck is something to look forward to. "
good,"I enjoy working here but there could be better management at some locations and their should be more teamwork also. I usually close   so our store closes at 10pm, but sometimes we  dont leave till 11 or 11;30. i think we should leave a decent time."
good,"Every day I come to work and look at the daily task list and see what needs to get done. I also make sure that all employees are working properly instead of just standing around doing nothing. I count the safe and make everything balance outs at the start of my day. The hardest part of my job is handling angry customers, but I learned how to properly handle them. I enjoyed learning news things at my work place so I can get a promotion and I love working with all my different employees at work."
good,"Working in the pharmacy is one of the hardest jobs and eye opening jobs I have had. Customers definitely do not understand what a technician does to help them out.  I learned how to deal with different people, the multiple laws that must be followed as a technician and even the pharmacy as a whole. The bonds that I made with my co-workers definitely were the best part of the job because we were all like family."
good,great environment and easy to work with. pleasant and very knowledgeable.  wonderful place to work would recommend to anyone.
good,"The company was vibrant place to work. Each week presented new and demanding challenges. There is a culture of constant learning that s refreshing. The culture has a history of applying the Rotary 4-way test, which is some hat assuring. Overall a rewarding and challenging experience. You will learn a lot."
good,"a fun place to work for,great work and compensation.job security was excellent.management had some great people who would bend over backwards to help u out.the job culture was great,especially giving jobs to people with special needs and treating them with the same respect.the people were great and the pay was great.a solid company to work for.i worked for them for 8 years,but my true passion was being in the commercial kitchen."
good,I worked here for over 10 years. I obviously loved it or I wouldn't of lasted as long as I did. Walgreens has a way of sucking you in though so that could of been it as well. I would of never have left had they matched my pay I was going to get at my new job.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of cashiering, showing outstanding customer service, and working all departments. The managers were very professional. They took their job very seriously. The hardest part of the job was unloading the trucks. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my peers. All of my coworkers made the job feel less stressful and like a more upbeat environment."
good,Walgreens was a great place to work the fast-paced enviroment was a little hard to adjust to but a great management team was there to help me adjust and feel more comfortable working.
good,"Just a typical day in the warehouse. It's mostly just stocking all day but all in all, a really enjoyable experience. My co-workers were nice and friendly, the managers weren't perfect, but I've learned a lot from working there over the past seven years."
good,"Wonderful work environment and management"
good,"one word retail, management is always understaffed and we have to run the stores on skeleton crews. A lot of theft in this area and also a lot of lifting, bending and manual labor"
good,It always seemed like there was something that needed to be done. Which I love because it kept me busy for my whole shift. I was pregnant when I got hired on and I have to say they were very open to letting me work. However the maternity leave pay was terrible. it basically wasnt done processing until I was almost done with my leave. I was still getting fmla checks when i went back to work and was working my normal hours. That was really ridiculous. But other than that I enjoyed my job. I was very happy being there. I saw a lot of people come and go in my year of being there. Seems like a lot of kids try for that to be their first jobs or something. I would've rather worked with more adults other than just the managers.
good,"Fast paced, customer oriented work. Provided on the job training and a professional atmosphere. Flexible hours for staff and leadership."
good,The management was always helpful and willing to work with anyones life schedule. I would go and clock in and immediately had things to do and instructions on how to do so. My co-workers always did their jobs in a timely fashion and were respectful to the customers. The hardest part of the job was finishing up everything before the end of my shift or finding things that needed to be done on a slow day. The best part of the job was helping the people that just wanted to get photos as memories so they would never forget and giving them a satisfied service.
good,"Good workplace, great family feel, good job, management was very well. Good flexibility. Pay was decent for the work position."
good,"Enjoy working at walgreens because it is an equal opportunity employer."
good,"I absolutely loved my job at Walgreens. I started as a cashier and was quickly promoted. Their goal is to promote from within, so the advancement opportunity is outstanding. The job is relatively easy. You are expected to unload truck, stock shelves and ring up customers even as a shift lead. I worked at three different stores and never had a problem with a manager or a co-worker. The only thing I didn't like was the hours. You will work mornings and nights throughout the week. I also worked almost every weekend. If you work full time, you are expected to work four of the six recognized holidays (Memorial Day, Labor Day, 4th of July, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years Day). The pay could be better."
good,"Have to work hard and have some fun at the same time--Must get along with people----Iworked all my life with people and love being around them.The hardest"
good,Enjoyed learning the roles and responsibilities of a community pharmacist while completing my Pharm.D.  Got to work with several excellent pharmacists who fostered learning and growth.
good,"This is a good place to work and helps you gain knowledge in the area of customer service, I worked there and really enjoyed the enviorment and the fact that everyone was willing to help"
good,Needed more employees at the one I worked at. Not as flexible as I would have liked because I had sports and often times couldn't come because of it.
good,"This is a good place to work, I have great mentors there. I enjoy most of the co workers. Fast steady paced job which I enjoy."
good,I learned so much in little time getting promoted with a significant increase in salary within just a few years. Scheduling is flexible and the environment is fast pace. Their benefits are not so great and their salary maxes out at a low point.
good,"Walgreens is a great company to work for. All of my managers and co-workers were wonderful people, who helped create a positive and fun environment. The job was difficult at times, especially during peak hours. But it was challenging in a good way. Walgreens was my first job, and I definitely think having this job benefited me in many ways. The only downside was the pay. At the beginning, I think I was compensated well, especially for it being my first job. But, the longer I worked there, the more responsibilities I had, including essentially becoming the head photo manager when ours moved. But, I didn't feel I was being paid for the work I was doing at that point."
good,"get to work talk a little."
good,"I have work for Walgreens a very Long time, I grown a lot in a few years an thought about a Career will take care of me and my Family. Will finish school by Fall degree in Paralegal.That is my main focus is having a career."
good,"Hard work, labor intense. Very low pay scale, on feet entire shift. I have really nothing further to say. Good neighborhood store/conveniently located for shopping needs."
good,"good work place, all bosses are fair and give fair treatment to everyone. The pay could be better but a place to start at as a young kid."
good,"A typical day at work was fast-paced, crazy but awesome, I really loved working in Walgreens Pharmacy. We were so busy, jumping all over the place at times, but we all worked well together and knew exactly when and where to jump in. The customers love us. We were told over and over that patients returned to our pharmacy because of us techs. Always Smiling, always laughing, recognizing patients by name and already having their precriptions ready to go. So sad to leave, but I am looking for more of a Monday through Friday, day shift job."
good,My typical work day was to assist patients with filling their prescriptions and contact doctors with any questions. I pulled any and all expired drugs from the shelves to send back to the warehouse. Ordered any needed drugs for the next day delivery. Worked any reports on a weekly and monthly basis. Answered any patient's questions I could or referred them to pharmacist. Answered phone calls.
good,"Learned Leadership skills, paid well for entry level management. I would recommend college graduate looking to seek management skill to work for this company."
good,"Doing scan outs, pulling bays, putting products on shelves."
good,Everyone worked as a team.  Needs better communication with store manager in terms of transferring and other company policies
good,"A typical day at work in the pharmacy involves checking out patients at the the drive-thru or in-store, counting medications, ordering supplies, stocking supplies, answering the phone, and entering prescription orders."
good,As a cashier my daily tasks were to tender sales among other duties such as stocking shelves and cleaning.  Co-workers and management very helpful and friendly.  Learned how to use an old school cash register.  Room for advancement all the time.
good,"Since I have started working at Walgreens, the environment that I have been introduced to has always been a friendly and inviting one. The management and individuals that I worked side-by-side with have always been helpful and did so with a smile on their face. The culture there is definitely what makes the company one that can be seen as universal to almost any crowd."
good,"Good company great for finding all your needs. Great people who are there to help you with all your needs. "
good,"Worked in the Pharmacy entering customer orders into IC plus.  Worked other staff members and Pharmacist to review, fill and sell orders to customers.  The hardest part of the job was working with insurance companies.  Many times you were placed on hold for extended periods of time.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the customers and being able to call them by name.  People like to be recognized. One of the downsides to the job is when you lose a customer who you have become close with."
good,"I liked working for Walgreens. I ran the cash register, stocked items, and assisted customers. I liked suggesting sales. My co-workers were fun."
good,Constant interaction with customers and coworkers allows for an enjoyable work experience. Flexible schedules and varying job responsibilities makes working here a great job for learning many job skills
good,"At Walgreens the people you work with really feel like a second family at times. That comes with the good, and the bad, but like family, the good outweighs the bad. "
good,"working for walgreens was an experience.i learned how to ineract with all different kinds of people. but i couldnt work somewhere where someone is always trying to get me fired and the managers played favoritism. it wasnt fair to me or the new employees,"
good,"Hour long breaks, learned about how to correct inventory, and tips and tricks about skin and hair care.Stocking and up selling items constantly."
good,"Walgreens Pharmacy is a great place to start your career. Where I am located at currently, has great management and great colleagues. We are the number 1 busiest walgreens in minnesota. Having to fill about 600+ prescriptions daily. It is a very fast pace environment with many pharmacists and technicians around to learn from each other. Overall Walgreens Pharmacy is a very good oppurtunity to new technicians."
good,"I like working for Walgreens, I was promoted within a year and am always learning new things. It is a fast paced work environment and a typical retail job so the only down side are the angry customers. Otherwise I like my job."
good,I have learned hoe to treat customers and communicate well with them and also fellow employees.I have gained good skills and management that I used on a daily basis and supervising employees and gaining trust to them from me and from me to them
good,"I enjoyed working here. fun crew,easy to learn the culture of walgreens. Not enough pay rate though. Learned a lot. Wish they could pay everyone more but what can you do?"
good,"Co-workers were very easy to work with. Everyone is professional in every aspect of their performance. Working for Walgreens was a positive experience, for the most part. The company has it's corporate short comings like all corporations."
good,"Great place to work, management is accommodating and many overtime opportunities available. I definitely recommend as a good starter job."
good,I learned a lot about customer service and how you can benefit on how you can make someones day and improve yourself as a person. Though the most enjoyable part of the job was just simply working.
good,Everyday was similar. I was given a list of work and had to do that and also wait on customers.  I have done this before but never really run into such great staff. The customers could be really difficult and the staff was great with everyone.
good,"Started as a cashier but quickly moved up to the position of senior beauty adviser.  I loved the promotion because it allowed for a more hands on customer experience.  I was responsible for helping customers find what they were needing and supervising the entire department of health and beauty.  I ran a register, stocked shelves, did resets and price changes, and all while maintaining sales quotas."
good,"As a floating pharmacist, my duties included reviewing prescriptions, verifying prescriptions, and counseling the patients on their medications.  Other duties included communication with the providers and resolving medications related problems. "
good,"After about a week or two on the job I become as versed in the different departments of the store as so of the more veteran employees. They always wanted to teach you new things if you were willing to learn. That was my favorite thing about the company. My coworkers were all friendly and easy to get along with and managment was always understanding of each individuals needs and wants. As long as you recognized you werent the only employee with needs as I always have, you would see no problem with how the scheduling and assignments were decided."
good,"Knowing your role in the pharmacy is key to your success. Pharmacy is hard work but being a technician is harder. Not enough credit is given to pharmacy technicians these days. They are underpaid & over looked! Not many customers know that the tech is who carries the pharmacist & pharmacy... without them this store & any other would fall apart."
good,"Fun workplace with supportive management."
good,"The company seems to be headed in the right direction for stockholders as there is a heavier focus on profit. Some of the benefits and cultural things that were previously here seem to be slipping away though and there is not always a great culture in the office. I think that a lot of the managers try hard to keep their teams engaged, however not every senior level manager fully appreciates what keeping their teams engaged can do for overall performance. Each division/team is different though, so this may depend on where you are located."
good,Best part of this job was my co - workers. Hardest part was the tasks coinciding. Typical day at work was helping customers and making sure they left happy. Management was very supportive and understanding.
good,Enjoyed working there for the ten years. I did not like the idea of having to relocate to several locations but did enjoy my advancements. All supervisors had great feedback weather good or bad. Lots of changes and buy outs from corporate as this was a large company. Ability to learn much from patient filing to medical coding and data entry of insurance company contract.
good,"Customers are what you would expect, most often upset/embaressed about not understanding this technology. work was constant and usually kept you thinking."
good,This company is big on customer service and satisfaction.  I learned how to work with people with different needs.  I learned many good traits working for this company.
good,"is a fast/ paced environment , multicultural people, easy to learn different tasks, management is great in this moment, coworkers are good, hardest part of the job in this moment is not having an steady shift, and i enjoy working there because the people i work with are pleasant to be around theem."
good,"My typical day at Walgreens, were to either open or close the store in a respectively timed fashioned. I learned valuable information about customer care and handling specific situation independently and effectively. Our team leads and store management always felt  pleased and treated us equally . The most difficult part of Walgreens was to contain shrink to the bare minimum. One of the many things I've  enjoyed about this company was to be able to sale and ascend goals that have never been reached by the end of the week."
good,Some days were slow and some were busy. I learned patience. Management was ok. My team would keep you laughing. The hardest part was changing our sales wall.  I enjoyed learning how to work in every department.
good,"My day consisted of being ACCURATE in my counts when shipping and receiving goods into the warehouse from the loading docks. I learned to work SAFELY throughout my tenure and to be ""Injury Free."" All warehouse supervisors were helpful to the crews regarding operational guidance. "
good,"A tytpical day at work for me would be set up the day before so I would know that I was prepared for that day. It would be a good fast pace environment. I enjoy working and multitaking all at the same time.I would like my co-works to be as dedicated as I am to get our job done correctly & in a timely manner. I also thinks it's important to try to keep things light and to have a good sense of humor, because our job is already tough enough without beating on each other. I feel we need to support someone when it's needed with the extra support that day! The hardest part of the day for me is leaving on time....I'm like one of the last ones to leave at night. I like to stay to the end and make sure everything is in place for the following day. I find that I have high standards of customer service. But with that said your not always going to make everyone happy all the time. So that's another hard part of a day, when a patient just unloads on you, but you have to remember not to takte it personally. The patient is the one not feeling well and is out of sorts. The most enjoyable part of a day is when we have win, win all the way around. Patients are happy, doctors are happpy with the outcome and we as the support staff have done are job to make it run that day!"
good,Being a manager at Walgreens has been very rewarding. A typical day is either opening the store and merchandising or closing the store white maintaining it. I would not trade my employees for anything! I've been to other stores where it seems as if a rain of chaos has come through. The only thing i don't like about walgreens is the direction it is currently going since it has merge with Boots Alliance from Europe.
good,"Walgreens used to care more about their employees. However, overall it's still a good company to work for. They would be better if they gave their stores more hours,"
good,"Great work environment employees,management and customers make it enjoyable. The downside is we don't get breaks and don't always get 40 hours. Over all its a fun job and good work environment all employees have positive attitudes."
good,enjoyed my time here. The upper managers where great and they value workers contribution a lot. Hours where long but rewards was great as well.
good,I liked the working environment there and it was an easy job.  Co-workers and managers were very nice and helpful there. I like how the job rotates and I enjoyed working with them.
good,"Responsible for entire store overnight(people, loss prevention, counting down all registers, making daily deposits, stocking, facing, ordering new currency, any customer concerns and housekeeping)"
good,Really enjoy my coworkers and when I am able to be on the floor helping customers. Management is pretty good too. Each area has its advantages and disadvantages
good,"Decent hourly pay, but doesn't compensate enough for the hours I get. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping out the customers design photos and tangible items such as mugs and frames. Management need to not put assign coworkers on the days they cannot work. Fun coworkers and fun to meet new people."
good,"Every day as i clocked in the first thing that i had to do was check inventory of my stations. Which was the coolers which contained soft drinks, Dairy and beer. After that i would check inventory for all my other isles and i would print out photos that came through the system and provide friendly customer service."
good,"Working the night shift 4-11 helping customers with their everyday needs finding products, stocking shelves, helping with the delivery trucks, inventory etc. Helping assist customers with their photo orders such as pictures,posters, canvas, photo cards. I help wherever I am needed"
good,"Enjoyed learning new skills and meeting new employees. A very demanding job,can't be standing on the job, or taking to many breaks. The pay was good."
good,I have been working here for three years and it has been a pleasure even though sometimes it could get a little bit hectic but a good experience overall.
good,"I typically had basic jobs that I had to complete and I would accomplish them as best I could in between taking care of what customer needs I had at the time, I learned to do some of the basic management jobs, and got along well with all my coworkers, I believe the worst part of the job was the unloading of the trucks cause some of that was pretty heavy lifting. "
good,"I felt like walgreens was the model for retail chain pharmacy's.  During my time there, we were the first to start immunizing, performing MTM's and driving patient adherence.  They were excellent trainers and had a large impact on the pharmacist I am today.  While some days could be stressful and very busy, overall I enjoyed my time with Walgreens."
good,"I enjoy working for Walgreens, my coworkers really make my job enjoyable. Also helping customers find the rights products is rewarding. This company sells life saving products and makes our jobs more important."
good,"Great company to work for, if you are young and just making your way into the work force. Can be difficult of those who have families and active personal lives."
good,The best thing about the job is how your co-workers aren't just people you work with but people who become a part of your extended family.
good,"I have worked at Walgreens for 13 years. A typical day at work is to first make sure everything is neat, clean and stocked for our customers. We have warehouse deliveries twice per week and have to restock everything in the store. The most enjoyable part of my job is to help customers, (especially the elderly). The most difficult part of my job is dealing with irate customers and I am usually the calming force when it comes to that. My co-worker's and manager's are awesome, we get along very well. The reason I am looking for another position is because I'd like to expand my knowledge and do something that I truly love to do and that is to work in the healthcare field."
good,"in the pharmacy we are like a family. we have a lot of regular customers who are very nice people and treat us as if we are parts of their family as well. only cons are not enough hours, resulting in not enough help. this results in stress, and strain, we also do not take lunch breaks, they schedule the pharmacist for 12 hours shifts and a lunch break when it is impossible for them to take a lunch break when there is no one to relieve them."
good,"I work part time as a photo tech at a 24 hour store in a busy neighborhood. Most days I do the leftover work from the night before, hang up new mylars, unload the truck when it arrives, and spend the rest of the day alternating between a constant stream of photo orders and covering for the cashiers' breaks. I learned how to make effective suggestive sales, deal with one bad boss by standing up for myself and leveraging the rest of the leadership team, and how to be professional under immense pressure and multiple competing priorities. My store manager and most of the sift leads are fantastic. They support me in my work, are constantly polite, and accommodate me while I was going to school. My co-workers vary. Most are hardworking, half are professional, but the other half are immature and rude. The hardest part of the job is dealing with crazy people and thieves regularly while you are just trying to get your work done and help good customers. The best part of the job is those moments where you go above and beyond the expectations of your customers (which is not hard. Walgreens trains you to do so) and have them recognize your efforts."
good,"I'm really grateful for having the chance to work for this company, i was able to learn so much and build such great experiance."
good,"good place and culture to work at, cant complain about my time there. Maintained daily operations while partnering with pharmacy"
good,"Typical day at a 24-hr Walgreens store was clocking in on time and taking over the drive-thru till the next employee clocks in. In the mean time, I'm scanning in prescriptions and filling in the blanks. Handling payments for transactions and keeping my area organized. Next position is the cashier; where I got to practice my costumer service and communication skill while handling money and insurance disputes. Third position after the cashier is the filling station where I filled and distributed prescription medications to patients under the supervision of a Licensed pharmacist."
good,"I open and also close the cosmetics department. A typical morning shift as a cosmetics advisor at Walgreens is I see what tasks need to be accomplished throughout my shift. I am responsible for making sure inventory is organized and we have what we need. In between daily tasks, I must provide customer care and knowledge of our beauty products. I am also responsible for sales and making specific quotas each shift. "
good,"As far as the time I worked for Walgreens Central Utility Pharmacy I would definitely recommend this company to work for. "
good,"good place to work. Great atmosphere, great people, solid company. tools to do the job were provided as needed. Sorda political but awesome at the same time."
good,"Great job, but the retail hours were not the best. Always working on weekends at random times and holidays..."
good,"I really love working at my store. We are very much a family there, and take care of each other. My store manager is the best manager I have ever had and wish I could work for her forever, but sadly Walgreens no pays as well as all the other places around us. I would love to stay with this company, but I have a family to support and would love to be able to finally take care of them."
good,During this internship I was required to fulfill the typical tasks of a pharmacy technician. And I was also encouraged to break free of my comfort zone and try to conquer tasks that I had not yet been instructed to do such as working the drive thru.
good,I have worked for this company for about 7 years and was given multiple opportunities to move up. Very welcoming work environment  for the most part but of course over years of working with a company you are bound to run into those that don't necessarily fit that description.
good,"Check in of guest, check in with others members of the team to see what we need to do. Follow up with any thing that was left from the night before. Insure that customers and taken care off"
good,I learned what customer service is and use what I learned to apply to work. I became a quick learner because to this job's quick work pace.
good,Liked working here in general. Fast paced constantly some thing to do. Good coworkers okay management interesting customers. Great pay.
good,"job was ok but their was no security guard. I felt unsafe work at that location. Their were shop lifters everyday some times two and three groups at a time. Lots of homeless and some one ""key"" the side of my car."
good,"I was scheduled for the overnight shift, which meant i would be tasked with unloading trucks, stocking the shelves, and attending to the few customers that wonder in past 11pm. I never worked day, but from what i heard management promoted a ""Fun"" environment and encouraged the co-workers to treat each other like a community. I'm sure that's a blast if its your thing, but as a night worker we were more encouraged to get the job done and get the store ready for the morning shifts. like I've said, the job isn't hard or difficult, but balancing your schedule if you work nights is."
good,The job was great. I did a lot of setting of product. The staff was very fun to work with. Hardest part of the job was making sure you finished all the task that were given.
good,"I loved working with most of the people there, but there seemed to be a disconnect between some of the upper management and what actually occurs in the store.  Overall a good place to work."
good,"Typical customer service operation. Team work type of environment. Co-workers were great no complaints in my experience. Great place to work, and the local customers are the most enjoyable part of working at Walgreens"
good,"Great Team,,.,................................everyone is professional. Team is very helpful. Manager is good . They know what is there job"
good,Working for Walgreens was a great experience. I learned alot more about managing people and running a business. The opportunity to grow and learn with the company was endless with continuous training they offered
good,"A typical day includes a lot of running around and proper time management. There is a lot to get done in a shift and not a lot of hands available. I have learned a lot in the time that I have worked for Walgreens, that's one bonus to the job is the continuous ability to learn and grow. Skills range from learning how to manage and grow fellow employees to being able to get the basics done in a quick manner. The hardest part of the job is the stress of having so much to do and not a lot of employees to do it due to hours being cut. I do enjoy interacting and working as a team, but also having the ability to still work as an individual."
good,"Walking into work I prepare my mind to give. There is a need to give to customers, managers, and co-workers alike. In giving I've learned that what is required is excellence. Giving my best and having zero regret about the rest is a hard thing to do because there is always room to grow and do better. Yet, I do my best to give my best consistently and wholly without the expectation of recieving anything in return. As a team this can be difficult. Especially when one team memeber is unwilling to do their part. Yet, the call is excellence and not excuses. Still, I wouldn't trade the level of growth the ""system"" has produced in me. I have learned a lot on how to deal with people and virutally love people where they are. Although working at Walgreens can be challenging it has also been one of the most rewarding expereiences."
good,its a diverse work place that allows you to deal with all works of life. It shows the value of customer service.  Its fast paced environment
good,"Assisted pharmacist through work flow to accurately fill prescriptions for new and returning customers."
good,A typical day at work would be as siting customers and keeping busy. What i learned at walgreens is that being bilingual is really helpful because many people do not understand english. my co-workers were great. The hardest part of my job was staying till 1am counting money and closing the store.The most enjoyable part of my job is associating with customers and helping them find exactly what they need.
good,I got to help people who were sick. the hardest part of the job was dealing with people who were not in a good mood because they were not feeling good but it was a learning experience
good,"As s Message Broker developer i have been gone through several transformations,mappings and routings and used SOAP nodes for web services it was good experience."
good,"I did enjoy working at Walgreens. Most of the time it was a lot of fun and self paced. Even in the rough times though, the staff made it a lot of fun. I encourage any young adult to get a job here."
good,"At Walgreen's I typically arrive around 10pm to start my shift. During the first few hours I juggle folding shirts, dealing with customers, and straightening the store. Once the evening crowd dies down I spend most of the night making the store look neat and running ovenright photo orders, in addition to any other tasks the daytime managers have assigned me. On certain days I also put up deliveries from McClane, sorting through products that go out on the shelf and back into the stockroom"
good,"Very busy, retail/customer service job.  There is always something to do, hours are pretty steady.  Friendly staff, benefits are offered, including profit sharing and health coverage."
good,I love my company! we are a team . we are a very busy company yet still manage to all get along and make customers feel comfortable and happy!
good,"I've met some great people here who are always helpful and happy to show you the ropes. It's collaborative, and you definitely have a voice here."
good,Everyone that works at this Walgreen's is from the area.  We al know our patients.  We even see them when we are out and about and running personal errands.
good,it s  over all great with last 14 year with this company. and I feel I need change in my life for . so I am looking to move forward and change. otherwise I am so great full for this company. because I grove up here and my roots here. with  this company.
good,Walgreens overworks their employees and they are not compensated for such work. I enjoyed the people I worked with and the managers were always there to help you if you had a problem. The hours were not fairly given to those who were full time as opposed to those part time.
good,Walgreens is a company that can allow an person to grow. You can start as just a stock clerk or cashier and work your way to management.
good,"As pharmacy manager I was in charge of all operations within the pharmacy. I worked at the same pharmacy for over 10 years and personally knew about 80% of every customer that came in. I enjoyed going to work every day and had a great staff through out the whole time there.   "
good,I like working for Walgreens. Great pay and great experience with customer service. I learned alot about how to address customer concerns and how to fix them.
good,A good company that gives employees an opportunity to grow within the company. I enjoyed going into work everyday and knowing something new was happening each day. Either with daily tasks or employees.
good,"I have learned that having retail Walgreens manager experience has "
good,"●	Transcribes and verifies prescription information into a computer Terminal "
good,Flexible work hours.  Benefits available.  Good co-workers.  Training available. Supportive Management.  Variety of tasks.  Encourage strong customer service.  Encourage staff to assist customers in making sales decisions without pressure.  Large variety of products available.
good,Co-workers were friendly and managers were easily approachable when I had questions or needed help. The hardest part of the job was managing the restocking of shelves while had customers needing to check out. Sometimes my co-worker was unreachable. Walgreens was willing to work around my school schedule and willing to work with me when it came to my personal appointments like doctor appointments or family issues.
good,"A typical day at work includes helping customers, stocking shelves, and merchandizing. I learned a lot working here, it made me mature and be more responsible in the work environment. Management and coworkers are wonderful and fair. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the demands of corporate with the deadlines. The most enjoyable part was learning how to reset and merchandize the store."
good,It was close to home. The drive down the mountain and across the lake to Walgreens was always nice. The staff is very friendly and the management was always willing to work with my schedule. Very professional attitudes are displayed here.
good,I learned a lot form this company. You got to help patients on a daily bases.
good,"Loved job and people I worked with but in two years I was there I was involved in three attempted robberies, the last time I faced down the barrel of a gun and family insisted I quit!"
good,"A very busy work day with impatient customers, but great staff."
good,"At Walgreens Co. everyday is a different task for you to complete. You have to be very open-minded when working, because there are times when you will work in different departments. I learn to multi-task on a daily basis and also be an excellent team member. The hardest part of the job is when customers are stealing items and you have to do your daily task."
good,"Looking back over my last 5 years, I have no doubt that my time at Walgreens was useful and interesting."
good,"A typical day at work was extremely fun. Nothing makes me more happier than being able to help someone else out. Customers loved me, because I was always jolly, happy, and helped them with the things they needed help finding. I knew my regular customer by name and they also knew me by name. My managers were great and they loved me. We've had many potlucks and crew outings. The hardest part of my job was not being able to give my customers exactly what they needed."
good,It's a typical pharmacy job. There are a lot of truly wonderful people who work at Walgreens that maintain friendships outside of the workplace.
good,"A typical day at Walgreens includes an early morning shift, usually taking in a truck full of totes. Normally between 150-300 pieces. It's very fast paced and energetic. I learned a lot about photo machinery, how to operate it and maintain it. The managers themselves were so-so, depending on which Store Manager I had at the time. My Co-workers made great friends, as far as work ethic..not so much. The hardest part of the job was stocking the cooler and the freezer and that was mostly because it was so cold back there, however they did provide us with coats/hats/gloves. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to see my customers excitement as they talked about the stories behind the pictures they were printing."
good,"A typical day begins with reviewing daily sales and goals; comparing to expected results and doing a store walk each morning.  After continuous notes, I write daily tasks lists and delegate out to staff.  Daily 5 minute meetings with Front End staff and Pharmacy Staff leads me into late morning to help customers, resolve concerns, offer customer service to those in need, coaching employees on their pros and cons and documenting conversations.  The most enjoyable part of this job is knowing when you have genuinely been able to help a customer with their need whether it be a medication, an online order for a product, a quick checkout on the register, as well as when I am able to spend quality time working and training employees on tasks."
good,"A typical day at Walgreen is working and managing over 50 employees, from the front end of the store. To helping pharmacy with customers and task. As well as helping customer find product that we carry in the store, and on line only. The hardest part of my job is along with the day to day. The situations that may a rise either with customers or employees, that demands extended amounts of my time. Which sometime hinder me from finishing my task that were assigned to me."
good,"AFTER company was bought out from the Walgreen's family-"
good,"Open and close store"
good,I loved working here and would tell anyone to apply. as long as you have a great store staff you'll be fine.
good,"On a typical day I would be very busy, doing inventory and price changes all day and also running the cash register. I learned a lot about how a store is run. The management was great, I got along well with everyone, The co-workers were always good people. I loved working with customers and being busy all day everyday."
good,"I go into work , clock in, and start my day. I go sign into my register. start asking customers if they need help finding anything and let them know my register is open whenever they are ready. I had really friendly co-workers that always had my back when we were getting busy or if i were getting behind. The hardest part of my job is when we would have game days, and the store would be so busy.The most enjoyable part is when i was able to help a customer find exactly what they were looking for and made their day."
good,"Loved being able to cross train in different departments, providing exceptional customer service daily and learning new aspects of the business. Great work environment"
good,"This position allows you to have an impact on the quality of life of your patients and you get to have daily interactions with patients, physicians and other referral sources. You have to be involved in every referral from initiation to delivery.  You must be able to not only SELL but also provide great customer service."
good,"I am working in a very competitive company with well trained co-workers and keeping the pace with them is a ""must""."
good,"Everything is good at walgreens but the pay. I have learned the companies values, the different types of medicines, and how to work in an organized company."
good,As a employee I've had many things I've enjoyed with the company and few things I didn't enjoy. Though the non-enjoyments were particularly important.
good,"Over night manager, learned how to manage inventory levels and employees"
good,"Like every salary type job, Walgreens has its ups and downs. A typical day at work for me starts at 5a.m. cause I like to get to work early to knock out most of my morning tasks (check yesterday's sales, writing daily tasks for team members, check store conditions, and check merchandising to see what is working and what is not working). My store opens at 7a.m. The hardest part of the job is managing team members that do not want to work or put in the effort to make the store a success. It is very difficult when you have one or two bad apples in a bunch. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing happy customers and making sure they are getting the items needed. Speaking to customers and understanding them brings a joy into my heart."
good,Work was fast paced with always something to do.  Need to be a multi-tasker.  Learned that many times there was more work than time in a day.  I worked for a very fair manager.  For  the most part the employees were long term.  The job was alot more physical than I thought it would be in that you were required to climb a 12 foot ladder and bring down cases that weighed upwards of 50 pounds.  One of the things I enjoyed most about working there was the diversity of the customers.  I always tried to create an environment in which we could have fun and get the job done.
good,"I come to work and immediately begin working with customers, my managers update me on new info shortly after I begin. I usually have a task list to work from, if I don't I check to see what needs done."
good,The company's core competency is pharmacy health care and it strives to advance modern pharmacy health care delivery every way in which it can.
good,they make the customers feel welcome and their associates fell like their own little family we have fun when we do floor set overall i loved working for them
good,"I enjoyed working for Walgreens, and helping our loyal customers. It brings me great joy to turn a customers bad day upside down."
good,Working in the pharmacy was nice. I learned a lot in the 6 years I worked there.
good,Walgreens is a dedicated company. They will do everything they can to keep they public healthy however when it comes to the employees they are over worked and under paid. They worry about candy sales. Do you know how hard it is to sell candy to a diabetic? They don't know they just care that we kill ourselves doing it to be top dog in the district.
good,"We start with opening up greeting customers and helping them when needed. "
good,"On a typical work day I make patient calls first thing in the morning, from prescription reminders to setting appointments and follow-up calls. Sometimes I will create fliers for upcoming health events I've organized. I walk the aisles assisting customers personally and answer questions. I work on projects I am given. This varies from setting up flu clinics with local businesses to putting up market materials. Throughout the day I assist pharmacy if they need additional help and also serve as a triage when they are busy, guiding customers to our express checkout or helping them fill out forms to get their flu shot.Towards the end of the day I approach customers to participate in a customer satisfaction survey I manage myself for the most part and my time. My management fully trust me and knows that I am accountable."
good,I worked in the Pharmacy department as a intern. This job was very interesting and I definitely learned a various amount about medicine. I enjoyed most was interacting with customers and being able to help others.
good,"I would go in to work for 7am. Start my register and put my draw in. I would start to count the tobacco pruducts with a telson as soon as I could because sometimes it would take all day if we are busy with customers. I would also count the batteries and electronics if I could before the day would end. I loved doing resets and reorganizing the shelves. Sometimes it got tough if I had a line full of customers and the phone would keep ringing, but it was easy to call for back up. Working in the beauty department was enjoyable also. Selling make up and beauty products I was really good at. Once a week we would get a truck in, I didnt mind that, but I would much rather work with the public on the sales floor. At the end of my shift, I would change the trash inside and out, clean and sanitize my work counter and put all the returns away."
good,"The overall guidelines for the company due to cut backs were outrageous. I loved working there, but the changes were more headache than worth the dollar earned."
good,"Employees help each other when needed, managers were very friendly. There was room to grow in the company."
good,"we were always playing games that would motivate you to excel."
good,"consulting patients on drugs, filling prescriptions, customer service most important in this environment"
good,"good start for an alien like me"
good,"When we're busy it's pretty good, but it can get tedious when there aren't many customers coming in. I love people, so the most enjoyable part of the job for me was meeting the customers and helping them. When I left the job one customer actually made a special trip to the store to say good-bye to me because he knew it was my last day. I learned a lot about how to reset products, mount displays, track inventory and sell products being promoted. There were always new sales every week and every month, so the down times were good times for putting up and taking down sales. I learned that things go easier when co-workers cooperate with and help each other. Most co-workers got along well with each other. I still talk to them whenever I go to that store. Resetting was the hardest part of the job for me. When some products were hard to find or hadn't come in it could really slow down the process. Both my managers were really nice and made me feel appreciated. Even the substitute managers that came in occasionally were always very nice."
good,"dealing with some difficult and some friendly customers"
good,i receive presciptions and type presciption. I learn to be patience and manage alot of meds.I love all my co-worker and my hardest part of my job was when customer would get out control and my most enjoyable was when old customer in cracked jokes.
good,I come into work and ask what the plan is for today. I learned how to be team oriented and working well under pressure. The management is great they genuinely like to help and provide feedback. the hardest and most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers. They can rub you the wrong way but for the most part they make working there interesting.
good,"Working at Walgreens has been very good there benefits are good . The employeess are very nice and easy to work with every one helps one other to get accopmplished what needs to be done for our benifte and all our customers benifite. It is a good company to work for. I have been there for 15 yrs I didnt have any trouble with employees young or old new or old. public, new people all the time a lot of people that live close by are always there for some thing so you see same and differnt people every day. It is realy a nice place to be. I give Walgreens a 4 stare rating"
good,"Responsible for cash handling,counting tills,supervising employees,verifying deliveries,building product displays,stocking shelves,completing department resets,when working at non-24 hour stores responsible for opening and closing,completed daily work list from store manager"
good,great company to work for and i learned quite alot from them. would highly recomend.
good,"A typical day in the pharmacy is pretty tough. All of us work really hard and yet we are rarely appreciated, either from customers or management. I love the group we have in the pharmacy right now. I feel that we work well together. They are easily the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part, as with any retail position, is dealing with disgruntled customers."
good,"This is a productive and fun work environment, but it can be overwhelming at times with all the tasks you have to do. For example, you will have a basic list of tasks to do, which is somewhat manageable with the time given, and then the management will pile on five-ten additional tasks. It is a lot of physical and mental stress for close to minimum wage. Also, it seems like the employees are stressed due to the extra workload after the company removed the midnight shift. In a positive note, the management has been doing a better job at acknowledging employees when they go above and beyond."
good,"- A day at Walgreens was fairly easy. I took care of customers needs both in person and on the phone. I also made sure that their medicine was prepared correctly and on time."
good,please refer to my previously written review. I didnt even work at walgreens twice i worked at Hollister. My review of hollister was i enjoyed that job alot. I like being in the fashion scene and helping people dress fresh so they feel better about themselves. Ive always been a trendy person up to date with the latest fashion trends so working at Hollister was so much fun for me.
good,Everyday is different. Store level is great but Corporate forgets about employees and how they help keep them in business. Have Great healthcare benefits
good,"Work at Walgreens is busy, and rewarding. Meeting plenty of people in the day tends to make time go by very quickly. When not working with customers, coworkers fill the void of productivity. Team work is a must, as there will always be something to do while on the clock."
good,"People were nice"
good,"Eastern Eateries was my first job. i worked with a very diverse group of people. it was fun, different than what I am used to in a job. i really like the fact that the entire thing was ran by the students that attended the University."
good,"We have a tremendous amount of daily tasks/projects that need to be completed, sometimes it is difficult to accomplish with the available help. District office management if exceptionally good, kind, and helpful, but the company does not offer more budget hours for technicians. Regularly the entire staff feels overworked. Firing is exceptionally difficult- a long-drawn process. Also exceptionally difficult to get time off or get the vacation dates you need. Work environment overall all is ok."
good,"I was either responsible for opening the store, in which I would have to be there fifteen minutes early to open the store and get everything in order, or closing the store and made sure the store was clean, the shelves were faced, and everything was prepared for the following morning. Also, I performed any tasks the manager had on a ""to do"" list. "
good,My coworkers were all very helpful on my first couple of days of training. There was no such thing as a dumb question when it came to me asking questions about cashier training.
good,"I usually worked the cashier, but learned a lot from it. A typical work day for me would be to ring up customers, answering phone calls, stock, put up price tags and answering any questions customers may have. After closing, my duties were to clean, do go backs, face, and prepare the store for the following day."
good,"my day work would go good.meeting new people helping with make-up tips"
good,Dedicated management  helped make filling prescriptions fast and efficient.  Staff was well trained and eager.  Most stores were very organized and lots of staff.  Filled between 200-600 prescriptions a day. Learned how to let the computer do most of the work and not have lots of paperwork cluttering the work area.
good,"everything you need to know starts here, most trained, great opportunities within the company"
good,I enjoy helping all the customers with finding the merchandise they need.  My co workers are all very nice. We help each other to get some of our jobs done( good teamwork).
good,Good place to work.  Good atmosphere with high expectations.
good,"It was a WONDERFUL JOB to start out with when just completing high school. I could have pursued a life with Walgreens had things been on the up and up with the company. However, things like new leadership and favoritism came into effect and affected me and many other workers. I held on the longest out of most people I know from there. A total of 30 new hires in my orientation and at the time of my departure there was only one guy besides me who was still present. So it isn't for everyone but for those who enjoy unstable and inconsistent environments but steady job security and pay this is for them."
good,"•	Assist customers as needed in a variety of departments pharmacy, cosmetology etc. all departments as needed      "
good,"Properly filled and dispensed an significant amount of prescriptions per day."
good,"I loved the team I worked with in Lehi walgreens, they were really nice, and great people to become friends with.  They are also very good at their job and even when things got busy, we were able to keep up with the work load."
good,"Walgreens has a good atmosphere to joke around and have fun, all while completing a complex variety of tasks."
good,"Satisfying my customers, new and old, brings joy to me everyday.  With some Walgreen's stores being 24 hours, work is constant.  This brings challenges because there is never a sense of completion, you always have a new project to move on to. By distributing notes to my reliable co-workers it helps get tasks done efficiently.  Being an Assistant Manager has taught me an incredible amount, from inventory to gross profit.  My time with the company has steered me in the direction of meeting several dependable Managers that I have been able to grow from because we both share an interest in exceeding our potential."
good,It is a great place to work. i would say is the best place to work if you are looking for a position in retail.
good,I have been employed here for many years.  I have learned so much in different settings.
good,I worked the beauty department cash register.  I also helped around the store where I was needed.  Management was constantly changing.  My co-workers were great.  The hardest part was setting up some difficult beauty displays.  The most enjoyable part was making customers happy.
good,"Great company to work for, position growth at a standstill. Management doesn't really care about the individual but only profits"
good,"A typical day at Walgreens is full of learning, problem solving, and customer interactions. I enjoy the employees I work with, merchandising products, and selling products I believe in. I have learned about building trusted customer relationships and how to be a leader to other coworkers. Problem solving and achieving goals make each day exciting and unique."
good,Looking for job advancement. Walgreens do not normally provide advancement
good,"An excellent place to work, with nice benefits and enjoyable co-workers. Lots of opportunities to advance, both within and outside the department in which you are hired.  Clean and quiet environment in a centrally located area."
good,"The pay was reasonable and loved my pharmacy manager.   Retail is not an easy job, you have to have  a lot of patience to deal with the customers.  Customers could be very rude at times and the company is always in the favor of the customers.   I learned a lot from this work place.  I can deal with anything and any type of people now."
good,"While Walgreen's offers traditional retail pharmacy services, they are expanding the role of the pharmacist in innovative ways.  Your average day may consist of filling 200 prescriptions, but you will also have the opportunity to challenge yourself with services such as Travel Medicine consultations, MTM, Immunizations, compounding, and specialty medications.  These may vary depending on the location you work at. "
good,"This company is one of the best I have worked with, but unfortunately they cap peoples pay. It would be nice for the company to adjust peoples pay with the economy changes. I feel many people are paid lower then what they may deserve (while others are overpaid)."
good,"The Pharmacy Manager was very cool, easy to get along with. Very helpful and"
good,Not only because we spend quite a bit of our day with the same people but many also have family members in the company.
good,"Experiences can vary as with any very large company depending on which store you are in.  Our particular store has excellent, professional management and pharmacy staff and a positive, fun work environment.  My co-workers also maintain highest standards for customer service and professionalism without being too stuffy or formal.  In a typical day duties are varied so the pace is fast and one never gets bored.  Management made sure to rotate task assignations for staff so team members would have variety in their days and weeks.  At times the job is difficult due to recent labor budget cuts causing under staffing, sometimes at key high-traffic hours of operation.  There is also a good deal of flexibility with scheduling with the store being open 365 days a year, but a down side of this is having to work some holidays. Management is generally willing to compromise with employees when scheduling for major holidays.   There are opportunities for advancement for reliable hard workers with positive attitudes who are willing to accommodate, innovate, and exceed customer needs.  The negative aspect of accepting a position to upper management is that the company often rotates and relocates management, sometimes with as little as a week's notice."
good,"I interned here and for a few months and it was great I learned alot."
good,"The amount of responsibilities are ever increasing for almost non-existent benefits. Management is usually knowledgeable, but corporate offices are out of touch."
good,"I was usually working the front register, with the occasional shift in cosmetics, so shifts didn't vary that much. A typical shift was 6 and 1/2 or 8 and 1/2 hours. We dealt with all sorts of customers, making it a bit interesting."
good,"over all my co-workers was great and very helpful love to train and welcome new people to the team  , the management team was hardly ever on the same page but we did get the job done we it came down to it . the heardest part of my day was seeing customers walking out unhappy and the best part was knowing that I and my team did our part in help the customers leave the store happy ."
good,"I enjoyed working for Walgreens Company."
good,They are a good company to work for but some of the managers just dont care.
good,"Its retail at its finest. I worked in a high volume store,were we saw 1200 to 1800 customers a day. Great Company !!!"
good,"My job include: helping customers with finding products and paying for them. Special ordering products, stocking shelves, ordering new products, educating the beauty advisors that work under me, and ongoing education of products and policies."
good,people were friendly and considerate. learned alot.management was really cool to work with.
good,"As a retail pharmacist I filled, processed, and counseled patients on their prescriptions.  I had a great staff at Oak Park!"
good,"Walgreens is a good place to work if you're aware of what you're signing up for. Like any other retail job, the hours can be very long and physical at times. But the co-workers are always nice, smart, ambitious people, and the management is understanding, patient, and on your side. You will make pretty good money working for Walgreens, learn some new things, and you will make new friends, as well."
good,I'm a part time cashier that enjoys working there. I help people improve their lifestyle by shopping at Walgreens
good,"I have with Walgreens for 5 years, and I honestly can say that I have enjoyed most of my time with them. Even though it is predictable, it is still not the same day in and day out. I have learned the importance of communication with co-workers, and customers. I have also learned how to ask for help when I am not sure what to do or how to do something. My management and co-workers are some of the best ones I have ever worked with. THe hardest part of my job is the mundane tasks that I have to do everyday. THe best part of my job is my co-workers and customers. I honestly believe that the people you work with and serve determine how you view your position and what you do."
good,"Great company to work for, they are very involved in the community and thats always a good thing for me"
good,"Walgreens is a very fast-paced environment to work in. The managers are understanding of things, so as you do not take advantage of them. All of the co-workers I have had are always willing to help out. I love working for Walgreens."
good,"Although not my favorite, Walgreens did provide me with what I needed from them. I had a few issues with certain promises not being kept such as moving within departments, but the offset to this was the job security that was provided from the job and the ability to have a semi-flexible as well as creating a static and secure schedule for myself."
good,It is good company to work with. Professional life and personal life is well balanced.
good,Great company with a lot of growth potential with hard work and dedication.
good,"There was normally a strong workload to do with overtime available at times. i had a variety of work tasks to do, mostly on the computer but also physical. i enjoyed my work associates and made close friends with many. The management was difficult at times and unorganized. The hardest part of my job was lack of communication from my management. The best part of my job were my co- workers."
good,"the company is well organized and the people I work with are friendly and amazing to work with. Tends to get busy from time to time, but we help each other. Hardest part of the job is hours being cut so we have double the work. as for our management staff, we are able to talk to them if we have a problem and they handle it as best and most professional way possible."
good,fast paced working environment and friendly employees but the store managers and shift managers are not operating up to par according to county guidelines.
good,A typical day at Walgreens was dependent on what day it was. There was a rotating schedule of tasks that needed to be completed based on when our order was delivered. I learned to accept change and to be more flexible. It was a great way to learn how to manage a small amount of time to accomplish a lot of work. I learned more how to delegate some of the tasks which is not easy for me to do.  I worked with some really great people that taught me a lot about myself.  The hardest part of the job was having a plan and not being able to complete that plan due to unforseen incidents. My favorite part of working at Walgreens was being able to do many different things instead of the same thing over and over.  I learned about so many aspects of the store including the pharmacy.
good,"Enjoyed assisting the public with any situation that may occure, motivated staff to be number one in customer service and completing duties to managers expectations"
good,"The co-workers, managers, and regular customers kept the job fun and interesting. I became friends with all my co-workers and we learned to work together professionally while still keeping a relaxed environment. A typical day included stocking shelves, helping customers find items, pricing items, ringing customers up, and keeping the store tidy. Not a hard job at all, just requires dedication and focus. You were required to complete your daily tasks which were not overwhelming."
good,"A typical day at work it was normally busy so your always on the move helping customers find products, helping customers with sale prices, stocking shelves putting up displays etc. You are always productive and there was always something to do!"
good,"At Walgreens, we provide a high level of customer service and satisfaction including pharmacy health care, photo development, beauty, and grocery.  My position mainly involves project and task delegation for all store employees. I report only to the Store Manager and District Manager. The most challenges we face are disgruntled customers, but I find the most enjoyment with developing team members and building positive relationships."
good,"best part of the job was the customers"
good,"Fast pace environment, always changing while having consistant duties. Have enjoyed working for walgreens. Fairly good benifits. Love my coworkers."
good,Walgreens was a very hands on environment where appearance meant everything. I learned that customer service is very important in the retail environment.
good,Our company was bought by walgreens. Thought it would be horrible but it really wasnt that bad. It does feel like there is someone watching you always. Pay is ok. My group of coworkers was awesome but they were with the old company. Walgreens is so worried about getting sued that we are always training and signing new things.
good,"Process referrals, communicate with patients, and making sure the patients are getting what they need in timely manner."
good,"The typical day of work is knowing that you would always run into some sort of problem that you would have to solve.  It wouldn't be a normal day without this."
good,"Duties and responsibilities are different daily. Sometimes I worked as a cashier, other I worked on floor which mean to refill and organize products, and provide customer service."
good,"A genereal day included ordering for my department, checking in on the last days sales, resolving any customer complaints from the previous day, helping current customers either find what their looking for or a substitution for what they were looking for. I learned how to be a team player by relying on my staff but I also learned that being a lead everything falls back on me. Management was fair but did not associate with everyone because there are so many stores they feel they can always find another individual to do the job."
good,"plenty of shifts to work, mandatory and selective over time,"
good,"I enjoy working with people, am a multi task oriented person, always willing to learn new thing and follow through on any task at hand."
good,"I absolutely loved my job at Walgreen's and the staff I worked with except for management, they could have been a little better and a little more helpful. I worked with customers and staff all say every day and loved it. my co-workers were excellent and helpful and taught me a lot on daily basis as well and me teaching them new things. the hardest part of the job was leaving."
good,A typical work day for me very busy & multi-tasking all day.  It is very important to acknowledge the customers and get there prescriptions done as soon as possible. You also get to know your customers on a first name basis they rely on you and keep coming back to your pharmacy. Hardest part of my job is probably when we are super busy and there has been a call off but this makes my day go by faster I enjoy working in a faced paced environment. Most enjoyable part of my job would be again the customers and also my peers you become like family and get to know each other very well.
good,"I enjoyed learning about the pharmacy. A typical day would be filling prescriptions, verifying insurance maybe.There is constant customer interaction. Getting along well with your co-workers is a must, since you work very close to one another. I learned how to compound medications such as make capsules, creams etc..  The hardest part may be just keeping up with the work flow if it gets real busy. The employees were wonderful and very helpful."
good,"I have a great group of co-workers. Walgreen's is great for benefits and has taught me a lot and I have grown so much in the time that I have been with the company. I love working in Customer Service and some of the challenges that come with my job. At times it's challenging, but many times also rewarding."
good,Came in went to photo and started the day. Management was good. Treated you well. Coworkers were great. Always had fun.
good,"OK place boring though,but i was young when i had this job, so its probably change since"
good,"Walgreen's was a great experience for me, teaching me great customer service skills and exceptional work ethic.Starting as a inexperienced cashier, Walgreen's gave me the opportunity to grow and learn the vital in's and out's of running a safe, clean, profitable and customer friendly retail establishment.As a Sims Coordinator i was in charge of maintaining correct inventory levels and keeping sections of the store in accordance with cooperate standard."
good,"wlagreens was an ok place to work. some of the management I loved working with,"
good,A typical day at work consists of filling prescriptions while counseling patients at the same time and ringing their purchases at the register.We must know how to process coupons for medications and to deal with any insurance and rejection problems.The hardest part of the job is the high volume of prescriptions that must be processed efficiently and to provide great customer service at the same time.The most enjoyable part of the job is the sense of satisfaction in helping my patients stay well.
good,The day would fly by since it was busy and kept the workers busy.
good,"A typical day at work included typing, filling, cashing out patients, inventory management, and cleaning the pharmacy. Being that this was my first time working in a pharmacy Walgreens taught me how to solve insurance issues, how to have good customer service practices, engaging in being proactive and innovative to solve problems, why it is important to work as a team. The most enjoyable part of my job was the knowledge I gained everyday. The hardest part was having to also convince patients to purchase weekly ad items that had nothing to do with their pharmaceuticals needs."
good,"Stocking shelves, customer service, cleaning bathrooms, answering phones, cash register"
good,"The joy of being able to interact with all disciplines of physicians:  Allergists/Immunologists, Cardiologists,GI, HEMOC's, Internal Med, Primary Med, Podiatrists, etc.  We offer great outcomes for their patients so that they will not be readmitted."
good,"This is an adequate place to work and has a high-paced but congenial atmosphere. "
good,"I didn't work for Walgreens very long so it is hard to write a review.  During the short time I spent there, I moved around to several different locations in the south bay area.  I didn't care to the location or the traffic so I decided to move to San Diego."
good,"A typical day at work included but not limited to customer service, workflow, data entry, billing, prior auth's, filling, filing, stocking, inventory, compounding, promoting, patient care, training, and coordinating.  Every day was a learning opportunity due to changes in our operating systems, workflow, training, promoting, and advice from our fellow peers.  Working with the people I worked with was like having a family outside of home.  It has its pros and cons but that's what it takes to learn from one another and work together as an individual and a team.  The most enjoyable parts of my jobs it bonding with my patients and assisting in there care and needs as well as being praise for accomplishments."
good,"I didn't work at Walgreens very long, Unfortunately, my father got very sick.  I was cashier. And the benefits they offer their employees are amazing. "
good,Overall the job was a fulfilling experience from every aspect. I worked in the stock room labeling merchandise. I learned to make the most of my time. The hardest thing was the slow days. What I enjoyed the most was assisting the customers.
good,"I love working with my patients/customers They are the best. It is a long, eventful day everyday. It is always busy with answering phones, typing and filing prescriptions. The hardest thing about my job is the hours are not stable."
good,"I start off with counting the safe, just to make sure everything is correct before I go about my normal day. Next, I start cleaning and organizing my assigned aisles. This includes pulling out dated items, cleaning off shelves, putting items in their proper spots, and making sure each item has a price. After that, depending on the time, I will either start new tasks like setting up seasonal aisles, or doing revisions on current ones. I also help assist my team in any problems they run into. At the end of the night I count down each cash register, and put the excess money into bundles in the safe."
good,"I am the overnight manager every other week at Walgreens. My typical shift would involved closing out cash drawers, end of the day paper work, balancing safe and cash reports for the day. I then complete the work list left by day shift which includes store upkeep, waiting on customers, photo department maint., and processing orders, help in pharmacy when needed, put away remaining deliveries, clear storeroom rollers and floor of product either by placing on sales floor or in department shelves, complete sets and revisions to existing merchandise displays and shelves, answer customer questions, concerns, and complaints I also process returns, claims, and recalled items. "
good,"Typical day at work is walking next door to log in to my computer in my home office. "
good,"The hardest part of my position so far would be trying to accomplish tasks without proper training, it makes simple tasks hard without the knowledge needed. I do enjoy helping customers find the items they are serching for and explaining the items many uses. Management does try to work with school or other job schedules so everyone is happy."
good,"A typical day starts and ends with plenty phone calls. Communicated services for pharmaceutical needs, insurance information and demographics."
good,"In the photo department working with customers."
good,"A typical day at Walgreens Mail Pharmacy. When I would sit down at my desk in the morning my co-workers would all give me a good morning welcome. I start my day by logging into my computer and phone. Once my computer is ready I pull up the first patient and begin correcting any errors I find with the prescription entered into the system. If it has a third party rejection I will contact the insurance company to find out why and get it corrected as soon as possible. I would also contact the patient for correct address, insurance information, and payment. I learned how to use Walgreens database, outbound calls, and using spreadsheets. I got along with management and felt I could talk to them whenever I needed to. The hardest part of this job was sometimes dealing with customers that were upset about their medications. I enjoyed correcting any errors or third party rejections on prescriptions. I love the challenge of correcting problems."

I was lucky enough to have managers help me learn new things everyday.  I have to admit that the late nights and working holidays has taken it's toll.  For the most part it's easy to manage, but working until 1 A.M. five nights in a row is a little hard to do."

The management team was great. They would sit and type with us occasionally, and always offered their assistance when needed. My co-workers worked hard and efficiently. The hardest part of the job was making every effort to insure that my personal ratings were on par with what was required, which means below a 3% error rating, and an on-screen time of roughly 52 seconds.

good,"as a technician, i did get the opportunity to ""float"" to other locations to help out with sick calls, vacations, etc.  that was something that i did really enjoy"

I knew there was always something to be done and no one had to tell me to do it. The people I worked with were very knowledgeable. If I ever had a question about anything, someone was always there to answer it. I did learn new things atleast every week at this place. The hardest thing at this job was dealing with difficult customers. They were people who thought it was my fault their doctor did not call in a  new Rx, or thought I was doing something wrong when their insurance was saying their refill was too soon. Walgreens taught me everything I know in my chosen field.  This companty taught me how to become a team leader as well."

If other parts of the store needed help, I would assist them while maintaining the photo department. As photo department manager, if there were any problems I would provide customer service and with my best efforts attempt to fix and resolve them. The hardest part of the job was fixing the photo machine when it broke. The most enjoyable part was truck day because I enjoyed working on the bay's stocking and moving new inventory. "

good,"Working with customers was fun and exciting. The coworkers were great. The hours were rough, working 10am-6:45pm, so balancing work and personal life was semi-difficult. Job security was also an issue when the job site was determined to set to close on October 31st, 2013. I learned a lot when it comes to insurance, diabetes, but most importantly I learned a lot about the Medicare customer themselves. I gained a lot of experience with customer service and in sales. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers."
good,Everyday was steady and daily challenges were enjoyable. I learned how to help every team member find there strengths in their specific field of work. My co workers were very enjoyable. The hardest part would have been the tech support from multiple stores at one time. The best part of working for Walgreens was the management.

good,I learned more skills to better my attributes at work to finish all job tasks assigned.
good,I enjoy my job at Walgreens.  My immediate supervisor is great.  He is a stickler for numbers and quality (which have never been a problem for me).  I have become friends with everyone on my team and will miss them when it is time to close.  The hardest part of my job was when I was still making sales calls.  I have always excelled in customer service so sales was new to me.  I did well but not great which is why I switched to sales support.
good,"Very fair job. Compensated well.  Work some nights, weekends and holidays."
good,"I love the people that I work with, they truly do make the job fun. I get to meet and work with many interesting people on a day to day basis. "

good,"The job had some hang ups ,but every job does. It doesnt matter where you are employed there will always be that one person who is just miserabe, but i found walgreens to be over all enjoyable. My manager constantly worked with me. I had the job as i was going through college, he was always very supportive, and worked my school schedule around the needs of the business. I would take one for the team. Then he would acutally reciprocate, and the team took one for me it was actually quite nice."
good,"This is a leadership position that the employee will possess an enriched working knowledge and fundamentals for the following system software (TSO, ISPF, ESP, JCL and UNIX).

good,Good work place. Many quality employees. I made a few long time friendships there.
good,Each day at work I would start up the lab and get the orders from the night before finished. Would have my regular customers each day and enjoyed seeing them and knowing what they wanted. I learned a lot about different people and customer service in how to interact with many people everyday. Management depends on the different managers they had in the store but on the hole are pretty good. Coworkers are great and you gain friends and good relationships in the time you work there. There really wasn't a real hard part to the job as long as you did what you was suppose to do. The best thing about the job was being able to advance and growing with the company.
good,"It's a job alright, but fun if a friendship is built with co-workers"

I have learned that this job requires you to be able to multi task and be able to learn quickly. My coworkers are great as you will need to be able to work as a team to get things done in a timely manner. The hardest part of the job is billing prescriptions through insurances and the most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers get their prescriptions."

good,I only left because this was my first job out of college and I wanted to explore other opportunities.
good,"Customer service based retail store. Spend most of the day cashiering behind a counter, answering the phone and customer's questions. Management and co-workers are great, little room for advancement, even less room for pay raises and/or overtime. Hardest part of the job is finding another employee or management to cover for breaks or lunches. Best part of the job is getting to meet new people and help a variety of customers on a daily basis."
good,"The company is great in treating most of its employees. I was responsible with filling prescriptions and assisting pharmacists in managing the whole pharmacy. The hardest part of the job is the balance between speed, efficiency, and safety for the patients."
good,I loved working at Walgreens! The only thing I hated there was the hours. I hated working so late. So I took a new position at IGA with a brand new pharmacy and they had better hours.

good,"We cook breakfast, lunch, dinner. it was more like a cafe then anything i liked my co-workers and my job there."
good,"I was the cashier so i spent most of my time ringing up customers. I stocked here and there, and at the end of the day I counted my own drawer/register and cleaned up the aisles. I learned a lot working for Walgreens like working a cash register and inventory. The co-workers and management were great. The hardest part of the job was ringing excessive amounts of people in succession. The most enjoyable part of the job was the benefits/discounts."
good,"A typical day at Walgreens was VERY busy. But the relationships with my former co workers and my customers were some reasons I worked there for so long. Unfortunately, advancement opportunities and compensation just weren't enough for me to be able to make them a career."

I would stay the hardest part was when we had to unload the trucks never seemed like we had enough people to help.the most enjoyable day was working that last hour on the overnight shift know you about to go home a nd crash and wake up to get ready for work again.
good,"I am trained in every department in the store, so my duties are not very specific. Since I am tht ease only one trained in all the departments, I tend to do various things in all departments. I help with customer services, for example customer needs help locating items, they can always call on me. The phone rings, i pick and help, sometimes customers call thinking they sent an order to our store, I help them locate their order in our system and direct them there. One thing about working retail is that the customer is always right even if it is so apparent that you know in reality they are not. My coworkers were easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is that people quit often so you're left with their task including yours too and you race against time to complete, not only just complete but complete well. Enjoyable part of the job is meeting people from all walks of life, and most especially the gratitude of the customers when I help them."
good,I loved working at walgreens. I was a part of a team that actually cared about its patients and customers. I learned to be more empathetic and learned a lot about myself.

I like the management as they are flexible for the staff. I really like to work with my crew at Walgreens. There is no hardest part in the job as I work hard and do my best. I enjoy every minute I work so that every part of the job is similar for me."
good,"Very busy place, get a lot of hours but you won't have an outside life"
good,"I believe the most difficult part of the job is dealing with the public. At the same time, dealing with the public, it is the most enjoyable part of the job. It is very important to be patient, to have the ability to handle diversity and to actually hear what people are saying."

good,Dynamic company that thrives on the cutting edge of technology to better serve their customers..
good,"For the most part I enjoyed this position. However the scheduling is hectic, you are on your feet for many hours. No regular break periods. The job can be mentally rewarding when customers give you compliments for good service.It's kind of tough to be considered for advancement though not impossible.It's also somewhat stressful due to the nature of the business which is retail. You are either made for it or not."
good,easy workflow team enviroment. Best part of the job was being able to help the well and the sick.
good,Walgreens is a really good place to work. Great benefits. Retail hours not that great. Prefer a routine schedule

good,Walgreens is a company with very diverse employment opportunities.
good,Assistant Manager position shadowed Manager of store. Also helped any customer problems. Helped open and close store. Also visited major distribution center location in NE Texas.
good,"I really enjoy working for this company. I'm not going to say that all the stores out there are as nice of an enviroment as mine, because I know from experience that that is not true. The only thing I wish would change is for the people in the pharmacy to get breaks. With only a pharmacist and myself, it is very hard to find a moment to get something to drink or run to the restroom."
good,This is a very good company to work for. There is plenty of room for advancment if you put the work and effort into it. I worked my way up from the bottom as a sales clerk all the way up to assistant manager.They do prefer to hire people with a degree from outside the company to be an assistant manger or store manager. If you put the effort and hard work in though like myself it is possible to reach that position without a degree.
good,"A typical day at work would be filling 300-400 prescriptions a day. Handling phones and drive Thru, Customer service, Cash register."
good,They taught me how to Reset walls ans shelves. I greeted and assisted customers. Maintained a clean and neat work space. Always polite with customers even when there rude and disrespectful. I cleaned lotion even when its not in my job description but I saw it first and it was on line 1 for check out and didn't want any one to get harmed so I quickly cleaned it up and got back to my task at hand.
good,"Working in the pharmacy is stressful. Management is not usually the problem, but corporate is. Nine times out of ten, the pharmacists and managers are very helpful and stand up for the technicians."
good,"My experience working for this company was great. I gained knowledge and experience in the retal industry. During the time of my employment with them there was a lot of room to grow with the company, Store Managers as well as District Managers made sure they gave you the proper training, guidence and encouragement to succeed. Fast paced enviroment."
good,"Good work enviroment, good customer service. Flexible hours"
good,"Working at Walgreens has been quite pleasurable. It's hard to write a review because, every manager runs their store differently. I was blessed with an amazing manager that mentored me throughout my employment. I started off quite a bit higher than minimum wage--at seventeen that was a great feeling. The direction of the company is changing though. I advanced quite a bit, but it turned out that I couldn't go into an assistant management position or any higher position due to the changes and a ""hiring and transfer"" freeze. Without anywhere to move up, the job gets pretty monotonous only broken up by wonderful customers--seriously, I love my regulars."
good,The staff at the local level is committed to providing good customer service.
good,I have only worked for this company for a little over a year and I have never seen such a friendly environment to work in. I loved to go to work where my coworkers were nice and everyone really worked well together as a team. It was all about serving our customers to the best of our ability. I have never seen a more devoted company that are true to their customers than this one.
good,"Great opportunties, great people and ability to move up. Its fun job to have and you can learn the business."
good,I had a great job setting up the new stores in the Atlanta area. I got to meet and work with new people every few weeks.
good,Being employed with Walgreens helped with experience. I was there for 3+ years and left due to joining the military and needed a full-time job when i came back. They are very loyal and will help you through every step. You are never on your own.
good,"Walgreens offers a great opportunity to learn about the retail business. They are very good at allowing entry-level management be involved in the decision-making of the store. Because of the company's growth (in stores), there is room for promotion for the employees. This is a retail business therefore holidays are thier busy time of year. This means that during the holidays you are away from your family alot."
good,A usual day at work would be working out items from the back room and stocking them throughout the store. Then I would zone items throughout the store and sometimes help customers with their needs. I learned how to assist customers with carry outs and assist them with products. It would usually get tiring as it would be hard to find things to do after all my assignments were completed and since it was a small store there usually wouldn't be that busy
good,Walgreens is a good company to work with. The only down side about it is the hours. I was okay with working on the weekends until I made a family of my own.
good,"I work in the Pharmacy in the current day. Depending on the location, the job can be hard to handle. Luckily, the team I work with is pretty awesome and everyone works in the struggle together."
good,This establishment was enjoyable with plenty of room for growth. My customer relation skills were utilized and improved upon due to the daily customer interaction.
good,I worked at Walgreens for 8.5 years.  I met many people there and loved working there.  When my family became bigger I had to chose a different career that would work with a newborn schedule.
good,"I made a lot of friends working this job. There were some ups and downs, but at the end of the day, I actually enjoyed working there. Great co-workers and environment"
good,Generally a great place to work if you're lucky enough to have good supportive managers and staff. I had the honor to work with awesome store and pharmacy managers until they got replaced with not so great leaders. It was rough after that.
good,At Walgreen's working overnight I always felt protected by my Co workers we worked effectively and efficiently together for overnight shift success completely finishing every task
good,"I loved my 5 years at Walgreens. Even though I have moved on to a job that pays more, I am thinking about restructuring my budget so I can go back with them."
good,I have 20 years of retail experience it was a good company to work for and enjoyed the customers I have worked for several retail places tjmaxx Westies j silver and famous footwear and Walgreens and target and bath and body works
good,Longstanding company. Open 365 days a year even 24 hours stores. Fun people to work with. Good benefits. Long days and nights lots of knowledge to obtain.
good,"over all that work environment is very good and the management is very helpful, When I had questions they always showed me how things were done correctly, I learned how to correctly handle cash at the pick up lanes of the pharmacy"
good,"Typical workday consisted of manning the cash register as well as helping stock the sales floor, helping customers find certain products and helping receive truck shipments."
good,"Working at Walgreens I felt happy almost all of the time, I had great hours and everyone was friendly. I felt I could do so much in such little time with the dedication I put into the hours that I worked. Overall the experience was one I was glad I was able to achieve."
good,I love making customers laugh and smile while they were shopping at the store. I'm a big people person so I love to socialize with them. I always made sure they left the store happy or smiling.
good,"flexible hours based on need"
good,I work with a great team and everyone is willing to step in when someone else on our team needs assistance.  We have a great leader and she is always available when we need her.
good,Enjoyed the people and my time here was a good job just sadly I was seasonal but definitely a friendly environment and good management even the employees were really nice and helpful to a newer person definitely recommend
good,I like to work with some people because I get along with them and all. I learned how to be active with everyone. The customers are nice and they love the sales and all.
good,"Lack of training for employees, company keeps cutting hours and expecting employees to keep up the work at half the man power that was used to keep up with the labor."
good,"My typical work day was 8 hours.  My manager very rarely contacted me other than for my review.  The most difficult part of the job was ensuring I was on time for work when there were traffic jams or accidents.  I was sometimes asked to travel 1.5 hours each way to my shifts or more, and I was never reimbursed for my travel or time.  I think the rule was >50 miles each way got travel pay.  If >90 miles each way, they would help with a room.  This meant getting about 3 hours of sleep some nights as I'd drive that far, have to drive home and sometimes would close one night then open the next morning at those locations.  The most enjoyable parts of the job were the patients and interactions I had with coworkers."
good,Walgreens was one of my best jobs in so many ways. I enjoyed my time there. The managers and staff there were like family to me. The customer relations I cultivated there were like no other.
good,"Prior to getting a job, I worked here for a paid internship. It consisted of a light workload with basic tasks. Great for individuals with little to no experience in the work field."
good,Enjoyed it while I was there. Great atmosphere and fun job! Learned a lot and the culture was amazing. Would recommend working there to a lot of people if they are willing to learn and have a little fun.
good,"Being a Pharmacist at Walgreens has been an incredible experience. A typical day includes "
good,The company will work with your hours. They do provide a decent amount of hours. Being able to cover other stores shifts helps a lot. They keep you always busy.
good,I find that customer service is a field I would prefer to stay out of. It deals with my personality and life goals. I'd prefer a more behind the scenes job.
good,Walgreens is a good place to give your career a start in business management. If you are a student and looking for flexible hours Walgreens is very good with it.
good,I would say the hardest part of my job was being comfortable. the job itself was a good place but the people who enter the store was too nice. I enjoyed working its the area where i worked were i had problems
good,The job I had working at Walgreens was amazing because I could be around people all day and when I was around people I was recommending different makeup I thought they should try.
good,its work. it has its good day and bad days. walgreens is a fairly easy employer the hardest to deal with is the customers. lots of people come to steal specifically from walgreens.
good,"It is a nice place to work and expand your knowledge. I learned a lot by working there. I work with an amazing team that makes me feel at home. It is surrounded by cultural diversity, but nothing that prevents us from offering a good customer service to our customers!"
good,"During the time of my employment, Manager at this location is a gem !!!  The hardest part of the job was the unloading of weekly truck deliveries. The most enjoyable were the people I worked with to make the day go by when it got stressful with positive outlooks to move forward with a smile; team work !"
good,Staff is great and friendly somewhat dedicated hours are steady pay could better work and open every holiday even if pharmacy is closed Walgreens over all is a decent company to work for
good,Friendly co workers. Flexible hours. Great work environment. Fair wages. I really enjoyed working here and was sad when my store closed.  I would recommend this company although I am sure everything Walgreen's is different
good,"Walgreens Was One Of The Best Job I Had In High School . It’s Just Hard Working There At Times Due To People That Work There . It’s Have Good Pay And If Some Of The Works Did They Job , It A Be A Good Place To Work ."
good,"Being active listener, learning some knowledge to team member’s able to handle many store.lear from your mistake capable of building relationship with team member’s and trust."
good,Great place to work. It has flexibility and great support . The job wasnt hard at all. If you do as needed there's room for advancement . Just like any job it has its days but it's worth it.
good,"Great company to work for. It has its ups and downs but the people are great, management does everything they can to help you and have your back. The employees are great to work with as well but the scheduling can be intense sometimes."
good,While working for this company I able to use my previous customer service skills. Which allowed me to insure each customer was provided excellent service.
good,"Customer Service Associate, my task consist of cashier, store inventory, merchashising, and maintaining the store organized and clean. Definitely a good experience but I want to try something more if my interest."
good,"retail/ pharmacy, easy work, great staff, management gives constructive feedback, there's plenty of room for advancement, if so desired. lots of on the job training"
good,Walgreens is good about working with associates about time off.  They are happy to make the customers happy.  Walgreens is all about helping the children in foreign countries.  They make you feel like a big family.
good,I loved working at Walgreens for so long because they take great care of their employees. I was balancing work and school and the company was able to accommodate my schedule. My coworkers were also one of the reasons why I ended up staying for so long. I miss my Walgreens family.
good,"Being at this company taught me so much, from assisting customers,to getting certified as a beauty advisor learning so many cosmetics products and etc. Helping customers going out my way for them. Managers were great and understanding. It was overwhelming at times due to it being a very popular location. It was full of surprises always keeping me busy great time thanks to staff members."
good,"Overall, Walgreens was not a bad employer.  They were flexible with my schedule, management was pleasant, and the location I worked at had friendly customers.  The pay is not the greatest if you are trying to raise a family."
good,"Working at Walgreens has gaiven me the most growth I've ever had: from maintaining corporate expectations, appeasing to individual customer request, and medical and  insurance information."
good,I worked for Walgreens for a long time and I enjoyed the culture and the people here.  It has a lot of room for advancement but has seen some major changes in the last few years.
good,Working at Walgreens is not an easy job but a very good job. My job was to help the customers and patients to make sure they found what they were looking for and helped them with any questions.
good,"Walgreens is a very diverse organization.  Being retail, it is of course very customer driven.  Excellent customer care is a priority, from the ‘front end, to the pharmacy, photo dept. and all areas in between."
good,"good working environment , learned variety set of skills that can also be used outside of work . great management . flexible with vacation time and hours ."
good,I loved my short time working here. My manager and her team were wonderful to work for and with and were very supportive of each other. I really wish this wasn't a contract position and would have lasted longer than it did. It made driving a bit further for work worth it. I really enjoyed the department of the company I worked with.
good,"Walgreens was a great place to work getting out of high school, Cant say many things bad about Walgreens. It was long ago that I worked for the company though,"
good,Walgreens is a really great company to move up in. They have good benefits and they have good starting pay. I enjoyed working there. Everyone I worked with was very friendly.
good,"Most management are friendly, and easy to talk to. Willing to work with you on emergency’s so that it doesn’t affect attendance. Pretty lax Attendance policy also. Less strict than use to be about personal time off the phone. GREAT benefits. Monthly calendars full of events or rewards. Bottom line is management knows it’s stressful so they try to make us happy and show we are appreciated. They also paid for my certification test. My pay has increased greatly over 2 years. And I’ve had many opportunities to learn new lines of business or project work. I love it!"
good,"Walgreens is a good place to work, the staff is hard working and great to work with and take pride in their work every day. The company has a lot of potential if you want to move up"
good,"Although I work there and was hired part time, the company tends to cater to those who work full time. Meetings and celebrations are often had during the work day so I am often not included due to my schedule. My shifts are flexible but nothing else is, in my opinion. The number of hours you work for a company should not determine if you are included."
good,Great job to have for starting your work experience with lots of different roles and opportunities ...................................................
good,The manager was very helpful and helped me learn the basic of pharmacy duties which helped me give me some experience which i used for my second internship.
good,Good company to work for and you get an employee discount of 10% The only downside is that you have to wait 6 months to get holiday pay and they are open everyday of the year doesn’t matter what day it is
good,"Walgreen's has allowed me to transfer all over the country. Their pay is competitive with most markets, and for those that want it, there are many opportunities to advance, even if you start as a CSA."
good,I like this place of employment it its small and dont have alot of major traffic. There enough to keep you busy and also company looks after your health and family. Plus customers have good experiensices here.
good,"A safe and reliable place to be, where customers are happy to shop and be taken care of. Walgreens does a lot to give back, for customers and employees."
good,In this type of field you can climb up the latter very quickly as long as you stay with a positive mind of thinking and a energetic aditude towards the work environment and customer.
good,"Like any other job. It was fun, it hard, it was easy, it was difficult. The team was great to work with. Management was an eye opener.  It was a good place to work at."
good,They have quotas though for selling . If you're a natural born salesperson like myself it's very easy. Otherwise you would want to stay working on the store.
good,Walgreens is a fun place to work at because I love what I do there. I like fixing stuff and organizing the display. I get to do something I'm most good at. I'm able to get along with my coworkers.
good,"Busy, and fast paced with opportunities. There's a lot to learn and there's never a dull day. If you are into a challenge have to guess working there."
good,Wallgreens is always striving to educate their workers on the products they sell. They hours are good and flexible. The managers are very accommodating and helpful.
good,I worked at Walgreens through a site named career club and helped me get a job any job . Helped me a lot with work experience and customer care. I am looking foreword to work at yoshinoya with your team.
good,"The pay is good, the work is manageable. There never seems to be enough hours to operate at peak efficiency. Corporate really only cares about numbers and meeting goals."
good,"The customers weren’t always the most pleasant, serious issues with theft but I had a great team that made the hours go by quickly. Really enjoyed working there."
good,I have enjoyed my time at Walgreens and have been able to advance my career since starting there. I have worked with a fantastic team and great management.
good,Good organized company. Good management. Fun place to be. Able to move up in company. You are shown appreciation for efforts. They take care of their employees
good,Walgreens was not REALY for me but it was okay because it’s like any other store Walgreens was always busy and I like that because I like to work. And the employees were very helpful
good,I really loved working there I just had to focus on school full time. My bosses where amazing if I could go back I would but the store that I worked at is closing
good,My biggest gripes with said job were small and not enough to take away from the fact that working at Walgreen is overall a good decision. Discounts on all items and a good paying schedule make it recommendable.
good,"Student intern. Did not experience full workload of senior counsels. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate account of ""a typical day at work."" Great people and company."
good,"The management is very nice and are always willing to help me with a new task. Everyday i'm learning something new. I feel respected and prioritized as an employee at my place of work. Overall work environment is clean, happy, and enjoyable for customer's and employee's."
good,"Whenever I had work, I enjoyed working with other employees and felt very comfortable around them due to their kindness and friendliness. My pay was good and was treated with a lot of respect by others."
good,typical day would be coaching and training staff and sesuovling customer issues. work schedule would be a mix of mornings nights and weekend. we were open everyday so we also had to work them as well
good,"I was with this company for 18 years total with being a manager for 9 of those. Only  reason I left was because they did a management restructure and I would have been losing $6 an hour. However, they trained me very well as a manager and I had the skills I needed to move on."
good,This job can be fast paced and at times overwhelming. Once you get past the training and you are actually helping customers it is a lot of fun to interact with the patients and make sure they are getting the correct medications and appropriate help needed.
good,"Pros"
good,"positive, and healthy work environment. room for growth is always available, customer service is a must for best results as a employee. great benefits great company cohesion"
good,"If you are looking to get a taste of retail environment, Walgreens is the place for you. With several location nation wide, you are sure to find a location in anywhere you are."
good,"It all Most of the stores I have worked at have been fantastic, the company as a whole has been very good to me. It all depends on the store manager though."
good,Walgreen's was a good place to work I enjoyed working here because of the management. I just didn't like working weekends or hoilday's overall it was a good job.
good,Walgreen's is a fast paced work environment and builds relationships with its customers and makes for a happy and relaxing work environment. managers are great
good,"Staff is now limited. Need to multi-task quickly as a technician at this location. Busy volume 24 hour pharmacy with a"
good,"fast paced, interacting with different customers on a daily basis.  A lot of regulars who shop there.  Like with retail environment, there are thefts, and being positive helps."
good,I started as a pharmacy technician. We had 4 pharmacists in about 3 years before I moved to the main floor. That was challenging but I worked with the flow needed. The learning curve in the pharmacy is a strong and challenging one. I enjoyed worked with the patients and the customers on the main sales floor.
good,"Expectations are clear and managers dedicate a lot of time to improving the store and assisting team members in their development. The company is passionate about coaching and promoting team members. The focus of each store is customer experience. All and all, you get what you give."
good,"There was so much favoritism"
good,"It's all about what you put into the job. If you desire to move forward and put in the work, the is progression within Walgreens for everyone no matter your previous work experience."
good,Good place to work.  Often busy. sometimes management can be over demanding.  That being said they work well with your schedule and are often able to provide time off when needed.
good,Walgreens was a good place to work. I was mostly on the register. I also stocked the shelves sometimes and did some cleaning too. I got to meet different people.
good,A very good place to work. I had a good team to work with. My manager was understanding and considerate looking at the fact that I was student pharmacist at the time. I will recommend Walgreens to anyone.
good,"I worked as a pharmacy technician intern at Walgreens for 2 months and found the environment, although fast paced and stressful from time to time, was a fun and rewarding experience. Techs run the cash register, take care of inventory, stocking, dispensing medicine, filling scripts, and entering scripts into the system. While I was only temporarily working with them I was told I offered employment."
good,"Very typical and simple tasks that are needed to be done. A lot of it is either stocking items on shelves or working the counter which means working multiple tasks such as the photobooth, answering phone calls, and cashiering."
good,I worked at two locations and loved it even thought one location was in a really bad naboirhood and by that i mean robbed a couple times harassed by costumers and ive had things thrown at me
good,A typical day consisted of stocking merchandise or working as the cashier.  The employees worked together as needed to get the jobs done.  The hardest part of the job as a cashier was trying to keep busy when there were no customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know your regular customers and developing a relationship with them.
good,"I was happy for the amount of time I was there. You do have busy, crazy days but time goes by fast. Management is great, be ready to multitask because you NEED that skill."
good,I enjoy working at Walgreens and seeing how the company gives back to those in need.  Its very important to put the customer 1st in everything we do. The hardest part of the job is having to multitask due to the changing needs of our customers.
good,Walgreen's is a good place to work for those looking for a fast paced productive environment. The tasks are generally easy to complete as long as you do them properly and safely.
good,It is nice working at the cash register. If you can multitask by stocking shelves and watching the register as well. Its seemed to be an issue whenever there was an IC3 or when I was required to take a lunch. This can be annoying because corporate knows the importance of customers not waiting in line for a long time and expresses heavily that it's not ok to make customers wait.
good,Coworkers were super nice. Management was willing to work with your schedule. Provided opportunities to move up in the business. Sometimes it was super busy but most of the time there wasn't much to do unless you were stocking.
good,Walgreen's helped me how to work with customers better. You are expected to complete the tasks given to you in time. The staff is welcoming depending on where you choose to work.
good,"I stocked shelves and learn new information about vitamins, I learned new information when working in the pharmacy, I also learned about the photo department"
good,"Worked there through college and it was a retail job so there's that. Mutually beneficial relationship, I worked most weekends and learned a lot working at the pinnacle  of a retail job."
good,have made new friends and have a lot of my friends come in to shop at walgreens...learn something new all the time..good work experience..i help people when they are trying to find a item and they always are so thankful
good,"They expect way more than what you get paid .dont get me wrong I learned a lot in the 20 yrs I was there . Will do it again but for the right pay !,,,"
good,They are a pretty flexible company. I’ve had 2 store managers and depending what manager depends on the working environment. Some work with you and some just throw things
good,It’s a great and warm welcoming environment. My boss is extremely flexible and the hours are constant.its nice helping customers. I would highly recommend working at Walgreens.
good,Wonderful people to work with and lots of growth opportunities within the company.. I started as front end cashier and worked all jobs except cosmetics before going to the pharmacy
good,"As a Pharmacy Technician in the Call Center, it was stressful. In my area I was paid $11.50hr (which was exciting for entry level with no education or experience). The benefits, discounts, stock options, PTO was all good. I even liked my schedule because i had an option of working 4- 10 hour shifts a week, but there were a LOT of options to choose from during the hiring process. But the call center environment was not what i was used to and ultimately i quit."
good,"I loved that I received my training for my licenses through the company. The most enjoyable part of my job is creating connections with the customers. Especially the customers who are regulars, the excitement they have on their face when they see that I am there working is so warming to the heart. The job can get stressful and things can feel overwhelming. People can be nasty and not understanding, but as a Tech it is our job to make sure that things are done timely and efficiently and most importantly the customer is cared for enthusiastically."
good,I enjoyed working here and helping people. It was a job that kept me busy and I enjoyed that because that made time pass by quicker while doing something I love doing.
good,Walgreens was a good company to work for. The benefits and compensation were competitive and it was a solid company who has been around for over 100 years.
good,Never anything too demanding in terms of this job. But I also don't think there is much room for advancing. Few openings for higher positions without moving locations (oftentimes over large distances).
good,Its a good job I like it. It is easy and you get used to it really quick. Some of the benefit things suck since the company has been changing so much stuff. But the pay is alright and my hours are good.
good,"I enjoyed working there, the management was great, great coworkers. all you have to do is to teach yourself to fast-paced in the job just like any other jobs."
good,Corporate is hard to work for .. alot exspected out of you. They cut hours and still expect everything to get done and all goals to be met. Requires you to be ptcb certified
good,"Walgreens is continuously expanding, which means the stores are pretty busy. Having such busy days makes the days fly by. I've worked at 3 different stores and each one is as welcoming as the last. The employees are amazing and when you get to know the regular customers they can make your day better. It is also very easy to work your way up through the company if you work hard and put your mind to it."
good,"helping customers,and stocking working photo is pretty normal work."
good,Management was very supportive to the employees with training and growth.  Continuing Education (CE) was provided and resources were made available.  Healthcare and Investment opportunities were very good.
good,A typical day of work at wall-greens would be coming in and stocking items where they are supposed to go.I learned how to be better with customers and i learned where things were around the store.The management was pretty cool because they didn't mind helping the new people out.Overall it was a good first job experience.
good,Forever changing but still unique in its own way. Great management great team. And plenty room for advancement. Pleasant customers. Good core values. Teamwork is a must. Fast paced environment to work in.
good,A great place to work not to stressful great group of staff members to work with feels like a family. Great benefits days off paid vavation. Great mangement staff
good,It was my first job it help me learn a lot of retail experience. It Help me understand the customers around me more. Learn about time management and sales
good,It was my first job in high school and they were understanding with my need for a flexible schedule. Great entry level and all for promoting within. Would recommend.
good,"Walgreen is very professional pharmacy. Strongly I want to tell, people learn something from Walgreen. But one thing Walgreen pay less sometimes internal fanertism problem but its allover anyway."
good,"I loved my job at Walgreens. Most of the employees genuinely wanted you to succeed and grow within the company. Offer plenty of tools to guide you through your career, whether it be CSA, SFL, ASM, and even Store Mngr. Many oppurtunities for advancing your education as well. Pay could've been a bit better, for all employees have to deal with on a daily basis, but utimately very good 1st job choice."
good,I loved everyone I worked with. I liked the job. I quit because I needed more time off for school. But I don’t regret working there at all. Management was really sweet and I’ll always remember that.
good,"I really like Walgreen's as a company for the most part, however we are constantly overworked and understaffed. I feel that because of the stress that's put on the managers it affects the atmosphere and people start to become angry and bitter toward one another. It can be really cut throat... I've seen it on several occasions within different positions I've held with the company."
good,There are times at my job that I can say I enjoy working there and also times it can be frustrating to get the job done when there is not enough help.
good,"I enjoyed working for Walgreens, I loved my customers . They were the best part of my day. I enjoyed helping them and talking with them. I loved my job."
good,Definitely had the ability to get your work done and still make time for the family. Management allowed you to do your work without micromanaging. Benefits were average.
good,"I worked there for about three months, then came back to work for them again for about a year....I left with good memories.... would work there again if given the opportunity!"
good,Managers will work with your situation and schedule needs. Will assist you with projects or displays. Management will utilize your strong points as well help you develop more.
good,I was able to finish everything in the morning by them dumping the Q. I've always was able to keep pace by using my counting skills so it was really easy to me. The store manager wouldn't let me on the computers or help customers but I do have customer service skills.
good,"Goal is to give  exceptional customer service, no matter how rude a customer may be.  Duties include:  stocking shelves, receiving and handing out Fed Ex packages, different projects in photo lab, running register, answering phone, keeping workplace neat."
good,"My day would start off as a normal routine, I learned how to keep more organized with my stuff and be more aware of my surrounding. The management was alright"
good,"Associates had to stock shelves almost everyday, and overall learned alot since i was sometimes taking care of the photo department, as well as cashiering and being on the floor. Management is strict yet very comprehensive and nice and the workplace is very calm. Co-workers were the best part since i made many new friends and learned alot from them."
good,has flexible schedules depending on store hours. 401k for fulltime. health care not to great. helps get your certified. and reimbursed after passing test. great opportunity to move up with in the stores.
good,The team is very engaging easy to get along with. We all have a great level of respect for each other and help uplift one other. We are able to communicate effectively as a team which its great.
good,"Good company, flexible hours, good benefits. Feels good to help customers when they need you. Fun people to work with and you learn a lot from working there."
good,The store was relaxed and slow-paced. Coworkers were helpful and friendly. I worked the cashier and handled ordinary tasks. The customers were nice as well.
good,"The job itself isn't difficult, it just takes a little bit to learn all the nuances. There are a lot of opportunities to branch out and learn new things, specifically with the pharmacy. The store is small enough that you can focus on customers and also perform your daily tasks. If you work over 30 hours a week on average, you qualify for health insurance. As long as you work hard and have the ability to problem solve, it's fairly easy to gain advancement."
good,"Typically assisting customers, receiving and inputting prescriptions, resolving insurance barriers, procedures of patient adherence, filling prescriptions, inventory management"
good,I actually really liked working there. Very fast paced but it makes the time go by quickly. Lot’s of merchandising and stocking. They could pay more though.
good,"It was a good place to work.  I left for health issues.  Their tech info was amazIng.  wish I could haVE stayed.  Like all retail, not alot of help.  Wish they could provide th right amount of help to build business."
good,Great management and caring culture.  Good schedule flexibilty and open honest feedback.  Fair compensation with close family-like atmosphere.  Would recommend this company for anyone starting out.
good,"Good place to work, "
good,All these metrics we have to meet has really changed the company. This company use to be one you can retire with but with the increased supply of all these pharmacist it has changed. Pharmacist and technicians have less job security.
good,"It was a nice place to work, staff was pretty good for the most part.  Pharmacy team was a bit cold, but did get the job done accordingly.  I would have like to see more of a relationship between management and staff."
good,"This was a great job to have while in pharmacy school. It worked with my rotation schedule and allowed me to prioritize school work. While working here, I was able to get accepted into a pharmacy residency"
good,Very good company to work for only bad part is a fast-pace pharmacy and most of the time they are short-staff..pay is good hours are not promised... unless you are senior tech you won't get full-time
good,"I enjoyed working there, was local to my home residence. The job helped me develop inter personal developmental skills that have now assisted me in my current and past position."
good,"easy to work get along with pears not stressful "
good,"All in all, I made good friends, had KILLER discounts, and it paid decent. Management needs to know when to let someone go if they are mean to co-workers but nice to customers, having to work with a certain nasty woman kind of sucked, but working with her AND my other friends made it easier,"
good,"I worked her for almost five years. I enjoyed my time there, management was good and great work/life balance. Unfortunately, my department was consolidated and our team got laid off."
good,"Nice place to work "
good,"The management team are great, and easy to approach. Walgreens work with your schedule and a great place to work. employees are easy to work with, and they believe in teamwork."
good,Great place to work time flew by. I really enjoyed helping my customers find anything that they were looking for keeping customers very happy with friendly customer service.
good,Cashier work was pretty enjoyable for me. I like talking to people and helping them find what they were looking for at all times.  I participated in the store incentives and made my job fun.
good,"All coworkers were patient and trained me efficiently. Management is strict but very understanding and professional. Place workflow makes it a easier to work and focus on what is important everyday such as patient medication adherence, and customer service."
good,"I received employee of the month and was also offered a management position during my time working at Walgreens , the staff were all great people . It was a very eventful job."
good,I learned a lot about customer service skills.I enjoyed feeling prescriptions and photo developing. I found it hard to remove frequent paper jams. Chemical tanks were corroded and most chemicals were cancer causing.
good,"Walgreens is a good place to start if you want to get into the retail business. The staff and management try to make it fun. It was fun to be involved in sale events or new product events. Management was strict but laid back at the same time. It is a place that you need to be professional but at the same time, try to have fun."
good,Peaceful on overnight shifts gets a chance to see the sun rise in the early morning not to much strain from management while working overnights taking care of necessary take for shift.
good,"It was pretty easy work, I would come in take inventory, count pills, work with pharmacist and doctors to give proper medication. I learned a lot about medical terms and medication given."
good,Walgreens is a great company to start a career with. There is room for advancement and opportunity to grow. Whether you’re just starting in the work field or are a seasoned career person it’s a great company.
good,"My experience at Walgreens was a success. They offer you an environment to learn, ask questions, and share your ideas to growth in the field. I will recommend anybody to work for Walgreens."
good,"I saw the possibilities, what was going on with me at the time, I hade to leave for health reasons.  The possibility of growth as always there.  Who love to work there again..."
good,"a typical day at work is me doing stuff on the computer and then typing more stuff and counting medications. I did more stuff too like handle phone calls, the end."

Drugstore chain with health & beauty aids, prescriptions & photo services, plus mini-mart basics.This role is not my career ambition; very fast paced, can be stressful, not enough help, customers are very demanding.

good,"you'll need to pick up on skills and knowledge quick as a manager but once you find yourself set in your position it becomes repetitive and predictable to an extent. there is opportunity to get promotions if you put in some time my friend who still works there just got a promotion actually. the hardest part of the job was the curve balls that customers through and delay other things within the store but that's to be expected, its retail."
good,"A typical day at work was stocking up inventory, greeting and helping customers, and keeping your isle clean. I learned how to order and restock inventory.

The most enjoyable part of the job was the time went by fast."

Walgreens has always been flexible and able to work around my schedule whether it was for PTO or a doctor/vision/dental appointment."
good,i do not want to write a review about walgreens. It is a good company to get started but not to last forever. The environment is very different. There is a big mix of older and younger people. Which makes it more difficult for the older folks to deal with.

good,It is always busy. Always on the move and multi- tasking. Very friendly staff. Managers are very comprehensive when it comes to emergency or any type of situation.
