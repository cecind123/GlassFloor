rating,review
bad,"So when I started with the company, it was great and the culture matched. Now, it's nothing but externally hired managers ridding for performance with not a single shred of care for their employees. Sneeze wrong and get written up with threats of termination."
bad,"Worst job ever. eBay has to have perks to keep people great company. Horrible job!"
bad,"Ebay only thinks about ebay and big business only, and does not consider its sellers as people.  Ebay gives no second chances to its sellers, and tries to get ride of its long time sellers who built ebay.  Ebay trashes its long time sellers in order to make space for big business."
bad,Attrition is high here due to the false expectations of when you will be off and the pay rate is not comparable for the city of Austin. management did not manage.
bad,"One of the worst environment I've ever experienced. When going to contracted company HR/Account Manager, they very kindly tell you, tough luck. There's nothing wrong with the current work environment."
bad,Radial is a really terrible place to work. The pay stinks and most of the management are terrible. You have to really watch your back working at radial.
bad,Management did not have the interest of the company but used their power to influence employees to do personal things for or with them.  If you were not playing the games that management wanted they would lie on you to try to fire you.
bad,"eBay is a horrible company to work at first you will think it is great but under the fake face of the company of eBay you will see that management and TLs just dont give care about you or your personal life , you are a pawn in there company. Forget about getting vacations planned , not going to happen. Training and supporting staff dose not exist. I watched alot of good people get let go from the company over the last 2 years over the result orientated company and they were perfect for the job did everything right but because they customer didnt like them and they got a bad review they got they boot. I quit eBay due to the way the company just dosent care about its employers. Take this as a warning , if you like seeing your family and friends dont apply to work here as you will never get time off and will never get a vacation you need."
bad,Se crea mucho ambiente entre los empleados y los managers pero hay una gran falta de comunicación y educación laboral
bad,"I was hired to work remotely for eBay.  I was shocked at the ages and lack of knowledge on basic info. the trainer Zachary whos previous job was manager at a chik Fil a.  He went on and on about his hair length and than we were asked who are favorite super hero was.  This was the level of maturity throughout training. Favorite disc jockey where to go skateboarding. Things normal grown ups don't think about.  I quit on the 2nd day realized I couldn't tolerate anymore.  My guess is eBay is too hip for me."
bad,Mandatory overtime all the time especially to peak season no raises for them. I’ve been there for years no employees to come and get hired on and get paid very well management sucks work life balance is terrible by the time we get home you’re too tired to deal with household stuff I would not recommend this job for anybody that is trying to grow this is definitely a job just to get money
bad,If you want to be stressed out and tired work here. if not DONT DO IT!!!!!!!!!! they do not care about their employees. I hated my time at this company.
bad,I would not recommend working for this company. I worked there and would almost cry because of the worst training and having to lie to customers about them getting there product on time when it was the holidays. I knew they would not especially when they were in other countries. I also won a gift card and had it thrown at me because I did not want to take a picture with it. It was in front of other employees. It was the lady manager sitting in the office that did it.
bad,"It was a glorified sweatshop! It's good for people who need something quick, while they search for an ACTUAL job, instead of signing up to do this slave work for PENNIES on the dollar."
bad,"- Lack of descent management"
bad,Over worked a lot and very disappointed with management team . I did make great money while I was there but was not happy . I felt I was treated unfairly many times due to a lot a favoritism.
bad,"I joined this company with very high expectations. Unfortunately, its more politics and games that run the show than actual working - let alone decision making. "
bad,"Awful, just awful. Worst place I've ever worked. Like fake botox filled faces on steroids glaring at you all day. Makes you feel like garbage for not having the implementation of any basic training that they don't give you. They treat you like chum to throw out to disgruntled sellers who the flawed system they designed has screwed over."
bad,Management has no vision and ideas. They lack vision and leadership. Favoritism and politics . The environment is unhealthy. New talent is the only working strata.
bad,Training class turned into high school drama. When I reported lewd and inappropriate conversations when the trainer left the room I was then ostracized and harassed by the immature trainees.
bad,"Ever."
bad,"Working there was very dull and boring, supervisors were very strict and getting a day off was almost impossible. The only time we got free lunch was when their head office came in for the day. The work was boring and very monotonous gave me no will to come into work, no games or functions were ever played making working there depressing."
bad,It was mediocre while it lasted. Liked being able to work alone. Did not like being deceived and led on about pay! Did not like constant verbal abuse from supervisor!
bad,eBay Enterprises was not a satisfying company to work for. There were too many supervisors and no shortage of condescension.
bad,"It not even worth the review.... did not like it at all, they pump you up by acting like this place is the greatest when it is not.They promise your certain things and never deliver. Dont even get started on management"
bad,"A typical day was like a root canal 2 seconds every 5 minutes across the entire day.  Middle management liked to surround themselves with idiots and 'yes' people while E and C level managers really wanted to get things done yet couldn't figure out how to get rid of the old infrastructure and dead weight.  "
bad,overall not an enoyable job. awesome co-workers and customer are very hard to deal with. thats really the hardest part of the job and long hours
bad,"No where near the pay that should be received for the cursing, angry customers that call in."
bad,"Environment built on the buddy system. The work isn't hard but requires patience. Outside of peak season full time associates rarely get enough hours to support their families. "
bad,very unstable environment. poor management. never knew if your job was secure or not. you hardly ever get a full break. Lots of backstabbing going one among fellow coworkers.
bad,No room for growth. Poor Management. Lack of equal treatment and lots of favoritism within the organization based off friendships and not work ability.
bad,"	Store Management"
bad,"Working at my prior ebay store was a nightmare. Was being paid less than minimum wage for full time hours. Was promised a commission that I never saw, and had to work under a clinical psychopath. Had to make a choice: better my life, or stagnate. I chose the former."
bad,"Bad management , bad working hours , unfair shifts allowcated , more than likely will be working every bank holiday and Xmas day , I would strongly not recommend"
bad,"The culture at eBay is a revolving door one. Don't get comfortable in any role at eBay as it is here today, gone tomorrow. Expected to run around looking for another role or get let go. No job security, lack of proper training and constantly monitored by computer software makes it feel like big brother is watching you all the time when at work. Terrible place and the few staff parties, tax write-offs, do not go anywhere near making it any better."
bad,"Management cares only about numbers, employees are only worthy of their  time if they make numbers. Management is not very helpful, any  questions are usually answered with a question, management will not stand behind you and will throw you under the bus at the first chance. Very high turn over rate my class was about 90% turnover in the first six to eight months. Calls are non stop and break and lunch schedule to the second. No real chance of promotions and raises were few and far between."
bad,"I worked at eBay for almost 7 years. Was promoted once. Applied to 5 other positions and was turned down each time. "
bad,"Plenty of overtime great benefits "
bad,"Management by Adecco is a joke, they have favorites and bend/break the rules and even laws for people they like or to make certain quotas. They are also condescending and rude behind closed doors, but sweet and smiling when the client or a supervisor is around. They are disorganized, inefficient, and poorly led-an HR nightmare!"
bad,"I answered phones placed customers orders worked with customers when there was an issue with existing orders, helped customers get tracking numbers for previous orders"
bad,"Not a good culture at the company. no fair opportunities for everyone."
bad,I was only there for four days and I was lay off my 4th day and I felt like they didn't give me time to learn how to do my job and get my numbers up.
bad,"It only matters whose butt your kissing...I wasn't paid enough to kiss anyone's behind. They will make examples out of anyone they choose, and the people that actually do their job get punished because of those who don't do anything! Horrible place to work and they were lucky to have had me for as long as they did! I consider 2 years of my life wasted. They have children running around called ""supervisors"" that don't know anything about the department they are running and they think that their jobs consist of talking on their cell phones, messing around of Facebook, gossiping about employees to other employees and disappearing for hour long smoke breaks. The disciplinary policies are not followed do to favoritism."
bad,"This company's old, stuck in the '90s. It's easy to get lost in the meaningless and pointless stacks of bureaucratic garbage that are produced whenever anything needs to be done. The CEO abandoned the ship, the most profitable companies of the portfolio are long gone, everything about eBay is decrepit, both as a company and a platform. I'd only advise you to apply for a job here if you're in your 50s,you have no ambition or you live in Blanchardstown."
bad,"Typical day at work is easy once you get used to it. Depending on the department you get depends on how easy or hard your job will be. You will need to pay close attention in training and keep updating yourself when it comes to new polices. Customers can be difficult good thing is ebay gives the employee empowerment. They focus a lot on availability so it seems as if you cant go to the restroom with out it being given the look."
bad,This was the worst place to work ever. Everyone acts fake to get where they want to be. Most often this meant the most ditsy and bubbly idiots available. They act like they care about you but will treat you as expendable.
bad,The company is managed by blithering idiots who think that they're intelligent but have no idea of what they're doing.  They routinely brutalize employees and treat them like slaves.  One of the managers there even tried to control my home.  The man had no business managing anything.
bad,If you were a loner or a family of one with 0 personal life its the place for you and you only if you were a DBA. It was the only work experience that left an extremely bad taste in my mouth and the only place I actually quit since I been a professional.
bad,Pathetic culture and management with worst politics
bad,"I have never heard of a company that is willing to fire somebody when they have gone to the ER.   They were unwilling to take a doctors note from the ER. The management lied and stated that they would talk about options, and Instead of the options I was terminated.  I’ve never heard of a company cell and willing to work with somebody, due to a possible heart attack."
bad,Limited internal promotion opportunities. Very limited management training and professional review. Learned a great deal due to a lack of upper management support. Enjoyed the job and not the politics.
bad,"Management set you up to achieve high and when you fall, the step out of the way. No support what so ever."
bad,"manage store,find items to sell.work when you want too. no over the shoulder bosses,good income, convenient or easy money  goes straight to your card or bank"
bad,"Poor upper management direction and communication."
bad,"Worked for a manager who pretty much was incapable of doing their job function at all and passed responsibilities on to the team. They were recruited from a completely different industry and had no knowledge of the actual job. When things were implemented they were not ever communicated well, and numbers became an on and off issue at different periods. Amenities were great and the people I worked with were cool too, but management was inexperienced and immature at times. Scheduling is pretty much locked in to whatever you sign on for, so anything you plan to take on in life will have to work around this."
bad,"Working at eBay is different than other companies. The management has their own set of rules that applies to them but not to employees, managers have lied about when people would be able to get to change shifts when they knew they weren't eligible. Don't apply here."
bad,Very few opportunities to advance in this company. Management are very poorly trained and have very little leaderships skills. There is little staff retention due to the highly stressful nature of the job.
bad,"They spend a lot of time telling lower level managers they have to play by the rules.  They have to follow the policies and procedures.  Then the Senior Leaders don't set the example, blindside people, say they will coach, but don't.  "
bad,"The pay is great, but the environment is not. Nothing really makes sense here and the expectations are unattainable just for the sole reason that the management is so picky and expects absolute perfection with nothing in-between. I hope you don’t have a bad week because suddenly you’re doing everything wrong if your stats go down in the slightest. The work is absolutely not worth the pay. They give you a “promotion” but really you’re doing 3x the work and are still at the same level and pay grade as you were before you got “promoted”. If you have a question, good luck finding a reliable answer."
bad,When I first started working for eBay it was well diverted and i thought that they cared about their employees. I was wrong. They don't know what they want to do as far as their attendance policy. They are not all on the same page so its very conflicting for the employees. One manager saying one thing another saying the opposite. They don't care about your personal life which i feel is very important because it affects our work life as well. I got fired because i had a womanly emergency and because i was explained the attendance policy incorrectly. I wasn't expecting special treatment to my situation jus some understanding or sympathy and the only thing concerning them was the fact i had to leave.
bad,"- hours are from either 6 am - 3 pm and 3:30 pm - 12 pm. "
bad,You work 7 days a week for a year straight and they would get mad if you ask for a day off  it was just to much for a person with a family there is no home work life balance there at all
bad,"I worked here for only a short period of time, and I was amazed with the stupidity, uptight, ignorance, insecurity, paranoia and other things this company showed me. I was always getting griped at for using the restroom too much. You know what, I'm not going to hold my waste just because it's ""Distracting"" to you. They put on this big show for all their new hires but when you have to use the restroom they get all uptight. DON'T BELIEVE EBAY'S LIES! It's not paradise like the people who work here say it is."
bad,Disorganized to the hilt. No normal systems seem to exist. Endless meeting soon forgotten. Organizationally chaotic. Taking huge regulatory risks.
bad,Micromanaging at its finest.Started great at first until we got a new Manager for our department who thinks if you’re not at 100% then you’re a failure.Its all about metrics.They feed you this BS about family oriented teams  and all but are constantly nagging you about how you’re failing and what you are doing wrong
bad,it was very hard job had to rush to finish  4 hundred 50 piece per hr so it was a job nothing too much to tell need a pay cheque will never go back to this company
bad,I worked there a year and never got hired on. all they kept was temps and never offered people jobs. The temp agency guy was a scum bag too. Terrible place to work.
bad,"Basically, don't work here unless you are desperate for some income, like I was! I was forced to work 6.5 weeks straight during peak season with no days off, on a 12-hour shift! HORRIBLE"
bad,Horrible experience. If you don't like IT stay away. Management needs to be more engaged it employees needs and create an envornment where there is a work life balance.
bad,i worked there for a nice period of time. hardly any days off and when i say hardly i mean only days off you get is when you call in or have something else you have to do.
bad,"Leider läuft alles noch sehr chaotisch ab. Es fehlt an Führungskräften, die durchgreifen."
bad,"Typical day, handle inbound calls of mostly complaints about eBay, the sellers on eBay or the buyers on eBay. Every time there was a change in policy there were complaints. I learned the programs, scripts, rules, guidelines and everything. I exceeded all expectations easily and was still not promoted."
bad,Work as a Seller (or shop owner) was fun.  I enjoyed managing my store.  Working from home to make money is always a plus.  I can't think of any cons.
bad,"The management I had in my department was horrendous. The Senior manager didn't know what he was doing most of the time. And talk about pettiness, he fired two great supervisors because of personal jealousy he had towards them. After that everything went down hill and we almost lost our client due to him."
bad,"Just a job... People want everything to be done yesterday... Mostly about the project... They take a lot of time to decide on how to create the project and spend money on flying in Prod Mgrs from all over who come here and just do some talk and when they find that budget is over, the pressurize the Dev team to get the work done fast... So for a 4 months project 3 months is socializing by Prod Mgrs and dine & wine and 1 month the Dev team has to work and still then the Prod Mgrs. are not available to answer any queries."
bad,Salary Dispute all the time.Nothing to write about this company. Issues with salary and management. Our office is too far away and the parking rate is not good.
bad,"The management here simply does not care about issues raised by drivers or customers. It's no wonder they ended the program. They tried to prolong the program by switching w-2 employees to 1099 contractors, which is when I left."
bad,"working with this companies was a great experience, but not so much somewhere I would refer anyone."
bad,"Learned a lot, but the work environment is dysfunctional in IT.  Minimal structure in how information is exchanged making mistakes more likely, some get you fired even, depending on managements current mood.  Early on, I worked out of email only, no tickets.  This was hell, the customers had direct access to me with no SLAs to restrain their demands.  I had no control over my environment and could only cope, no way to plan or prioritize.  Some effort was being put to the problem recently but the solutions implemented were generally inelegant band-aids.  This environment sets you up to fail."
bad,"no advancement, long hours. Poor management. Good work life balance. Good benefits"
bad,Packing & shipping out computers; data entry; filing; customer service.
bad,"I work for Security Industry Specialist, which have the contract at the ebay/paypal data center.  My management is very poor, the running joke among the other contractors there, is if they know they need something from security management they can just forget it."
bad,"I was a contract worker, and believe they should invest in their employees. I liked the people in my team, but it is very silo-ed off. I guess I would say that they need a better business model and category tree. they are way behind in e-commerce"
bad,This company offers amazing benefits but is a tough job.  It's all about perception and reputation so don't mess around!  I miss the pay and benefits.  Do the bad job for a good pay.
bad,"The overall concept of the account manager is simple, meet all customer needs.  "
bad,Very disorganized and confusing environment to work for. Not recommended for structured people. You will face daily challenges that result out of the incompetency of management more than from market conditions.
bad,Its really boring. You have to walk a lot. Management us strick..they crack that whip and u back to working for that slave wage. You have no life. Peak sucks. 7 days a week for months.
bad,"It was a good place to work. Good money and easy work but there was no upward growth. Good starter job, but consider it a long term job as opposed to a career."
bad,Chaotic work environment with constant change.  Work load is too large for the time allowed to complete tasks.  Management provides conflicting priorities and does not support its people.  Be prepared to be blamed for things that are not even under your control.
bad,didnt work here for very long stressful place bery long training time mandatoty ot sucked sitting all day sucked pay was alright at the time  give it a shot
bad,"The focus was on delivering the website as fast as possible to beat the others to market. "
bad,"Rough workplace, management needs work. But if you work the weekend shift its condusive for school and worth the work. Pay was alright, benefits were lacking"
bad,only offer 12 week contacts like new staff in all the time so people work harder mangers are hard to work with because they know you wont be there long not keen to teach you nothing
bad,"In-store sales representative for a range of different products, trained in all areas including merchandising, stock cleaning and replenishment, customer service and telephone queries. Monthly sales figures achieve on a regular basis and rewarded with bonuses also an innovative approach to product display in order to promote sales."
bad,"better keep those metrics up. no one cares about anything else. great for somebody in dire need of a job, less so for anyone with an ounce of self respect."
bad,Difficult to see how this company will survive without innovation of its products and services. Add to it the high spend vs incoming revenue and it makes for a questionable future.
bad,I have been working for this company for a while simply because I can work from home. The pay is very low and the client I work for is very inconsistent and is not agent oriented. I truly feel like they don't care about the agents as long as their unrealistic goals are met.
bad,"I was part of layoff in 2013. Almost all of those I worked with have been laid off since in the account management department."
bad,"Ebay USED to be an AWESOME!!! place to work, UNTIL the management changed hands, NOW, people are Quitting left and right! The Current Manager over our vertical IS A COMPLETE Dictator! Assigned Seats and ALL, ( I mean Really, We Are ALL adults HERE! ) My coworkers are EXACTLY What made the job enjoyable and bearable! The pay is Already Horrible enough! Now WE have to be Miserable too!!!"
bad,"Great work environment, fun atmosphere, and never boring, different work all the time. Very diverse group. No full time opportunities or benefits."
bad,"•	Lead role in controlling and managing data devices, set up maintenance schedules, distribution lists, set recovery and inventory procedures, group instructions on the applications of the devices, and software and hardware troubleshooting intiatives. "
bad,"Magento (an eBay Enterprise Company) is located in the heart of Culver City. Its can take nearly 1 hour during peak traffic times to drive 12 miles to the location. Once you are there parking is limited and you either have to have an assigned space or fight to find a spot. "
bad,"Ever changing culture that leaves you job status in limbo. Management can't get out of their own way, but they pay super well."
bad,I learned how to do consolidation and inventory. As well as time management
bad,"This is a company who just take care of there customers not there employees,"
bad,"Poste à responsabilité financière et constant changement."
bad,Many great clients and a lot of challenges to prepare you for future positions.
bad,"Not much else to brag about here. It is a job where one wakes up in the morning to go to and at the end of the day, one clocks out."
bad,"This is a non friendly environment. Numbers only, Not about the customer."
bad,I learned to email and chat with customers who were online shopping and wanted more information about products or the company. I spent most of my time replying to customer questions through online chat. I thought the workplace culture was odd and I didn't feel comfortable. The hardest part of the job was learning the different tools to use. The most enjoyable part of the job was it was easy and fast to find comapany information.
bad,Bilingual goes a long way . nut because they were in such need of them they couldnt work with my schedule . even when sometimes i didnt have a choice. other than that. not to bad of a company to work for.
bad,"Asking me to write a review is fine, forcing me to write a review is not.  You don't get good reviews from forcing people to write them.  I am sure someone has to understand this at indeed.com?"
bad,My job was for specific client which I loved my work but it was under the umbrella of Radial which  I felt could use more coordination in the management and structure of agents.
bad,"I spent many years at eBay and, in the beginning, it was exciting and our opinions and ideas were encouraged.  As the company grew, they became weighed down in middle management and lost touch with what our members wanted.  tT"
bad,Very good company to work for and a lot of good people employed there. I don't have anything bad to say about this company. We would have team meetings in regards to different company updates and also on policies.
bad,If you enjoy working in a standard call center then this is perfect for you. I did not like anything particular about the job. They were not organized when I worked there and they made the training a little stressful.
bad,Fantastic co-workers and management. Fast paced and fun place to work. Great room for advancement and on and on and on. No more feedback to add.
bad,"To date, leaving my long-term employer for a consulting role with a chance at contract-to-hire remains my largest career mistake. My entire team no longer exists. The average tenure is less than 5 years in risk management staff."
bad,Taking transportation freight invoices from the vendors & adjusting the bills by searching for the correct code to bill the client.  Training new on boards in research & escalate issues.
bad,"a los equipos le hace falta motivarse con los proyectos en lo que participan, todo el mundo desaparece antes del trabajo."
bad,"The company needs to better communicate its directions to employees. Since what used to be GSI Commerce/eBay Enterprise was acquired by and re-branded to Radial, the business keeps going down, which reflects onto over all company's culture and inter-department relationships."
bad,"Better for those with great Customer Service Skills."
bad,"Management need to focus on the goals and keep up with it, I have seen lot of change in the management. ppl get through manager change a lot, could be a new manager on an average every six month."
bad,Supervising and leading employees to ensure accuracy and completion of all tasks. seeing day to day tasks were completed as well as working with customers and customer service.
bad,The job itself is a peaceful job to work in but the management for the Sports department has way to much drama. The best thing to do is to find a secluded computer and just work.
bad,I did not work at ebay. I worked for a farm equipment machine shop. I was in charge of selling and shipping items on ebay. The management was poorly ran.
bad,"Management was hard on the agents, and some agents matched what management wanted but were not supportive of customers. Many people have been long time agents and were not promoted."
bad,eBay has a problem with decision making and duplicate roles. There was always fear of lay offs and reorgs. Job stability is not stable and room for growth is limited.
bad,"Inbound call center handling escalated member calls.  Management is only concerned about Customer Satisfaction Survey scores, but they do not provide any empowerment to allow you to make the customer happy.  They want you to support the company's policies, and change customer's opinion of the policies, without providing empowerment tools.  You are written up and your job threatened if you do not meet survey goals."
bad,"I enjoyed my experience , but eBay was alittle un prepared and alittle un organized as far as management and project management, not alot of communication between recruiters me and what management . Younger managers"
bad,I hated working at a place that only rewards kiss asrses nd people that know how to lick the daily dicc fucc this place I ha E hate hate hate hate hate this place
bad,Work schedules where great . Work load was very difficult but we all worked together and got it done . i would recommend working with this company not only are the workers there great so is the work hours and money .
bad,"You have to find work for yourself, there is a lot of politics in the teams."
bad,"Fun place, nice building, nice people. Poor management. They add more and more responsibilities for the same pay."
bad,it is a okay job to be at if you really like the job. i like  the job but it could pay more money for the work we do there.
bad,The job is not very rewarding hands are tied in being able to help members.  Very difficult to make buyers/sellers happy if you are not empowered to affect change.
bad,it was an okay place I just don't like working in a warehouse I would rather be doing some sort of construction work. supportive management the where really nice and understanding.
bad,Working in the dispute appeals dept is awful. The pay to listen to people literally scream all day is horrendous. I get that customer service can be bad sometime but this is out of control. sellers calling in and screaming like small children throwing temper tantrums is insane. Not worth the pay.
bad,They talked about how important work life balance is and how we should do the right thing but didn't offer a lot of chances to get time off and policy was too rigid to be able to do the right thing in most cases.
bad,"No proper planning, the result of it decision making is delayed for every little thing. WorkLife balance also need to sacrificed due to the pace of the working culture and decisions are made at the last minute."
bad,"Basically, eBay management does not seem to have any desire to improve any technical aspect of the company. Nobody is interested in new better technologies, improvements of user experience whatsoever. Patent work is slow and incompetent. Engineering managers have lost a culture of execution and innovation"
bad,"It was okay for a job, the pay wasn't too great but they changed it now. As long as you stay to yourself you should have nothing to worry about but it wasn't that bad."
bad,"workplace culture: "
bad,"Great working at home.  Being your own boss is always a plus. You can make your own hours, the work is very easy but it is getting very competitive."
bad,"It was a normal company work day.  Environment atypical due to upcoming ebay/PayPal split and a lot of re-organizing."
bad,"Jag har lärt mig fantastiskt mycket på flera områden. Jag har lärt mig om account managment, e-handel, onlinemarknadsföring, B2B, kampanjskapande, kampanjkoordinerande. det som har gjort det svårt är att utvecklingen av plattformen inte har gått i samma tempo som man har önskat få in flera stora säljaktörer. För lång beslutsprocess på ledningsnivå och tre chefer under ett års tid har gjort det svårt att arbeta konstruktivt. Det absolut bästa har varit alla kollegor och möjligheten att få lära sig en ny branch."
bad,Its good to be a part of such a big and reputed online selling market like Ebay because it gives us the opportunity to grow more globally.
bad,"Unless your only hope is to get chosen for Voluntary Time Off, you and everyone around hate being there. We'd all rather go home than get paid everyday."
bad,"Laid back work environment with good hands on training, however $9.00 dollars an hour at 30-35 hours a week isn't enough for me to live. I also don't think that company exists anymore I think its Radial now"
good,"The work environment was nice. Coworkers were always there to help you, they also were more than willing to show you how to get your numbers that you were required to get in an hour. The only downfall was that you rarely ever saw your managers, they seemed to be in meetings all the time and when we did see them it was to tell us that we didn't make our numbers and that we should work harder. The managers never gave us tips or pointers on how to get your numbers up."
good,Working at eBay was fun most of the time. I enjoyed the interaction with potential candidates. I learned different aspects of recruiting and HR processes.
good,"Lots of sitting, calls in (inbound call center) to customer service of major clothing and other retail stores to handle escalation of issues or problems ordering products or services online. It was fun job but kind of mundane-10 hours overnight mostly sitting down with a headset on. Culture was lacking. The hardest part was every once in while a customer would complain and if you weren't trained in complaints or escalation, you would have to transfer them to another department which either went well or it didn't. I found it difficult to hold down a day job, go home and sleep and then work another 9-10 hours based upon needs of the center. So I got worn out. Yet we got paid weekly which is rare and even though there were no benefits the pay was more than starting a retail job at a store."
good,"over worked"
good,There are a lot of gaps in their business protocol which you only become aware of once eBay has charged your account. I was baptized by fire and ran a honest and conscientious business but that business model does not work in this environment. One can become a victim very quickly to scams and those who are on the prowl for undercutting a seller's profit margin.
good,"Some technically good people. Many in the middle management are incompetent."
good,I personally worked at ebay during there peak season which was honestly a physical nightmare and a wallets dream. working in resolutions was really enjoyable up to the point that peak was at its absolute worst. the job is highly physically demanding both on your legs and your arms also the high shelves in the racks were extremely hard to reach for some one 5'3. working at ebay taught me to be more active and to push through minor aches and pains in order to receive what you are working toward. the management here is not very personable and genuinely treats the employees like nothing but numbers. however I did find many people I worked with to be highly kind and enjoyable.
good,"No pay raise when you get converted to a permanent employee. $10/hr with no questions asked. Benefits are available, but quite expensive. PTO given is generous, but nearly impossible to schedule and you will end up taking most of it when they are overstaffed and you are forced out the door. Management has no concept of what it is like to be on the bottom and the top performers are almost always held where they are with incredibly incompetent employees being moved up."
good,Good experience. I wanted a schedule change for school but unable to get one so I decided to look for a new job. I would suggest it to anyone who do not mind Customer service.
good,"Pay in need of increasing, sanitation of work space is needed on an hourly basis, computers are in need of upgrading, cubicles are in need of upgrading"
good,Great place to work if you can actually get a full time position  if not and you are a contractor they will treat you like an employee but you don’t get any of the benefits of that status or protections no sabbatical no 401k no stock options and often under paid for the same job title a full time employee would get
good,"Location of our area changed  weekly , i Learned how to process and receive   items and product through customs. Management changed  almost every other month  always some one new coming in , making work life hard with the constant  changes."
good,tough physical demand on every day shift. takes a toll on the body from day to day and requires an extra insole for both shoes
good,"eBay was the best company to work for ever, until it wasn't.  The company cared about employees, and rewarded hard work.  That lasted about 5 years and then it changed.  Sad, really."
good,"A typical day at work starts with getting in eairly to prepair for my day. We have a quota to reach everyday, i like to get in and be ready.  Im always ready for a challage or eager to learn something new, I learned alot and moved around doing different jobs. Being in at company thats excels at getting everyone to work together while getting along as a team is important. A positive atmospher means positive porduction. The hardest part of my job was pulling heavy pick carts all over the warehouse all day."
good,At the site I worked at certain policies weren't upheld. One in particular is the no phones on the floor rule. They would walk around and tell the agents to just put the phones away.
good,"Ebay was once a company that you were proud to have been taken on board with but a lot of tenured staff have left due to feeling unappreciated and having to answer to ""leadership"" who are clueless to their role."
good,"eBay has a great culture and benefits.  They have a sabbatical program, paternity and maternity leaves, great 401K and other benefits.  Aside from that, the management is horrible.  They don't take employee consideration into account.  Work life balance is not taken into consideration."
good,"This job is no longer located in austin, so anything i type here is pretty much irrelevant. The call center people always looked really happy, if your looking for a CS job it seemed like a great place to work."
good,competitive and mean. hostile to women. Hard to advance. Boys club in upper management. old technology and design. lots of games and politics. doesn't have to be this way.
good,"Actually the job was the typical one , the management was although good but the boss was not. He always tried to impose extra work on colleagues. It became worst when it had a festival season , the boss become insane that he always tried to chide us on our minor mistakes. Although I learned how to work in such a worst condition and the most enjoyable part of the job is when the bonus were parted between colleagues."
good,"eBay is one of the worst companies to work for, very cheap, no overtime. Penny Pinchers that are operating on losses every year."
good,"Good people working there, management is decent and willing to help with some situations. Will not help when you request for extra training."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of assisting dissatisfied customers, tracking packages, honoring discounts and promotions, placing online orders for customers. I learned how to type quickly while placing orders. Management wasn't very effective, regardless of what they told you or promised you had to be overseer by a senior supervisor. My co-workers were the very best thing about the job, they understood the feelings and situations we went through. The hardest part of the job is being cool while getting blamed for something you had no doing of. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing and hearing the joy of a regular customer coming back for to place another order because they're so happy with your knowledgeable experience."
good,schedule was 6am-4:30pm Tuesday - Friday. Mandatory over time was every day not scheduled. There were days we wouldn't be there for an hour but would get sent home due to no work.
good,13.5 Hour day with 10hrs  overtime shifts data entry quality an inventory control updating order status. I learned the red parier system. Hardest part was going up an down fout flights of steps to verify product with no air or heat. Most enjoyable part of day was break.
good,Political place with no commitment for change or innovative thinking.
good,Ok but not place I would want to retire with. Management ok to work with but friendly and respectful to hand picked co-workers. Not the best employee morale.
good,Very little communication between shifts and departments. There is a weak action plan and not proactive but reactive mentality.
good,"Great company created, huge growth quickly, couldn't keep up with demands from the communitiy. Made many decisions quickly without thinking them through. Great culture, management fails to honor core values put in place at creation of the company."
good,good for someone who likes working at big companies
good,6wk training w/20 of us. Within  a week of taking actual calls more than half of class was gone. Nothing could've prepared me for the carnage. I lasted 6 months
good,The only thing that I find good about the company is work life balance.  eBay was a good company but not any more as management bad decisions and internal politics has ruin the image of the company. They believe is keeping the lights up instead of exploring and giving competition. Work culture is decent. You can get stability but growth and promotions are very tough to get.
good,Like any company...there are challenges. You have to take the good with the bad and push through.  Good company for the most part.  Management tries hard.
good,Worked at Ebay in a seasonal position through Adecco temp agency for the holidays and while taking a 6 mos break from school. I enjoyed working there. I enjoyed being physically active instead of being sedentary all the time. It was very different from what I was use to doing.
good,"For the most part they are a decent company. However the management is very poor. There isn't really a structure system. They do what they feel like instead of doing what needs to be done. The manager will tell you what you want to hear verses actually listening and taking care of the problem/issue. The workers there are great, if anything I do miss working there with them."
good,"only job in town, no work life balance"
good,"No clear vision of where the overall company was going after being sold to an investment company."
good,My review on this job isn't a pleasant one. You sign up to do certain things and keep getting switched to do something different. Certain procedures aren't reasonable at all times.
good,"Fun place to work. Canada takes a back seat to US, hard to get resources and staffing."
good,"A typical work day consists of answering customer calls for a certain client which you have somewhat minimal training on, which can make things escalate very quickly. Learning as you go, its a sink or swim job. You do have resources that are somewhat organized but do not cover everything. The benefits are great, and if you ask for help, most of the time you get great help if you appear to be asking good questions. Its a very business oriented atmosphere, which means if they do not need you, well good-bye. Management is efficient and I have come across some very great individuals working here. The best part about the job is interacting with interesting people from diverse backgrounds. What I have learned from this job is to get my college degree as  soon as possible and be the least expendable wherever I may work."
good,"As part of ebay UK Top Customer Care Team, I support the needs of both UK & Irish buyers and sellers on eBay. Troubleshooting all products related to eBay and clearly offering solutions or recommendations to Top Sellers on how to improve their business performance on eBay."
good,"In a typical day work - I deal with employees at all levels including executives.  I love what I do but the work/life balance is non-existent.  Also, senior management doesn't appear to fully understand the workings of our business unit so they make decisions that work against productivity.  "
good,"My typical day of work would consist of call auditing, taking escalated calls, monitoring staffing levels, weekly meetings and coachings with the agents, and monitoring the daily operations of the business. I have learned to be a productive Manager while dealing with a diversity of agents and clients. I have also become a great team player as with working with my immediate Management team to create a overall better business flow. The hardest part of my job would of been dealing with the escalated customer issues and ensuring their overall satisfaction. The most enjoyable part of my job was dealing with the people who I worked with as we were almost like a family."
good,"Ebay aquired GSI Commerce Inc. in July 2011. They are currently under reconstruction so I can say that the moral is very low. Many of the individuals that supported the company for many years has left. In addition, there is no room for advancement at my current location."
good,You assist customers with online orders an track packages and help customers place orders online or transfer phone calls to the correct departments. The hardest part of the job is the timely manor you have to complete your call in.
good,During my time at ebay I had a good work environment experience. It was a steady fast paced job that wasn't stressful nor overwhelming. the work hours and pay where both very fair
good,"Rebranding and changing the Marketplace. The brand partnership team works hard and strategically to grow, improve, and drive results for current, past and new brands."
good,This job has a very structured environment. They do a lot of business during holidays and will almost let you work as many hours as you like during that time.
good,Good department to work for. Great team member to work with and interface with. Travel to remote site working with other teams.
good,"Work was usually busy, always running around picking out the contents for the order. I learned how to pace myself in order to finish the job on a timely matter. The management was decent, but it was hard to find them if they were needed. The hardest part of the job was actually finding the items because the warehouse was far from organized. I enjoyed that it was busy so that the work day did not take long to actually finish, time flew by."
good,"eBay has a great work life balance with PTO starting from day one, excellent health coverage and multiple team building functions allowing for a strong and friendly work environment"
good,"Unfortunately, Not the greatest job opportunity with eBay. They made many false promises and laid off a lot of fellow employees that worked at my side. Others took severance packages which calling a low ball was an understatement. The environment was great! Basketball hopes and other games to keep you busy. Cool people to work around, But the overall leadership is looking to ship US jobs out the country to save money. Not my first choice for a good future for my family and I."
good,"Working here seemed like a dream come true, at first. The trainers did what was expected of them, which was make this job seem like it's the best job you will ever have and they love working for this company. I, of course, got sucked into this dream and it did seem like this was going to be a career instead of a job. Once you got out on the floor that immediately changed. They want you to know everything and even if you know everything it will change every week. I can understand change but every company needs consistency as well. Your customers aren't going to have faith in you if they call often and then get told something different every week. Then we get the back lash and cursed out. Management is ok. Have had worse. Can be understanding. co- workers are usually great. The company has great benefits and they start first day you work, no waiting, awesome. Also, free snacks, sodas, juice, starbucks coffee, cereal, oatmeal, etc. Gym on site with free membership. Parking sucks if you get there later in the day. This job will suck the life out of you if you are an emotional/ sympathetic person. People cuss you out on the daily or will want to talk to your ear off about why they are entitled to whatever they want at the moment. So to sum it up, great company but people in America do feel entitled so be ready for that. High call volume."
good,"A good place to work and exposure and opportunitys are offered, I would recomend working for Ebay."
good,"I worked in a friendly place, was happy to go to work because of the people I got to spend time with and the people I got to call around the world. It was relaxed most of the time, we dressed down or in normal everyday clothes. Left the company with a 97% hit rate for correct actions on accounts."
good,"I was so happy to join eBay.  3.5 years and 6 different managers and a horrible performance review by someone in SJC who never worked with me I left."
good,we would be assigned a order as soon as we clocked in and you would go get a cart and start pulling the order. once you got finished you took cart to shipping and returned to supervisor to receive another order. 12 hour shifts 6 days a week
good,"Firstly positives amazing culture and diversity. And you will work with some of the best people.  Benefits are ok but bonuses are unachievable. The reason for this is stats and markers constantly change and when you think you are achieving success and new target is applied. Old fashioned systems and processes for customer management. Promotions are all given"
good,"A typical day involves checking emails, attending meetings and working. "
good,"I really loved the training, it was fun and innovative. "
good,"The company is quite large, so you need to do your part to make it small. It's best to make sure you are working within a team and organization that is important to the company though that can change from one minute to the next. Also, if you don't work in San Jose, you're at a disadvantage when it comes to career development and advancement. "
good,"when you going to work for ebay expect to be expected to deliver above and beyond, having being managed by under qualified management and wanting you to deliver crazy results without actually helping you. Want a bonus? HAHAHA- lets make targets unrealistic and see how are will achieve them. "
good,"6 bosses in the last two years.  Very ""me"" focused culture.  Cliquish work environment.  Politics trumps knowledge.  Despite all of the press around technology advancements Ebay couldn't innovate its way out of a wet paper bag.  Sad.  Flawed growth strategy.  Trying to emulate competitors instead of building a better marketplace model.  Same old transactional platform they built over 20 years ago."
good,"There has been times when I loved working at eBay and times when I could not stand it.  The culture overall is good, but definitely helps if you are a software engineer vs.  working on other job functions.  Very stiff competition and just looking for a better work life balance and maybe a company that does something other than just help people buy stuff online"
good,"Con la poa formación que nos dieron, pude llevar yo solo el trato con los proveedores y los distintos eventos, no había mucha organización y nos echaron a la mitad de repente."
good,"Working with Adecco was very easy.  They make sure you have all of the tools and knowledge that the job requires.  Unfortunately, working with them is very unstable.  the job assignments are short and there is no warning of upcoming lay offs."
good,"Everything seemed to change when eBay spun off the company and it became Radial. New owners split the old company into three divisions, only one of which actually had sales. This led to budgetary issues and an exodus of top talent. Layoffs happened after that, leaving people either unemployed or scared for their jobs."
good,"Since we are a CSR almost all the calls that we receive is an issue between buyer and seller. We handled 60+ calls in a day and there are times that it's an irate call. on this account, i learned how to extend my patience"
good,I've not yet met a salaried member of management that has had a single positive input regarding the direction or mission the company is headed. The last year the organization has been under a restructure and with it blended eBay and Innotrac associates.  Many are also previous UPS employees. It's a good ole' boy network. If you're not in the click....FORGET IT.
good,"Physical infrastructure is good, but very lethargic work culture. Many products/projects gets delayed due to indecision.This brings down the tempo at work place. And frequent Layoffs!!"
good,Give me to opportunity to develop myself in the customer care role and prepare for my next role after redundancy. Met some great people and made life long friends
good,Great place to work while it was GSI Commerce.  Has since been through acquisitions and a sell-off.  Company is not what it once was.
good,"I learned how to use RF guns then transitioned to voice pick in the outbound department. I loved that I was given PIT training for nearly all of the vehicles at eBay, the only vehicle I was not  trained on was the Scissor lift which only maintenance used. I loved the teamwork when I was in both inbound and outbound."
good,"Great fellow employees, they will be your best resource.  Selling/buying department incur many changes to site&policies which made it difficult to provide quality customer service. Empowered to regurgitate what leadership or technical team says but not empowered to escalate it to them if it would be best for the customer and retention."
good,"Worked for EU Pricing & Promotions team on C2C and B2C Seller Promotions in UK, France, Italy & Spain."
good,"Very stressful at times, hours vary week to week. Some mandatory overtime and mandatory under time. Pay is to low for the stress level and the job requirements."
good,Manager show favoritism some people work will others sit in the office with management. Pay Sucks!!!! The health benefits are great though.
good,"this job helped me learn a lot about working in big offices, it shows you also that in the working world its not always about your skills its about who you know"
good,Management is poor and executive management is even poorer - seems to change direction every 6 months. First they bought GSI and raved about it and within 2 years want to sell it off.
good,Compensation is low per hour yet you get plenty of time off and benefits are top notch.
good,"This company has a very high turnover of employees at every level due to the lean operation and long hours. Unfortunately, when one employee leaves, their position takes a long time to backfill (if they backfill it at all) leaving others on the team to absorb the extra work (...at the same pay, might I add). Morale is low.  Promotions are seldom. And all your work is graded against how happy/unhappy the client is. You could be the hardest worker on the planet, but if your client is uncompromising, you stand to be poorly reviewed."
good,Rather remain a seller on eBay than work there. Love the culture and eBay as a corporation.
good,"cool technology, too many corporate IT contacts, domains."
good,i was a csr i told order through pay pal and i enjoy interact with my customer through email online or on the phone
good,"In my experience, management doesn't care much about how their employees are doing. They are definitely mostly focused on hitting stats and making sure that customers leave good reviews."
good,"The company is driven by product people, it is mainly focused on trying to keep the business alive."
good,Did not communicate well with hiring company as too what site could be prepared for . Not a very well organized experience but could get a lot better with confidence in who knows what's going on and who can help give great direction for the project lead and team .
good,"Management is very disconnected / lack decision making and vision.  Very difficult to get anything accomplished, departments are fractured.  Workplace culture is good however it's very difficult to communicate with multiple different languages on several different continents.  What I've learned is to be more selfish, take care of me first.  The majority of the employees are lazy and unproductive.  Consistently putting out fires since the individuals making the decisions don't thoroughly research the processes."
good,I work with amazing people! They aren’t  just engineers or product owners...they’re my friends. Having a team like that makes going to work easy. Best group of people I’ve worked with in a very long time.
good,"Working with customers, reviewing their orders, upselling, operating several computer systems. Great benefits, since they were bought out, management has certainly changed."
good,Nice to place to work seasonal.great pay during Christmas time.would recommend they hire people on more full time. Mangement team full of leaders.very comforable atmosphere.
good,It was a okay company. Just the management isn't organized. The people is diverse and a good place to meet new people. Also the scheduling is pretty set.
good,"For me it was a relatively easy job, it just became repetitive and customers started to get on my nerves complaining about orders on a daily basis, but breaks lunches shifts etc were all great in my book, had a break lounge with pool table etc and vending machines."
good,"It's a factory place so no phones and earphones allowed. I was assigned to packing, so I boxed up boxes and had a headset on following the instructions from it; which told me what and where items went. Once I had everything wrapped up and in the box I'd put a sticker on it and place it on a moving belt next to me."
good,"It wasn't bad, but it was warehouse work and it was hot and tiring. My feet cannot handle this type of job. I've had surgery on my feet since this job."
good,"The scale of traffic is amazing. The amount of data being processed is impressive. The tech stack is very outdated. A lot of poor choices when it comes to tech stack, too."
good,Associates are treated for the most part like second class citizens. They are 'talked down' to and disrespected daily. I learned that in some cases you are nothing more than a number and if you aren't producing as your management thinks you should you are completely expendable. The hardest part about that job was not returning the disrespect that that was being handed out by the management.
good,Good place to work for. 16 days vacation on hire date. 30 min lunch you can leave facility. Fast pace. learn more about e-Commerce and online shipping. Lots of room to grow and learn.
good,They have high expectations but give you all the proper training you need in order to complete the job. They do a lot of customer appreciation and have excellent benefits. Great hours. Many different shifts to accommodate everyone's lives.
good,"Daily routine was monotonous but the job itself was invigorating. Management was amazing but had their moments. Benefits were subpar but time off was given when necessary. Overall, a great place to work. Advancements in the company were offered consistently but seniority won in the end."
good,"First, I would pick orders using paper slips, pack items on cart that have been picked with a specific slot number. Next, take items to embroidery room and monogram items following an instruction sheet. Management was one of my major dislikes because they never were organized and didnt know what was going on. There was no hard part to the job except for most of the time you were doing other jobs that were not in my job description. I like to monogram items and that was the only thing I liked besides the pay."
good,"eBay is way past its prime.  I worked in a solid group of people, but overall the business is a boat lost at sea.  You have to expect that while HR has its hype, in reality the business is a business and as an employee you are just fodder and don't be surprised if the day comes you get laid off and lose all your benefits."
good,"The job itself is not hard, but only taking phone calls all day, everyday can lead to a person getting burned out.  Night shift and day shift available.  I work night shift, and it is not conducive for our family."
good,"I thought I would love working for ebay. The training was poorly facilitated. I am not working the job I was hired for, which made me lose trust in the company as a whole."
good,"Once great, still good company to work for.  Large company, too much middle management, but overall surrounded by some of the smartest people around."
good,"Great Benefits, not much room for advancement.  The culture and employees are great.  Management seemed unable to learn from previous mistakes."
good,"Responsible and accountable for Global eBay Information Security Compliance, Risk Assessment and Audit Adherence."
good,"Peak season runs from Halloween to New Years; during this time work days run long and weekend shifts are expected (work/life balance is for February through September)."
good,"eBay is a great place to work, but work/life balance can be kind of tough.  Especially during the holidays."
good,"If hard-work-to-growth is your mantra, then this is not the best place for you. The management values blabbering a lot more than actual work. No wonder many people take up that route, ultimately slowing down the company's growth."
good,"•	Assist  customers with the purchase of tickets and tracking of customer orders "
good,"GSI Commerce was recently purchased by eBay. As such, there is a lot of change occurring within the organization at all levels of the enterprise. Supervisors and Managers, unfortunately, receive very little training but are hired mainly internally. Management is generally expected to work from early morning to late evening with Blackberrys and laptops that are taken home daily. Work/Life balance is poor because of this, but the job is ideal for anyone that is extremely passionate about their work."
good,This job will have you there ready to work and also they acquire you to reach your number at the job in they watch the numbers alot in also don’t miss or be late at work because you will be pointed.
good,I was an independent contractor where I have sold items on ebay. I did not work for eBay within the company. I have sold items from my home as Part Time work.
good,"i liked it."
good,It's an okay place to work.pay is a little low but it's a good seasonal position. Management is ok I guess. Wouldnt make it permanent Ever! .............
good,Wasn't fond of that work culture.They should've payed their employees more and be a little less strict with the level of adherence in their KPI reviews.
good,"solid place to work, its a solid paycheck coworkers are great a lot of promotions are lateral movements, negative corporate culture, very restricting schedules"
good,This is a decent place to work in the Melbourne Palm Bay area. They have great seasonal opportunities. And for the work that you do  you get paid pretty well. If you do well enough while working seasonal they do hire you permanently.
good,"Workplace was very crowded, management lacks vision. Lack of communication across dependent divisions towards carrying on IT development work. A lot of internal power struggle. However, it is a great company with great idea in place. A ton of innovation is possible to compete with other e-commerce platforms. eBay create living for many sellers who only earn on selling eBay."
good,"UAT with stakeholder,"
good,"Customer Experience/ "
good,"Independent work environment for the most part, but working in a warehouse with no AC or heat was difficult. Owners were very rude and not helpful with training or advancement."
good,eBay will work you to death. They don't hire enough people for the amount of work that needs to be done. They don't convert contractors to full-time in less than 2.5 years. They do spend money on employees equipment and will have fun events scheduled throughout the year.
good,"Familienfreundliche Arbeitszeiten, Kranke Mitarbeiter bekommen meist die Kündigung"
good,"This is just a school case study, not a real work experience. I learnt a lot of researching skills from this case and try to understand IRC and apply it to the real life."
good,"I learned and had the opportunity to practice project management, working in tech, cross functional business teams, influence, etc... details in resume."
good,I have not been at this company for awhile but in the time I was there it was a fun and rewarding place to work. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
good,"more learning experience for people who want to be great in their individual field of knowledge and creativity,testifies with the manner that the employer"
good,Good company to work for with all the technology in place to help you achieve your goals. Good insights into new technology and up and coming trends. Overall good
good,"Working at ebay has been a good ride. There are good people who work there and i've built lasting relationships. However, exec management is having serious issues. Very fragmented leadership team and lazy when it comes to getting work done."
good,"Good place to work. Opportunities for career progression varied based upon organization growth objectives.  Mainly seasoned management staff however, some areas needed more subject matter expertise."
good,eBay has a fun culture. They are also very diverse. They like to participate in a lot of very diverse activities. They claim to champion people being brave but the company moves too quickly to really do this.
good,"Employees seem to constantly be nervous and worried that they would get laid off at any given moment.  Many people were cut short on their hours, even if only an hour or two of starting a shift, or called just minutes before their shift to be told not to come in.  There was no feeling of job security or schedule consistency to fulfill the 40 hours."
good,"The majority of eBay's ""employees"" are long-term contractors. They are treated like regular full-time workers in a lot of everyday ways (free breakfast at cafeteria; they can attend ""all-company"" meetings), but the best perks of being an eBay employee (generous sabbatical; health insurance; free gym; lavish "
good,"Overall, none yet. The hardest part is trying to elevate our systems and standards to that which we elevate our clients to. Some expect that we would be best-in-class on all things Human Capital, but that is tough and something we are working on."
good,"everyday uou go to work and then you have a lunch and then you work some more and then you go home.  you sit at computer and work, you answer phone or make phone calls"
good,"This is the great company with best work culture."
good,ebay like gsi was bought out by radial its a good place to work same as radial only a few things changed but other then that dont know what else to say
good,"Overall good working experience, well organized, good team spirit. Good workplace culture, a typical day at work would be quick paced. The most enjoyable part is celebrating the team achievements."
good,Long hours at a very fast paced work enviromrnt but able to work at a pace that is controlled by the worker. Management is far and will work with you at all times
good,Paid 2 weeks training. Once you start working you'll realize how stressful/ boring this job really is. you'll also realize you're broke and need this job for however long
good,"eBay San Jose was a great place to work except for the parking. The First Street campus, prior to PayPal spin off, was more spacious, but there you had  morning/evening commute. Both campuses were lovely, people were friendly, culture was inclusive, amenities were plentiful and available, and events were fun. It's a fast-paced corporate tech environment."
good,eBay is a good place to work - the people are great and inclusive. It's often difficult to get things done because functions are siloed and goals are not aligned.
good,it was a simple job did not require a lot of thinking to it once you figured out where everything is your job becomes a bit more easy just dealing with different people I would say the hardest
good,"Your typical pick/pack operation, was very quick paced. They train you fairly well and the job is pretty straight forward. I was only there for a week before I took a job closer to home so I don't have much to saw on it."
good,"it was a good job especially that i was working on a day shift. i loved the people and my job, i get to travel and have fun with my perks. i would gladly recommend eBay Australia with my friends."
good,The job was laid back and easy to learn. Only problem I had was lack of work they had and the reason I was let go! I really wanted to stay and hoped to be moved to different department but nothing was available at the time and then I moved out of state
good,"eBay was great until they were sold to an investment firm. The company was great, the co-workers and environment were outstanding, however after the sale, the culture changed and the best workers and supervisors departed for greener pastures."
good,"The schedule had very flexible hours, but the compensation for the amount of work was not enough and there was no room for advancement. However the ability to cross train and build your knowledge base was vey helpful."
good,"Typical day at work was laid back, i learned on how to talk to people, workplace culture was more Americanized, the most enjoyable part of the job was overtime and pay"
good,"The job has its ups and downs"
good,"treat staff well."
good,"Good, stable, slow-paced environment for senior folk and parents. The benefits package is one of the best you'll find. But, if you're looking to have an impact, move quickly to beat the competition, build something new or advance your career, eBay is not the place for you – they like to stick to the status quo and not rock the boat."
good,"the environment was fun, they did a lot for there employees like weekly lunches, free drinks every day, the campus was beautiful and they had spacious desks"
good,"Experiencia con el cliente en todos los aspectos, ambiente agradable y aprendi mucho"
good,the work is pretty great if you like to lift all the time. some of the people are cool and easy to work with and some people are not. the is great though.
good,"Management is very supportive, they gave u work according to employee situation, Good salary increment, starting salary is not good but if the employee work hard salary will increase good"
good,"I hated working at ebay they overwork the employees and under pay them,Your always on your feet and they don't seem understanding nor do they see that the employees need bath rooms breaks."
good,I like the job it was ok i jus didnt get enough jobs an the job was a temp job so we got laid off after the seasonal position was over there was no room for growth
good,"It wasn't a bad just, just the hours and shifts were always changing so it was hard to get into a solid routine. I would recommend to anyone just starting out in the workforce."
good,Think it was a nice working place with fun people to be around.The pace of the job kept you moving and also made time go by faster. Hours were long and tough but by end of week paid check was well worth it.
good,"Learnt lot of things."
good,Consistent scheduling. Above minimum wage pay (even for entry level). Paid two week training. Revolving door for staff employment. mandatory overtime during holidays.
good,"Back to Back Phone calls"
good,"Company wants and tries to have progressive culture, but result was leadership abdication and confusion for leaders and rank and file employees. When all was said and done, it was an awful lot like other companies - all about the money and very little about the employees."
good,eBay has amazing benefits. They need to work on their culture though. They have an on site cafeteria which is nice but expensive. Also has a coffee shop and on site gym
good,Co-workers are nice. Willing to help; answer any questions. It can be quite busy with a lot of work to do. Some room for growth however not ideal place to learn new technology.
good,A fast paced commerce company. Provides sabbatical and quarterly vesting RSUs. Has good technology talent. Lot of cool projects to work on with niche technologies
good,Fun place if you like call center work. It can be a stressful environment at times but it can also be a lot of fun. People are nice pay isn't bad and the setting is alright
good,A warehouse where they pack and ship what you order online.  you will pick and sort and ship the orders that are generated from online orders.  there are jobs where you recieve the product in
good,"Work/Life balance was worst I've experienced in 20 years.  Leadership managed by fear.  Executive vision and culture was a positively incomparable fun, energetic atmosphere. Great cross-functional teams to work with, but direct team was very individually competitive leaving a bad taste in anyone's mouth."
good,eBay is a good place to work. I would go back to eBay if I found the right opportunity.  The only issue with eBay is the inability to advance your career there.
good,I enjoyed by time at eBay because I had a great managers.  She had the ability to recognize strengths and weaknesses.  I liked that she held people accountable for producing a good product.
good,Posted postings of CE items to be resold on Ebay. Took pictures and wrote descriptions about the product. The hardest part about this job was to find what to write about the product when you didn't have all the information when they give to the task to do.
good,Full of life lots of people in and out. many interesting characters. Always extra work time available and constant feedback there for your growth in your profession.
good,A good starter job where you can gain valuable experience in the warehouse industry. Not a lot of room for advancement and the pay is low. There is a high turnover rate and very few full time employees.
good,"Working at eBay wasn't terrible, but I don't agree that it's one of the best places to work in Texas. The managers were never there and training wasn't all that thorough."
good,I have a lot experience with ebay.. i was very hard work on gift wrap who they want us wrap gifts from order and i have to follow thier order any color with gift wrap..
good,"I came in at a time of increasing company change and instability. Very kind people but not much direction. Managed the integration strategies of multiple companies with EBay’s enterprise system. Designed the technical solution for the transitioning of multiple, disparate platforms into a large enterprise ecommerce environment. Worked with many different teams and technologies to enable new, highly functional and high performing solutions including new web solutions, Omni-channel configurations, Affiliate marketing, mobile architecture and strategy, Search Engine Optimization, and supply chain management.  Estimated project costs, delivery and maintenance costs, budget forecasts, and total return on investment."
good,"Typical day at work would involve handling customer escalations as well as back line work dealing with Warehouses directly through email correspondence.  "
good,"Call Center was in transition while I was working there, gets pretty busy and hectic around the holidays here, pleasant staff sometime serve up pizza and promotional stuff to employees, Nice break area"
good,Great place to work with great people to work with.  eBay treat their full-time employees great but they treat contract employees terrible.  Contractors are forced to take two weeks off during Christmas time with out pay and you may or may not get to work 40 hours a week.  When Sr. Management comes into town they take the full-time employees out for lunch but not the contract employees.  Only given a two day notice before the contract ended.
good,"I work at home on my own free time, package and print labels out, send them yo UPS or USPS for shipping and handling. I also order and receive plenty of items when purchasing."
good,"None, It was ok for a call center.Typical call center setting, management was ok for the most part. once I started doing management team lead work it was better"
good,On a typical day we would sign into a computer and sign into all necessary programs and then start taking phone calls and answering customer questions and taking customer orders.
good,"I did like working at Ebay/GSI Commerce, great warehouse experience for those who have not worked in that type of field. The only problem I had with it was the distance from my home to work, but overall working there was good."
good,Work real hard to get to the next level (glass ceiling). Good place to start out your career and get great exposure to situations related to your career.
good,good work experience learned a lot how to despatch how to organize deliveries for the drivers how to sell products on ebay
good,"I wasn't there long, but it seemed better direction was needed. They acquired a lot of smaller firms, only to let those folks go."
good,"A taxing contradiction of highs and lows in moral, sociality and ethics. A gravitation for those less burdened with acumen."
good,"on a typical day there you'd walk up to 10miles during yourself"
good,fast pace work environment.  Management changes hands frequently.  Company going through a split on top of that they are using many new systems.
good,"This is the kind of job that I doubt I could stand for more than two years. Yes, it seems easy (from an outsider looks in perspective). We get to sit down for 8-hours a day and basically do nothing. (Almost) all of the information is laid out in front of you, and you just need to assist the customers in the best way that you can. It sounds great, and simple (which it honestly is) if it weren't for the people who are actually calling. I would say about 90% of the contacts you receive are because the person is experiencing some sort of problem. Many people are angry, and they are not afraid to take it out on you. It's not that I as an agent take it personally, however the negative vibes definitely wear you out. After a full-time work week of hearing people complaining, moaning, cursing at you, and basically calling you the biggest idiot they have ever had the displeasure of speaking to, you wonder how some people have done it five days a week for 5, 10, 15 years. I could never. I would literally rather do ANYTHING else than work at this company longer than I have to. "
good,"Took pictures of goods, priced and uploaded items for sale for a professional seller. A Simple job that requires a lot of attention to detail and quick computer skills."
good,"eBay let me have an impact to thousands of people. eBay has the scale to better the lives of hundreds of millions of people, and for the most part they try to do just that.  Good work-life balance and good compensation."
good,"Training was amazing and I loved working with all different kinds of people. The job wasn't for me, but I believe I had taken a lot from this training class."
good,"Ebay is a fun job to work at you get to meet new people, you get to see when the customer service experiment is like, taking calls placing orders, troubleshooting."
good,Good environment to be in. Not sure about how advancement really work as their was no clear direction on a path set out for individuals. Good improve software and company internal resources in order to compete with fast developing companies .
good,"Fast paced, productive, fun. Kept moving, learned how to use a ""RF GUN"". At some points didn't get along with supervisor. Other than that it was cool."
good,Productive and organized factory and learned to workaccordingly and on time to every position according to producing quanities of solutions to trial and error. Co-workers were friendly and never interrupting production but could have been more prompt with working the assigned job criterias without much trial and error.
good,Work delegation needs to be improved upon. Can learn new technologies.
good,"* 7:00am to 3:30pm with 2 fifteen minute breaks and half hour lunch                     break. Operating power equipment placing inventory."
good,"Taken over sick organization, so rebuilding the team in both from architecture point of view and also have to lead them become high performing teams."
good,"Would take customer service calls for 9 different websites, from pet items, coffee, shipping memberships, sporting goods, home dacore."
good,Management can be hit or miss. Ebay-California gives little thought to King of Prussia. No real e-commerce feel to the operation. Excellent Caf.
good,Fun place to work and great social environment.  Fun use with computers while also using the phones to talk to customers.
good,A job that fairly compensates you for the work you do. People are friendly and management makes you feel as though they actually care about your life outside the company.
good,"Worked with eBay team"
good,"Not too bad.  It was ok. "
good,"Not the best of places to work but it has some good things about it. Very dynamic environment with technology, projects, etc."
good,"A typical day involved helping out the facilities team, delivering post, setting up meeting rooms, covering reception and things of a similiar ilk."
good,Great company learned a lot about infrastructure positive people 
good,"eBay is a fabulous company to work for, the benefits are incredible. The ability to make change, roll out streamlined policy/procedure is not possible. Overall job satisfaction / happiness in the workplace was low for myself. This is the reason why I ultimately left the company."
good,"My typical day at work involves, producing analysis of previous days performance, and communicating these to the clients. I am also responsible for ensuring the advisors are ready to handle calls and emails according to flow dictated by the customers."
good,Receptionist Responsibilities:
good,"Stats mean more than quality. My advice if ya work there, Dont care about the peoples problems just get them off the phone"
good,"eBay has a flexible work environment. You can work remotely and you feel comfortable setting your own hours. The culture is fun, however change happens often thus teams get re-organized every few months. Moving up is hard and if you do not have a champion, it is almost impossible."
good,"I got the opportunity to be my own boss and make my own hours.  I liked researching my products that I posted."
good,It was really fun working with the management as they gave me a space to showcase my skills. The most enjoable part was Team lunches where we used to have immense fun within the team.
good,Lavoro svolto durante il periodo universitario. Formativo
good,ebay is a get place to get what you want in a couple of days.if you you need to pay some bills are try to get a car in 2 mouths then this is the job for you
good,"Great people, relaxed, just don't be an idiot. Don't take something for granted. Business is always picking up so always stay on your toes. It's not always fun stuff to do but make the most of it."
good,"The only reason to stay is the people. Everyone is really great, it's just the companies strategy is strictly about the clients. While I get that outlook, they rarely look at retention on good talent that they have which is sad."
good,They could have paid more for the knowledge you had to have for so many different departments. They pay their employees for many holidays that I am pretty sure other companies dont pay for.
good,Many marketing roles are now outsourced overseas. Tough to find the role you want these days. All in all most managers are good about helping you achieve work-life balance. Holiday season is brutal and work life balance will be challenged. At times eBay gets ahead of itself and tried to implement without proper infrastructure in place. At least that’s how it was in marketing.
good,EBay was by far one of the best jobs I've ever had. Ebay is a company where you can start on the ground floor and go as far as you want based on your own job successes.
good,It was a good place to work for someone who needs fast or seasonal employment. I worked there seasonally through a recruiting company and it was a good job.
good,"Company was great until its last year, when they sun-setted our platform and we no longer had anything to sell.  No real advancement opportunities though."
good,"fun place, i developed and trained my skills to be a leader, a team player and a productive worker, loyalty, attitude towards work and initiative are those major characters that i have inherited."
good,eBay really helped make you feel like they wanted you there. There were unlimited drinks and you could work at the on site GYM at any hour of the day or night.
good,If you want long hours you will find it here. Which can be a good and a bad thing. Yeah everyone needs the money but at the same time the astomspare of the whole place is kind of a downer so it just makes it a hard company to work for. They have very strict policys but they do offer alot of free lunches and a turkey at thanksgiving and ham at christmas. Every holiday they try and offer either a lunch and a gift or raffles.
good,"Wonderful environment to work in along with a wonderful staff of coworkers and managers. Growth opportunities could be more available along with better job security, but the compensation is definitely better then the industry standard."
good,Everyone at this company was great all the way to upper management. They treated you as a person not a temp employee during the peak season.
good,Manage SharePoint service request and assign to IT team (off shore and on shore). Take requirement from the Business users and create a ticket in the SharePoint Ticket system and assign ticket to the SP ops team.
good,Handled calls learned to follow script dealing with fraud hardest part and upset customers cursing at me. Most enjoyable part of job coworkers and managers.
good,Very stressful job. Sports had very poor management. Floor walkers were rude. Became very difficult to find help when needed. Co-workers were very kind. Hardest part was it became very mentally draining.
good,Good company in terms of Salary. Work life balance is bad. No job Security. Management decisions are not transparent. The workplace environment is good.
good,work day was simple with the incoming callers.  A small amount of the management and some co-workers lacked in professionalism. In order to excel self-motivation is a mandatory thing. Majority of the co-workers was a pleasure to be around making you want to do overtime.
good,Work delegation is poor. Constantly changing deadlines for implementation.
good,"A typical day at work is dealing with various customer issues by telephone and some by email. It could be a business related query, the customer may not be happy with a review one of their customers left them or it could be a technical query."
good,Working on eBay my work day would typically begin at 10 am I would get the items together that needed to be listed on that day. I would prep the items (example : counting stamps and putting them in order to be scanned into the computer). This job required a bit of patience due to the fact that we would have to wait on the auctions to be over to send the items off. I enjoyed working with co workers and being part of a team it helped when questions arose. the hardest part of the job had to be organizing the merchandise such as stamps or documents as for the tended to be a bit time consuming. all in all I found this job to be quite enjoyable as for I like working on computers and I liked being able to work with the valuable merchandise.
good,eBay is pretty good place to work for depending on the division
good,"Other than customers being very hard to deal with all the time, the supervisors were always ready and willing to help everyone out. A great first job."
good,"The company is wonderful but the people are so egoistic. I wouldn't say the majority of the people are bad but people are not friendly. Even though, the company provides diversity people are not friendly. There are people who do not work but nobody says anything due to headcount problem. If they fire that person it is not sure to take someone else. This is not nice."
good,"If you are looking for a job coming fresh out of high school or just something temporary, Radial is the perfect place. Keep in mind, that is all this place is in my opinion, a stepping stone. Although some have made careers out of the place by earning a spot in management, not a big percentage of people can do that, so my advice is to just use Radial as a place to get some good holiday money while searching for a better, more financially rewarding career. I will say the management is probably the best part about Radial, and the supervisors/leads. I had personal relationships with my supervisor and the manager, they were both amazing people. There are a HUGE variety of people that work here, especially over peak. African, Brazilian, European, everything. And that's a good thing, well... Can be. Sometimes you get those young, crazy, drama starting people over peak that really make your life harder than it needs to be but, that isn't all of the time. Every job has it's drama at some extent."
good,eBay brought out a company i worked for called Gsi commerce m. It was as a nice place to work but didn’t pay enough to raise a family. I learned to drive a lot of equipment there
good,"Warehousing was fun and fast paced, you were constantly around your co-workers to have people to talk to while maintaining your work speed. Never left doing one job all day, often you  were moved to another section."
good,Good opportunity to learn different aspects of fraud in e-commerce/retail space.   I've learned multiple aspects of the fraud business throughout my career here.
good,Too many events occurring at one time nationally and globally to keep up with. Too many meetings to be totally productive. Too many on the fly changes and misinformation form SMEs
good,There was good and interesting work to be done with people who wanted to accomplish good things. eBay is going through some big changes and helping to change that has been fulfilling. The politics were extremely difficult to navigate across multiple llocations
good,While I was there in those short three months I have learned a lot. I learned how to assist our customers the right way and soon I was promoted. I think actually talking to the customers was the scary part of my job because I felt like I was going to mess up something. But the most fun I had was actually doing the refunds and stuff.
good,"My work day was filled with a variety of duties beyond my main duties as the eBay clerk. I was also the patrol clerk, which  required attention to detail to ensure everyone was paid correctly. I also assisted other team members m]when my world load allowed."
good,I had a good time. It helped me practice my skills in a professional work environment while I helped people achieve their goals in the real world. It was an enriching experience.
good,Great company with startup culture and seasoned leadership team that is trying to reinvent itself in the ultra competitive but rapidly growing e-commerce market.
good,"Benefits are great, pay is not that bad, and we used to have cool in office perks like beer on fridays and christmas parties."
good,Fun environment with tons of perks. Great job for college graduates. Good benefits. Compensation isnt the best. Would recommend.
good,Great place to work. Fun staffing and great management team. Good customer service experience. Energetic environment and comfortable work areas.
good,"eBay is an okay place to work, but they don't care about family. So if you have small children better make arrangements if they are sick or have dr appointments"
good,"Great support from management with constant feedback and clarification"
good,"Work is simple to log in, the work at home offers are great. I have grown and met many people throughout the 4 1/2 years I've worked for this company."
good,"Factory reset all electronics"
good,"pretty good work/life balance, company culture is ok. bad management. have top level road map but unable to implement it in every department. too many re-orgs"
good,"The work on the floor was difficult, lots of difficult phone calls. The people, management, and atmosphere was great and that helped make the job much more enjoyable. "
good,Amazing team to work with. Very good environment. Learned new products. Sometimes I felt I am going away from own expertise but at the same time they give enough time to learn a new skill. no pressure.
good,Not a dynamic organization. Most of the people I worked with moved on to other companies. Benefits are a bit below average for a large tech company in the Silicon Valley.
good,"It was great to work with the team, however, I was looking to work in a different career field- events management, therefore, I had to move on. "
good,"detail-oriented, work well under pressure and on deadline, enjoy working with a variety of people, and have a great attitude.  I’m looking for a creative, challenging, growth oriented position and would like the opportunity to learn more about the position and get more experience"
good,"I was happy working at eBay classifieds, although they had allowed their iOS code base to deteriorate over the years, and had no plan to refactor it.  This issue caused numerous problems.  "
good,A typical workday at Ebay was packing or picking. You have to maintain a certain percentage each day. You learn the codes on the computer and the codes on the scanners if you are a picker. The co-workers are nice and good to get along with. The job is not hard at all. The most enjoyable part of the job was going to work and working with people you got along with and built relationships with. It makes the job much better because you can pack with one other employee in your pack station.
good,Opportunity to take on new challenges but highly political the higher up you go.  Finance leaders seem to need to come from GE or people who are willing to step on others' backs to get that promotion.
good,"Had an awesome IT Manager, did fun and enjoyable work. But was paid way below the average minimum for IT."
good,"A typical day included dozens of service calls. I learned to effectively solve various consumer issues/complaints without further upsetting him/her. Another great aspect of working here is the family atmosphere projected by upper management & fellow co-workers. I especially enjoyed being a temporary supervisor (floorwalker) to my fellow employees. However, the most difficult aspect of the job would have to be assisting unruly callers without sounding negative or condescending."
good,"The management there have their problem, but really these days who doesn't."
good,"I have taught myself both systems that the warehouse ran off of to run my reports and BOL's. "
good,This used to be a smaller company with values and an identity. They have grown so fast and have lost so much along the way. They have become a prime example of a modern U.S. corporation with little in the way of human values thrown in and only a look at the bottom line.
good,"Good technologies, in demand skills, growing industry but poor top management and vision and lack of execution. Talented engineers and good work life balance"
good,I like working at eBay. They have great benefits and also have a great work and home life balance. I got reimbursement to take the train to work every day and also got 12 weeks of paid paternity leave. The only thing i don't like is the career advancement. They don't take every candidate into consideration equally.
good,"It was good to work here, and exposure to lot of new technologies"
good,"Work/life balance encouraged"
good,Great place to work if thinking about the companies and people you work with. Love my day to day but compensation is something to be desired.
good,Fun and exciting company to work for.  Innovative and constantly adding new ways to improve.
good,Ebay enterprise was an amazing place to work very fast paced and a lot of room for growth.
good,"Este es un empleo temporal, donde deseas hacer dinero mientras sigues buscando. No permite estabilidad laboral ni posibilidad de crecimiento, su ambiente es muy amigable y divertido, pero no se compensa con serio ni profesional. Es el sitio perfecto para el primer empleo de alguien pero no para desarrollar carrera ni para tener aspiraciones. "
good,"I loved being able to work from home and help manage my brothers company he started with E-Commerce.You don't deal directly with E-bay, and that's all the better as well."
good,"Great Job! Great team to work with, daily job variations, shipping, receiving, store clerk, cashier, front room merchandiser, product installer, web site designer, eBay management of all items on eBay and all paperwork that goes along with it."
good,"Most people may not consider this, but where you work is only one important factor. A major factor is the people you work with as well as for. You want to have Managers who care about your growth and care about the company, as well as fellow employees who are teaching correctly to the new comers and actually acknowledge concerns of them. This company is much like this, though the hiring team are very disrespectful and always looking for and making excuses."
good,I learn there how to work using RF scanner. My co-workers are very good and helpful. tthe most enjoyable part of job is everyone work independently . no one is depend on any other. Management is also very good.
good,"I’ve been at eBay for quite some time now and I feel like I have been stagnant for the majority of that time, because of the unachievable metrics that the agents are given there, and what it takes, in their opinion, to “master the role” to be able to advance. Myself, alongside several others, are great at our jobs but are not getting the recognition we deserve, and those people end up leaving. The response I receive when I bring that up to leadership is that “turnover is to be expected “"
good,To work in ebay is very good experience. Had a chance to learn new things.work  environment was great. Had a chance to work with best team. Management is also  quite good.
good,"Days would vary. Usually customer service, listing and shipping throughout the week."
good,Very typical customer service job usually seasonal. Gets bought out every 5 years. Only real industry in the community so it is a great place to start if you are in school or want to advance in life.
good,Potential to be a great company and really challenge Amazon. Inconsistent senior leadership creates a lot of conflicting priorities and doesn’t leverage our great assets.
good,"it is like a high school, everyone gossips, is loud and annoying, There are clicks and you are judged the second you walk in. You are expected to do more than your job title on a daily bases with no compensation. Supervisors are children that got picked to be in that position as favorites by their peers."
good,"eBay is a great company.  That should be the end of the story but there are so many layers of management that making decisions is impossible.  Those with the authority to make decisions are so disconnected from the work being done that they pull the people doing the work in one direction after another without rhyme or reason.  "
good,"Challenging, but boring every days  work. I learned the courteous way of serving employees through valet parking. Pro Park company manages well with the customers' parking organization. I found eBay  employees are very courteous people. Valet parking is a tough job whenever there is a big company events. The best enjoyable part of the job of taking care of other people's car in the parking area is when they are satisfied and appreciated the services of valet parking for free."
good,"Ebay inc, wherehouse workplace work as ' UPH ' unit per houre,"
good,"Managers had little control and were there to only disseminate information and handle some customer escalations. Shift based work that rotated several times a year. They closed down the Burnaby BC office very fairly abruptly, devastating for a lot of my co-workers who devoted their lives to the business."
good,"You look at the thing you are going to post and you research it and than ad what you have learned about the item to your posts.Then you take the items and add a photo to them, take the photos of the items and than photo shop them  and add them to your posts. I have learned about the Items I have posted and it is kind of nice to walk into an OEM parts store and know what things you are looking at. I had no co workers. The hardest part was cleaning some of the old parts. The experience was the best part."
good,"The job is all about ""crowd control"". Many people call upset and it's about being able to communicate efficiently with them as well as being able to help and assist in any way possible to make the experience more enjoyable for the customer."
good,Typical day: Busy
good,"Focused on what needs to be done and enforces it. Could use a little more color. It tries to reach out to employees but fails to. not bad inherently. Just, not the place if you want a really fun environment. If you want a quiet environment to help focus this pace has you covered."
good,"eBay sells themselves to you quickly. You learn eventually that, as realistically expected, the amazing things you're hopeful about are really only just pretty good."
good,Had a decent job with decent money and benefits for my area. Stressful job dealing with individuals who always had issues but that is what you were paid to do fix the issues.
good,"The benefits are excellent. The managers are not the best, but compensation is fair.  Many many changes to adjust consistently. Culture is not bad. Changes bring layoffs and adjustments. Big corporation now. Employees are just numbers."
good,Great job with excellent benefits and good pay. Terrible management.  Made simple things very difficult. Often want you to come in on your days off or change your schedule with little notice. Company is consistently going down hill. Losing more and more clients.
good,"Overall, this is a wonderful place to work, I really enjoyed myself and my co workers I will always be friends with. You are given every tool available to help you succeed in your position and it is very low pressure."
good,Management talks out of both sides of their mouth.  A lot of politics and favoritism.  Decision making is slow.  Work/life balance is good.
good,"My review of ebay good as a part time job, laid back and easy. Typical day involved description details, listing,selling, packing, shipping, communications with customers. No management of co-workers. What I learn was how the postal system works, how to deal with unhappy customers, time management, speak and convey items with completely accurately. Most enjoyable part of the job was the hours."
good,"Worked selling collectables and antiques. Gained knowledge in a vast variety of specialty  products and rare products. I researched products , listed, priced, sold and shipped. My overall experience was gained in custimer service and reasearch of items i aquired from storage auctions and garage sales."
good,"Good job culture and management really concerned about how you do your job, there is always communication going on and teamwork is a necessity at this place. eBay is a great company to work for."
good,This job is very high paced and very busy. No customers face to face but lots of call volume. Learn on your own type of environment. See your floor manager about once a week or so. DIY.
good,"At Ebay enterprise, there were many seasonal employees that they hired but that was why seasonal workers did not last long. Everybody that worked there had polite behavior and the performance was easy to accomplish. It was probably the best work environment I had as far as the labor went, but they worked me about fifty to sixty hours a week, sometimes more. I wanted more time off for my personal life. The management was caring for all employees."
good,Fine if you put your head down take the calls and then don't ask to many questions. ONce you start to question the way they do things don't expect to advance
good,"I helped manage the world's largest (commercial) Teradata instances.  I was responsible for operational excellence, user training and other performance tuning of large systems.  I spoke at conferences and conducted training all over the world."
good,"Here, you work with kids, some may be good, some may be bad. If you like working with kids then you should join this program. I loved working at my first site but things happened and I got moved and I didnt like that."
good,"Great place to begin your career with extremely smart people. Agility to move around in the organization. Poor decision making at upper management level. However, roles below director level have good scope and opportunity"
good,Ebay is a great company to work for. As with any corporation there are bad points. Ebay has been working very hard on reconstruction of team members to ensure a better work life for their employees.
good,"I enjoyed my time there, the people are great.  The communication of  change needs some  work. You always find stuff out after the fact."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job has been turning around an negative situation to a positive for our clients and Assisting our seasonal workers with  their new jobs.
good,"-Enjoyed working for eBay as a full time and contract worker"
good,I learned a lot at this company as far as customer service. It was not a stable position though because they always send you home early.
good,great people and awesome place to work. the people that work for eBay are amazing. They really love the company and what they are doing.
good,"eBay's benefits are what makes the company so attractive.  They diluted the quality of candidates by lowering their standards over the past few years to allow non-degree applicants to hold leadership positions; which has attracted lower level under-performing, sometimes scheming managers to run things.  Manager Level & Above Leaders are arrogant and lack true desires to be creative.  I always hear...pull a lever, or go for the quick win.  Nobody really invests in the big win (long-term strategies)."
good,"Worked with candidates to line up interviews with the various internal teams."
good,"I worked the night shift, so call volume was only busy for the first few hours, but what it lacked in volume it made up in quality of customer. Intoxicated, agitated, prank calls. It took a lot of patience, insight and understanding to deal with customers. Management was patient and helpful with new employees as were more experienced co-workers."
good,This job allowed me to be available for attending my husband's doctor appointments and treatments.  I enjoyed the hunt to find quality items to resell.
good,Had the flexibility of being my own boss and setting my own hours. Was easy to ship merchandise to clients after receiving payments from them. Drop off at the post office was a breeze.
good,"Fun, flexible, I sale my own stuffs from previous stores that I owned. Sometimes I buy and sale back on Ebay.  I sale things like smart phone, electronic items, clothes, Jeans and furniture."
good,"Working on ebay was a good experience. Learned a lot and got exposure to work in a multinational company. "

good,"Seasonal recurring job opportunity with opportunity to work at home. Some extra time and under time available, only Black Friday mandatory extra hours. Fair pay for seasonal work"
good,"eBay is a phenomenal company to work for - their benefits, values and vision can not be matched. Unfortunately, that is often overshadowed by poor or downright toxic management. Often too results focused to care about the individuals they are burning out in the process. While poor management eventually lead me to leave, the experience and skills I gained can not be overstated. Appreciate everything they did for me and everything I was able to learn from them along the way."
good,I enjoyed my time at eBay - the company gave me the opportunity to have a broad range of experiences and grow my career. My colleagues were smart and fun to work with.
good,Great place to work for until an unethical and horrible person took over our facility.  I learned how not to do the wrong things to move up in the company.  Workplace culture depended on who was running the facility and not by company standards.  I really enjoyed working with my peers and the associates.
good,"Corporate culture is relaxed but the Treasury Department is fast paced and a lot of attrition within the group (both while I was there and now). Additionally, the company overall doesn't seem to be doing well post-split with PayPal."
good,Overall good company to work for. Was given great projects and the colleagues were very professional in most cases. Would work for them again if good opportunity arose.
good,Busy work place during peak season and all the hours you care to work each week. Caring management always willing to work with you if you have problems at home
good,"excellent work-life balance and team oriented, giving the staff autonomy to make decisions within an inviting and open environment to ask questions and request support"
good,The workplace its self wasnt bad but the supervising and management teams were terrible. They treated their employees like animals and constantly disrespected them.
good,"The company provides excellent medical, vision and dental benefits and 401 k match up."
good,Ebay provides great working environment and encourages engineers to be creative and pursue their goals. You have opportunity to work with bright people in the industry and build software used of millions of people
good,"A typical day at work starts by being there on time to clock in. Choose a work station. Collect all supplies needed for the job and start working. At Ebay, I picked and packed Godiva chocolates for the  christmas holiday season. The employees i worked with were very helpful and fun to be around. The hardest part of the job was making sure the right size boxes i needed were available for packaging. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing customers were receiving their packages on time for the holidays and they were wrapped and packaged neatly and secure."
good,"Ebay/PayPal are global companies with global presence.  This can be challenging if not primarily located in one of their established sites because the result is significant travel."
good,"Definilty a full time job and then some. This is an all consuming job. Between looking for the item, listing the item, taking the photos, pricing the item, coming up with a good sales pitch, invoicing and shipping. Then you have to insure accounts are paid you’ve spent numerous hours on one item. But to see the customers satisfaction makes it worth it. And you get top seller and power seller awards. That’s rewarding. I enjoyed getting those awards. And to see your feedback build is energizing. All in all it’s angood job but it is a full full time job"
good,"team is good.  co-workers are smart and nice"
good,Talk to different national people. You taking orders or help solve a situation with a order. Stressful and quiet. Team of different station.deal with customer satisfaction
good,"Ebay has been a great place to work, i have grown exponentially with working with the co-workers that i have been dealing with for the past year. Would recommend Ebay to anybody to work there"
good,"Ebay is a well establish warehouse that deals with a wide range of clothing. From children wear to adults, all staff are well trained "
good,"Salt Lake City office has too many levels of upper-management. Directors are often uneducated in new strategy, and dismissive of change to old-school call center culture."
good,"You always knew what to expect. Positive management, clean working conditions, Always received breaks and lunches."
good,"Great place to work with great benefits for senior level employees.  Downsize is that the company is changing and trying to adjust to shifting market trends, so whole departments can be affected by layoffs."
good,"I met some of my best friends while working at eBay.  I cherished my 4 years at eBay, and I was happy that I was able to move up in the company ladder..."
good,"Easy going job, very little stress (as far as work goes). They have pretty good benefits and constant change (if you get bored easily). The company does change pretty often, 3 times since I've been here. That doesn't effect the job but the benefits and rules do change around a little. Overall very easy job, it worked out perfect for me because I am also in college."
good,working there  was a lot of fun they treat you like family. it was a lot of walking but the good part you can listen to your music and talk to other people
good,Great company where you learn a lot and gain a lot of experience and meet very smart people. Work-life balance. Very friendly culture.
good,Shoe store with limited stock room. It was difficult to reach the appropriate sizes for customers. It was a great environment with great management. They were willing to work around my other job's schedule.

good,"Great place to work and good learning experience in terms of learning new technical tools like R, Tableau, Qlick View etc."
good,"Was good at what I did I am a great people person. It was a good place to work fast pace at times, but you get to talk to many different types of people and help them."
good,A typical day would consist of me acquiring a handheld scanner gun soon as I entered work. I then would log in and go about my days work picking different items for the packers to continue the process
good,"eBay is a great company and obviously one of the biggest players in the marketplace, but I did not fit in here. Rather than being given flexibility to drive growth and maintain customer loyalty, we were given a script to follow."
good,Great company to work for. Talent acquisition is done very carefully and made sure that the right person is hired for the job.
good,"- AV support Lifsize Systems"
good,"This work environment is one of the most friendly, and organized environments I have had the pleasure of working in. The employees there were always very helpful and understanding. I couldn't of asked for a better work experience."
good,Overall working for Ebay Enterprise is an enjoyable experience. You are constantly busy with calls coming in. You have the resources you need to assist the customers and the environment is very diverse and welcoming.
good,"i liked ebay. if you like easy, on your feet job. this is the job for you. especially during the holiday season, you get paid A LOT of overtime. expect no off days during and until holiday season is over."
good,"Good place to work. Fun and can learn a lot in marketplace. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,"While eBay can be a stressful place to work, they provide great benefits. Good medical, plenty of time off for the year, and the management is great to work with."
good,There was a great teamwork atmosphere from the employees on up to management. I great caring team that was able to be understanding of family situations.
good,"employee friendly, great environment, great innovation, all in all a a very good company to work for. leaves you with the sense of satisfaction"
good,I learned how to manage a team and at the same time keep the team members motivated. Project Management helped me get promotions within the same company. I learned alot from my superiors and took criticism positively.
good,"eBay gave me opportunity to learn internet marketing business. I am very proud of having chance to utilize one of the biggest and most comprehensive data set to analyze customers' behaviors. Especially, working with smart and nice co-workers in the team helped me finish smooth transition from IT specialist to marketing analyst."
good,"The company cares about its employees. Their is a fun work atmosphere, and a great morale."
good,"Good Company, highly political - Great thought leaders and co-workers"
good,"Nice co-workers"
good,"Ebay is a company mainly concerned with helping itself.  Employees are treated well with free access to all state of the art amenities, insurance benefits, dual monitors, and free soda with free snack day once a week.  As a customer trying to buy/sell using the eBay venue, however, they are the WORST company ever! I have actually heard co-workers use phrases like ""that's our policy"" and ""you're right, it's not fair"" when speaking with or chatting to customers."
good,"Great place to work"
good,"Great Place to work for"
good,"I really enjoyed my stay at eBay.  Unfortunately I wasn't able to find a full time role. My contract there is ending this week.   "
good,"Translated, edited and proofread translation of eBay's and later PayPal’s web content, including new features, promotions, graphics, user interface elements, email, on-line help, etc."
good,"Working at PayPal is both a challenging and interesting experience. The amount of payment industry, risk, and exposure to different business models knowledge gathered on a daily bases is exceptional. Each day is a joy and the team and colleagues are amazing. "
good,A typical work day was spent keeping fraud off the eBay and Paypal platform and finding new and creative ways to combat fraud. I learned to be a forward thinker in fraud detection and how to find fraud through a large data sets and ever changing information.
good,"40+ hours per week,                               "
good,"It was okay for what it was..."
good,I loved my job. Then I was having home issues and received a corrective counseling . after that I was shunned and constantly watched . I was told I was taking to long in after call work when I was making sure I had all the necessary. Info. Apparently once you get in trouble its all down hill until you quit.
good,"Main benefit was that I worked from home for most of my time there. "
good,"As long as you approach eBay knowing that only the buyers matter, you will be okay. Not many Saftey measures for sellers. eBay doesn't due any due diligence on cases for loss or fraud. Customer service is almost non-existent."
good,Good company.  You have to be a go getter and keep up with company changes .  Limited control over listing.  Must know what is selling at a given time.
good,"Great company to work for, they are constantly looking for ways to streamline processes. I would recommend eBay to anyone."
good,Stable and secure place to work.  Always found positive and fair treatment of employees.  It s a large company so management differs.  Some fantastic managers and senior leadership and others not so much.  It really is dependent on your individual group.
good,"From MindTree Ltd., I went to US to work with eBay on Business Visa short term (1 month)."
good,"I enjoyed my colleagues and support the company's mission.  Middle managers are a mixed bag.  Some are excellent, some are useless.  The company tends to hire senior managers, then sticks them in an individual contributor role where they get stuck."
good,"As a Senior leader it has been a great place to work and develop skills and resources. With eBay selling us we moved from a customer focused both internal and external focus by moving away from our core eCommerce Practice.  The Private Equity firm has been clear with us Senior leaders regarding their desire to re-sale and recover their investment. At this point my skills and leadership ability as well as ability to build and drive operations would be benefit other companies lucking for experience, energy, depth and excellent clients facing skills."
good,Expected to work above 40 hours a week and be available all the time.  No option to advance. management only cares about numbers and not employee health and stress levels are high for everyone
good,great work but you need to not have a soft heart.  There are a lot of rude people on phone that treat you like scum.  eBay will not protect you when you find yourself on other line of a bully.
good,"Good employer. Good pay, good shift work, good benefits. However very little chance of progression, job security is not as good as you would think and management communication can be poor."
good,"Better workplace for a person who want to stay and calm."
good,"Easy to balance schedule, nice management, and laid back culture. No opportunity for growth or benefits if you have either bad credit or a criminal charge."
good,"A great place to work, depending also on the colleagues and team in general good people except sometimes you find people who would do anything to get a promotion, even if it takes to cheat in productivity."
good,"They had free Soda and Bagels. Can't beat that. Some customers were difficult, and sometimes the job was hard. Management were jerks a lot of the time, but the little people were usually nice."
good,"It was my first job related to Development fields, that is way I call it help me how to walk in Development field. It teach me a lot which help me in creating my career as front end developer, now I am seeking for much more challenging and exciting job for further enhancing my skills"

good,This was a general labour job which was the first of its kind for me.I have enjoyed working in Ebay and I've to quit this as I have started a course to resume my career in Banking or Sales. Good Place to work in terms of environment and culture.
good,"Daily job:"
good,"I was a contractor at eBay for over a year via the contracting company GP Strategies.  "
good,Do your best to balance work and life as much as possible. The most enjoyable part of the day comes when you are able to make a customer smile!
good,"Work is fine, but it seems like the company itself wants to crawl before they can walk, they make millions of dollars yet can't make a website fully functional. Moving up requires a lot of networking."
good,"Its a nice place to work, but I wouldn't recommend it for a long term job. The co workers there are awesome, but the supervisors and management really lack authority. They tend to show some favoritism toward others,."
good,"Typical day is relatively easy. For the most part, it is a relaxing job; however, there is little room for advancement."
good,I really liked the flexible hours as it is a part time job. eBay gives the opportunity to sell products all over the globe and work from home during hours I can maintain.
good,I have worked many places and I can say this about very few of them.  Ebay has been a place where I legitimately like and/or got along well with just about everyone.  It is a very good group of people staffing this joint.
good,"Have done e bay Marketing, Selling for 11 years on a part time, my time schedule. You make it what you want it to be. I never made enough to live off of. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with a small, to low inventory. It is what it is. I sold over 300 beaded deer hide wraps that I personally crafted. I am now concentrating mainly on the Numismatics of coin collecting, buying & selling. History does repeat itself, but with coins they have a history all their own. Passion for this hobby, turned journey, turned lifestyle. You're either in, or ALL IN. Happy Trails."
good,Ebay was fun. They made work easy and enjoyable. I enjoy helping people with issues and being on the computer staying busy. Working there was one of my favorite jobs.
good,"I start eBay 2012 as a inventory parson. last 2 years I am on wave planner position. I have good knowledge in inventory department so its more beneficial for wave planning job. Every more I have to drop customer order and make sure all order going on time, If something wrong with order I have to fix it. I enjoy work."
good,A lot of phone calls back to back but good advancement during peak season. Managers willing to work with you to advance and set goals with you. Just a normal call center
good,Processed emails from buyers and sellers. Great management to work with. Co workers were always willing to help with tough emails. Supervisor was the best. Meetings were held each week to discuss goals and to help us with whatever was needed.
good,stimolante.                                                                                                     buon ambiente
good,"Recommender if you are values driven. Management could really improve, by being more focused on real customer needs rather than bells and whistles."
good,"It was lovely exprience with ebay and  fun workplace place and They also had some pinball machines. "
good,"I would spend my day either taking calls, or making calls to customers who were having problems with the website. Lots of tech errors could happen so I would often have to strongly problem solve to figure out why, and how we would fix these for next time."
good,Good work place environment. They are making sure that every employee is doing there job. No delay of pays. You are free to take OT's. They are treating every employee as part of the family. Kudos to my previous TL.
good,"Pretty decent place to work if you like to type, talk, and help people. Not the worst place I've ever worked and hours are good."
good,working with ebay was a great experience in the unique role I was deployed as a technology evangelist . Really good working culture. Technology explore was great. Management was mostly set by the example.
good,Working with passionate and dedicated business leaders to find the best talent for the positions open.  Working with a talented Talent Acquisition team that was able to take on multiple projects and successfully complete and hire the right talent in a timely manner.  The hardest part of the job was to balance priorities.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the opportunity to work with and build relationships with business leaders and provide exceptional service to our teams.
good,I learned a lot from working in a call center setting. There are a ot of variables when working in a call center. Some of the time I was there I did work at home and maintained a score on my calls above 90%.
good,"i worked overnight fulltime and the pay was about 11.25 per hour also if you worked overtime it was a time and a half"
good,"Only a few full time employees, they say if you work your but off you will be rewarded and offered a full time job at the end of peak season but it rarely happens."
good,"eBay Enterprise gives plenty of opportunity for advancement and while hectic at times, it make up for it with a productive management and fun atmosphere."
good,"ebay is a fantastic place to work. There is a great energy in the office and the company genuinely cares about the wellbeing of the employees."

good,I'm very proud of the contributions and success I have had in my various positions. I enjoy working with my large team of 20+ agents who I have had the privilege to learn and grow with over several years.
good,"Amélioration de l'entreprise"
good,"It was a nice company to work for, salary wasn't great but that was 7 years ago. Great team mates, interesting tasks. Very friendly staff. Canteen was nice."
good,"Plenty of opportunity and fun. Fast paced and not for the meek."
good,"Enjoyed my time there, albeit short due to consulting contract.  Definitely would recommend, learned a lot and some really good folks.  Millennials there are rude, distant and egotistical, but they don't know any  better as they lack life experience."
good,"Too many layers and re-org very often, not easy to stay stable ;"
good,"The people I met are now life long friends, the break room was amazing, TV and pool tables, 45 Minute lunches was very nice. But little to no supervision at all, people could do whatever they wanted, take a break as long as they wanted. People would clock in 10-30 minutes late without and issues. Constantly moved around, being made to do things you was not trained to do. It was easy work, but management was very poor. Wasn't an issue for us, but I could see how things could get out of hand. Extremely difficult to get on full times, I knew 3-4 people who had been there 2-3 years and still a seasonal. We brung in help from out of state during peak, they provided them with free lunches for a month, while we recieved nothing. Mo enjoyable part, was working around friends, made the day go by a lot smoother."
good,"long hours standing on feet , lunch time  was enjoyable you got to sit and give your feet a rest ,hardest running from one end to the other in timely fashion , management kinda stuck up to be honest  and a lot of work related injuries due to none communication."
good,eBay comme beaucoup de grosse entreprise Américaine dispose d'une très bonne culture d'entreprise.
good,"•	Managed a portfolio of 50 Italian key eBay merchants, increased their business, incremented their catalogue, optimized sales and opened new international markets."
good,"Client interaction, internal and external"
good,employee benefits overall are really good. management towards employees are pretty flexible.
good,Makes you feel good when you are able to help a member be successful
good,"The team I worked with made the work day go by, even on busy days, it felt more like I was doing tasks with friends than working, when in reality I'm taking calls and chats back to back. Any moment of breathing we would have the chance to chat. We all got along, and there were never any disagreements."
good,"A typical day at work, while being self-employed for eBay as a seller, consists of..."
good,"As a PM I found the open and collaborative environment at eBay  to be key to productivity.  As a PM I never found it a problem to communicate with my resource teams, clients and stakeholders.  The atmosphere was focused on successfully completing the various projects and moving forward.  The overall focus was on the customer experience."
good,eBay acquired our company and they did a great job of easing us into the greater group.  We were allowed to keep a small company culture but with large company avenues to pursue job growth.  Too bad they blew it all up.
good,"I am the contractor at eBay. Fairly pay and nice people to work with."
good,eBay has good team culture and provides decent benefits. Management may sometimes lack vision and does not provide enough autonomy to workers. There are many opportunities for growth for more junior individuals.
good,"eBay is a fantastic place to work.  people and culture are excellent, however with slowing growth overall, and limited options to reignite growth rates, quarterly results will rely more and more on cost cutting and increased marketing spend."
good,Work and Life Balance with Brutal Efficiency. The Company promotes innovative culture while continue to improve daily operation. Overall a good company to work for.
good,This has been a great and fun place to work! It has a break room with nice pool and ping pong tables.  TV's with sports and news. Free drinks with cans and soda fountain.
good,"I really enjoy working at eBay, mostly because of the people I work with who are super kind and friendly. The one thing I wish was that people could relax enough to hang out from time to time - things are so busy that even finding time to schedule a lunch with co-workers could take a month! But overall everyone is really smart and thoughtful and they don't micromanage, which is great."
good,"The Management Team does their best to make the job as fun as it can be. It is a call center, and that work really isn't fun. You take so many calls that you eventually feel like a robot. But you turn around and see someone dressed like a monkey... and it lifts your spirits. Great people!! The people make that place."
good,"Fast moving company"
good,"it was kinda stressful dealing with very unhappy people constantly, free coffee was nice but picked up smoking due to stress of work an everyone smokes there"
good,Fun and full of opportunity. Lots of new projects to work on and meeting new people from different backgrounds allows for inspiration to venture into new fields.
good,It was through a temp company. most of there IT jobs are. we didn't have any holidays off and didn't get holiday pay. We also didn't get PTO or benefits.
good,"EBay is a great company, great  projects, great benefits. Lately there has been a culture of constantly changing management, which hurts a lot of things!"
good,"ebay is a great place to work on real world problems, technical astuteness, test and learn environment with customer focus. I learnt a lot while working at eBay."
good,"A typical call center. Company has good benefits. Free drinks. Free food once a week. Sign up bonus and quarterly bonuses."
good,When I started at eBay the culture was more of a start up feel to it. Towards the end of my time there it felt like things changed to a more large company model. Not as much fun but still interesting work.
good,It is a good environment to work at. I had a lot of typical days but with the help of the team i did well. I learned a lot here. The team helped me a lot to learn. Good management and culture of the workplace.
good,"Overtime availability.  Peak is rough.  Management has both associate and customer interest in mind.  Over-all good job, just not a career for myself."
good,Telecommuting Infrastructure allowed for flexible workplace environments and schedules with excellent full-time training opportunities and benefits.
good,"Work was always hectic depending on the client and the time of year. I spent most of my time fixing issues, and was excellent at resolving the issues at hand. Most of the people were wonderful to work with. I am looking to move forward as I no longer wish to work weekends, or miss out on the holiday season due to working extended hours."
good,"Much work and pressure to get things done sooner than later."
good,"I enjoy working at ebay, even though a lot of workers operate a rigid silos and some can be seen as blockers to good ideas."
good,"Ebay isn't to bad to work for. The job itself can be very physical, but overall easy. Some of The management can be very questionable, and not very well with communication. Unless told to be from upper management. As for the rest of the work crew, we all get along well. You will face your typical drama starters, and favoritism.Though, those can be easily ignored. Many of us work as a team, and help each other out when possible. Overall Ebay has been a good place to work."
good,"The work itself is pretty good. A little numbing at times, but they're good about getting you on your feet to keep the blood pumping. My only real issue is the hours are really inflexible for a seasonal job."
good,"A lot of changes, and unknowns at times.. Hard to keep things consistent - but overall great place to work. eBay is a great company - you can learn a lot if you want to, lots of chances for advancements"
good,"工作强度很大"
good,"They have commodities for the employees. etc."
good,loved working at ebay relaxed enviroment mos friendliest people ever to work with all one big family easy to get into but hsard to get hired not many hired at end of yr
good,"Good and Nice place to work ."
good,"I'm so happy I started my career with eBay!  They're very good at helping you grow and develop.  People are extremely kind, and slightly overworked.  It's a great place to grow!"
good,What I learned while working at ebay is that dealing with customer can be overwhelming but each customer is different so therefore you have to find techniques and the proper words to use without getting the customer upset even when they are wrong.
good,Lots of opportunities to learn different aspects of the business internally and externally as there are so many faucets of eBay Enterprise to work within. Locations span across the United States and there are teams working on everything from agency services to developing an in house brand.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of picking items throughout the warehouse, and putting them in the correct slot on your cart. Normally every cart would have a total of 25 order sheets, each sheet containing multiple items for you to pick. Than I would switch to packing the items from the finished picked carts. I learned to bubble wrap, bag and box multiple items from clothes and shoes to toys and glass items. Packing consisted of inspecting items, making sure the correct items match the order sheets, packaging items safely and correctly, and labeling all finished orders to be shipped out. The hardest part of my job I would say was packing heavy glassware and cookware items, lifting the 50+ lbs finished packed orders. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning new skills and jobs."
good,"good management and support"
good,Enjoyable job and plenty of extra hours. worked 12 hour days for 7 days a week.
good,"Management was very supportive"
good,"Typical day was being on the phone non-stop. I learned that there are a lot of unhappy people out there. My job was to decide cases on items. Not easy, but was interesting."
good,They offset high stress jobs with a good work environment with unlimited snacks and sodas. They compile the work load on lower level employees and do not reward performance with prospect of growing with the company. It is possible the management positions also do not get much pay either.
good,"Working in ebay.in is a great experience for me, It gives me an opportunity work in such a typical conditions which increased my confidence, working ability, and skill set. I was selected as a business development manager (Export) and posted in Lucknow. I am taking care of Lucknow, Kanpur, Allahabad, Sitapur, Kannauj, etc. This area was untapped and ebay was just going to start making its market in this area. I was responsible for ebay's performance in UP. It was quite hard to work in the area where most of the dealers, distributors, manufacturers and retailers are computer literate because ebay is a online retail venue. I worked hard, some times I worked for 18 hours and finally made a market for ebay. Now area is sharing $1,20000 per quarter in ebay's revenue. "
good,I never realty got anywhere with the job because I failed the final and they didn't have anymore training classes after that one my coworkers were great I had a few friends in the class so it worked out plus my exs mom works there the hardest part of the job would be the hours and multitasking I mean they take it to the extreme there
good,"eBay is a fun place to work at and has a lot of nice amenities.  There is a game room, gym, and cafeteria.  They provide everyone with free sodas as well as several contests and fun activities for the teammates."
good,"During a typical day of work, you could expect to accept up to 30 calls concerning various consumer issues. Although there isn't much of a physical demand, the workload can sometimes take a toll on you mentally. I've learned to create a healthy balance between my work & social life. Management does tend to help a lot with this. Their honest-nature, sociability, & eagerness to assist seems to ease stress in the workplace. Co-workers, for the most part, perform A similar function. Despite being in the workplace, associates join together as a type of family, recognizing birthdays, holidays, important events, etc. This helps to reduce the effects of the more unpleasant aspects of being employed here."
good,"Working at GSI/ebay was a pleasure. Everyone had the same motto ""Work hard, play hard""...We got alot of work done, but also had a great time. We all worked in teams, so if you didn't know how to do something, there was always someone you could go to to help you out. Every year the company threw a huge party to show appreciation to all the hard workers."
good,This job enabled me to work from home which was a big benefit at the time.
good,"Oportunidades de promoción interna."
good,Good and fun place to work with friendly environment and great people to work with.

good,Work environment was very relaxed and great change of pace from previous positions.  Worked with a great group of people.  Enjoyed working for this company.
good,"Wearing the brand name is attracting so many respect from customers and partners. We can feel the power of saying ""I am your eBay representative""."
good,"eBay is an enjoyable place to work at as  what it lacks in work life balance it makes up for in benefits and events and culture."
good,"Enthusiastic team , fun work culture , latest technologies make it fun working at ebay. The team helps out with anything new and any help necessary for advancement."
good,It was great working there and fantastic managers made it very organised. Very hard work in eBay's hardest department. High targets and hard work. Pays off with the companies atmosphere and add ons.
good,"The company really takes care of you interms of financial, health, and fringe benefits.  The people I met there are generally very friendly and helpful."
good,"Ebay proved to be a great learning experience . There's a nice work life balance. You get the opportunity to participate in numerous events whether it be learning /mentorship sessions, hackathons or recreation."
good,"Career Advancement is limited, work life balance is good. Executive team isn't firm in making business decisions. We have to work in reprioritizing roadmaps and projects"
good,The environment and co-workers make this place a great working experience. They often have snacks and free drinks available. Management is approachable as well.
good,"Had a great time at eBay, enjoyed my team and my work. Loved the company purpose and mission. It's a slow engineering environment on an arcane tech stack so things move slowly and cross team dependencies are hard to align."
good,The internship at eBay Inc allowed me to interact with people of different walks of life. The job was based around information politicians of the grassroots benefits of a small business. I really enjoyed my time at eBay Inc.
good,"The job was very enjoyable and I worked with a lot of great people. We sometimes needed to work on a team for something and we always had a blast. The hardest part, I would have to say, would be when it got very slow and there was not much to do until you got your next client on the line."
good,Easy to make money selling items on eBay. The hardest part is making sure to sell what people will buy from you and making sure you sell items at the right price.
good,"eBay represents a strong culture of their values and goals. Company provides a wide spectrum of benefits.  Driven by success, lacks communication with employees occasionally. Overall it is a great company to work for."
good,"•	Tested account system changes by upgrades and inputting new data"
good,"Ebay was an amazing place to work at. Awesome teams, moral boosters all month long and cafeteria always stocked with goodies! My only issue was there is no room for personal growth. You have CSR that goes to coaching that can be promoted to supe and thats pretty much the areas within the call center. Wish there was more diversity when it came to opportunities. If there were other areas provided i would go back in a heartbeat"
good,Good place to work and worked knowledgeable people. It was a team oriented group that worked in a high technical data center. We had good leadership and it was a great learning position.
good,Good and sound top level mgt. Has a lot to offer in terms of talent and culture.  Good work life balance and perks are great as well.
good,"eBay is a fun working place, with loads of new learning opportunities. People are very experienced, and very friendly open minded.  The team members were very helpful and supportive."
good,"Manager was easy going but frustrated often with having to deal with eBAY and their policies.  Had great personality especially when it came to working with the employees.  He displayed patience, understanding, flexibility and fairness when mistakes were made.  Postings included model, make, and year of auto part, picture, installation instructions, refund procedures, price and shipping costs.  Posting instruction consisted of being guided through a few postings and then employee was left on their own until assignment was completed.  Pay was an hourly wage based on the average of the  amount of time it took to complete the first few postings, and then adjusted on the number of postings overall.  An invoice was prepared each week listing the completed daily tasks, posted at the end of the day.  Each assignment listed the auto part, model, make and the calculated assigned charge."
good,Great place to work with plenty of opportunity for career progression. Lots of focus on communication and effective management and a positive culture.
good,"Very flexible schedules, very relaxed atmosphere, with all types of people. Easy job, talking to customers and resolving issues. Supervisors are generally capable and supportive. Had to leave due to medical issues. Pay is substandard, considering all that you have to learn and memorize. Internal computer programs are good. Good benefits. Highly recommended, wish I didn't have to leave."
good,"eBay hasn't innovated the main product in years and it shows. The new CEO post paypal split has been good, but the site has still been slow to take risks and make changes. Work life balance is great, and working remotely is accessible to everyone."
good,"Fantastic place to work for."
good,"El salario y los beneficios contactuales son muy buenos,entorno multicultural"
good,"Worked with resellers to procure a next generation firewall for deployment within the Data Tactics IT network."
good,"For picking have to walk around isles and pick clothes with an RF Scanner and pick the clothes and put them in totes"
good,"Ebay isn't what I would call a amazing place to work. The atmosphere is calm, and laid back, and other than basic job functions there isn't much asked of you."
good,"High-volume, omni-channel, multi-client call center and all that comes with it.  As a phone agent, expect to be trained on their software in a fast-paced training environment.  If you like helping people find the right gift or assisting customers with order issues, this is a great job for you.  Spoiler alert:  Customers will range from friendly to down-right rude.  Know that going in and you'll do great.  Great starting pay rate too!"
good,"It was a good time working at eBay, but I was not completely satisfied with the management due to communication gap, location barriers and time constraint."
good,Great place to grow a career. There are uncertain times ahead due to major divestment of previous acquisitions. If you can weather the storm you will definitely be rewarded.
good,"Great place to work w/ interactive and dedicated leadership.  Collaboration w/ many teams to ensure proper QA, forecasting and execution.   Learning new skills everyday and enjoy a change and challenge."
good,My most enjoyable part of my job is being able to get the job done at the end of the day.  Knowing that I had a lot of work to do and was able to complete the tasks at hand.  I work with some very nice people. It is hard to find a job that you like with people that the generally get along with.
good,"It is a fun and beneficial place to work at with a steady work environment, no outgoing calls, great management and a variety of companies to work for."
good,"My favorite parts of  this job included the ability to work independently (trust from EMPLOYERS) & the people I worked with. It’s great to work with people that care about their company and doing a good job. It’s hard to find that environment today because so many people just don’t care about honesty, hard work & integrity."
good,"This is an employer dedicated to production as well as making it simple for you to care for self, family and unforseen emergencies.  The overall atmosphere is everyone helping each other."
good,"Ebay is an awesome place to work when they aren't selling it every year. They provide activities, meals during holidays, xbox, tv's, pool table, and small gym for use while on breaks. Typical day at work includes lots and lots of phone calls. Management is different through out the building because of all the different clients there are."
good,The company is in a major rut especially with the change of Leadership and moving out PAYPAL.  It's going to have to find its way as its no longer a leader at all.  Big 800 Pound Gorilla that survives because of Google Search Placement not because anyone actually thinks I want to go shopping at eBay today.
good,"A forward thinking, modern and absolutely wonderful place to work."
good,"I could not have learned more or had a better experience at eBay.  My managers were always supportive and encouraging.  My team members are fun to work with,, extremely smart and interesting.   The only reason I gave ""Job Security/Advancement"" a 3-star rating is because of timing."
good,"Best company set up I've seen.  Great training classes and upgrading.  Modern equipment for business.  Places to relax for eating or breaks, free drinks.  Great employees and co-operative.  Gym, lunch rooms, private phoning rooms and semi-private email stations for public use."
good,Started office at 7am till 4:30pm. Everyday is a new learning experience and also had the opportunity to train the new employees. The work was great and very interesting and always did something new.
good,"It was nice working there."
good,"The job calls for one to be caught in the middle of two colliding rocks where both agents and bosses go to you for any unimaginable tasks and favors. You get to get first hand information from the back office which you are obliged to disseminate to the rest of the guys in the operations. As part of the operations team, it has always been difficult to impose sanctions to friends. However, you are left with no other options but to continue with it as the job calls for you to do it."
good,"+ Great compensations and benefits"
good,"Great place to work if you enjoy working in call center environment. "
good,"Great working environment, really cool people. "
good,"Beaucoup de travail mais très agréable d'être sont propre patron , j'été très motivé pour ce job ."
good,I loved working for them and would love to go back one day as a permanent employee
good,one thing i like most here is people. my mentor and co-workers are all nice and knowledgeable and always ready to help me grow.
good,I met a lot of nice people. Some management could've been better in certain departments. A lot of agents felt that there was favoritism in the work place. I learned a lot about the client that I worked for and loved working for Keurig.
good,eBay was an amazing work experience. The pay was reasonable and the job was truly a fun one. I needed more money which is the only reason i left.
good,"As i said in summary. It is using most of the new technologies like mongodb, cloud, hadoop, html 5. Only thing that i dont like is, it contributes very less to innovation and open source community."
good,"eBay is a matured company that is organized in unique way. An example product development project would consist of a engineering manager, a product manager and a product development architect who all have leadership functionality. A typical work day included at least 3-4 meetings if not more that range from 20-60 minutes in duration. As project manager with many administrative assistant functions, the job was definitely a learning experience where my role includes assisting various project team members."
good,It is working in UHG. Helpful team and it is process oriented . Good place for technical and functional learning. Gives you good expose to retail business
good,"Good work life balance with my position having flexibility to work from home.  Worked on marketing promotions and merchandising daily promotional inventory.  Learned many things about B2B relationships, e-commerce and growing businesses.  The company culture was very diverse so I enjoyed working with all types of people around the world.  The most difficult part was working with 3rd party sellers to find very specific inventory for promotions.  Loved working with a very close and cohesive team that continually grew the parts & accessories business on the ebay platform."

good,"I loved working here but felt stagnant.  I was often bored."
good,"I find items online and drop-ship them to people who want to buy them. After I get a message from eBay that says someone has purchased my item, I quickly go to the site and send the item to them."
good,"At eBay, Managers try to provide a work-life balance.  The executives try to provide a fair company culture but it is a large company and with it come the politics of a large organization.  The people are great and helpful.  I would work there again in a different organization."
good,"Great place to work.  Free lunches and dinners, gym, yoga, yogurt, yurt, yoda, swimming pool, free Uber. Company meetings were fun and exciting.  Great pay"

good,Great work environment and amazing management. It was an easy job to maintain and the pay was steady. All shifts were available and management does work with you in case of emergencies
good,"eBay solutions was an enjoyable source of valuable experiences in which I took full advantage of to mold and detail my researching and data entry skills. During any typical day at the shop, I would exercise what I have learned in the beginning of my time with the owner at eBay solutions by researching whats selling and locating the target buy to turn it into profit. Collecting the right information about the product and categorizing it all on to a spread sheet was definitely the hardest part of the job, but making the sales and seeing the money coming in was the most enjoyable part of the job. Over all, a great place to work."
good,"This was an excellent place to work with great people, the ability to be a free thinker, free drinks, game room, birthday celebrations and a relaxed option for clothing."

good,"""It is a IT Company. Mainly focusing on web development. It's good for freshers and great work environment. Good supporting staff. It's good for develop your skills. """
good,"I loved working at ebay. It was my first call center so I was pretty shocked at how hard it can be, but once you learn not to let customers get to you it can be a great job. Sometimes I dreaded going into work, other days I was chipper. I played cards and drank free soda much of the time. They really do a lot to keep you happy since it's  a hard job. I had one super fantastic manager and another one that seemed to not care at all. I had trouble getting positive surveys back, and they were all negative about the company's policies, not so much about me; but still it's my fault. Still, left with loyalty to the company and feeling great."
good,"-Regular work hours"
good,"Fast paced busy environment, great atmosphere and benefits.  The campus is very nice once you can get to it from the parking lot.  eBay has a strong presence in the community encourages charity and commits to not only the employees but the communities and the world.

good,"eBay wird erwachsen. Das hat schöne iund weniger schöne Seiten. Das Arbeitsklima ist immer noch sehr freundlich - für schnelle Entscheidungen und klare Verantwortungen manchmal zu freundlich. Es bilden sich aber auch klare Konzernstrukturen aus - mit allen Vor- und Nachteilen: das Schiff wird träger aber auch effizienter. Viel Wert wird auch Weiterbildung auch der Führungskräfte gelegt, was sich sehr positiv auf die Qualität der Manager ausgewirkt hat. Insgesamt ein guter Arbeitsplatz mit einer sehr speziellen Unternehmenskultur."
good,working at ebay was very fun i had a lot of positive hard working people around me who motivate me to work harder and reach higher goals

good,fun and very energetic took plenty of calls and helped out customers
good,"eBay is wel een typisch Amerikaans bedrijf. Alles is groots. De personeelsfeestjes zijn dan ook echt uit de kluiten gewassen.Erg leuk, dat dan weer wel. Er zijn veel doorgroei mogelijkheden en het werk was ook erg leuk. Investigation en safety department. Onderzoek doen of mensen zich aan de regels houden van eBay."
good,"Inbound call center, designed to be a comfortable place to work. During the off season things stay light for the most part, where call volume can be steady and usually the customer is buying one or two items on sale or interested in future sales or information on the products. When peak season comes around things become more serious and everyone puts their game faces on to focus on high call volume delivering quick customer service to those who are having trouble with a purchase, needing a time frame for delivery or any issues that may arise. Sales are a main focus and we are equipped to help the consumer find exactly what they need and how best to get it, either assisting in price or shipping, and suggesting other products or services that was compliment their purchases."
good,That was a nice place to work in with some good people but unfortunately the business goes into liquidation.
good,I'm currently working remote for their Program Management Dept.
good,helping customers
good,"The first four years that I worked at eBay was one of the best work experiences of my life. The values, job security etc. was excellent. However, the year before I left everything changed and became more like a typical call center. It was still great to work there, but not as great as it had been. Instead of being fun and like a big family, it was more like a call canter/bank. All business."
good,"Management is awesome, you actually feel like a human and not a robot! they come around and ask if you're ok. During peak season it's typical to work in other depts for a couple of hours which is a nice break from whatever you're doing. Repetitive movements makes your joints hurt after a while also u have no life because u are working really hard to make production goals and too tired to do anything after a 10 hour shift. Really, it's a cool place to work, the pay isn't bad and room for advancement."
good,Benefits are good
good,A typical day would be taking multiple quality photos of the shoes or clothes I sold to make them look more appealing to the eye. The job as a whole had its part where you had to be patient but was a very calm experience.

good,Ebay is wonderfull work culture to each and every employe. its vey wondefull place to mingule with each and every person. every person have his own dream to work in this company.
good,"eBay as a company can be hard to pin down in a singular sentence. They really appear to care about their employees and invest heavily in them. The benefits they offer are excellent and entry level positions are paid a living wage with reasonable opportunity for advancement. The call dynamics are not script based, so you are often having to do a large amount of research in a short amount of time in order to satisfy both the customer's demands and the expectations of management. Management is personable, but heavily goal driven, and it can be stressful for those not accustomed to the atmosphere to meet the metrics laid out for them. If you have experience in a call center, or tend to thrive in semi-competitive offices, eBay may suit your style."
good,I got to enter my own items I was selling. It was a hassle but it was to make my own money for a short amount of time. I constantly sold things and it was fun to do.

good,"everything went very well. people and work culture is awesome."
good,"Having a great time at eBay, it has been 5 years now, time to move on."

Also, in certain instances it can be very difficult to operate in circumstances where you reporting staff is not in the same location as you.

When I am not on the phone, I am training new hire classes to take calls and field the inquiries that we get as phone agents. The most enjoyable part of the job is the different personalities I encounter all day and also getting to help develop other employees. The hardest part of the job is the abuse that sometimes comes with speaking to a disgruntled customer on the phone."
good,Answer customers inquiring concerning paypal accounts. Fast past environment. Need knowledge on different account transactions to provide accurate information to customers. Co-workers are team players and easy to get along with. Management is very informative and helpful.

My co-workers were very supportive and fun to be with. It made working a lot easier due to the fact that there was always help around you. The only difficult part of the job was receiving the wrong orders and doing your best to correct them. I  believe the most enjoyable part of the job was working and getting the job done in time.

The company was made up of 4 people and we all enjoyed each others company even though we were doing different projects. Being able to balance personal life and work with all my co-workers was a struggle because sometimes all our work would slip, even the CEO's. The most enjoyable part was the bags, clothes and shoes! All vintage Chanel and Prada that all women dream of having in their closets."

good,"Typical day at work involved catching up on emails and sorting work requests. I would then check my ticket queue, perform work that had a quick turn around, then plan how to perform larger projects. Some days I would get to devote the whole to day to developing applications and scripts to automate or remove human errors from the process."
good,It was a great experience for me to work with eBay. But i am not happy with my privileges. Like work 9 hours 6 days a week. But working with lower salary. I am looking for a good company.
good,The pay is very good and i had gained new skills with dealing with things online. I had learnt how to list products online and also sell them. I had experienced shipping the products myself and carefulling packing it.
good,Good Place to work and advancement is available for trainers and leadership positions. I liked working here and the staff are all very friendly. They also have a good training program.

One of the best Silicon Valley companies to work for."

good,"Overall I had a good experience. However, there was a big lack of advancement opportunities. There were also issues with misinformation from management, and poor communication strategies. Great work/life balance."
good,"Ive learn how to be a great customer representative. Learn that all people want is help. From management to co workers, you get to learn a lot from each and every one of them. Things such as knowing how to use your communication skills. Knowing how to get out of a escalation call. The hardest part of the job is back to back calls but the most enjoyable part of the job is hanging up the phone after im done with a customer knowing I just help a customer and theyre indeed satisfied."
good,"Working at Ebay Enterprise has been amazing, It is the best job I have had so far in my young life. All of my co-workers and managers were down to earth and really provided a warm and comforting environment. It really felt like we were all one big family."
good,I work on an On-call basis for the entrepeneurship.  I love doing the quality control work that I do for her.  I have learned a lot about the Stampin' Up Company and all of their products.  The hardest part of the job is that I never know when I will have work and when I will not.  There is no room for advancement with this job and that is the hardest part about this job.  I make a total of $65 a month at all times.  The most enjoyable part about this job is working with the owner and learning about the company.
good,"My fellow coworkers and the management staff were very friendly and helpful. This warehouse was huge and very unorganized, so it made picking orders really frustrating, and it being so hot inside the warehouse made it even more irritating. But working the bag line, packing orders, and gift wrapping were very enjoyable because you get to see all the different kinds of items & inventory that this division of eBay held. This was also only a seasonal job."
good,"I am very pleased with my role in this organization.  My colleagues and managers are all exceptional people to work with and for.  Although my position is challenging, I enjoy it and am very happy to come to work every day."

good,"I learned how to strive for great customer service, to always listen to customers issue and problems so we can  find the solution. Management was an open door policy, they were always concerned and interested in our ideas to better help the customers. My co-workers were all very professional and fun to be around daily. The hardest part of my job is to stay firm to our policy and procedure but also find the4 best way to please and satisfy an irate customer. The most enjoyable part is when I will de escalate an unhappy customer, to insure they  will hang up happy."
good,"On a typical day from clock in to clock out, I was on the phones. I'd log into my phone and as soon as I did I'd be receiving a call. I had to make sure that every customer on my telephone was happy and satisfied by the time the phone call had ended. The best part of my day was being able to make a customer happy and actually hear the relief in their voices that the problem had been resolved. The hardest part of the day was always right before clocking out, because it seemed as though as soon as you're about to clock out you get swamped with several calls. Overall it was an amazing workplace. You had to have patience, but not every customer is the same and it made me appreciate my job knowing that I was making someone else's day better."
good,"Working with a great team, and will be a great pleasure and fun to work in here. Everyday is exciting and enjoying, will never think of coming back. "

good,"The work I did at eBay was totally different than what I did at Fenwick but it was a learning experience that taught me a lot.  The pay through my recruiter was very low in comparison to what I left at Fenwick but what I was to learn made it worth it.  I'll never forget the people.  I was surrounded by the friendliest, most helpful and sincerest folks that made a permanent impression on me."
good,Ebay had a great culture.  Leadership was respectful and inclusive.  Workin conditions were good.  Peers were qualified.  Training was not as strong as I expected.

The most enjoyable part of the job was winning the Halloween Contest taking First Place!"
good,"very good Job Work/Life Balance"
good,"I worked at eBay for 17+ years. I couldn't have done that if I hadn't felt I was treated fairly and equitably. Lots of room for advancement if you're motivated, and leaders are very fair in work-life balance, compensation, providing a positive, uplifting culture."

The most difficult part of the workday was receiving a particularly stressful call, but getting a positive result for both parties was definitely the most rewarding."

This job was so much fun. I answered calls for all companies but ended up with a permanent job in Keurig. If you had questions or needed help, there was someone always there. The opportunity to advance was very easy if you were excellent at your job. I found it amazing that every week or so your Supervisor would take you into a room and grade a few calls. They really stressed teaching you the best way to handle calls. Always opportunity to have overtime. During seasonal times it was hectic but the supervisors and managers took pride in making it comfortable. Throwing minis parties and get breakfast and coffee alot. The company also took a huge roll in giving back to the community every chance they could."

I have learned a lot about Stampin Up, a company I had no knowledge of prior. The owner is a VERY good owner/manager of her company.  I have no co-workers.

good,A typical day consisted of answering a high volume of phone calls while also assisting customers via online chat and email. My co-workers were always able to help when I needed it in the early going of the job. The hardest part of the job was when I was forced to transfer a call to the supervisor because I had exhausted all options and could not help the person any further. The best part was always when the call ends and the customer is satisfied with the answers you were able to give them--that's a great feeling.

good,"I enjoy working at ebay because of the flexible hours and the ability to work from home. The only thing I don't really care for is the call scoring. Some of the things that they say ""you should have said this instead of that"" or being counted off for something that you did not even realize was something that they expect you to say to a customer while placing an order. It just seems like the scoring has the ability to change with every call, nothing is black and white."
