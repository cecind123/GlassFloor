rating,review
bad,"If you would like to work for an organization where you are treated like a number, rather than a valued employee, consider working for AECOM. Truly an organization where the COO places his compensation much more of a priority than that of his Board of Directors or Employees."
bad,If you like threats and intimidation this is the place to work. Safety is preached but not practiced. Management is nearly nonexistent and usually scatters at the sign of any trouble.
bad,"AECOM could care less about it's employees. Employees are simply revenue generation units, faceless cogs to be ground into dust and then replaced with a younger and cheaper unit."
bad,Terrible management.   Company doesn't care!   Don't respect employees. At all.   When they took over entire sections walked out. When you lose 30k off the top and the benefits are terrible.   What is one to do?
bad,They constantly berate and abuse their employees. Fire people for no cause and do it regularly. They will force you to work overtime till you are exhausted to meet deadlines and then put you off work w/o pay when quota is low.
bad,"Working at AECOM was a constant fight, and up hill battle so to speak. The work was not hard and the peer group of individuals working with you are fantastic. The company is very flexible with schedules, however they constant downsizing and lack of accountability from management is not an environment upon which employees can thrive."
bad,"Zero job and tool training. 3 days of Corp policy training, then threw a few tools at us and said get to work in a new program that no one had done before.  100+ hours the first week, lost our time sheets and then lied about it when they made up their own hours work for us. After 2 months of complaining about not getting paid they fired us.  We had to drive our own cars, buy our own special clothing and additionally required tools for the job with no reimbursement, pay for our own hotel & meals traveling 7 days per week. Worst experience ever for 22/hr. with no overtime or weekend pay."
bad,Management is a complete Joke they do not know what is going on they protect worthless employees who shouldn’t be in the job they are in and get rid of employees who know what they are doing.
bad,"Lots of turnover, plenty of people jumping ship, while managers and directors make promises such as promotions and bonuses that they do not keep. It's expected for people to stay during weekends and holidays."
bad,"Poor management no communication and they lie"
bad,Local management operated against corporate. It's like your expected to be a secret agent and everyone is out to destroy your work. Your expected to work during vacation time. I wouldn't recommend the job for management or a technician. Program Manager and Area Manager both lied to employees about reviews and raises. They were trying to break into Wisconsin but because of their poor performance and bad employee interaction they will fail.
bad,"My experience with AECOM made me lose faith in fairness and equality in corporate America.  Growing up in a foreign company, I was taught that a job is extremely important and you give your all.  This I did.  My job came to define me.  I took great pleasure in thinking that I was adding value and helping my employer succeed.  This dedication sadly was seemingly not appreciated by all and soon there was little to no feedback between my supervisor and I.  My health suffered,  relationships failed, my home life was neglected."
bad,"Five days before my 41st  birthday I was laid off after working a little over 11 years for this company. "
bad,One supervisor will put out one thing then another supervisor will put out something else. The lead site manager said that he does not have to guarantee you 40/hours per week.  This is why have an abundance of employees leaving the site.
bad,Please do not work for this company unless you really need a job. THEY DO Not take care of their people at all. Again do not work for this company. No
bad,"This has got to be the worst possible place or company to work for."
bad,In 2013/14 I worked for Flint which was turned into URS Flint which was then turned into Aecom helping build the Surmont 2 project. There was a culture of east coast Canadians running the company from management right down to the tools. These guy lest be reminded are very very clannish unless you speak the lingo. When sitting in a headache shack I had a guy slandering a speech impediment of no shown proof that I have or had as a person of aboriginal descent. By that an saying I’am also the type to drink Lysol with my cousins and live on a reservation. Well I was angered to say the least as there was 3 of us in this headache shack an only the 1 was making assumptions while the other laughed (also from the east coast). So I told him to shut up and walked out of the room. Outside to my relief I see the project manager I tell him soon about the happenings of the situation and what was said there. Well he goes into the headache shack and asks the guy by what on his account that was said to be true. As no surprise he was met with denial since of course our 3rd party member as witness to the occasion has no recollection and says he heard nothing. Might I mention these guys are friends right east coast thing as I irriterated. Needless to say the foreman was contacted and because they have this no tolerance for racism policy he was terminated right. Wrong he was moved to a different crew. So he keeps his job because he’s from the east coast he’s untouchable. Eventually after surviving lay offs I get moved to a diffierent crew. Guess who’s crew well his old crew the mix & match also moved
bad,This company has no understanding of how to run a maintenance squadron. Has employed the wrong individuals as site managers who pretend to do their job while using less than professional behavior. Talk down to their employees and treat them as if they are less than human. The office clerks can not do the the job they were hired to do by adjusting your Deltek to match what the company wants not what you actually worked.  Then you as an employee are threatened by the site managers if you report your time correctly. Clearly the company is not concerned with hiring anyone with any real experience. They speak of training and promotions as if they actually care about their employees but expect they will hire from outside rather then internally even though they say other wise. The company will lie to your face about having overtime to turn around and send you home early to avoid paying overtime before you cross the 40hr mark. In the last 3 months they have lost close to 45 plus or minus employees to better paying contract. My office is right beside the room they have the new hire orientation and it apprears they can not hire enough people to fill the weekly void of individuals leaving. I would not waste your time at this company you would beter staying with contract you are currently with. At this point I am truly waiting on any other company to take the Holloman contract because AECOM does not deserve it.
bad,"This company took over a contract. They came in making all of these amazing ideas and making promises that was never fulfilled. The head managers demanded so much but never paid the employees accordingly. They made decisions based on their personal decisions instead of whats best for the company as a whole. They started hiring their wives and provided company paid equipment to include vehicles to them and their personal secretaries.  They encouraged harassed and turned their heads when it was brought to their attention."
bad,"I work closely with IAMD Government personnel in scheduling and executing March Order and Emplacement (MO&E) of the IAMD Engagement Operations Center (EOC), Integrated Fire Control Network (IFCN) Relay and the Interactive Collaborative Environment (ICE), often on short notice and in harsh conditions, to ensure proper functionality on time to support IAMD’s stringent Test schedule requirements. I brief Fleet Logistics Support Directorate (FLSD) and IAMD senior managers on key issues which directly affect our ability to execute our mission such as; manpower funding, equipment readiness issues, travel discrepancies, and any/all safety issues. I develop and continually improve Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to ensure timely system emplacements to maximize efficiency and effectiveness based on IAMD wiring Inter-Connect Drawings (ICDs), Technical Manuals (TMs), and our experience in fielding systems. We support each of the IAMD Product Offices in the development and improvement of their hardware load plans, conduct of hardware trade studies, provide valuable feedback to influence Technical Data Package (TDP) and Interactive Electronic Technical Manual (IETM) development, provide Human Systems Integration (HSI) input, and ultimately influence all front end design efforts ensuring the 12 Integrated Product Support (IPS) elements are being considered during the design phase of this program in order to provide the best overall product for the Warfighter while reducing the overall logistics footprint. We also conduct Preventive Maintenance Checks and Services (PMCS) for vehicles"
bad,"Senior management couldn't manage a lemonade stand if their lives depended on it - "
bad,No one knows their job. Low pay..lies...and incompetent management. Do not come to Kuwait Camp Arifjan to work for this company. They are a joke and a waste of your time. Even the PM quit...
bad,"no direction no idea what your job is a nasty toxic environment of blame and fear so bad that people lie"
bad,This place is driven by greedy management and cheap labor concept. HR Management is a joke... no one has a clue if HR exists. You are on your own and keep making money for th big boss and his followers. Sometime you wonder if this a public company. HR Leadership is committed to sending all jobs to the Philippines and India...any place you can find labor at cheap rate. Project Managers struggle to work with clients as their is no functional support. The compensation team works on confidential data to recommend salaries... no one has access the data. Technology is the key to “saving money” for everything whether you have knowledge input or not..The whole concept is based on call center mentality (round the clock service by people who have no understanding of business).. you call for help and they have no answers...will direct  you back to where you should have started! And the company has US Government contracts....
bad,"Management lives in a different world, expectation is as many hours as possible (100+ weekly) to overcome support failures at the Business Unit level."
bad,HBLR was a great place to work. it was fun and exciting. the responsiblities were great but the reward was greater. dealing with customers on a daily basis and helping other was awesome.
bad,This hands down would be the worst job opportunity that I have ever encountered. The work environment is toxic and the management lac ked the necessary skills to perform their own duties.
bad,I do not wish to give a review and it is perfectly idiotic that you continue to force people to give one when it is not necessary. the stars say it all and I am done with your feedback.
bad,No chance for advancement unless you kiss your managers but and even then it is highly unlikely. Promotions only happen to management and above. No standards or templates. Every office does things different. No standards enforcement from senior staff. Not allowd to charge to overhead. Must be 100% billable. Which trying to develop standards or more efficient workflows or even trying to setup new software is frowned upon so it better be chargable to the project.
bad,"Big company"
bad,"You are seen as a number, not a person. Toxic work environment. Favoritism between management and other employees. HR contact turnover rate is impossible to keep up with, trained to forward complaints/grievances directly to supervisor/site lead and retaliation to follow."
bad,"job was not a good place to work. poor management poor lack of training. poor communication skills,, get put out on the floor with different jobs thats to much for one person' and inspect you to get it all done in a hour."
bad,The company does not offer training. There is no upward mobility. It  appears to be interested in the employees. They have on occasion messed payroll up.
bad,"stressful place to work with rude and disrespectful management "
bad,"this job is unorganized for being a contractor with billions of dollars, and DoD employee's treat contractors like their nobody in life. there could be a lot of things different at this marine base in Barstow California"
bad,"Worst job I ever had. I was constantly getting wrote up for things that I had not done! After about 5 months I just quit. I was written up for things like not holding my tools ""correctly""."
bad,I wouldn’t recommend working here. I am a CAD technician and have been with the company for a year I felt being pushed out by people in the office a number of times and no one is friendly there is no atmosphere in the office. If you enjoy banter don’t apply here
bad,"Had all the qualities they wanted but would not hire me because I was a UAW retiree. I was told by the interviewer that "" You are just what we need "" , then they switched interviewers and all of sudden  I did not fit the job ."
bad,"Not professional at all."
bad,No work / life balance. Often called out on no notice. Very low salary / benefits. Extremely poor corporate culture. Competing departments. Very poor client relations and regulatory relations
bad,Management plays a dictatorship over employees.  Rude yelled at us.  They did not treat their employees right.  I could not advance with this company no matter what i tried they always held stuff against. me
bad,"there is no leadership or direction in a very hostel environment. a good old boy system which puts uneducated, no leadership and very unethical personnel in charge. In Yuma back in 2014 they hired the best leader as the site manager and he turned the whole program and built relationships with team and customers and forced him out"
bad,"This Employer is all about the Company and not the Employee.   It's all about money, rather than the Employee.   I have been deceived, retaliated against, lied on; accused of things I didn't do and I had proof.   This Company is on the 7th most worst Employers to work for list, and all the reviews are accurate and very much true."
bad,"Workdays are typically 10 hour days, they usually go by fast because there is enough going on to stay busy. Its all about who you know with this company when it comes to promotions.   You can be the most unqualified for that job but they will keep in that position despite lack of job qualifications. Management doesn't hold their people to any kind of standard when it comes to tardiness and telling the truth. There is no real job security when it comes to working a contract job."
bad,It was NOT good being out of work.  It did give me an opportunity to return to my hometown to look for other opportunities. I wanted to transition to oil and gas but that industry was starting to go downhill since oil prices were also going downhill.
bad,You will be in for a surprise once you notice all the work you are doing and  not getting compensated for it . everything changes once you've been working there for a while
bad,"This is not a very employee friendly company!  As a first time contractor working for them I was quite disappointed in the business ethics of this company.  If you have other offers....go with them!  I did like the organization that I was working at, just wished it was through another company!"
bad,"I was originally told there would be some travel, but then we got a new contract and was told I needed to travel once a month to several locations. Not what I signed up for."
bad,"The management has taken this facility to an all time low.  The management is incompetent and doesn't care about the employees that do the work.  If you are thinking about applying for a job at this facility, do yourself a favor and don't do it.  Look elsewhere.  You will be miserable."
bad,I worked for AECOM twice. When they found out they were losing the contract they force the people who had insurance to take their insurance and it was high. The second time they came in with their gonna make things better bull and they allowed the wrong things to still happen.
bad,Tried to do the best I could with little training. Management was puppet to the host company and would throw us under the bus to make themselves look better.
bad,I have a hard time believing how poorly Aecom in this area is managed! The job co-ordinators play favorites and that is how the work is divided up . If you don't suck up and do everything they ask you end up sitting with no work. This area needs some type of HR or upper management to come and check out this circus ! The pay is rock bottom and you always end up working and not getting paid for all hrs worked. Conflict of interest is huge!
bad,"I started off with the wrong computer, it had 8GB of RAM, and no work to do and everything is always over budget.  I've had to work for free for the first time ever in my life."
bad,Contract company who doesn't care about their off site employees or the hazardous work environments they put their employees in. Do not join the AECOM team for any over seas contracts or military employment
bad,"only those who polish stay. "
bad,"Not a good place to work. Pathetic management. Full of politics in the office. Manager is very bad and not a place for internationals .. Good place to learn as most people do not work and just talk. Hence you will get good hands on experience, but the work culture is very bad."
bad,horrible company no real leadership the leadership they do have don't know what they are doing. causing problems with employees
bad,"I have not worked at this company to my knowledge."
bad,"AECOM is a pretty bad place to work. The project controls group is especially bad-JPB. In Denver, they don't have work and no one seems interested in finding any work. People sit around doing nothing, while charging overhead - if they are one of the 'favored' who can charge overhead. Managers definitely play favorites."
bad,When AECOM took over Flint URS there got to be too many people thinking that they were in charge when they weren't. They started to fire everyone that had been there for a long time and began hiring people that were family members of the company and refusing others. They began hiring people that didn't know how to do their jobs.
bad,"Beware of the billing department; poor training, if you can even call it that. Ultra high expectations and stress. All management seemed very stressed out. They closed their Denver office and brought over their manager who tries to make it a fun place but these major things can't be looked past. Management is not friendly or understanding. Unachievable goals especially as a new person. Don't see how you could advance in this position. Tense environment. Seems stressful to just take your PTO. Office is in need of an update, deary and depressing interior."
bad,"Overall, this place was a horrible place to work.  The office is run by a bunch of 3 year old catty women that try to pit people against each other. Upper management was un-involved and flat out didn't care about their workers."
bad,"Ordered , tracking and reviewing parts . Correcting any issues with parts that are not on hand locating a provider in the US to get parts from and Going over and building the Program for each individual truck program coming up in the next 6 months getting PO ready to order Going to Line meeting with all employees working on My line to go over and parts issues at 615 am and then going to Tier I meeting to update Branch Chiefs on any issues that are happening on the line or any parts issues that might hit in the future before program is completed"
bad,"bridge element design and analysis calculations"
bad,"Look at the dates of all of these reviews.....so fake. They are simply trying to offset the horrible workplace that it is. This place has made several 'worst places to work"" lists."
bad,"It is an okay place to work, not great job culture. Bonus and compensation is not great either. Employee participation are limited.Overall not so great!"
bad,"I took this job thinking that it's a great place, how could it not be right it's work with the contract for DLA DoD contracts! DLA either doesn't care how there contract people are being treated, paid, and trained or they have no clue just how bad the management is to employees. No matter.. No raises, no time off, and gossip mill will leave you feeling less of a person and more of a nothing."
bad,"AECOM is only interested in increasing its profits. Unfortunately, those increase in profits, typically come from cutting wages and benefits from the employees. AECOM violates laws, contracts, and  does not seem to care about the rights of its employees."
bad,This company is too top heavy and senior management has lost touch with what's going on. It's all about the bottom line at the expense of the employees. Human resource is only interested in protecting management.
bad,"Avoid, look for other opportunities. Toxic environment and not the Britney Spears toxic, the bad toxic.  That is about all I have to say."
bad,"The benefits/salary are very low and poorly designed, no career development."
bad,AEcom is just a contractor company that isn't good in helping there employees with what they need in there job. not a bad company.
bad,"Probably the worst job ever. Continually downward spiral in benefits, virtually no raises after 4 years. HR is a joke."
bad,"Smooth flow,long days, team work, learn a lot about current position."
bad,The only reason I gave this company 1 star is because I had to!! If it was up to me I would give this company a -5 star!! Management is horrible. Hostile work place.  This company cares nothing about its employees unless it benefits their own pockets. I worked there for 5 months went home in tears every day. If your looking for a job KEEP LOOKING PLEASE!! Dont put yourself through this HELLHOLE!!
bad,"It's hard to sum up in a few brief sentences how much of a joke (E&C, I can't speak for other divisions) working in IT here is, but let me put it to you this way: In no way, shape, or form is the work there in IT justified or relevant. The management team was one of the most incompetent groups I have ever come across in my career. It seems they had a brilliant idea to hire internally for 90% of their staff, which is great when you hire technology professionals, but bringing on engineers that have no technology background to work on highly technical projects or be a manager is just blasphemous. Aside from that, you're expected to work your 40 hours (6:45am - 3:30pm) but then, more times than none, you would end up going home and working until the wee hours of the night because that was the expectation... especially if you did not live in Denver. On top of that, salary or not, they had you charge all that overtime to an uncompensated overtime charge, because in IT, ""overtime isn't allowed""."
bad,"Worked with team work and got the all times training , learned safety  meetingeveryday morning and evening"
bad,"Accountants do not make good dinner guests. This fact asside the employees were; except for 2, terrible people."
bad,"After jumping through about 10 different hoops to just get started, I wound up going to the job location. The guy that hired me was not there, I was handed over to a bunch of guys who were already familiar with the extremely large facility, and were not exactly in a welcoming mood. There were about 8 different mechanics and maybe only 3 said hello and acknowledged my presence. The only other HVAC mechanic wouldn't even say hello. This would be the guy I would work along with or that would watch my back at an extremely large plant. A place where the key component of safety is communication. These guys looked miserable, angry, beat down, and most definitely not interested in helping a new tech with anything. An everyman for himself attitude. It only took me one day realize this place was an accident or fatality waiting to happen. They were so desperate to get another individual to help with maintenance calls, that they were willing to hand over a 24-7 365 day phone for service, to a person who had not even been there 1 whole day. This was not a place to do the sink or swim game.  This was a serious size facility that would require at least a solid month of getting familiar with, before being handed the keys to the castle. I had the skills necessary to thrive here, but I was terrified by the group who were in control of keeping me safe. I give this 1 star due to poor leadership and training. I give it negative 12 stars for the individuals in charge of training and the miserable crew. stay far away."
bad,"The only reason I gave this company 1 star is because I had to!! If it was up to me I would give this company a -5 star!! Management is horrible. Hostile work place. Dont get paid for holidays even if shop is closed down for the holiday. This company cares nothing about its employees unless it benefits their own pockets. Supervisors dont even know their employees names, who their employees are, who their employees look like, or what their employees do!! Supervisors want even talk to their employees!! I have been here for a few years and just found out who my supervisor is!! If your looking for a job KEEP LOOKING PLEASE!! Dont put yourself through this HELLHOLE!!"
bad,"The upper management did not care about your well being or moral.  They could care less that you were in a foreign country and conditions were miserable already.  I worked 12 hour days, for 7 days a week for a year.  My fellow co-workers had good spirits, but complained about management as much as I did."
bad,"Company as a whole is very deceptive, they hire you as one position and make you do other positions. No advancement within the company, management tells you one thing and does just the opposite. Warning to all who think this is a good move working for URS PLEASE THINK AGAIN !!!"
bad,"schedule sucked,management didn't have a clue of what was going on"
bad,Really did not like working here. The management team were out for themselves and not for the people.
bad,"We worked13 hour days in Afghanistan with no over time. things we needed like laundry bags and meal cards were always getting shut off, the buses got confiscated because they were not registered. they lost my tool box when I first got over there and it took them 9 months to repay me for them even with a claim receipts, pictures and inventory of the tool box."
bad,This is one of the worse companies that I have worked for since I have been out of the army I do not recommend this company to any one. I believe this company should be banned from aviation all together.
bad,Management is clueless when it comes to judging the amount of work they have often times drive all the way across town to find out they dont have anything for me to do and get sent home...yes they could have called me but dont know how to pick up a phone I guess. This has happened to me and multiple other employees on more then one occasion. The management pays no attention to who come in on time or who is actually working. The job requires a BA but I do not feel Im being compensated for the skill level required for the job. I will never work for this company again!
bad,"The company is very unorganized,poorly managed, management is uneducated, and they care nothing about employees or their family. if you like getting mistreated and constantly discriminated against regardless of your color, and just because your not management then this is the company for you, oh and always laying employees off."
bad,"Absolute worst company ever! They breached contract upon arrival in country by paying hourly wages instead of salary like my contract said. When asked about why is this so AECOM Site Supervisor, Country Manager, Program Manager all replied with "" Get an attorney, it is what it is."" Medical benefits are almost non existent, it will cost you $350 to see a doctor for anything, and that cost comes out of your own pocket. Hundreds of people where laid off within a few months due to not being qualified to work on specific airframes, and where given severance packages that didn't even equal one months pay! The people in charge don't give a second thought to its employees and their well being. Living conditions were horrible at first, then they eventually got a little better."
bad,very bad company i was very unhappy were i was and how i was being treated by this company and i hope no one has to go though with what i went though with this company.
bad,"I accepted employment as a Technical Inspector in Afghanistan, upon arrival to Kuwait I was detained by Kuwaiti immigration, for a statement on record made by a previous employer during my first visit to the region (2003-2004). I spent 34 days in confinement. During that time AECOM management in Kuwait did not help. They did not contacted my family, or the US Embassy, never showed up to see how I was doing and was not returned to my home of records after release. I handed my luggage tag to the Station Manager, and I am still waiting for the luggage. Not a good experience!"
bad,Poor management and a terrible work environment. No training offered for new employees and coworkers belittle each other behind their backs. No direction of guidance from others as to how you are doing and you wont know what you are doing for the week until 10 minutes before hand. Don't expect to make plans because asking for a weeks notice will get your boss upset. Don't ask questions because its annoying but don't mess up on anything. Mistakes are intolerable.
bad,"Poor management , unprofessional human resources , and unfair promotions. I worked for VDOT and while driving a URS vehicle while working I was hit from behind by a driver that had no insurance and caused me to have back injuries. My supervisor told me in the ER at the hospital to get a good attorney. That was the best thing I did . I was told by URS that I was SCREWED because the other driver had no INSURANCE. I fought with URS and Workers Comp for 2 Years before we settled out of court. While we were fighting they were trying to dig up dirt not only on me but other employees as well , one employee had a felony from 25 years ago and they fired him. I hope no one will have to go threw what I had experienced, they tried to make me give up and discourage me for 2 years but it did not work...."
bad,I worked for them URS ALBANY. Sent to Texas on a travel team with a promise that I would get paid. When payday came I got no check and was told I will get it when they give it to me. I had to pay my own way home with no money what a pleasant experience. Go to work for them if you dare. Management lies and covers up for themselves. They have been sued in the State of California.
bad,"I was hired at URS for a contract position at MoDot. I was assured that my training would be thorough. It was not. My training consisted of watching someone perform the job functions that would be expected of me. I did not get to perform any of them during my training period. This presented problems when I was assigned to my permanent post. My immediate Supervisor was also employed by URS and he was fantastic to work for. As long as you did your job, after he taught me how to do it of course, there were no problems. When he was moved to a different shift and the new Supervisor took over it was miserable. He was employed by MoDot. His outlook was that if you didn't eat, sleep and live for MoDot you were substandard. No on employed by URS and contracted to MoDot enjoys working there. The benefits absolutely awful. In fact, you may as well not have benefits at all. They pay for nothing until you reach a very high deductible every year. I do have to give URS some credit for trying to make it more bearable to work there in that they provided some lunches and other similar small incentives. Whoever, they did nothing to ensure that the job itself was made more enjoyable. Modot was allowed to enlarge the work load for URS employees without further compensation because a contract was in force and could not be altered until it was fulfilled."
bad,Typical day at work is an average 8 hour work day.
bad,Their intermediate managers in facility department need to be more educated.
bad,"Do not work at the Jersey City location. They fire people for personal reasons. Secondly, the company does not enforce it's own management rules. If you need a job, you can take it for a short period of time but be prepared for the stress that you will endure. Also, if you are going for the Line Tech job, your electrical skills will diminish. You will be doing everything other than electrical."
bad,The company is more interested in their bottom line than the employees.  They work-life balance sucks. The management is not concerned with employees issues at all. Safety is not the most important to the company as it should be! Experienced employees know how to keep themselves safe otherwise there would be a number of serious injuries.
bad,"Os feedbacks do corpo técnico são ignorados pela gestão."
bad,"Management is completely out of touch, refuses to recognize opportunities for improvement. Management has installed a cultural belief in 80 / 20 rule modified to reflect the few competent individuals ( 20%) will do 80% of the work load with ridiculously poor treatment while the balance of the employees invest quality time in Facebook and YouTube with 0 leadership accountability. Unpaid overtime expectation? Is ""professional time"" (time worked onsite but off the clock as a requirement of employment) even legal in the US???  Carry a cell phone after hours with requirement to answer 24/7 for free??? I guess everyone is billable if the DOD onsite representative and prime contract managers don't have the competency to audit actual field performance. If you have any credible work ethic, do not apply."
bad,Engaged in their so called training did not learn anything instructors were so full of themselves literally.  I was the quite type they fraud upon that so they cut my training and terminated me. Anyways job was stupid.
bad,"AECOM in the South-west was atrocious, the first year there was fun, they encouraged development etc. but soon after, I learned that HR and management was a mess - a lot of bullying went on and people's ideas and work-life balance was a clear indicator that stress, caused by bad leadership and project management, was a key factor."
bad,Horrible place to work. There are a few people who are hostile and toxic and it is overlooked by executive management.  It is a very stressful place to work
bad,Need to be transparent with management with regard to your own career advancement. Not easy to relocate. Corporate culture is heavy here despite branding on collaboration and inclusivity.
bad,"As long as you are billable, no problem.  Expect a lot of work on your free time. Benefits at the bottom.  Will replace you or lay you off the moment you are not billable."
bad,"Too many hours, for too little pay. Management does not appreciate hard work. There is a cutthroat culture among project managers and support staff. It is hard to get and help when you need it. Human resources is absolutely no help when you need them."
bad,"Too construction centric, poor decision making and lack of experianced managment made for a miserable experience. Constantly putting the cart before the horse with regards to design/construction creating an emergency state for almost everything going out the door. A sense of mistrust coming from upper managenment reflecting in their ""new changes"" within the office. An office arrangment like I've never seen before - desks jammed so tight that you couldn't move around without banging someone elses chair near you."
bad,"Nothing to say really, other then if your female you are gold. Males are nothing to these people and take advantage of their situations without understanding the whole story"
bad,"I would not recommend working here. Very stressful environment , long hours are expected from you with no extra pay or taking time off. No flexible working hours ether. Expensive health   insurance. "
bad,Will be asked to do things against the safety policy. I have worked alone in places where it was unsafe management does not care. Their environmental attitude is horrible.basically the management was horrible
bad,"Backstabbing, Political, managers screw you over wherever they can, limit your career advancement. As a result this culture cascades down all the way and everyone is just at each other. There is limited team environment. Some people are lovely but you can only survive if you are a narcissist, good at playing political games, come from an anglo saxon privileged  private school background - that is the only way you can be in the ""in crowd""."
bad,Company is in complete state of chaos with no guidance. AECOM purchased URS with no interest in being in the OG business.
bad,"Management has no idea of the skills of their staff. I think that is because management has no idea how to manage anything. I have noticed that if you are a good ash kisser you can climb your way up."
bad,It has decent pay but benefit management and working around your schedule is the worst. The really stress safety at the job which is a really good quality but on the other had god forbid you ever hurt yourself it takes a act of Congress to get any kind of medical attention unless it's by there company physician. Growth is very limited with the company unless you know someone that's in the buddy system.  Overall great pay but know room for advancements.  A pretty sh*tty place to work for. Dont want your time and potential looking to grow with the company.  Better of going somewhere where your talents and skills can be utilized.
bad,"URS purchased BPBarber and kept all previous management which was a mistake. It's the good-ole-boy system at the company. Upper management fired both of my supervisors then forced me to do their jobs. Of course, I was unable to complete the tasks, so I was written up and verbally abused on a regular basis. Required on our timesheets to record all time in 15 minute increments. This is impossible because I handled 20 projects a day. I was told by my supervisor to bill clients even thou I did not work on their projects. This practice is the unwritten rule in the Columbia office. If you want unethical treatment join the survey department at URS."
bad,The upper level management for the Atmospherics program is severely hampered by their inability to communicate and poor leadership skills.
bad,They need some real leadership. As of April 2013 they worry more about their bottom line than keeping good employees.
bad,"This company has no clue how to treat their employees. False job advertising; they advertize their positions to attract good people, but you end up doing a lower level job that you didn't apply to. When you have questions or concerns about your job you get stabbed in the back and treated like garbage. I found management to be inexperienced and inadequate to handle workloads, staff, budgets and projects. No job security with high stress among staff and employees who feared of losing their job."
bad,"This is one of the worst companies to work for. There is favoritism, nepotism, discrimination at the Jersey City location. The managers were former rouge workers. Avoid this location at all cost. You will not learn anything."
bad,"higher and intermidiate managers take old school management decisions and distruct the company structure, the result is the employees don't trust the company and the managers. Some employees brought millions of dollars to AECOM, but the got laid-off because stupid decision from higher management without looking who cares of AECOM and who is not."
bad,"Professional atmosphere, nice people with a wealth of experience, challenging work, recognition for a job well done, but at the end of the day, the only thing that matters is the bottom line. Senior managment ROUTINELY course corrects by laying off staff and OVERLOADING remaining staff to get the work done. At the same time, they keep adding more management layers (and overhead) at the top. Doesn't make sense."
bad,"Lies about wages start during the interview process and continue from there. If a promotion leads to a pay increase for you, URS will leave you where you are and hire a new employee instead regardless of experience or credentials. After you apply for a different position elsewhere in the company, URS will change the qualifications for the job rendering you not qualified for the job. Supervisors view their employees as merely stepping stones for themselves to advance. You are given NO support by supervisors for any problem situation that arises. They leave you out on your own in the hopes you mess up enough to be fired so they can replace you at a cheaper pay rate."
bad,"Prepare to be a number, this company has bulldozer over small local companies sucking them up and spitting out the bones. This all happened before I even got there but in the wake I can see an entire office of biter people who no longer care about working together, are constantly throwing their coworkers under the bus to cover their butts and hoarding work for billability because you are always reminded you can be fired at the drop of a hat for not keeping your billability up. You will not be trained as no one wants to spend their time on non-billable work, so you will have to learn to fend for yourself, you will not be rewarded for hard work, you will see little to no raise after spending hours on your year end review because it really has nothing to do with performance, the only time you will be recognized is when somethings gone wrong and someone needs a scape goat. We actually got a letter from the CEO stating how much the company has profited (a lot!!!) and thanks for all your hard work right after being told there was not enough money for raises this year! Management is congested with work and don't seem to know how to delegate it leaving lower level workers without work, then because there is so much work and its not getting done they hire more lower level people to help out because they don't want to pay the slightly higher salary of a mid level person (or god forbid they train their current staff to become mid level. That would take unbillable work and they might have to promote someone or give them a raise!) They really are only out for the profit treating their employees"
bad,URS has no job security and you are expected to travel over fifty percent of the time. URS will not compensate you for the expenses that you run up on the credit card that they provide to you. A very stressful place to work. Management is only interested in satisfying the Air Force and keeping their numbers up. They aeem to think it is easier to replace people than to see what happened to the mechanic.
bad,"imagine an unorganised business of 10 people. Now multiple that by 10,000 and you have AECOM"
bad,"Unsuportive environement coupled with bosses that visibly have favorites and actively talk down to those who are not their favorite. Allowing more flexibility to those at the top of their list. There is zero communication, little opportunity for upward mobility and they don't even allow managers to write recommendations for graduate school applications. "
bad,"Manager is a idiot and control freak and a micro manager. He will lie to u and does not have any experience as a manager or maintenance experience "
bad,"The company i worked for was acquired by AECOM, and from then on, the culture become absolutely toxic in a very short period of time. Their benefits packages are a joke, the salaries are constantly frozen unless you are a member of the executive team, and there is no recognition program at all. Don't do it.."
bad,"The company was dishonest and didn’t have a good reputation in Texas! They lied about the project troubles and lied about there project schedule. They are not a reputable business and or company in the DFW area,"
bad,So many wrong decisions and bad judgement. Moving to an outsourced IT model was an even worse decision. I would not recommend anyone going to work at AECOM.
bad,Managers don’t communicate well with employees and most of the time will just direct questions to someone else. Care more about the time spent at your desk than the quality of work done. Manager play games instigated confronting employees about problems. Had me turn spreadsheets of what I was working on then used it against me to say that I was not working long enough. Did that instead of just talking to me about my time card on each day
bad,"Horrible company,  HR may as well be nonexistent, management is incompetent and knows nothing of the job at hand yet continually tries to insert itself as if it has a clue to how the job is actually performed. "
bad,"Company integrity is questionable!!"
bad,Worked at Tishman's office in Piscataway. Management that does not reward loyalty and hard work. The operations VP is terrible. Each day is a fire fighting panic. I tried to offer ideas and solutions to problems but was not listened to.
bad,"It wasn't a great experience for me to say the least. I learned a lot from this job I had, but it caused me too much grief to continue working there. My manager rarely was in contact with me and let things get out of hand before stepping in."
bad,"If you planning to work for AECOM in Collegeville  PA campus be ready to lose your job at any moment."
bad,"Come work here if you don't care about career advancement and sitting long days of doing no work. The pay is not good, management is favored and you will get no bonuses & little pay raise."
bad,Hopefully it was just the procurement department that I worked in but I have never seen such poor management or such a high turnover of employees!  This place was like a revolving door...
bad,"I don't know what to say.  The place is a nightmare. Worked nonstop, criticized for taking vacation, badgered when I was able to take vacation, shuffled around constantly.  Everything was a moving target, and if you don't hit them all at once, that's your fault."
bad,"Poorly managed with a variety of office cultures across the globe.  Benefits have plummeted over the last 3 years.  Very cut throat and strictly by the numbers.  I loved the company a few years ago, but things have really fallen apart."
bad,"Poor management, policies are reactive and management has difficulty instilling a team culture.  Every one to his own until the end of a project.  Then goodbye.  Experience and loyalty is not a major team building value."
bad,"Company cares about bottom dollar. No support for employees and no loyalty. They use people 100+ hours a week till they burn out then replace them. "
bad,Employee morale at a all time low. No advancement or stability. Play favorites with employees. Does not acknowledge loyalty.
bad,"No mentoring of younger professionals, terrible management, and no chance of raises or advancement. I would not recommend working here. You will be crying in the bathroom on your lunch breaks. Especially hostile to women."
bad,"Poor leadership and focus on quality and employees. Training is espoused as important, but relevant training is remiss."
bad,"Worked on HEMMT, 915, 917, PLS, LSAC."
bad,"A business that had suffered legacy losses ,and severe problems with design defects, and inherent poor design and build projects, losing millions."
bad,This company does not follow up with employees that are onsite with customers.  They do not support nor communicate anything to the employees.  The morale is poor. Management is poor. They are only worried about themselves and not the people supporting them.
bad,"I am very disappointed in myself for believing the lies of my hiring manager and recruitment staff.  I accepted an offer for less than I should have after being led to believe that the exposure and work variation would enhance my career.  They touted the excellence of the company's benefits package and emphasized their work-at-home philosophy.  What a crock!  With the assimilation of URS almost complete, the company decided to change the medical benefits offered for 2016.  Unfortunately, I need decent coverage for several of my family members and the 2016 benefits are horrible!  The only offer three deductible-based plans and the plans cover zero cost until you meet your deductible.  The cost for this high-priced catastrophic, obamacare required BS insurance? $650 a month.  Yep, you read correctly. $650 per month is the best that the world's largest engineering firm can do for its employees.  I have a problem with companies that put a higher value on the price of their stock than the care and retention of their employees.  Shame on you AECOM."
bad,Very negative work environment where people are treated like pieces of machinery.  Top heavy management team that doesn't listen to employees and continues to run to company toward bankruptcy.
bad,"The co-workers are fine, and the only way to advance in your position is by being friends with the boss. Being female helps too."
bad,I have worked only on specific projects as a consultant on matters of quality assurance procedures and practices and on issues related to Portland cement concrete specifications and problem analysis.
bad,"Good clients"
bad,I do not feel comfortable writing a review for a company that I am employed at while I am seeking employment some where else.
bad,The management team is lacking in managing its' talent and meeting the delieverables that were set out prior to the hiring process.  Coworkers were great to work with but did not make up for the overall experience.
bad,Keep away from this group. Unethical practices and poor management. Overtime is compulsory and no work life balance. All they care is profit and not the employee. You are just a number in the 100000 firm.
bad,"Outdated processes & lots of office politics, management allows unprofessional behavior to continue in spite of numerous complaints."
bad,The people who work for AECOM on a lower level are GREAT!!! But beware of the dysfunction that is noticeable at the Program Management level because they're suppose to run the program.
bad,A day of work was 12 hours a day and seven days a week. What I learned was heavy equipment repair. Management was micromanaged. The co-workers were terrible. The hardest part of the job was dealing with UN-educated third country nationals who didn't speak English. The most enjoyable part of the job was quitting.
bad,"would be a good place to work if half of the people cared as much as you did. There were people in positions that really shouldn't be in those positions. It was all about the buddy system. Management couldn't make decisions on anything, and when they did it really didn't make sense. Though it was decent pay there were no reviews being done either."
bad,"This, relatively new office, is a collection of relatively new employees who prefer to do things the way they were done at their old companies. This creates significant confusion and constant stress as different Project/Discipline Management staff want their work done differently. URS will espouse an impressive collection of ""best practices and procedures"" but they are seldome followed preferring to do things to individual past experience and preference. Couple that with ineffective and often absent senior management and you have a company which must be micro-managed by their only client infusing another level of requirements, practices, priorities and procedures. The Houston Office has similar issues. Significantly top-heavy with overworked staff due to frequent and constant employee turn-over. When I was there over 60% of my department quit within 10 months! If you like a place where Management regularly angrily shouts at each other and subordinates this is the place for you."
bad,"Upper management hasn't a clue how to manage. They make absurd decisions that have nothing to do with making a decent profit. They are a predatory firm that buys up smaller engineering firms for their clients and assets then strip them bare, leaving what was once a decent firm twisting in the wind. Management is ""penny wise and pound foolish"". They are the Wal-Mart of the engineering world. I can't think of a positive thing to say about them. As far as being an employee, there is NO job security. Layoffs are rampant. Clients nor employees are valued."
bad,"I started with the Houston office in 2011, the moral was very high and the staff was deep with great people. In two years the office has been decimated by mgt actions and decisions. The Houston office has lost in one division over 60% of the staff. PMs and others are running from this office. No one in the mgt team seems to care, the company offers reviews yearly. And they seem not to matter, great reviews equal very low pay increase that does not even match inflation."
bad,"I worked for this company for about 6 years and during that whole time never did I once feel that management had my back, management at this company only looks out for themselves, I did not feel like there was any place for advancement and absolutely to work/life balance. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL!! notice that this review is for the Germantown location and all good reviews are out in the field so be careful when making a decision to work for this company!!"
bad,"I worked for this company for about 6 years and during that whole time never did I once feel that management had my back, management at this company only looks out for themselves, I did not feel like there was any place for advancement and absolutely to work/life balance."
bad,"If your utilization time is not above 90% always, you may get fired at any time. They are in the market for their profit, not for your benefit. I tell you what? This company has so many acquisitions in last five years, that is one of the reasons, all employees are in the state of mercy of the company's management. They do not listen at all. What they listen is the profit and the number of projects you bring to them. It really sucks.."
bad,the worst part of this job was the administration. prejudiced and unethical
bad,"This was a terrible work experience. The manager I had was awful to work for. The only reason I stayed for a year was because it allowed me to take a computer class and the job market was so bad there was little to choose from."
bad,"Lots of high visibility campaigns but where the rubber meets the road it is just another bloated corporation beholden to stock holders. They are big on safety for insurance reasons but when it comes to innovation they can't get anywhere because they are too top and middle management heavy. They look like a good game of innovation and listening, but they never implement anything. Short sighted."
bad,"I am no longer an employee with the company but I was not fired, I left. While working at AECOM I believe I was compensated fairly, however, it came with the price of having a huge target on my back. The company fosters a toxic environment where the management is much more focused on covering one another's backs rather than training / cross-training and protecting their employees. The management will actually steal the lower employee's billable time then paint a target on their back when review time comes, I watched as many people got fed up and left.  I watched as an ENTIRE DEPARTMENT of up comers left one by one, and after speaking to most of them they each had the same issues. Should you choose to work at AECOM my suggestion is to use it as a stepping stone. Use your time there to gain experience and possibly earn a few accreditations but do not plan on staying long or making it a career as the more you earn the more the management comes t rely on your utilization rather than things being reversed. Do not confide in or trust anyone. You can turn in a stellar year and still be laid off so the management can protect their salaries. This IS NOT the place to learn how to maneuver or succeed in the corporate world."
bad,"Billing is everything, no loyalty to employees. Minimal time is allotted for developing clients, and there is no job security.  Witnessed several long-term employees let go when they were not billable for a month."
bad,Bad management and no job security. They frequently do layoffs. Frequently expected to work weekends and overtime. Feast or famine when it comes to hours. Work is not consistent.
bad,Aecom is a very unprofessional company with poor leadership.Management favor others and if your not a favorite oh well.J was laid off with three day notice and they kept others that was brand new.Pay was great but I would not go back do to their leadership.
bad,Working for this company in Kuwait has been the worst contract I have ever been a part of. I have worked contracting for 15 years. Everyone has low morale. Salary quotes from recruiters are not accurate. You will be paid much lower than they offer you due to hours being cut if there is a sand storm or bad weather. You are paid for 12 hours a day but you are gone from home 16 hours a day minimum. They don't give you time to eat your meals but preach safety. Your job is always under threat by your management team and leaders. I would not recommend this place to work for anyone. There is a huge turnover rate.
bad,"Worked with the company for several years.  Local people were treated very bad by management team.  Lack of communication, favortism and dirty politics. Business manager had no business in that position.  She would reprimand in front of others and use profanity.  The rules were only designed for certain people, management  not included-infact things were swept under the rug."
bad,"Peoria Caterpillar project unstable.  Management only cares about advancing their own agendas. Very political, trades people not paid as well, therefore hard for them to attract talented maintenance workers."
bad,"The management is absolutely terrible. Turnover rate was extremely high. The work load was extremely stressful. Aecom boasts as a company with lots of resources, we never seen any of that. Begged for tools, parts, training and never received anything. Our so called manager just would blame everything on the customer that we worked for. Worked six days a week and very rarely had time to stop and take a break or lunch. I would not recommend any one to work for this company. The pay was the only good thing about the job, but it is not worth it at all."
bad,"In AECOM the upper management are trained to disregard people for their effort and minimize hard working folks and at the same time use people to meet their ""numbers"", hiring and laying off as if they were dealing with leasing machines and not people. On top of that, they hardly pursue any projects but instead the mid level management does all the marketing effort and they only ""qualify"" what they like. Upper management is a true bottle neck for the company, most un-needed hypocritical heartless spreadsheet geeks with unbelievable high salaries."
bad,"Industry dominant, with excellent staff talent that is sorely mismanaged by an overpaid, bureaucracy of incompetent, pathological managers. Hugely challenged communications with canyon divides between doers, sellers and managers. Most people who stay are simply trapped."
bad,"Over staffed and over managed. Focus is on producing work with the minimum of effort and maximum profit for the company. Junior staff are not trained properly nor given a chance to learn and make mistakes. Management would rather hire from outside than give existing staff the chance to move up, then they wonder why staff turnover rate is so high.Key business focus changes all the time leaving staff in a permanent state of fear that their area of expertise will be chopped next."
bad,"There is no work/life balance when you work for AECOM in the middle east and especially UAE because of the amount of stress you will get from the management of the company."
bad,It was the worst experience of my career. I've learned that you can't believe a word they say. Senior management will promise the world to employees then the next day they will finger point and pass the blame. Unprofessional behavior by long term employees (the good old boys)  and senior management takes advantage of the clients.  The Alaska office is poorly ran and majority of the employees last 1 year before quitting or transferring. The most enjoyable part was finding another job and leaving.
bad,"Generally company has good reputation over the world."
bad,"poor management led to poor training, staff are lazy & managers dont lead well. no advancement therefore no future."
bad,"its a terrible company to work for, don't want to spend money, the computer was outdated, very slow, who on earth uses Microsoft office 2003, in 2013. the company is 10 yrs behind. They don't pay good salary."
bad,"The worst company I have ever worked for, no job security. I had to learn everything on my own or from other co-workers. Management was and probably is by far the worst I have ever seen before, they do not take care of their employees. The most enjoyable part of the day was lunch and getting off work. "
bad,"If I was a client I would have to keep a close eye on these guys they have more managers, project engineers, and project staff, than they do designers or billable engineers on their projects. It seemed there solution to a problem was to add more management than actual working staff. Top heavy is out of control."
bad,"I did not find anything good about working for this Company in the Germantown accounting office. Some managers are full of condescending comments, unreasonable demands in terms of timing when projects need to be done, inflexibility, long hours (all the time), lack of respect, name calling."
bad,"Immediate Supervisors demonstrate dishonesty; misconduct and lack management skills. Their favoritism to certain employees is obvious."
bad,"Not a good company to work for. Advancement potential is low. Large decisions are made that benefit the large company but hurt the individuals that keep the company running. That being said, the benefits are decent."
bad,Worse leadership and Human Resources in the history of man.  If you ever experienced 2 such problems like these you will understand.  Leadership is horrible and weak.
bad,"leadership takes full credit for all accomplishments and pushes blame down stream to others for all risk -don't let high salary fool you, it is the only way to attract people before they destroy their career and reputations."
bad,very stressful with lousy management.  last supervisor was one of the worse experience of my life.  most enjoyable was the people I worked with.  a typical day was stressful.
bad,Company did not provide resources to successfully and efficiently complete work.  Mentors were basically nonexistent. The project management tools were geared towards bigger $1M+ projects and not useful for programs working on smaller projects. Overall not a good environment.
bad,"Beware, they will pay you well.  But you have join the union.  No paid vacation days or holidays.  Before you do any work.  You will go through months of pointless training.  And you will have tests on the subjects.  The training department that gives the training is poor and will blame you and make excuses about the material when you dont pass them.  Fail more than 3 tests in one area and you are gone.  This happened to me.  Avoid this job and this place."
bad,"Management was constantly breathing down our necks and complaining about downtime but they never had enough projects to keep us busy. We would receive work packages and find tons of problems and issues with the instructions, some made the packages completely unworkable. Supervision always wanted us to ""look busy"" or go somewhere other than our main break area so we didn't look like we weren't doing anything. If we happened to miss a mistake in the work package we got reprimanded for it even though the work package had gone through the planners, engineers, schedulers, supervisors, general foreman and foreman before reaching us we always took the fall. I got tired of getting all of the blame and none of the credit. "
bad,"Used to work for the company. Management created a hostile work environment. You are better off to seek work with other companies..."
bad,This is a company so filled with red tape and beauracracy that it can't get out from its own way.  The culture and day to day work environment is horrible unless you enjoy fulfilling non-engineering related tasks that are tied to meeting accounting requirements imposed from a corporate management that has no knowledge of day-to-day operations performed by the engineering staff of professionals.
bad,"Lousy Company, don't care about their employees only in making big bucks.  Buy other companies just to get what they want they lay off those employees they don't want."
bad,"Most people seem to get hired because they are friends with management or related to them in some way. There is no room for advancement. You never get recognized for the hard work you put in. Management is horrible, way too much favortism on this contract. Benefit are a joke!!! Overpriced health insurance with an over inflated deductible. Sick days and jury duty days you pay for out of your Health and Welfare Benefit. They change the way you receive your Sick days and Vacation going back and forth from accrual to front loading different times through out year. This is the contractor to avoid whilst looking for a job at Fort Bliss."
bad,"They have fired a lot of  good people once they bought up good company, They never comunicate information or touch base with you if they send you to a project."
bad,It's been an interesting journey with Aecom and we have enjoyed working on mega projects; though the overall management is complete chaos and utter lack of vision for India
bad,"Pros:"
bad,The position had the same requirement as above but the company had so many restrictions that it was hard to accomplish a daily task.
bad,Not recommended work place. Poor management and company culture. Hard work not rewarded. Performance is purly based on manager's personal preference..... No fairness.
bad,"Leadership is really lacking at AECOM.  Extremely share holder driven company.  Meeting financial metrics is priority and employees are pushed hard.  "
bad,worse company to work for management does not know how to run a government contract they think they are still in the military. No leadership what so ever. looking for an other job just to get out of these company.
bad,"Things started out wonderful, but once the honeymoon was over the story behind the mask was revealed. Being told different stories (lies)from mid level management about work status; ultimately I found a better company with pay. I honestly can say that the new company has been upfront and truthful through the hiring process and work status and I am extremely happy! I should have left months ago!"
bad,"Management was terrible and unfocused.  They weren't engaged and when they tried to engage, their priorities were not their employees.  They were simply trying to meet the established metrics."
bad,"I believe that the management is taking the staffs for granted, as if they just come and go, if somebody quits replace him immediately. No career growth at all, promotions were not discussed."
bad,"It's all about the money in their pockets.  They do not care about the people, that work there but's off to get it for them."
bad,AECOM doesn't care much about employee retention or employee welfare.They care more about corporate profits. Seems to be geared towards cheaper labor offshore.
bad,extrememly corporate feel. the company has grown so large it has lost touch with its people causing people to become numbers and lost in the budget. it needs to reconnect its managers to its staff and share growth internally through training and support not just aquisitions
bad,"Lead guyand co-workers Were Fine BUT Management was Horrible Communication was horrible and sometimes disrespectful and a bad case of conflict of interest, and no room for  advancement form within unless you are a friend meaning he knew before you were hired or a family member in that order don't voice your opinion or you can end up on the black ball list.."
bad,"Co-workers are great and hard working.  Office manager is lacking leadership and communication skills.  No plan was communicated to the office staff.  I had been there over 2 years, and they were down to 9 employees due to lack of business development, planning, and executing strategy.  This should be a 25-50 person office with the amount of work in the region.  It seems to be a storefront."
bad,"Great people in the URS/AECOM office.  I very much enjoyed time with coworkers.  Although, URS office manager is not capable and competent in Oil & Gas.  He has been in Bismarck for 5 years with expectations to grow the office to 50 people.  There currently are 9, 3 of which are straight overhead positions.  It is just a store front office for Denver and Minneapolis, where all the work funnels.  Stay clear until there is someone with a vision and strategy!"
bad,"I worked for 21 years and every time we got bought out our benefits and expectations changed. AECOM is solely based on utilization"
bad,"its was o.k. in most areas more trainning is required, more time required to do proper review of projects."
bad,"The only reason 75% plus of the aviation workforce of AECOM sticks around, is because we've had many years on contract before they arrived. We have vested vacation from time on contract. And the contracts pay is good. Management is two faced at best, and will hang you out to dry for their short comings."
bad,This company will destroy you over every chance they get don't believe anything they say they can't keep employees the reason for that is if you don't suck up to them you will be treated like trash. if I could I would give them NO stars I worked for them for a year and I quit because the way they treat there employees
bad,"Worked long hiurs,no time off on weekends it's all about Aecom no life nor time for family,poor management she feels you work for her you dont need time off for anything very stressful job people dont pay you attention as yourciutside the truck working on other vehicles"
bad,"It is time this place gets called out for what it has turned into through the acquisitions: 3% yearly raises -not performance based, doesn’t matter if u get a PE, wait for your 3%! Cannot retain staff, new people constantly coming and going, don’t even learn names. No work sharing. Hiring when no work. Fake job position ads. Stock investor deception. No bonuses. CEO gets good bonus regardless of profits. Senior staff has resigned, only to be replaced by young professionals who average 1.5 years before resigning. The URS acquisition went terrible, now the company is selling out divisions to persuade investors not to sell shares."
bad,"countless examples of people not knowing what they are doing, working on duplicate tasks , managers either trying to micro manage everything, or managers that I haven't seen in months"
bad,"I was offered a job at AECOM, in April. Moved across the country with my family to start work. I started in May. On my second week with the company, I was told (along with 43 other AECOM employees) that we NO LONGER had a job with AECOM as of July 1st, 2019. And we would have to either apply for an opening at the city or jobs that were posted within AECOM. "
bad,"Positive- strong culture of process improvement and customer service. They are also flexible with schedule when needed. "
bad,Typical work day varies but overall relaxed. Immediate supervisor not good. Over work culture for me no room for advancement. Hardest part of the job was my immediate supervisor. Best part was my coworkers.
bad,"As an employee worked here for few years, the company has changed a lot in the past few years.  The management only treats you like a number, they don't care about you, you don't feel you are valued as a member and avoid this company if you can.  Really awkward/cold working atmosphere in this company especially if you work with senior management.  Most senior managers are so fake.  You put your hard work in and that's it."
bad,AECOM is a very poorly run company.  I would not recommend anyone try to work there unless you plan on having to look for a new job when they lay you off in a few months.
bad,"low work load, sitting idle most of the time."
bad,"inexperienced senior management, all have degrees but little man management skills."
bad,"If you want to show up late every day, not work hard, and have outstanding job security this is the place for you. Little to no reward or recognition for those who truly show up early every day and give it their all."
bad,"Maintain aircraft daily"
bad,"AECOM is a fast paced company.  I have worked in the paint booth for almost a year.  As a painter at AECOM you are expected to perform all duties from sanding, masking, surface prep, bodywork, and paint."
bad,"I enjoy the fact that the project managers has the freedom to operate at their own speed. Oh, there are deadlines to meet for all projects and they are met. My co-workers are easy going and are always welling to help out when needed. They are the best! Great working environment. The difficult part for me is when the project is winding down and I no longer have the opportunity to meet with the client to ensure we met their expectations. I enjoyed the clients appreciation of the hard work that went into their project"
bad,"Company is good in work culture and all the needs except the management in Bangalore Regional office. Employee survives if he work without following ethics and conduct policy, even if the mistakes are seen just need to keep quite without reporting. Suppose, if the reporting done you will be cleverly moved out of the company. The reasons will be lay-off even though work is too much or replacing with multiple resources for an individual; other reason is transfer (for the employee who has exceptional performance) within 1-2 days notice."
bad,This company is getting too top heavy and senior management has lost touch with what's going on in local offices. Human resource is only interested in protecting management.
bad,"This company does not invest in dedicated employees and treats them as disposable goods. The benefits are less than par. 401k matching was only 3%, much lower than majority of companies that I've personally encountered over the years."
bad,Horrible management with no communication. They struggled to find us consistent work. Worked less than 40 hours a week when promised there was 40+ hours a week when hired on. Overall not a good place to work.
bad,"The only reason I would go back to work for this company is if I couldn't find work anywhere else, and that includes McDonalds. The pay was great, but NO job security. Upper management, top level, is so positive, but as you move down the ladder it's not a good atmosphere. My last manager didn't talk to me directly until the day I was let go due to company budget problems. 22 other people were released at the same time. I knew it was coming, but didn't know when. Be very careful if you work IT because they are losing people left and right along with whole departments with no warning. Final dollar made is worth more than treating people as humans. I know from working there, what I don't want in my next employer and for the rest of my life. I personally know of some lower management that would work up to 70 hours a week. They would ask for more employees for their department, but were told the was a hiring freeze. This goes on for weeks at a time. I really felt for those managers. It's really sad. Be careful."
bad,"employees were good, money was good, 10/10 is a good shift but managment seemed to have no idea from one day to the other let alone able to answer questions or fix problems like pay checks being messd up or not even paid on time. workers still managed to keep good spirits even with mass confusion and frusteration on a daily basis."
bad,"Very large, faceless corporation that seems to have forgotten it's the people underneath management that make it run.  "
bad,I was usually there after everyone had left so it was fairly quiet. The shop was a fair size so it took a few hours but since it was just me there I was able to get it a cleaned without much interruption
bad,Unfortunately the management I had to deal with were very racist. I hate to put that on here. I do not believe it was the entire company but the managers I dealt with overseas were obvious.
bad,"There was supposed to be work for over a year however, that was not the case. In stead of being given a warning or honest upfront communication about upcoming projects not being available. I was just told to turn in my supplies."
bad,This company doesn't care about their employees.  They care about there wallets getting bigger and our wallets get smaller.  They will try everything in there power to fire you if your not in there click.
bad,"After the merger with another giant URS in 2016, the company has been struggling to find its footing besides staking the claim that it does everything on earth. Very high employee and upper management turnover!"
bad,Too much work for the pay. Constantly worried about meeting productivity and answering phones. Partiality shown to various persons.
bad,URS acquired Apptis and did not understand the Federal space and IT contracts
bad,Work should be fulfilling and enjoyable most of the time. Too much emphasis on profit drains enthusiasm from employees
bad,"I worked for one week in October of 2013. After that I was told not to return. I asked why and they said I did not have the proper job skills. I was floored. I have been working in welding and machine shops for 28 plus years and have degree in welding and metal fabrication. Also 10 years machining experience and i am a certified CNC Operator and Programer. I found out I wasn't the only one that this happened to. Three others were gone too. the real reason is that urs is a contractor there and the regular Tobyhanna employes hate them because they think they are taking away work from them. They will do anything to get rid of you. In my orientation the union rep said , If you left a job to come here , it wasn't the smartest thing you could have done. It is by no means a stable job and no one will take time to help you out.also its a union shop and they will take 200 dollars out of your first check. If you last for three months your lucky. Best advice is to pass this one up."
bad,"great company, great benefits, fun work place, would still be employed but contract was lost"
bad,"They stripped morale from management with pay reductions and massive benefit cuts to the point that management could not or would not support the employees. There was no job place security. Management became consumed with their own job security. Many fine gentlemen resigned from their positions due to unnecessary stress, poor company goals, and lack of support from upper management. Flight safety suffered greatly."
bad,"I was a technician, I repaired computers as the can in and tried to finish them before the day was up. If it was not possible then I completed it first thing in the morning."
bad,Je pense que l'entreprise vise à élargir la mondialisation et d'aider aussi les personnel sa devrait nous faire du bien pour nous les étrangers.
bad,"daily work processed were received scanned and given to the team for processing"
bad,"It was a superb company to rely on for employment ;I felt uneasy to leave due to the condusive environment unfortunately,it was a short job term."
bad,"When you join AECOM, you’ll find the support to develop your career in an environment that fosters your talents, encourages new ideas, and provides you with unique professional opportunities. With exciting projects that span more than 140 countries around the world, you’ll play a part in finding innovative solutions to some of the world’s most complex—and important—challenges."
bad,"I would never encourage anyone to set this company as a goal. Their is no room for growth, management does not care about their employees only there to get paid."
bad,"good place to work good safety enviroment, good pay worked as if we were family, good time off, good vacation time, holiday pay and time off was good."
bad,Absolutely the worst company I have ever worked for. No idea how to use the resources they have. Management will not stand up for their employees. Poor planning and execution. Very poor management skills. I could never recommend them to anybody needing a job. Couldn't even coordinate getting email set up
bad,"no comments, company does not work for me, not the best job I have ever had, looking for something with better opportunities."
bad,"My experience at the company started off wonderful, but was then met with backstabbing, false promises, micromanaging from multiple people which led to confusion, name calling from upper management, and a seriously under-qualified manager. "
bad,Management has no concern for health and moral of its employees. They have a take it or leave it mentality.
bad,"Just as it says above. Unorganized. If there is a word that you can attach the prefix of ""dis"" to then this would sum it all up."
bad,If you weren't part of it you couldn't advance regardless of experience. They are a construction company that got into military contracting and it showed in the way they treated mechanics.
bad,Most unorganized company I have ever worked for. No real leadership from upper management. Very low pay scale across the board. 99.9% of the employees are disguntle
bad,"My experience was just that, mine. AECOM may be a very good company to work for. There were people I worked with who were very helpful, unfortunately it was not enough to make it worth continuing with the company."
bad,"Lots of talk about important things, but values swing and shift like the weather. Salaries are significantly behind others in the City. Much happier now I’m out which is disappointing to say."
bad,Crammed for 3 certification exams in subjects never spent time with before working 60 + hours a week hoping you're doing things right. Asked questions were met by annoyance or ignored phone calls.
bad,"Typical day at work boring no training at all."
bad,They say they have your back but they don't. Your over charged for benefits and not enough returns on your money. They don't care about the employees only how much they can get out of you.
bad,"This place had few pros and many cons. Not really a good place for advancement, very poor management, combined with an unreasonable work pressure combined with poor HR support."
bad,"The job is stressful at times, however working for an environment where everything is outdated software and operating systems its a constant battle of stopping the bleeding and conducting tests on the new/current platforms"
bad,"Subjected to hostile work environment from management.  Co-workers (client & company) were awesome......Corrupted computer system due to a new version rollout the weekend before I started work but management thought the problem was me.  29 years of professional experience, but URS management would not even listen to me nor look at examples of the problems I was having with the new system."
bad,"As a part of typical day work, it includes the delivery of documents to the site office as well clients office on daily routine work.  I learned to take the attention of people around me.  On day to day work it is my part of job. Once the duty starts it will occupy the whole day.  I am covering all sites as per the requirement of delivery of documents."
bad,"Poor management and no way forward.  Days are 10-12 hour days.  Co-workers are fantastic.  Most enjoyable part of job are my co-workers, staff, immediate boss and location to home"
bad,A lot of people lost their jobs because of these people. They're greedy and don't care who gets hurt in the process. They'd rob their own grandmothers for lunch money.
bad,"the worst company i ever had to work for, unorganized. Poor choices in management."
bad,"Typical Day at Work: Easy Going"
bad,"Working at AECOM is like going back in time, the culture is very old school and male dominated. People are not treated well and it's a place of constant fear of layoff."
bad,"I have been working with naval aviation for almost 10 years now and this location has so much safety precautions and rules that I actually feel nervous doing my job as if ""breathing"" is a punishable offense. They only care about safety ratings and following a bureaucracy that extremely slows down production. Although safety is important there are many aspects that dont make sense and are unnecessary. I could discuss soooooo much more but this is a small review"
bad,"Company has no culture and you are just a number. Slow growth. Keep your expectations low, as  company does not implement change and follows the rule - if it's not broken don't fix it."
bad,Restrictive management with a view to blame. Senior management was accused of wrong doing. Many changes to leadership structure caused confusion and resentment
bad,It is extremely stressful all the time.  Have to work 40+ hours per week with required over time most of the time because of poor and un knowledgeable managers and stupid decisions.  There is rarely parts that are needed in order to complete the job due to the parts managers having poor skills and not ordering the parts ahead of time.  I would not recommend working for this company unless you want loads of overtime and no life outside of work.  If you have no family and plenty of time to waste at work this is the job for you.
bad,The west cost manager is not very nice as with the site managers in Alaska. They will tell you one thing to your face and another when you are not around. They treat you badly after you are hired and the good old boy program is good and we'll established in Alaska if you are retired air force on an air force contract. They take advantage of ignorance when it comes to compensation.
bad,The people I work with are great. Its the higher ups that do not have a clue. Its all about the good old boy program. The work is fun and tiring at times. Working and maintaining F-16 fighter aircraft as a civilian for the Air Force.
bad,"Flexibility is good, but I have found that with staff turnover I have had to work regular long hours to meet project deadlines."
bad,"This is difficult as it is such a large company. there are some very clever people within AECOM but the higher up the management chain you get, the more school yard the culture becomes. "
bad,"It's not a typical 8-5, Monday - Friday position.  You will be working 10- hour shifts during the week then required to work the weekend.  Employees are working 52 - 66 hours a week, but they'll tell you 7 - 3 to get you through the door.  Very high turnover rate."
bad,"Stressful"
bad,Big corporation with the corporate view of work.  Employees are just another number.  An average workplace with flexible hours.  Biggest benefit is the ability to have flexible work hours.
bad,They don't really care about concerns of the employees. They don't care if people are doing things they shouldn't. They hire ex cons.
bad,"AECOM does not think of their employees, only the bottom line.  They speak of work/life balance all the time, but do not follow through on their own policies and employee communications."
bad,A typical day of work consists of completing the same boring tickets with no future change due to lack of foresight from current management.
bad,"Management is hired based on family and the good old boy system rather than education and experience.  Co-workers were pleasant and that is where the ""pros"" end."
bad,"Have low expectations when working for this company, my experience is with URS Federal services Div. If you are only looking for experience then you will be fine here. If you are looking for a challenging controls engineering company then this is not for you for they job shop all the controls programming out to other engineering firms."
bad,"Check in for head count."
bad,"Worked in the Richmond, Va office. No support staff provided even though it was promised. Remote staff is located in Virginia Beach almost 2 hrs away. Upper management was not supportive of employees advancing themselves. Typical good old boy system. a ton of indian chiefs at the top but no indians to do the work. Stay out of this office....Layoff Central."
bad,This company is so worthless they do not train you on job specific machines and you are at there beck and call 7 days a week 24 hours a day. Will call you at 1 tell you to be at work at 2 your shift starts at 3 need to do extra training. Management stinks no knowledge of job and not very people friendly. Older techs treat you like you don't know anything
bad,"URS Columbus is a bad place to work and has been for many years. Many employees are relucant to say anything for fear of dismissal. This office has been know for years to be a hire / fire office on a per project basis. There are many good professionals in this office that really deserve better managment. I became the scapegoat for a very incompetent manager. In my time there, I spoke with the manager of the office 2 times. The unfortunate part of my experience is the unwilingness of the other managers in this office to see the incompetence of my manager."
bad,Upper management doesn't really care for anyone who works under them. The environment is stressful and not environmentally safe for the aircraft workers. Some plane captains don't get the recognition they deserve. Politics play heavily in who gets promoted.
bad,The company is very large circa 100 000 personnel worldwide therefore a culture of being nothing more than a worker ant or number prevails. Salaries are not market competitive and annual increases usually fall below annual inflation.
bad,Managers are friendly but unable to provide genuine staff support as they appear to be tied to unreasonable financial requirements from higher-ups. Poorly trained human resources staff.
bad,Management did not have knowledge of job or what the responsibilities were for the jobs.  They did not listen to the workers and help when needed.  A lot of good coworkers that were willing to help.  There was a not a positive work environment
bad,"Company is broken up into divisions, divisions are made up of teams. Teams work well together, unless you are assigned to the team instead of them choosing you. Being assigned to a team does not guarantee inclusion in the dynamoc."
bad,"For shift or day workers the day starts early, generally before 0600.  The direction and focus of most departments are in a constant state of ""flux"".  Priorities change quite often and you must be able to adapt.  most people who work there are conscientious about their work and provide the effort necessary to get the job done.  What I learned while working there was to always have a plan B with a plan C working and with plan D being researched.   Try and maintain flexibility within your team so that you are agile when the change comes....because it WILL come..This may sometimes be difficult if some of your team is not amenable to change."
bad,"Strong growth in recent years appears to have stretched the quality of management.  I was disheartened by the dated culture; racism, sexism and Islamophobia was present after hours."
bad,"I had a 3 months contract, spent 2 months ding absolutely nothing. No matter how much motivation I can show or how much help I'm offering, they just don't know how to organize and properly train you."
bad,When the president of your company says he is not doing his job because you have yours or your Director says you are a turtle because you don't talk enough (sorry I work hard and don't talk a lot)   .. kinda sad 13 years and nothing....
bad,"My immediate supervisor had more ego than leadership ability."
bad,Get it going in door cause you are going to get lousy raises and ever increasing cost of Benifits - amazing how how much benefits cost increase faster than wages
bad,AECOM has a critical and significant disconnect between upper management and the people who do the work. Chronic insufficient administrative support is an ongoing challenge.
bad,"Once URS was purchased by AECOM the entire atmosphere went down hill.  Work/ became Pretend Time Off as you were called for meetings when on vacation and on weekends."
bad,It has been a productive experience with them. They tend to care more about bean counting and productivity than employee satisfaction or work life balance.  Not much employee input allowed and the company is very poor for information dissemination.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the my co-workers. Very dedicated and hard working group. However, with micro-managers hovering over us, it was difficult to excel."
bad,"Working environment is not good. No job security."
bad,It was not a very exciting place to work at. Very less space to grow. I did not have too much fun during the internship. All I did was modify thousands of data in excel. I did not feel like a civil engineer.
bad,"No room for advancement through training. Always tight on money. Insane corporate culture and process. A silo mentality abounds. Everyone in I.T. too paranoid about their jobs to share helpful information. Executive management doesn't give a ""care"" for the users at the desk. It's all about lining their pockets and screw the rest."
bad,"The AECOM engineer side is great, but these contracts in the middle east are terrible far as management goes.  Lots of racism. Buddy buddy system.  No oversight from main company. People in positions that are so under qualified."
bad,"8 hrs a day starting at 7:00 am. Usually i have something assignated for the day."
bad,No growth for non-management.  New aquisition in process so layoffs pending.
bad,"Managers are not friendly, they don't give freedom to innovate new things in company and no professional development programs they have"
bad,There are better places to work that treat employees like people rather then numbers.
bad,"Do not be blinded by the dollar signs of overseas contracts. Although this particular contract pays upwards of $107,000.00 per year; the contract was severely underbid. When you take into consideration that barely one year ago the pay was $150,000.00 per year you can start to imagine the difference in the quality of mechanics they are able to obtain. "
bad,Low ball me from the beginning $$
bad,work way to much didnt like the hours and it was to far away never had time for my family
bad,I learned a lot about how NOT to manage people. I am now schooled in the art of logistics and government contracting
bad,"It seemed to me, that AECOM spent most of their management time making sure there were more than enough people working on site. Like WAY more than necessary. People would get called in for extra overtime during a shut down, and would end up sitting in a trailer waiting for  four or five days. It was unbelievable at times. And then everyone would look shocked when all the sudden 80% of the crew gets laid off!"
bad,Weak leadership and little sense of strategic direction within the Oil and Gas division. Leaders had little interest in the well being of the company.  Team was good and the aren't companies brand is strong.
bad,"Safe work culture is nonexistent. Management ignores safety regularly and puts employees at risk as they rest comfortably in the office. Toxic and hostile and management will freeze you out of hrs if you make an error instead of helping you out. Try paying bills with a 18 hours on the time card. Hr is a joke, I was spit on by an employee and he kept his job Sounds like sour grapes I know but it’s all true"
bad,If you're looking to get into contracting work then I'd look elsewhere other than AECOM. Unless you work here and are lucky enough to be there long enough to have seniority and survive the numerous lay off periods this company goes through then by all means take the chance. I need something a little more guaranteed for me and my family.
bad,The job was what I expected.  I managed the supply chain side for a factory.  The management team rotated faster than the hourly people.  It didn't seem like anyone liked reworking for them.   They didn't inform me of high lead levels in the facility until a month after I began working there.  I was required to take a monthly blood test to check my levels.   3 months and I hated it
bad,Very mysoginistic environment. Not nearly enough work to keep me busy. Manager ignored me for 10 of the 11months I was there. I was let go about one week before my 401k shares vested.
bad,Management decisions dictate the flow of productivity.  New management made day-to-day operations difficult without cause and reduced team morale.  Outside hiring processes forced multiple in-house candidates to be overlooked without second review.
bad,The corporation has problems that are addressed via reorganizations each year. These reorganizations result in constant changes to management which can extend down to the local level. This causes confusion.
bad,Place was  high paced at times. AECOM expects you to do work that is not assighned to you and work that is not at your pay level but still pay the same amount. Ex: an office assistant doing a managers work and still getting paid as an assistant. Managers work on the buddy system. Increase in salary is yearly but less than 10 cents. Promotions are very rare.
bad,Senior leadership and middle management changes on a regular basis which frequently creates a climate of feared disposability within the employee population.  Policy changes are not well-communicated.
bad,"No work/life balance"
bad,"This company provides most of what anyone would be looking for in an employer to the extent of wages, benefits, PTO, etc. However, they don't care about you as an individual in regards to your goals of personal growth and advancement of your career."
bad,"Job Stability"
bad,Company does not care about retention when it comes to employees. I had been employed for a little over 3 years and have seen over 20 people leave Staff is only 26 total.  Most left for more money and better benefits.  Management or the lack of was the also the reason.  It is a shame because they have had some very talented and professional employees
bad,Company recognizes employees with exceptional work ethic. They also match donations and retirement accounts. The company will give educational benefits to senior employees studying engineering.
bad,"Although AECOM promotes from within, managers do not receive mentoring or appropriate training.  As a result, there is poor management to the point that problems are rampant, morale is non-existent and work well done is ignored."
bad,"I was working well with them efficiently and very competent throughout my career with them. But all of the sudden they send me home without any warning, without any explanation.T hey have strong grouping and never let you stay in if you are more experienced and talented then them. And I stupidity accepted the advice of union steward that don't go for grievances and sign the paper."
bad,"Tested all electrical systems"
bad,"Will promise you everything you demand but after signing the job offer will not work on your agreed negotiation."
bad,No job security.  At will employment.  There was a great deal of poorly managed change in my tenure.  There was a lack of management communication of goals beyond profitability & efficiency.
bad,I do not wish to provide at review at this time. I work under an agency contract and am not a permanent member of staff. I work under a temporary contract.
bad,"The people i work with are great and friendly, we are like a family there. They value and take consideration of every ones opinion."
bad,"Working hand in hand with young sailors and other civilians is a joy, it's a pleasure learning for both sides of the spectrum. The time spent together is great, but there are other things that could be improved."
bad,That people are only out to cover themselves and don't really take accountability for their own actions.  The management team does not support its employees in their respected areas and will allow our internal customers to bully employees
bad,"No day is typical at work.  There will always be emergencies, a fire to fight, a deadline to build, a night build up of email messages and ever mounting list of to dos.  I realized that for as long as you manage your time properly and keep your objective and do them in between emergencies, no task could not be accomplished."
bad,A typical day at work involved starting work at 07h45 until 10h00 for a 15 min tea break. Worked then again from 10h15 until 12h30 for a 45 min lunch break. Worked again from 13h15 until about 17h00. I did not enjoy my job.
bad,"I have considerable freedom to do many things.  I participate in Audits, Design Projects, and Construction Execution.  I also review several deliverables to clients.  I am most frustrated by the lack of direction from managers.  I feel isolated.  Also, the company tends to say one thing but do another."
bad,Speaking from the Saskatchewan area only. If you are an electrician looking for a job and not a career that's all aecom is. Forget about your future the project managers walk all over you. Basically a company where the field worker is treated like the lowest form on the earth. Managers forget that field are the ones that bring the money to their pocket. I suggest you keep looking for work and keep aecom away from electrical all together. They are ruining our rights as electricians.
bad,"Interesting work technically, but management structures and systems seem intentionally designed to keep managers uncomfortable."
bad,"Lies a plenty. First they lied about lateral job opportunities, which do not exist. It is unlikely that a federal services sector worker supporting a defense program would qualify for a bridge engineer position.  Usual idiotic corporate dribble to keep the rabble subdued."
bad,management is too unorganized to make warehouse run as smooth as it could. management does just enough to get things by and they are too untrustworthy of their employees
bad,"Upper management has caused the jobsite to be in utter chaos in terms of  planning work projects that do not conflict with each other.  The waste of time and money is absolutely outrageous.   Foremans are required by the unions to be local to the burlington area and it appears some of them have no idea what they are doing.  Working hours are 60 to 70 hours a week and if you miss time you are regarded as a serious problem because it's a time and material job and you are cutting in to their bottom line.  It is colder than **** out there.  Other than that, it's just a wonderful place to work."
bad,Big top heavy corporation.  Not good environment for lower level employees.
bad,"Involve in the following projects and tasks,"
bad,"A place to start, not a place to stay.not my 1st choice, but the project was what i wanted to be apart of."
bad,"AECom is a conglomerate of many companies offering an all service engineering and architecture portfolio.  However, long term job security is rare and often determined by billable time over skills."
bad,Working for URS was not a recognized experience. No room for advancement.
bad,I have worked for this company for the last 4 years both overseas and stateside. I have received exactly 1 raise of .50 per hour despite various awards due to performance. I currently commute approximately 4 hours per day to this job and it seems time to find something to make the hours away from family worthwhile.
bad,"Think twice before you apply with URS in Albany. The Site manager sleeps a great deal of the day away at his desk. ( And the Government managers know it.)"
bad,Company seemed to be inexperienced in contracting and supporting the customer. Might just be an isolated perspective.
bad,Won't be told directly about job changes or if job was done incorrectly. Unqualified and unhappy management.
bad,"The benefits were good, but the work environment was the worst I had ever seen. I worked 65-80 hrs a week with no extra compensation. They were constantly laying off workers, and everyone walked around worrying if they were next. The management would lie to the employees and their clients, and join in the gossip that made everything worse. The management made promises to their clients that could not physically be met. They even had top management suing each other! They had this “Great Place to Work” committee that tried, but it was anything but a great place to work. I got out as soon as I could."
bad,"You are taken for granted, encouraged to work un-paid overtime and bombarded by management Emails about how you are an invaluable part of a team until the day you are stabbed in the back."
bad,"Work from home, poor communication and unclear definitions of requirements, Min training and follow up."
bad,"I worked for a great environmnental engineering and consulting firm based in the northeast before AECOM took it over. They eviscerated the company and treated those who were left like dirt. I worked with many talented people who were either laid off due to ""downsizing,"" or who just got fed up and jumped ship. AECOM is the epitome of a mindless corporate behemoth that shows little regard for its talented personnel. Profit at all costs."
bad,"This was about the worse company I worked for in a while, I would not reply for employment unless the entire Management staff was gone."
bad,"Managers do very little managing and hard work is rarely acknowledged. Salary increases are nominal and absolutely NO GROWTH! The company adopts an open space concept to promote collaboration; however, the goal fails when no one wants to talk to each other."
bad,"This is a company that puts management over the people. Being told that you excel at your job and then making you have to reapply for it because another business unit is losing their contract and they now have a chance to apply for and take your job."
bad,"I am working in AECOM India Bangalore Office since 1.5 years. During my intial 3 months I learned a lot but after then I have assigned all the repetitive work. There are lots of field visit even on Saturday, Sunday and they don't pay overtime for that. Suming up all, there is not quality of life."
bad,"It was an alright position, it was also a temp position so you couldn't really get the hang of it because they were already accepting another candidate for the position after I started there."
bad,Not for career enhancement.. The management not manage company so well. So many retrenchment in this company. Not secure when we work here because anytime can be terminate
bad,I was on a few government programs during my tenure at AECOM and once the programs came to an end they told us that we would be laid off. I was fortunate enough to have good supervisors that helped find me a new position. But I felt that I was just a number in this huge company.
bad,"Horrible place to work, management lies to you and no stability in job. Also there is no onsite management and your boss helps with nothing unless begged to do so. Boss also talks to you and treats you like trash,Shows you no respect. Boss will also write you up for anything and you are constantly worried that your job is on the line. They also constantly lay you off."
bad,"Worked there for four years management is a joke. Management talked to grown adults like children and some times down to their employees (bad military mentality). God forbid you miss something on a daily or turnaround or your inspection is done but maintenance was done on your aircraft after you left to go home can I say terminated. The retention rate is way to high 33 people in November of 16 to termination or resigned. The money really isn’t good as overtime is hard to come by,but don’t let management hear that they will tell you if you don’t like you can work at Walmart. There’s no advancement there only why you advance is if you are a retired chief. On the the good side it’s a good starter job for sailors or marines getting out and retirees."
bad,"Possibly the worst management team ever. Coworkers were awesome, but I had zero confidence in upper management. All fluff and rewarded the butt kissers."
bad,Overall the work is really easy but with them being a contractor the job was not secure at all and they could get rid of you in the drop of a hat. Insurance was way to high and if you opted out of there insurance and showed proof else where then they would take it out of your paycheck anyways in the form and going to taxes and retirement.
bad,"No opportunity for the existing hardworking employees, professional - western work culture need to be re-instated as it was two / three years ago. More opportunity to be given existing western employees based on their experience in AECOM"
bad,"First job in oil and gas, not really sure how to gauge this company vs others and working as a contractor to a different company I truly dont have much interaction with AECOM"
bad,Bad client and bad manager.  Client expectations are over the top from a workload perspective and the managers will not back up the projects with the appropriate staffing levels.
bad,Project and project team dependent.  Multiple training opportunities but most do not coincide with project related requirement.  Pay is average.  There are many companies in AECOM which can be confusing.
bad,Unrealistic expectations and quotas placed by upper management.  Leaders do not stand up for their teams and like pitting coworkers against each other.
bad,Their priorities are as follows: 1) money 2) schedule 3) safety 4) quality. The management was more worried with schedule/ money than doing anything right. It was a constant struggle getting compliance with specs and codes. Multiple violations on a weekly basis.
bad,"Strong engineering company that attempts to work in the international development space. Energy  is a large part of AECOM, but the international development department has little motivation and capacity to implement energy projects."
bad,Worked for a subcontractor under AECOM that was not a very good company. Salary is horrible and benefits are not good. The management was horrible as well especially for being in a hazardous zone.
bad,"AECOM was cool to work for, at first. I thought there would be so much opportunity because it is a world-wide company. What I found was a lot of disgruntled employees, that were not paid adequately for their quality of work and did not feel confident in their potential for upward mobility. It's easy to get lost in this very corporate company if you start from the bottom. However, those people who AECOM hired from other companies that already had job skills were paid generously, so it seems the ticket to success here is network yourself ruthlessly or work somewhere else and then get hired into this company."
bad,"Company culture has declined in past few months. The Training for young folks has gone down, Also the company is not open for internal tranfers to other divisions."
bad,"Work life balance is pretty fair. Most supervisors are understanding of family situations. Compensation is dependent upon project. Most projects I have been associated with are considered short term. You are required to reapply for other projects or you will be laid off. The company does not offer placement in other projects. Advancement is meant for few and not necessarily dependent on knowledge, skill, or work ethic. Management is not transparent on issues and communication is rare. The Culture is poor and is driven by poor communication, poor raises, poor advancement opportunities. Their is not a real incentive to go above and beyond."
bad,Watch your back!!! A lot of shady dealings go on. If the higher ups ever went to our shop and seen what was going on they would flip out!! The shop foreman would not stick up for his mechanics
bad,"A well established work space but a need to have a stronger community within it. "
bad,"I was assign to managed something which was not related to my experience and not as per job specification and agreement during job interview. "
bad,"I was working with a nice group of people, but AECOM is not looking out for their employees. No recognition despite the hard work provided with the long hours worked and weekends. Big turnover. Too manual, not automated..."
bad,Not Great. No overtime paid. Bad communication. Forcing systems to work before they are ready. 12 hour days without being paid.
bad,"My work days consist of providing participant information to HR Staff and third-party service provider.  Generating reports for indicative data, contribution and loan payment reviews when compared to service provider data. Preparing balance sheet, data transfer forms and wire request for weekly transmission to service provider to load into participants' accounts."
bad,"There does not appear to be a consistent source of direction when it comes to decisions, protocols and procedures which makes the work environment and moral with this company non-conducive to any type of advancement."
bad,not a bad place to work just the hours and the drive was bad and they wont tell you that your getting laid off until the last minute
bad,"Not exactly a place for talented people to work, does not recognise the potential of good staffs. Work ethics are violated repeatedly. Good people tends to resign within the year."
bad,I learned a lot of different phases of construction in underground or tunnel work. I got more experience in steel and concrete construction.
bad,poor management and not competent. Not able to win jobs for very long time. Lots of ppl left.
bad,I did not work with aecom i worked with the sister companys. I worked with GSS/AC FIRST.
bad,Very poor at planning daily activites. Procesess did not have smooth flow. Other divisions did not work well with each other so it seemed we always putting out fires.
bad,Site manager was not visible to employees. Management policies were vague when implementing them.
bad,"Good Learning experience"
bad,The job was demanding and very busy. Requires lots of experience in the field to be effective.
bad,"84 hour work weeks, no overtime and no benefits. While deployed in an environment such as Afghanistan, moral is as important as a pay check. If the company you work for doesn't care for its employees as much as it's investors, there is a disconnect between senior and subordinate."
bad,"Complete ones task."
bad,You punch the clock and you are billable then you are safe. Butts in seats contracts that are by no means inspiring.
bad,"Typical work day is 8am to 7pm - but longer on many days,"
bad,What kind of a message is being sent throughout the organization when they allow a senior high paid individual run his own business while on URS payroll?
bad,I suggest this company for those who want a work-life balance. You cannot expect though to have an interesting compensation package in this company.
bad,"I was busy and billable all day, every day. I enjoyed helping project managers with tasks they were too busy to complete. My co-workers for the most part were easy to work with, and very intelligent."
bad,"Quality of service dropped when company became publicly traded. URS is a prime example of charging the government $500 for a $7 hammer. Their government contracts with DoD, USACE, FEMA and others are the reason we are a bankrupt nation."
bad,"My position was with EG&G (under URS before it was completely changed to URS). The company was okay and I did enjoy my position, for the most part. The company did not offer highly competetive salaries compared to other companies in the DC Metro region, as I observed them."
bad,The job is ok for the reason that you get paid ok and you get a take home truck . The job is dangerous and you do not get enough training. The scheduling manager should not be a scheduling manger they do not k ow how to communicate with employees.
bad,"Political and profit driven drives operational decisions...... minimal upward movement. Self promotion is abundant, lacking team culture, morals and values"
bad,Extremely corporate environment and culture. Every action needs to go through a chain of command which can slow things down and be frustrating. A lot of good people on staff that strengthen the experience overall.
bad,I started there as a tech two under different plant management and was needing a job due to moving back to moving back to the area and felt they took advantage of my situation and didnt look at my skill set/ abilities when deciding my pay and as time went and so did tue good supervisors management switched to a  better person and pay got better bit due to the unknowns of when the contract was foing to end or not and the buyout of the company i had no choice bit to look for a better stable job die to javing a family to support
bad,"AECOM treats its labor impersonally. The company offers poor benefits and is not shy about eroding them to satisfy shareholder demand. I had anticipated the opportunity to do innovative work, but found that the company is highly bureaucratic and risk-averse. Because there is no room for overhead, there are few formal opportunities to gain skills. People are also fiercely protective of their timesheets, and often interpret offers to help make things move efficiently as an attempt to ""steal"" their work."
bad,The company is highly competitive.  Very young culture.  Open office concept.  Company cares only about the bottom line and not for the employees who have invested years of service.
bad,"company was not interested in employee well being, too little upper management involvement difficult to accomplish needed task do to approval matrix. difficult to feel job security."
bad,Underwent rapid expansion due to acquisitions. Primarily an oil/gas company priorities and business philosophy have yet to change to include the defense industry. Very cutthroat and very direct profit driven. Bottom line style company.
bad,HR reorganized 4 times in under 10 yrs; 4 HR VPs. Business Leaders don’t support HR processes and people; little opportunity for real impact and progress.
bad,"Procurement department being converted to an assembly-line process."
bad,"Still negotiating pay with these guys. Holloman AFB. They basically hide the fact that their health insurance is through the roof."
bad,"No job security. Work structure is on a 'billable hours' basis. If you are salaried, no problem, If you are hourly, big trouble. I simply cannot live on the # of hours I am getting."
bad,"Incompetent Management run by former BD staff who set projects up for failure from inception and then collect large bonuses for booking the revenue to backlog. Additionally there is no accountability from these employees when the projects go south. "
bad,"processing incoming mail and outgoing mail"
bad,Work load is not bad but management is poor and planning and communication are horrible.  I have learned a lot since I started here. Great group of guys work with in Maintenance. Compensation is fair but benefits are not worth it.
bad,"rate of pay is undesirable"
bad,its good pay but the workload is crazy. They don't show employees no appreciation for the work we do. The benefits are good. Its really no room for growth.
bad,"its been very stressful for us, cause we had to take all the work load that has been left behind by other colleague who left and retrenched. Development and promotions are the last thing on their mind. Salary and Bonuses not good aswell."
bad,"The job has a lot of room for improvement. I was told that there would be sufficient training. That wasn't the case. "
bad,"Lots of promises of advancement and development, but when the times get tough, they sell the farm. Our office went from 2 storeys and ~40 people to 1 floor and 8 people in 6 months. "
bad,"- Lots of CBTs upon hiring. (as required for account requests, etc)"
bad,"As long as it was a productive day at work and able to go home safe at the end of the shift, then it was a good day. Structural GF & the Pipefitter's GF were awesome guys to work for because they cared about the input of the people working underneath them. They knew that a happy crew was a safe & productive crew! Hardest part of the job, was watching people with families being laid off....On the account of management bidding aggressively on jobs!"
bad,Didn't win BIDs to be competitive in engineering business. Lots of older people sitting around with high salaries that work in slow motion. Young talent worked much faster and harder for less money.
bad,"No consistency of job description."
bad,"AECOM sits in a very tight margin industry, and has only really grown through acquisitions.  The latest acquisition, URS, puts AECOM on a path to ""realize synergies"" and ""increase efficiencies"".  AECOM has been doing a lot of consolidating over the years and has a very frugal IT budget."
bad,Well blend staff which have the experience and handling the project
bad,"I worked at URS 2011 to 2012 in Business Development and Proposals.  People there were rude and mean.  I wrote up a harassment charge for a person on my own team.  Didn't file it because it would affect her career.  When I spoke to my boss about her, the boss said ""we have to keep her because we are paying her so little!"""
bad,"Good Company, got bought out recently, not where I want to be."
bad,"The work environment can be very stressful and management works towards being ""yes"" men to advance."
bad,bosses were dumbs who liked to micro manage. didn't give a hoot about employees
bad,"Where do I start."
bad,Two weeks of training.  Division eliminated before I was done training.
bad,There seem to be a dip in the contractor business due to the conflics over seas coming to an end
bad,"Work was okay, learned to interact with people from muticultural backgrounds,but management must make efforts to make employee feel more at ease- no timely performance reviews were held..which was another sad thing..."
bad,"Great place to work initially.  Interesting and challenging work and the salary was excellent."
bad,"Work expectations at AECOM do not create a great culture of work life balance. Staffing is lean to maximize revenue, which creates pressure on managers and staff, who seem tirelessly overworked, to deliver projects."
bad,"- Pay below average"
bad,"I worked as a contractor so there wasn't really a commitment to keep me as they said they would, but overall the place was just that...okay. Would I work there again, No."
bad,"I worked on site for the company for a number of years. At the end of the project I was relocated to HQ in Calgary."
bad,"Stressed with not knowing if you will be let go or put on reduced hours"
bad,"The company is structured in silos and the silo I was in was very poorly managed. The managers at or above my level had no experience and did not seek advice of others to make decisions. Great pay however, just very low quality delivery of services."
bad,"Aecom's Denver office has the most negative vibe of any other place that I've worked. everyone truly feels like a number. "
bad,"The Job was not what was presented to me. The operation has no, safety program, no training program, no HR support and was totally disorganized. The program was beginning to turn around but the hours vs the pay was just not going to be worth the stress."
bad,I would not recommended work here. The culture is to stab each other in the back especially if you are new. And they encourage driving to fast and unsafe behavior. And it is only seasonal.
bad,"The job was actually not too bad.  I think I could have made it work for far longer.  "
bad,Been with AECOM for more than 15 years and tried to move up in position. Did all I could - even started my doctorate degree to advance professionally and still in the same position as when I started. its time to move on.
bad,"Corporation that is more interested in bottom line profit than their people.  "
bad,"A very large company and as such, don't get the feel that the company really cares about you as an individual. I spent over 2+ years at a job site before I actually met an AECOM Chief or overall discipline manager or higher."
bad,"Engineering staff is outstanding, though morale is low.  Job security is nonexistent.  No new contracts in the pipeline.  No business development."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with co-workers. The building and location was nice too."
bad,"A very large corporation that continues to grow and work became less of a tight knit community feel. It is mostly consulting based, so if your group did not pull in revenue, there may be budget cuts. Stingy on holidays, PTO was fair, but no sick days."
bad,"It's fairly standard in the engineering consulting industry for mergers to happen at the drop of the hat.  Having been through several, I can honestly say this was the worst one ever and it has left scars that cannot be healed.  I imagine if you are an accomplished engineer or a young graduate fresh out of college that this is a good place for you to work - the pay is good for some lower ranks - but other than that, go running for the hills. "
bad,"Completely healthy and thriving working environment mixed with management who fail to foster employee career paths, approve raises/bonuses, or simply listen for any new directions."
bad,I will not suggest to work for this company because they Laid me off for the a reason that is not justified. I really wanted to retired form this company but they did not understand that. I wanted to be part of a Leader here but others thought I will take the job away. I was never brought up that way so that was not my initial thoughts
bad,As laid back as the office can be AECOM pay employees very poorly and largely forget about employees needs.
bad,"Building construction consultancy firm s used to be held in high regards in the 80s and 90s. They command fees in the region of 12 to 18% of the construction contract sum. "
bad,A typical day at work can be interesting. I have notice that the employee morale rather low for a company of this size.  There are several things that could possibly  be improve.
bad,Not a position if you are wanting to advance with the company. Raises happen rarely if ever.
bad,"Although it was a fairly easy job, I never felt like I had job stability working there. It was a tedious and uneventful work environment. I did gain great customer service and sales experience. My direct supervisor was great, other than that, the upper management and co-workers were unpleasant to work with. All in all it was an easy job, it was not difficult whatsoever. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to assist customers."
bad,"Employee morale and management support are terrible. URS overall is a great company, but the Controller in the General Ledger department of the Austin Accounting Center is a tyrant. Make sure you ask about prior management turnover if considering a position."
bad,Management within the office was poor. No one seemed to be in charge. Upper management at URS in general is pathetic. It is all about the bottom line and zero about the employees. Having worked at a smaller company URS is too big and cannot seem to get out of it's own way. The lawyers and accountants make the decisions.
bad,"AECOM is a big company so there are a lot of varied projects I get involved with. I have learned a lot while on the job about environmental reporting to federal agencies. The management is horrible and always way too focused on the bottom line and don't show care or concern for employees. Management is old and not looking to push innovative new ideas. The hardest part of the job is working with people in other offices without face to face contact. The thing I like the most is the opportunity to work on web servers creating interactive mapping websites. I do enjoy working with other employees in the company, including my 3 direct reports."
bad,Very stressful work environment. The best thing about the company is job security.
bad,"In AECOM Middle East you can easily remark a disconnected Operating System in managing both the design and executing of construction projects, with an obvious farness from applying any quality systems or internal standard auditing, but only a client-oriented managing of the human resources and engineering calibers."
bad,Aecom has the potential to be a good company. There are very unprofessional supervisors unsupportive managers and no chain of command to report anything. They tend to make up rules and they go along and treat employees according to their own feelings. They also change policy whenever they want and discourage inclusivity. Take away paid holidays and discourage outside help such as union although there is a partial union for a portion of the work force and they discourage legal help with threats
bad,Good work life balance. Not a lot of opportunity for growth or advancement. Great place to work if you are looking for stability. Not a place you come to jump start your career.
bad,"The company had really poor management direction. Competition between business lines were heavy, as everyone tried to book similar contracts. Overall, the company waste a lot of resources on useless things and development. Not the best place for development, but good experience learning the industry."
bad,You are a number and you must maintain billable hours if you are to retain your job. Office staff are Cliquey and stay within select groups. Management and mentorship is almost nonexistent.
bad,"Salary is ok for admin work, but department hugely under resourced and therefore no opportunity for advancement."
bad,"You never know what's going to Happen Next. Seems to always be something, Surprise..."
bad,"The people were great to work with. I really liked the 4-10's. I wish I could have worked more overtime to help cover the insurance cost. The health insurance was expensive and didn't cover much until you reached your deductible. I had to get a release from a cardiologist that I didn't know I was going to have to have until I had already started and was expensive because the insurance sucked. 410K wasn't that great. Did I mention how bad their health insurance was? They say safety is priority, but I believe they used that as an excuse to delay the job so they can make more money."
bad,"High turned over"
bad,"Most enjoyable part of the job is my team."
bad,"AECOM overall seems like a good company, but"
bad,"This is a very big company so I think your experience will depend on your office and your team. There are teams that are better than others and no doubt you are going to learn a lot, as you would in any other company, but honestly, the training opportunities are very limited. They won't look after your personal development and will see any interest in learning from different areas a waste of time. So they will give you the same tasks time after time until they exhaust and demoralise you. I stayed there almost a year and I assure you it was way more than enough."
bad,"Everyday is a different day, different task to do or challenge."
bad,"Fellow employees seemed stressed unnecessarily, input was frowned upon, boss would stress importance of safety and procedure then openly disregard. Employees couldn't say anything without being accused of insubordination even when fellow employees knew better."
bad,"I have no commit on this company."
bad,"Fellow workers were great camp was very good , food was great at times "
bad,"Working with fellow coworkers was excellent, learning from others, mentoring others etc. Ruined by micromanaging supervisors and backstabbers. They will exploit the skills and knowledge you bring to the table then get rid of you. Government regulations and rules along with over the top safety program make it very difficult to do your job. Benefits are terrible."
bad,"Very poor management throughout. No routes for promotion. Scare culture in offices and there is a lot of emphasis on timesheets rather than projects. No options to develop or increase training or improve CPD. Company policy seems to thrive on blame culture. Some interesting projects."
bad,"Long hours, good pay, strange management, interesting projects, no planning ahead, no schedule or contract following. Lots of meetings, no assignments."
bad,"Management is unorganized and cannot agree on what is best for the company. "
bad,Not the job for a seasoned person. They do not keep promises when it comes to pay. Would not recommend anyone for this company. Management is unprofessional.
bad,"The company grows by acquisitions and as a result the uniformity that it tries to achieve struggles, this is also hampered by the fact that it is a large public company that's main goal is to meet quarterly targets."
bad,"Management is swift in making executive decisions and prefers micro-managing. "
bad,"AECOM is a tremendous in size and skill engineering company, spanning the globe.  However, the company is very split; no feeling of unity, horrible communication from/with management, and employees typically feel like just a number.  The culture quality needs major improvement."
bad,doing up keep of air force c-5. management never seem to know what was going on and never could assign the work load properly.the only thing good about this job was the pay.
bad,"No means to retain employees, no strategic plan just goals with out operational effective plan. Manger are hired outside the company with little knowledge and key performers are let go because each group does not know that the other group needs"
bad,URS now Aecom is a nice place to work. I liked so much building a strong relationship with engineer to have a good understanding of operations. I even could participate to S&GW monitoring or Air monitoring. It wa fun.
bad,"I worked with very good people. Highly trained and very professional. The people I worked for on the other hand were very poorly trained managers with management techniques reminiscent of the 1940s and 50s. Heavy handed, micro management, verbally abusive and demeaning communication is the norm for the project manager I worked for."
bad,Alright place to work while you look for a real career and collect a paycheck if you can stand sitting in front of a computer in a cubicle 8 hours a day.
bad,"This company has given me the opportunity to try and make a different in my and my co workers life."
bad,"Was there for 10 years. Went in at entry level, to fully certified in all plant system."
bad,The company does not seem to retain employees rather put them on stand by or lay off.
bad,I prefer not to review this company due to the hostile work environment it had.
bad,Co-workers are a great group of people to work with. Management is not quite qualified to do the jobs they are managing so training falls on the few individuals that brought skills to the job with them in the beginning. There is no incentives for training or for going above and beyond the call of duty. Promotions are given for favorites and not for work and knowledge. The job is great for someone likes doing logistical work but you have to possess the willingness to go out and learn it. If someone has a decent amount of logistical experience then the job becomes routine and it doesn't seem like there is much in it to challenge you. 
bad,High stress.
bad,"My honest review, URS in Mossville Illinois is NOT a company to stay on with for the long haul. URS lacks proper management in all departments at the Mossville Cat facility, from managers talking in front of employees about other employees "" not very professional "", talk about putting a person in a very uncomfortable position at work, especially when you have to work with these people. Also, managers would want us to watch, ""spy"" on others and then report back to them because they didnt like that person."
bad,"the co-workers were great to work with, pay wasn't the best. no overtime provided unless working out side of scheduled work hours. lots of great help from management and supervisors steering me in the right direction"
bad,"They were confused, but good employee. the best part was the weekend off. benefits was O K but not the best. than they change it taking away the annual leaves."
bad,"My fondest reward was working side by side and/or volunteering with individuals with disabilities to help make their work duties easier and more helpful to adjust and increase their coping skills in the workforce."
bad,Great supply experiance
bad,Good place to work for robots as a multinational company.
bad,"Working at AECOM had it's moments. The people I worked with were friendly and attentive and were hard workers. I found management difficult at times to work though. Management didn't understand the way our staff did things, and the bottom line was always money in their pockets not customer service."
good,It pays the bills. A typical day at work is processing parts and customer service. A consistant way to meet new people. Co-workers get alone but not very social.
good,Not much opportunity for growth. AECOM is not investing in growth and hiring new employees is always an uphill battle.  Not being able to hire and train new employees limits my opportunities to advance.
good,"you will never get any where in this company,you can do better ."
good,Depending on the project you are on and who the management team is determines how difficult your job will be.  There is no consistency.  There is no teamwork in departments.  The length of time a person has been employed with the company carries more weight than how good you are at your job.
good,"Typical day is 8 hours heads-down coding enhancements and bug fixes."
good,I cant speak for the entire company. I believe the program that i supported lacked upward mobility and failed to train all employees. time vested in the company was over looked and others were fast tracked for more responsibilities.
good,"Frist off, my recruiter gave me the immpression that my base wage was much more than it was.  She tried to lump in every little bit of time and ""benefits"" into the offer to inflate the numbers. Once I found that out, I continued to see this kind of lack of integrity and dishonesty for my short time with the company.  The job was oversees, the host country work week was 6 days. Overtime was only time and a quarter. You weren't paid for all the time you were under the company's control.  The company switched back and forth on host country and US policy which ever way benefited them. All the leadrrship and management had been in country for at a minimum of 8 yrs and they all keep each other in positions they had no business holding.  Absolutely no work life balance. You were up and in a company shuttle between 5-5:30am and didn't return to your billeting until 8:30-9pm.Glad to be gone..."
good,"I worked for ACFIRST, AECOM. I think it was a great company. There is not much advancement opportunity. Experience means nothing, work ethic means nothing, its all about who you know."
good,"No advancement opportunity, NO benefits, low pay, wouldn't recommend this company"
good,Too much of work pressure. No proper guidance from upper management. Completely negative work environment. This review is only for Program Cost Consultancy department. No benefits/compensation.
good,I was laid off 2 times since I started there the were contacted by Caterpillar so when they were doing bad we got  laid off before cat employees did. It's an ok job
good,"poor management, way too many apprentices working for the amount of journeyman. poor communication between management and employees. lack of motivation from management and supervisors."
good,This was a nice company to work for. Management was very nice and my work day changed day by day depending on the ICC. We were under a contract so getting all the sensitive information into the computer was key. I had to upload daily reports from several different Quality Control Inspectors so pressure was on but I work well under pressure. Like working with any subcontractor on any construction job you are under contract so when the job was done so was your contract.
good,It is a great learning experience. It has taught many many things that I can take with me and use the rest of my life. There are things that are better left unsaid.
good,Growth through acquisition with poor assimilation. Management was not properly trained or available to provide leadership and/or direction. Company is totally focused on billable hours vs. quality of service.
good,"i always appreciate my current and job opportunity which could lead and mold me to be a better person "
good,I was able to learn the start of being a Procurement Buyer.  Dealing with vendors on a daily basis - looking for the best price and availability of materials.  Communicating with the people in the field to ensure that they were getting the correct materials in a timely manner.
good,"Empresa que cumpre as normas e as regras estabelecidas, mas não propõe desafios aos empregados."
good,"Company was lacking in benefits but great pay. I enjoyed working at the MOAVCRAD for URS Corp. Co-workers were the best to work with, we were like a big family. I loved my job, it kept me busy and I was always learning new skills."
good,Poor leadership got advancement by who you knew no one was treated equil very clickish organization
good,"Extremely hostile work environment Proceed with caution, schedule pressure combined with the fact that the project had been ongoing for 20 years and no one wants it to end causes a lot of frustration getting the job done. Constant conflict with employees trying to drag out a project that should have been done 15 years ago."
good,lack of continuity with the current employers.  Managers are not engaged enough to make this company an effective place to work.  Many employees make a living of the work of other employees.
good,"The culture is they protect their employees. If you are from a company that was bought by them you are expendable. It doesn't matter who is better qualified for the job, if you have been an AECOM employee from the beginning you are safe, even if you are incompetent"
good,Shift work with mediocre management. Pay was decent and benefits were decent.  Did not like shift work and didn't have much chance to get away from shift work.
good,I trained individuals who once learned knowledge stab me in the back. If you were a hard worker who completed work it put you in the spotlight. There were people their who hid in the shadows and was able to keep job in the end.
good,"Over the years the corporate drive for the bottom dollar disrupted the work environment, gone are the days of potlucks, job reviews and safety awards. Overall appreciation for the staff has disappeared, instead of being proactive they became reactive to the issues faced. the most enjoyable part of my job was fixing the issues."
good,"If you are not a fast worker you will not do well here. "
good,My work relationships and theatrics I worked with were great people with a vast knowledge of processes and we were never at a loss for ways to get the job accomplished.
good,"Company doesn't care about employees just he bottom line, management spend too much time micro managing every thing. No where to advance."
good,"The day would start off with a tailgate meeting with a weekly safety meeting every Wednesday.  I learned on the job the different types of drill pipe.  Management was a stickler for keeping records precise.  My fellow co-workers we a great bunch of people to work with.  The hardest part of the day was trying to find a location for incoming stock,  there was such a lack of space in the yard.  The best part of the day was when you got congratulated on a great job."
good,Its just fine. The oil and gas was very dependent on Oil prices and projects in the market. The management changed alot during my time in the company.
good,"AECOM is a large coproration, the management structure and competence is lacking. If you want to be treated like a number and ingored for advancement this is your place."
good,"Where do I start, I worked on a large DOD project for AECOM.  The management was the least qualified and least  educated I have ever seen.  The management are ""good ole boys"" where fraud and nepotism rule the day.  The job paid low as compared to the rest of the industry and the management blew many opportunities."
good,Job work/ Life balance is difficult to have with the type of long term assignments that are required. There is no office support after taking a long term assignment and returning to the Office.
good,"early start on day, inspect veh ,help mechanics, do paperwork,let supervisor know what was going on "
good,"A typical day is to provide maintenance support for the Navy, and the things that I have learned is to be more hands on with my work. The management team here can be more proactive with the employees. My co-workers are great people to work with very knowledgeable team I have to work with. The hardest part of my job is satisfying everybody's needs, and the most enjoyable part is putting in eight hours and going home to my family."
good,"Job involves Secretarial/ clerical duties which include typing/ reviewing all outgoing letters, reports and other correspondence, arranging meetings with Clients & Contractors, co-ordination with Contractors, faxing, preparing time sheets and attendance sheets of employees, correspondence thru e-mail, preparing minutes of monthly progress meeting, preparing  commissioning /pre-commissioning reports of the projects, preparing monthly reports, bids, tender documents, preparing payment certificates & material submittals, preparing tender/ technical evaluation at ADWEA/AADC/TRANSCO /ADDC, producing various types of spread sheets, organizational charts etc.., telephone attending, co-ordination with office staff & drivers, preparing itinerary (traveling). "
good,"I coordinated employees in assisting an inventory crew with fork lifts, stock pickers and packers."
good,"Worked as Administrative Assistant.  URS is an environmental firm.  Created reports, managed field technicians, wrote proposals."
good,Overbearing bureaucracy with little focus on how to help project managers provide value added service to customers.
good,"Long 10 hour days, Lots of overtime available. Depends on what department your in as to how hard the work is. Work can be very strenuous to fairly relaxed depending on where your at. Most places are very hot in summer time."
good,"Liked the staff to work with. Little advancement opportunity. Management needs to improve. Because it is an international company, much of the work is being sent overseas."
good,"Pay is below average, benefits are there not much to say unless you happen to be in management. Supervision is lacking, more interested in pleasing the customer than to stand behind their employees. Will do what ever it takes to hide discrepancies from headquarters."
good,"working hours typical."
good,AECOM is a good company.  However the Middle East and Africa leadership is more profit driven than interested in keeping and appreciating productive and culturally-accepting and charitable employees.  For example here in Ghana they allowed my contract to expire as work accelled and my junior team grows without proper leadership.  AECOM EMEA appears to be loosly supervised by Global AECOM and has created a difficult atmosphere here.  I will be leaving March 31 with one of the best safety records in AECOM intact for the past 2 years
good,"Small group in Calgary, when I was employed there... The main office is Toronto. It was just expanding into Calgary and had few clients, and little work."
good,"A empresa passou por uma mudança de gestão onde os novos gestores vieram de uma outra empresa falida. No passado a empresa dava muitas oportunidades de crescimento, porém os novos gestores têm pensamentos arcaicos e machistas."
good,"it not very good place to work becuae the management is not good and no body cares about the employee, and its hard to survive for all and the benefits are not as the market"
good,"Huge top heavy corporation. Not good environment for lower level employees. management seems largely incompetent, and out of touch. People in management really have no experience / knowledge of construction / engineering. Very hard for Lower level employees to "
good,"Very busy place to work, lots of people who have been there 10 plus years so it was an overall good working experience.  Great company and would work for them again."
good,the thing here or was at aecom was to mind you own business. if you come into work to what you need to you wouldnt have problems. when management would get stressed out they would take it out on the workers with everything is mandatory. This way or the highway was more of the expression.
good,Hostility among the departments that I was engaged with was my main concern. This was the main reason why many individuals left the company in a short time after been hired.
good,Internal bureaucracies makes a very simple processes too complex to complete in a timely manner.  AECOM has become too large for management to effectively develop internal talent.
good,"I have worked for this company nearly four years. I continue to work there because it pays well. No other reason. The benefits used to be great when we were URS, but since becoming AECOM our benefits have slowly been taken from us."
good,horrific place would not recommend. Management is not well-versed in addressing outstanding employee retention issues and hires inappropriate managers and staff and promotes those that drink the koolaide
good,The Job Culture is ok. Lot of senior management than technical guys. Some managers do micro management. Some weekends are crazy. Some teams do enjoy and others really work too hard.
good,"I liked it there but they require you to retire the year you turn 65. If you've been there for a while, they keep you on until the month before you turn 66. If you're essential to a project or are key to keeping clients, they'll hire you as a consultant for another two to three years."
good,The pay is good but they misrepresent the opportunities to get you in the door and then lie consistently when you ask about advancement!
good,"co-workers easy to get along"
good,"This was a temporary job.  I was only there for 6 months.  We received, sorted and prepared documents to be sent overseas. The company has been sold."
good,the company is ok to work for it is just the leads in our transporation office which need to tone it down and be more involved on the floors jobs and responsibilities.
good,"I am an enthusiastic self motivated team member. "
good,Poor management of projects. Nobody seems to be in charge. There is no control over projects and due dates are missed regularly due to poor planning. Picture a ship at sea with no Captain.
good,URS is a great company but because it is so large they tend to over look the people at the bottom. I just hope that in the future the company would be more focused on employee growth and advancement.
good,An industry that lacks a proper balance between work and home life. The hardest aspect of the job is being away for several weeks at a time.
good,"Management allowed 1 individual to be extremely cruel to the team, this could have been a great opportunity for the organization to grow in a positive direction but the atmosphere was tense all of the time."
good,There was no leadership in the company Birmingham office and no way to move up. I only received 1 pay raise of 1.25 the hole time I was working there I started at 7.75 a hour and they found out we was being paid under scale and they moved us up to 10.75 but did not reimburse us for back time. other then that I got to meet a lot of great people and learned a lot from my old boss that passed away.
good,I was asked to come and work for URS Inc. so I relocated and went to work as a contract employee. Was laid off in 6 mos for lack of work. Very poor foresight on their part.
good,"Typical day of work is kick the tires and fill with gas and wait for arrival back of base. "
good,Company came to Albany in 2011 and a lot of us hope URS may be leaving in 2013 when this contract bids again.
good,Lead a team to make vehicles fully mission capable to give back to the military to complete their missions. The hardest part of the job was being overseas and being away from family and friends.
good,"AECOM is a global provider of professional technical and management support services to a broad range of markets, including transportation, facilities, environmental, energy, water and government. With approximately 45,000 employees around the world, AECOM is a leader in all of the key markets that it serves.

A Fortune 500 company, AECOM serves clients in more than 130 countries and had revenue of $8.2 billion during the 12 months ended March 31, 2012."
good,Training and promotions are at the bottom of the ladder. Technology has caught up and passed to the point where skills are outdated and almost obsolete
good,"confusion ,lack of industrial knowledge in the refinery oil and gas divsion.co-workers were helpful but not overly excited of the constant personel turn over.keeping the contractors dedicated to be safe and productive. making deliverables on time and safely."
good,"This company is so big, there are many opportunities if you don't mind traveling. Sometimes it is easy to feel like only a number. They provide quality services for the projects they have, high integrity, and very moral and ethical."
good,there is a sense of urgency without support from senior management on the project. it is difficult to accomplish the goals without the assistance of senior management.
good,AECOM is a large company and has lots of large firm issues - too many processes and procedures in place that are not applicable to many of the smaller jobs that are bread and butter of my particular work.
good,Management tries to run the work site from thousands of miles away and has no idea of what's happening.  The don't listen to or take suggestions from the site lead or the employees.
good,Love all the guys I work with. Nights are usually very busy. I love working with my hands and learning something new everyday. Pay is excellent and benefits are not bad.
good,"The company is okay, but the only thing is that the job is not fully secured since it's project based. I hope to change the work culture that I am in now."
good,"This is a typical corporate company. You are promised the world and awed with many things, but in the end...you are expected to produce whatever you are told to and produce money for the company."
good,"No teníamos líder, la persona a cargo no nos ayudaba, estábamos solos en el proyecto, nunca me sentí parte de AECOM por que estábamos por outsourcing con SELEX "
good,"Government contract work isn't very rewarding. Times have changed and mostly revolve around low acknowledgement. During my time with them, although i had a decent experience. The money was horrible, and the demand for more work, and performance increased."
good,"There are not many cons working for AECOM as it is such a large company. Saying that, it is sometimes difficult to contact the appropriate personnel at the time needed and when contact is made, response is usually delayed."
good,I was working as a contractor/consultant.  So my job depended on the opportunities that Dow provided for us.  As a consultant you answered not only to Dow lead but company lead as well.
good,When they URS they where listed 7th worst company to work for.. My thoughts they spent a lot of money on PR and forcing Managers to  tout company line . replace CEO and reorganized division and clean house alienating exist and long term clients losing market share. Lack of understanding from of upper management of client needs Definite growing pains way too many MBA running things employee are more less harvested  for the bottom line ie reimbursement
good,"Worked 6 days a week, 10 hour days. Good employees to work with and the immediate supervisor was excellent. Fast paced and you have to supply your own tools for the modification work. Upper management has to play the role of being on Ft. Campbell and seems to let some of the distractions fall down to the employees performing the work which becomes a hinderence in some situations."
good,"I took this job as an opportunity to live and work in San Diego. The job was not to my liking but the living experience was okay given the sunny climate. Basically, a 9 AM to 5 PM job."
good,"This job was a good one at first, until AECOM purchased us - it took a few years, but things are starting to change around here and becoming very difficult.  I do not feel that employees are valued."
good,"management was not helpful"
good,"Overall, good company with plenty of job security and opportunity for advancement if you put in the work. The culture can be difficult, but it's a great place to keep your head down and get your job done."
good,The Company has really changed over the last couple of years.  It is really depressing to walk around the building and see how empty it is and to hear how a lot of employees are worried about their jobs.
good,"It's not how much you know, your experience level, the education level obtained, where you've been or what you can do. It's what your assigned to do. You can be a substandard performer, not know the subject or material and be in a supervisory position. Most information does not go up or down the chain of command."
good,Mucha intensidad y pocos recursos. Mala gestión intermedia.
good,The culture of the company is great and I enjoyed working with everyone. The biggest and only issue I had is that there was no room for advancement.
good,"Buddy system, no chance of advancement. been with the company for a year and a half and had multiple interviews within company and not a chance of advancement"
good,"Though the company has many good aspects the work environment"
good,Lost opportunities and failure to grow the business due to excessive mergers and aquisitions resulting in losing a growing energy business
good,"The company has been up and down and just merged with Aecom, but overall they treated me good. Unfortunately you are stuck at one pay grade and never receive rases."
good,Paychecks didn't add up and the management was horrible the entire time I was there. The work itself wasn't an issue at all. I can't describe the company as a whole but the time I spent with it was one of the worst experiences of my work life.
good,This job has given me a lot of new experiences and I have worked hard to progress. This company could do better by allowing more advancement opportunities or having an annual raise instead of just capping out. Micromanaging/ not listening to the people doing the actual work has crippled and demoralized the hard workers. This company is a good stepping stone comapny or a foot in the door to the aviation world.
good,Some people really like working for this company. I don't really know what it's like since I am based at the SCA. The only thing I can comment on is their health benefits. It's not that great.
good,"Drove to site app. 2.5 hrs there and back daily, negotiated extras to contracts and obtained design answers for trades.  Reviewed all documentation and dealt with on-site and PR issues daily."
good,"In the group I worked at, most of the work there are government contracts,some are long term contracts (5+ year) and some or short (few months). Working with the staff there was good. Everyone got along with each other fine. There was not a defined management structure. No chance for advancement for 99% of the employees there."
good,good place to start and learn. Contract Company and has its pros and cons.
good,Will do anything to meet financial expectations.  Long hours.
good,"Can't really talk about a typical day at work, as each day came with it's own ups and downs. "
good,Management fails the employes when fairness and equality.
good,"I would go to work, and have a safety meeting for 10 minutes every morning. I would go to my work bay and get all the parts i needed to complete my task for the truck that was currently in my work bay.upon completion of the truck i would fill out required paperwork and start to assemble parts for the next vehicle to come into my bay. The management at my job site could definetly use work but we were able to get the jobs completed safely and in the required time. the hardest part of my job was lifting the ac condensors into the trucks.It was a combination of the weight and awkward shape of the items. the most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the finished product that i had completed and everything in good working order with no gigs or defects."
good,Complete water schemactics for Scottish water using StruMAP & Visio. Learned how to use these softwares. All co-workers really nice & always there to help if needed. The hardest part of my job is the travelling to & from the office from home. Most enjoyable part is getting to utalise the skills I have developed through uni and develop them further.
good,"A typical day at work started in the office get an assignment, then it was about assembling equipment, materials and paperwork to take to the job site, which was usuallly a 2 hr. drive from the office."
good,Having a high level of standard on all type of equipment. Using proper manuals for the task on hand. Work hard to keep management off the floor in a work safe enviroment. Having a goog attitude and very helpful to other employees
good,"Better firm than most, but still had the good old boy stigma from past firms that had been absorbed. A lot of ego and chiefs running around driving up costs for the clients resulting in loss of billable work. Many good people lost to other firms."
good,"Good company to work for as long as your business unit is making a lot of money for the shareholders."
good,Looking for a great place to work. Then aecom is a good start. It gives a great base to start with and hone your technical skills. But come with open arms and you'll be fine.
good,"It doesn't matter how many OT hours you put in or effort you show to get a job done, in the end you are just a number. The training involved meant training your self and hopefully you have enough initiative to get a head and stay safe."
good,"Better management better pay they didn’t seem to invest much in the employees, Ihave nothing more to add. The Company should try to improve on it’s leadership policies to get better results from the workers"
good,Spend 10 years with URS/AECOM I got lost in the merger had 4 different managers in one year. End up being outsourced by IBM base on direction of CIO that left shortly after out sourcing most of IT to IBM.
good,"Any job comes down to what you make of it, but this place has great customers and is in a leading field of I.T. It is a good place to learn something different from every day I.T."
good,Working for AECOM was suppose to be wonderful but my goodness what a disappointment. Same as any other low end firm. Talk and smoke screens. They ask for your input and when you give it you are suddenly laid off. No wonder companies can't find good people. Because when they do they treat them like garbage.
good,AECOM Crystal City is a great location to work.  It's a great opportunity to provide financial support for a Navy program office and support the warfighter.
good,"This is a decent company to work for in every regard, except the pay for technicians is drastically under the national and state average. If the company appreciated their technicians and paid them what they were worth, they would have a lot less turnaround."
good,La gestión en España dista mucho de ser la gestión Americana.
good,Pay is under what gunsmiths make no chance for advancement but over all a good group of people insurance is exceptionally expensive  must use vacation days for dr appointments or if you are ill
good,"Its a vibrate environment with opportunities to learn. I started working there during my internship and have grown quiet a lot, my introduction to the working environment though the company was amazing and I was partnered with the best mentors."
good,I worked for the companies that were EG&G Technical Services and URS Corporation which became AECOM.  I did not continue with them because of their company business practices which I didn't agree with
good,Having been head hunted by them I was very happy to work for them and given the opportunity to share my knowledge with coworkers that had spent there entire career at the same office. I also enjoyed being mentored and groomed for further excellence. The gentlemen that I worked with and for will always be held in my memories
good,Be careful working here. Snakes in the grass. Good Ol boy Place in the demil world. False promises as welland you never know who you can trust. Good Luck
good,"very convenient location, nice people, not a lot of work. ever since AECOM took over the place has been going down hill. lack of work and very old staff."
good,"Came from Flint Energy Services it was a good company with lots of opportunity to advance and had knowledgeable management learn from. Once URS then Aecom bought them out most management left or were dismissed, the opportunities diminished and employees began to feel more like a number then part of a productive organization. They started selling off key parts of the business as the construction division of the company does not fit the engineering ""cubical style"" business model."
good,"Overall, I think AECOM is an alright place to work. There are a few people that don't make the office the most positive work environment. That said, there are some extremely bright individuals who are willing to help. "
good,"A poorly ran site from the regional supervisor to the shop supervisor, Management does not support nor invest in their people. Since i have worked there it has been a revolving door of co-workers due to people getting fired for minor infractions, leaving because of poor conditions."
good,"Immature supervisors and management that take out there own inability to lead on the employees. Great pay, but very frustrating place to work... No real advancement and childlike coworkers"
good,A typical work day at AECOM consisted of worrying if you would have a job at the end of the day or even the next morning. The best part of the job was only working 4 days a week 10 hours a day.
good,"Support from client and direct manager badly needed"
good,"Lack of Knowledge"
good,Productive place to work. Gets slow quite often. Smart engineers and project managers. A little favoritism going on in the office. But all in all great engineers and designers.
good,"Typical work days are varied depending on the season and project you are on, can be completely in the office or located in a remote location. While the people I had the opportunity to work with were always great and helped me out to learn what I needed for each specific project, most complications come from organizations inefficiencies and poorly defined measurables and standards. Management was always helpful when it could be, but communications breakdowns between levels of management were nearly constant and caused a lot of internal delays. The hardest parts of the job would be the need to figure out exactly how the project operated, as it varied from one to another. On the other hand the most enjoyable part of the job is the flexibility that management provided with regards to hours and work place location."
good,"AECOM is a very challenging environment.  Depending on what you do, it can be very rewarding.  The people at the company are very nice and great to work with. Management however, is not."
good,"High level of micromanagement, each team works independently. The type and quality of work depend on the team and project. big team are normally chaotic,. Too much overtime with no extra payment."
good,"Very busy place, co-workers are amazing. "
good,"This company is just like any other companies out there - struggling, but still floating and is trying to make waves. "
good,"Heartless management teams"
good,"AECOM is an OK company to work for as long as you are not in IT.  AECOM recently decided to outsource it's IT to IBM."
good,i worked with AECOM around 6 years where i have lead the infrastructure design at Abu Dhabi Office. i was good experience and have strong relationship with several clients.
good,"Set up workers with tasks and periodically check on them through the day while i do maintenance on equipment. I can say ive learned something new every day and still continue to do so. Some of the management knows their stuff and gets the job done, others are just there to collect a pay check. Co-workers have their good and bad days, and who doesnt. its how you approach them that determines if they will produce that day. Hardest part of the job is to have everyone satisfied with a a task. The most enjoyable part of my job is leading by example."
good,"There is too many managers, some of which are graduates that finished their internship and suddenly became managers. Sonetimes unexperienced and production teams are put in danger of losing their jobs."
good,Great group of co-workers. It was a team environment and there was plenty of new things to learn and opportunities for growth at AECOM. This is a very divers company and is a world wide business.
good,Seems like there is double standards between management and technicians .still in startup condition and has 3 joint companies
good,"Good Company but work not long term, however management wasn't the best. There was also a lot of the buddy system going on and unqualified people often got certain jobs."
good,"They are great people to work for. Management understands work life balance. wages are terrible and it's very difficult to move up in the company, but over well its a good company."
good,"This was an excellent opportunity to broaden my understand of pressure piping fabrication , and turnover document creation. The group is very tight knit, and are hard working. The most difficult part of this job was becoming part of the team."
good,"With the down falling economy They keeps taking away from the worker even though they say there people are # 1? They have taken away the RRSP donation, and also had a wage decrees and possible another one in the near future ."
good,"Hired on for a project that went belly up after the economic crises of 2008. Their business model consists of hiring for ""planned"" work and then letting the employees go if the ""planned"" work doesn't come in."
good,"Fair pay with good hours.  Job was to fly to remote locations to check on generators.  "
good,"Every day is differnet, busy workplace, good people to work with, enjoy project leading office moves, hardest part of job sometimes can be the travelling ."
good,"A typical day at work would be to review project reports, follow up with contractors in terms of outstanding document. I really enjoy when a project is successfully completed."
good,This company provided a lot of work experience in my field. Gained valuable business and recruitment knowledge for my career.
good,"AECOM purchased URS in November 2014. They had never owned an engineering company that worked in the oil and gas industry before and a lot of their standard procedures do not fit. We were URS legacy to AECOM. The people there are hard workers that want to perform their jobs to the best of their ability. However, with the oil prices the way they are the industy has hit a slump and people are being laid off or put on leave without pay. Overall URS was a good place to work. I don't know what will happen in the future now that they are owned by someone else."
good,"My work day was aligned with a production schedule which had to met in reference to a yearly schedule.  The work place was arrange according to military unit definition.  I learned to utilize all supporting program's in reference to FEDLOG, AWRDS,LOGSA.  The Most enjoyable part of my job was knowing I gave the soldier the best quality product available."
good,"Stable company, but behind in leveraging technology to collaborate, in order to combine skills to create synergies."
good,"Working at AECOM was great experience working on some the biggest projects in Middle East, Singapore and India."
good,"Very cold company, its all about the numbers and not the people."
good,"relaxed for the most part,the crew I worked were wonderful with the exception of a few but thats understandable. Its not a perfect world. management could be better,Nothing was hard about the work day."
good,"Organized and maintained all aspects of travel arrangements"
good,Provided me with many years of experience and allow me to grow within the company.
good,URS seemed to me to have more interest in making profit at the expense of the employee
good,"Working for the company started off being good, but then after a few months working overseas for the company i realized as well as other co workers it was alot of favoritism of who you knew and didn't know, meaning if someone you didn't get along with you people they may know wouldn't like you based off what their friend told them even if you were a great worker, then the biggest issue was not really knowing weather or not you would still have a job with the contract status,because the company was issuing out pro rated bonuses for certain job positions co workers could go home before their contract ended. I met alot of wonderful people even with all the nonsense with management i keep in touch with alot of of coworkers, and i really enjoyed the winter time because it snowed alot and being from Texas you don't see much snow."
good,"Okay to start out; not a place you'd want to stay. Not much job security, even less room for advancement."
good,"A typical day, getting my job done, making life better and easier for my boss and all 300 employees, I have been thrown into several position and learned very fast!"
good,"Fast pace environment, with plenty of opportunities to cross train, and enhance and develop different skills."
good,I have learned a lot with this company and the leadership is fair towards the employees.
good,didnt explain much at begining learned more from other employees and was neglected to be inform of how to apply full time lost two jobs to other that started months after me
good,Conductut review for systems training.
good,AECOM is a pretty good place to work. Many challenges dealing with its client.
good,"URS spends a lot of time promoting itself as a great place to work and at times it is. But the management structure of the local office is so weak that it becomes hard to work there. I'm not a sour grapes person who got canned for poor performance. I got ""laid off"" when the work slowed down. My perfomance reviews were outstanding. This could be a great company but management does not support or back its key people. It amazes me that a company that will pay a senior person $120k per year plus benefits will not train or support them or give them the authority to do their jobs. No delegation, no client interaction. If a problem exists with a client (pretty common in this business) there are no protocols to deal with it. Many people feel left out of the process. We're just here to bill the maximum number of hours. Everything else is secondary."
good,"Good pay and long hours if you like that, too much government oversight and no set schedule...you may work 40 hrs one week and 82 the next"
good,"URS is a challenging and highly professional organization. Though my job description was as a drafter of structural engineering drawings, I was able to offer my artistic skills in the way of photography on site, graphic design for redesign of the corporate joint venture logo and other little artistic needs."
good,"AECOM is an enormous company with unlimited project opportunities. The short term contract I was employed on was all work and production, with little to no down time, to fulfill the contract as soon as possible. Nothing enjoyable about it, but it paid well."
good,some coworkers were great others need to learn that its not a frat house. Poor communication from the management to the supervisors causing the priority aircraft to constantly change and causing problems among shifts.
good,AECOM as well as URS do roads and bridges as their bread and butter.  They are kind of over their heads in the IT industry.  They need to work on their management style and get a clear distinction between the divisions.
good,I enjoyed my work and my interaction with the project teams. I learned a lot from my colleagues that have been there for a long time.  I appreciated the flexibility my manager gave me to do my job.  I do know since the company was taken over by AECOM the culture and morale has gone down. The push to leave actually was a positive since I have been able to learn more and grown within my field.
good,The management was in transition and didn't really seem to care about the employees. It was a cold and rather sterile climate. I have worked for AECOM twice in different cities and my experience was the same at both places.
good,"Management, scope of work and wage have been satisfying but the lack of work fronts makes for stressful employment at times."
good,"AECOM is a pretty average consulting firm, there is high emphasis on sold time/billable work. I have felt from the beginning that there is not an emphasis on training for personal growth, rather just training that checks a box to fit yearly metrics for the company. "
good,"公司平台真的很好，高层管理人员思路清晰，指导都很有价值"
good,"Excellent salary but no job secure. management also good. I learned so many thing in aecom. working hours to long ."
good,"Very large company with an extremely vast outreach. Impersonal but plenty of opportunity within the company. I worked for an offshoot of the company which is currently for sale, so not much for job security."
good,"AECOM was great for flexible schedules and being pretty open, but to grow within the company is very difficult.  They rather hire new/cheaper personnel for a job than promote within."
good,Current management does little to engage the employee and often does not adequately support the employees independence. Often project staff is moved around so no one person feels any sense of accomplishment when projects are delivered
good,"No job security for any support departments.  If your department isn't a money maker, your job is in jeopardy.  Constant changing of policies and procedures."
good,"Nice people to work for, but job security constant concern.  Focus is on profits and utilization rather than career development. Less than stellar management. Difficult to advance."
good,"Worked with employees on life balance."
good,Aecom is a great place to work. It is the staff that makes it the best. We work well as a team. The pay could be better. I have learned new programs and join in the corporate challenge.
good,"It's a good company. Being that it's large it is stable, but being that it is project based makes things very difficult. You're only as good as your next project and the salary is dependent on a contract basis. If you're not an engineer, don't plan on growing. Good place to get experience and then move on."
good,This was a contract role. Subject to Govt. needs. They can be changed instantly. No job security. Generally if in the correct area you are very stable. No more to tell.
good,"Fast paced workplace. Collaborative environment. Learning experiences and mentoring. Highly competitive, and stressful if you're not used to environments like this."
good,"Working there was interesting and challenging and the management in Aiken seemed to have a focus on the current and potential work available. The AECOM buyout created a disconnect which left many of the group without work as AECOM's corporate business back gound was craft based, not professional services based. It has been a long transition for the combined company and many changes have occurred to get alignments. They appear to have a good future."
good,"AECOM is a large scale company that is diversified with project capabilities.  An individual working with AECOM will have the opportunity to be exposed to a variety of projects and will be able to diversify their respective work experience,"
good,"AECOM is one of the giants in the industry. In this type of international organizations, employee satisfaction may change from location to another. My experience was with the Alberta branch so it is specific to location. The resources you will have is more than adequate however level of professionalism is questionable. Upper management is mostly coming from trades, less educated, more experienced. This could be a good thing if they could educate themselves on the level of the posts they sit in, however, it is not the case most of the time for AECOM. Favoritism is also a big problem, it does not matter how you perform if you are not from the 'neigbourhood'."
good,"Review of this company is out of date (10 years), I trust things have improved. The staff made it a fun place to work, however, the management and expectations of staff and their time was a disapointment."
good,"Salary/ benefits relatively higher. "
good,The nuclear services office has taken a hard hit and no longer maintains a successful infrastructure. Most talent and the necessary experience needed have left the services office due to major downsizing.
good,"Overall its was an enjoyable experience, co-workers were a pleasure to work with."
good,"As the the company changed ownership and grew, from Flint to URS then AECOM. I feel I became more of just a number with AECOM. Less personal of big companies. They did keep me working for the most part in these harder times of lower oil prices."
good,"My immediate managers are great.  The company, not so much.  Short term perspective on only the job at hand by upper management.  Completely disinterested in training staff for the future."
good,"It's a Good Company to work with since it is carrying it's legacy from Aecom US, but in India it is not doing anything for the betterment pf employees."
good,"Overall, AECOM has grown so large that management tends to lose sight of the actual work that is being performed. It is more important to make cash targets then anything else. While the work life balance is great if you're not a manager of some kind, the work load is ridiculous if you are. You are expected to perform many activities that should be charged to overhead, without charging overhead. "
good,"Too much indecision since buyout and cut backs. Lost a lot of benefits.  Have to work too far from home, only see my family on weekends.  Had great co-workers, but most of them have quit due to job insecurity."
good,No a bad place to work.  Unfortunately the lack of work or ability to win projects has caused my departure from the company.
good,"They are a large, convoluted company with no loyalty to their workers. When a job is finished they mass lay-off people and then leave it up to the employees to find out if they have more positions available."
good,"The company offer a variety of benefits and paid above average compensation.  The costs were average in the industry.  "
good,I enjoyed the crew and the project manager but I feel that this company has a lot of work to do to get back to being in the race for high end employer.
good,I enjoyed being able to move around to different shops. the company tried to help you when there was disagreements between you and civil service.
good,"Excellent team work culture and positive work attitude."
good,"Worked at AECOM for a federal project in the DC area. Basically, looked at old military records and made sure nuclear data or intelligence (CIA, NSA) programs were not mentioned. The job was tedious, having to read old musty and dusty records all day. But that could be interesting, especially for history majors. The work center was kinda far from anything, which was one of the reasons i quit. If it was in downtown DC or Arlington/Alexandria, probably would have stayed on."
good,very interesting experience with substantial change over a short period. Each individual should make their own decision regarding their own experinces
good,work ethic is very strong however employee welfare is not so. good to learn and gather experience but promotional prospects are very not clear.
good,"Not for everybody. Unable to deviate from spec installation. Good immediate supervision, Full benefits but expensive."
good,"...................................."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to work with a lot of great people and work together as a team to get our production for that days work.  I really enjoy what I do and making sure that my daily task is performed and completed at the end of a work day.  My supervisor is the B.O.M.B!! he is awesome person to work for.
good,"Company makes decisions without thought to the outcome; good, bad or indifferent.  Poor leadership.  The most enjoyable part of working for this company is the co-workers.  Everyone got along great and team work was always a plus."
good,"URS was a great company to work for, supportive leadership good pay, had plenty of hours in the field, until work dried up."
good,"Working for AECOM starts out as being a great position.  I have learned a lot about the transportation business and have made some good friends.  I have learned to set goals and achieve them.  We have a hard-working team.  The most enjoyable part is working together as a team to go for a common goal."
good,Great job for all that love aviation. But have to have a thick skin to deal with all of the over done safety requirements. Management would do better if it stayed on its side of the contracts by not taking so my direction from the government side of the house. It leads to lower management ending up not being able to make any real changes that need to be made.
good,Jam packed days working to get deadlines met.  Kept on your toes with the workload.  Have some flexibility during the day switching to different tasks.
good,AECOM is now one of the largest engineering and construction firms since the acquisition of URS Corp.  It is typical of the other owners of the legacy companies with average benefits.  Growth opportunities have diminished and there is significant turnover of personnel in the Power Group.
good,"Great company to work for but lacked management strategies and plans. Great people, great culture but employees turn over is great"
good,"Morning Meeting with upper Management to discuss plan of attack for the day and safety processors."
good,Top level managers do not seem to have a grasp of what is happening day to day at the middle management and lower levels within their Federal Systems Management Sector -- specifically Marine Corps programs.  Many unhappy workers supporting the Marine Corps at this time.
good,"AECOM is likely the biggest international company with  nearly 100,000 employees worldwide. I was responsible for the implementation and advancement of project controls and project controls systems in the Africa region. This included technical installations & deployment, training and high-level administration. It also included the offering if PMIS services to clients as a stand-alone management service. I naturally adapt very well to new environments and people and would like to believe that I am generally liked and respected. My management style is inclusive and sympathetic, while stringent when required. The most enjoyable part of my job was the ability to express creativity in the manner with which system solutions are designed to suit specific products, the biggest challenge being change management for employees to adopt and adapt to new systems."
good,"Processing, filing and archiving of documents."
good,Working as contractor through URS was interesting; Had to provide own work maintain own schedule and make sure up to date on all processess
good,"As far as the graphics & programming departments go,the immediate management trusts you to do your job (but not blindly), Co-workers are always willing to share knowledge. "
good,"this company does not have a culture, not stable."
good,"Good company, results driven. Individual offices compete with each other vs. toward common unified goals."
good,"Open, update & close work orders, send and receive interfaces. Send out reports on the daily, weekly or/and monthly bases. Assit the customer by explaining to them the procedures and guidance on how to operate certain or any area of the systems and the organization as a whole in conjuction with the military. Order, receiving & issueing parts, conducting invetory every month and other tasks as asssigned."
good,"Boring place to work with lame co workers. Your employment is only as safe as the current contract the company has with the client. If the contract goes away so can your employment. The company is setup to make money even at the detriment of the employee. All the benefits, paid leave, vacation, sick time is setup to take advantage of the employee. the cost of healthcare for an employee with a family is actually pretty expensive. Don't let the big name, reputation or international presence influence your decision, at URS you are only a number not a human being."
good,Good work place. pay and benefits were good. There was just not enough time in USA to raise a family and work overseas.
good,"Being such a large player in the engineering world, URS is a great place to start a career or just a great addition to your resume. There are many very different and very interesting projects. There is a vast array of skills and information floating around at any given time. There is a lot to learn and the culture in generally welcoming. Do not however mistake their nice demeanor for loyalty. You are only as necessary as your billable hours justify."
good,"Maintaining UH-60 for MFO, phase, unscheduled through flight line maintenance. Most tools and parts at this remote site. Management is in Fort Worth, very few responses for email as benefits and when will my tools arrive. Typical coworkers, everyone has their day, on the most part, one of the better crews I have worked with. No real hard work to this site.. Ability to join tours of the Middle East and Europe.."
good," Excellent typing Speed"
good,The department I was working for was not very well managed at the time in 2009.
good,"Provided design calculations, Estimates and analysis for different type of RCC and Steel foundation structures."
good,I have learn a lot a daily basis due to the multiple task and subcontractors that I am tasked with. My direct supervisor is always placing new opportunities on my desk so that I become a well rounded Contracts Administrator.
good,There was a lack of relationship with anyone within URS. The company was too large with its sole goal to make money.
good,"L'équipe est sensationnelle. Malgré les coupures surprenantes, les gens se serrent les coudes."
good,"My management is very good, compensation is below average for the area and experiance"
good,"Very Corporate and stale environment, good pay and benefits. Opportunities for advancement exist however and difficult to achieve."
good,"of course no workplace is perfect but this company could always use an improvement. "
good,My work schedule is flexible and allows for me to accomplish task that can't be completed after normal working hours.  It is a low stress environment to work in.
good,AECOM cared more about there financial gain then there employees welfare and moral. The unit was undermanned and overtime worked was not allowed to be entered in time sheets. Overall felt unappreciated for the hard work.
good,Ok work environment.  Heavy construction area. Serious safety concern. Constant oobseration. Regular progress updates.  Weather can be restrictions. Good supervisors
good,"Good place to work. there is the ability to take classes to further your career, and there is plenty of AECOm, FEMA, courses to help you get ahead in your career."
good,"This was a great money job but it's treatment of workers was sad. Although they use their motto ""one team one mission"" they do what they have to n pressure those capable to pull the weight of the ""team"" sho the job gets done."
good,My 12 years working with AECOM has gain me lot of experiences in different kind of discipline especially in wet and dry services. Learn lot of drafting techniques and utilized my working background being a civil engineer in different aspect of technical solution.
good,"After the 5th merger, the work culture didn't quite recover. The departmental communication was disjointed. New leadership was disconnected and attrition was significant."
good,"-good exposure for large scale project"
good,"This company gives the opportunity to grow as a professional and expand expertise. During my stint with the company, I have expanded my technical and mechanical experience on airframe maintenance and grown as a leader and supervisor."
good,"I was challenged and enjoyed what I did. I had unofficial mentors. I did not experience a collegial or learning environment, however. No opportunities or support in building a career there or overall. In retrospect, that was disappointing. I also did not get a bonus based on the work I brought in -- that was a benefit of upper management (mostly male). I find this to be the case at companies like AECOM, but I believe (hope) this is changing."
good,"A typical day at work the receptionist area is very best with clients meetings, multi-lunch meeting at the same time different conference rooms. Vends and delivery. Ordering coffee supplies The staff are friendly. I enjoyed working with the employees and the helping with the timesheets."
good,"Work days are normal when compared to the other local firms.  I was previously employed by URS until AECOM purchased the company.  Following that, we lost a couple of holidays and the 401k match was cut in half.  I travel a ton with my position and work between 50-80 hours during travel weeks.  The workplace culture has become more about how we can make AECOM money vs taking care of employees."
good,"It was great to have worked with AECOM Europe.  The mission was accomplished to the satisfaction of the client, the European Union.  Notwithstanding such success and achievement, there's been absolutely nothing in terms of future opportunities, and even complimentary recognition of what we accomplished."
good,"The company took a different direction."
good,"AECOM in the location I am in is not a place I would recommend for someone to work at. Financially, it is a great gig. You do get paid well. However, if someone here decides they do not like you... God help you!"
good,"I first started with AECOM when they were URS. Unfortunately with the economic downturn, there were many changes with layoffs and job duties. I also found as AECOM was not an oilfield company, it was hard for them to understand the oilfield business."
good,I’m not sure why I have to write out one of these. It’s a good place to work I just wish they paid a little more and there was better job security....
good,Team is very experienced and have good communication but management is very far from team and doesnt understand the needs of team. they force people to complete projects ın a very tight schedule and this cause project quality to be low than usual.
good,"Received plenty of training for all types and levels of work. From operations to utility yard work to waste management activities. The work can be slow and idle at times which can become annoying in itself. When things get slow the management begins to dig deep into whatever they can find to terminate. The job security is low, due to the fact of your working yourself out of a job, once all product has been processed the job will end."
good,I truly enjoy the company I work for the only thing I don't like is that we will never get pay increases and its physically demanding working in a warehouse.
good,"People were unhappy to work there. Many left for better opportunities. Diversity really needs to improve, women should be treated equally. Overall a very toxic workplace."
good,"Firm cannot stay with a plan and stick to it. Everything changes on a regular basis: policy, plan, personnel. Gives the impression that they are flailing and constantly searching for solutions to nonexistent problems."
good,It's not about what you've done. It's about what else can you do for the company. It's a cash-grab. Their goal is solely to garner as much revenue as possible regardless of how it's done. You may work 12+ hours a day and your manager may still be unsatisfied. It's all about the money. No development - no training.
good,Good culture and flexible schedule or people with a family.  Employees are friendly and understanding.  There are a multitude of projects to work on here.
good,"The local Alaska office had a great team environment, managers that believed in their team members and cared about their success. The management outside of the local office was constantly changing which made productivity difficult at times."
good,The company has gone through extreme growth in the last couple of years. AECOM has purchased many competitors and industry leaders in order to place themselves in high demand.
good,"Well balanced work load, schedule adjustment not really possible.  People are laid back for the most part.  Wasn't a bad place to be, but not exciting either.  Very budget conscious."
good,This company has a good atmosphere. Very diversified. Management are good. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the technology. The people you work with.
good,"Many employee engagement activities, ranging from sports to food making workshop and calligraphy."
good,"Job work/life balance is better than in public accounting. However, employee benefits such as medical insurance and dental insurance are poor; it needs a lot of out-of-pocket expense."
good,"8 hours per day, 5 days per week. Spent most days flying on Boeing 737 aircraft as Flight Mechanic/Backup Flight Attendant. Nice work environment and yet a constant routine not boring."
good,"AECOM is a place to work if you are looking for experience and it pays wells.  The health benefits are pricey and where I work, we are working ourselves out of a job. No longevity at this site."
good,"Huge Company, Good Benefits, but lots of turnover.  When I was there, there was never any real structure. Lots of turnover as well.  Alot of departments were closed and people left without alot of notice."
good,"bad management. "
good,"The job I do is very interesting on a day to day basis. However trying to advance within the company is difficult. It is a challenging job, the days seem to go by fast. Everyday is a new challenge."
good,"AECOM was a fine place to work. I only have a few complaints, there was really no room for advancement. No raises unless you got a new position. Management and workforce communication were lacking."
good,"Good innovative culture. This company promotes new ideas and engages in employee feedback, regularly. Every day is mostly the same but it's a good company."
good,"You get overworked if you do good work. They are mostly concerned with selling hours and squeezing the most out of their employees.  They have pretty high turnover."
good,Ive been with the company for eight years and overall they are a great company but there is no advancement within the company. Management needs to improve.
good,"I worked for various Senior Executives at AECOM. Coordinated Events for Holiday Parties, Travel, Calendars, invoicing and took care of all basic routines to run the floor on a daily basis."
good,"AECOM has been in an up and down slide as every other company in oil and gas has. It has its benefits, my career path started with Flint and they are now Aecom. the guidance was not there but they got you started. downside there are some behind door agreements that are made and its not fair for everyone else. i feel if you earn and get the education for your trade or job you should be paid accordingly. people who don't take the plunge and upgrade there positions should not be paid more than a qualified individual."
good,"At Vistaprint i learnt a lot. I learnt very much about employee transportation for night shift. My co-workers are very good and always help me because i have learnt lot about cafeteria management, process of vendor registration in the company's software, raising of PO through software, etc. There is particular time given by MD in that time any one can meet to him. To develop procedure to register any complaint on JIRA train for facilities was the hardest time for me and i have achieved it. i was enjoined a lot by taking active part in organization of annual event."
good,Could have a more focused approach to work by the management. Higher management not focused on people growth in the organization.
good,"I stayed for 10 years until the big recession of 2008 hit. As a company it is great with over 55,000 employees. will managed."
good,"I prefer not to answer this as the last 4 years has been the worst I've ever gone through. To begin with the job was fun and I learned a lot.  But 4 years ago, we became a service center with a new manager who changed the entire atmosphere of the office and our jobs. And then 2 years ago we went under a different division of the company and URS was bought by a company named AECOM and things just got worse.  People were being laid-off until it got to my position and then 10 of us lost our jobs.  In the last 4 years I went from 9% raises to 1% and 0%"
good,The work environment was good and the people were fun to work with. Sometimes work came in piecemeal and the servers were overloaded which cause slowdowns.  The compensation seemed low and raises when received were small.
good,"Great place to work; however, some of the managers need diversity training.  Some of them are o stupid, you can't do anything, but feel sorry for them."
good,While I worked there is was first called EG&G and then changed to URS.  The atmosphere was always upbeat and everything on the government contract was in order and working very smoothly. Have not worked for them since the company has become AECOM.
good,Have seen numerous of times where the company cares more or less about their employees as well as their means of survival.  Winter months are coming and employees will lose hours without compensation.
good,"I liked that we were able to take breaks in shacks with A/C and heat throughout the day if we got too hot or too cold because all of work is outside. Most jobs I've worked didn't offer such ""luxuries""."
good,Not a lot of room for moving up in the company.  Great people but the pay was not great.  Didn't offer a lot of perks.  Working with contractors proved to be a big benefit as my liaising skills got much better.
good,It was both fun and challenging at times. I worked 7 days a week and 12 hours a day for months at a time. I worked in a conflict zone where we could expect incoming rocket attacks at any giving time.
good,Has been a good place to work. Good people. Hard lately with the downturn in the O&G Industry. Be prepared for many changes and to accept them and move forward.
good,"work as aircraft maintenance, contractor. 40 hour work week, little or no overtime. spend about 20% on the road. great co-workers. left on good terms, tried to get hired back but will not contact or reply to e-mail or job submit. lots of jobs overseas on web site. but like to hire expat's for these jobs."
good,"create plans and design aspects for the project in work"
good,"Ok if your an Engineer, not much going on for administrative group, no room for advancement"
good,"Only two of us in the Central Publishing Bureau department consists of 300 staff.  It is now called AECOM where during my employment it was called ""Meritec"".  An engineering consultants where they bid for big jobs throughout the world, and my job was to collate and typing their proposas with the deadline.  Organisational skills comes in to play and prioritising can be a deman.  I enjoyed it most because I learnt the engineering jargon."
good,"This is not a bad place to work. Just like all jobs, it what you make of it."
good,I was at a small camp where work load wasn't all that busy. My time there I learned how to work and QA the military MRAPs. The manager at the current time never showed interest so he never came around. My co-workers were knowledgeable and helpful. Hardest part of that job was being in a hostile environment and the most enjoyable part was the soldiers and contractor there made It fun.
good,"A bit of background: My only reason for seeking other employment is that, like in all construction-based industries, available work hours are specifically tied to active contracts for that particular office. Since the economy hit significant problems in 2008, the rate of incoming contracts - specifically which allow for chargeable administrative hours - has been greatly reduced. I gave a low rating on benefits only because when my hours dropped below 20 a week, per company policy I was also dropped from benefits. "
good,"Usually I am very busy.  When I come to work I usually start from going throw my inbox and identifying the jobs that need doing urgently.  If there is too much work I have to think of re-distributing some of the work in order to stay on top of things and get everything done.  Mostly I am involved in document control, so I am keeping eye on all incoming transmittals and issuing outgoing files and drawing as required.  When I have a moment I do scanning and filing off all the staff that was received and issued.  This is a bit of a time consuming job as it is required linking various databases for the future reference but It's very important to do it thoroughly.  During the day I might get asked to provide reception cover or arrange some travelling ticket or book a car, it really depends on what day will bring us.  Some day I have to set up WebEX conference or book a meeting room and provide some refreshments. My duties are not limited by document control so I am involved in everything to extend.  In the evening I am franking and sending outgoing mail."
good,"Inexperienced manager leading a highly technical operation that ""just doesn't understand"" every thing really make the day long and trying."
good,"Originally company is UMA. After they merged with AECOM, many people left the company. No idea about the company now."
good,They Will call or text and tell you to come to the yard that they wont to to go with someone and work. sometimes the info that the office gives you is right sometimes not. Get to the job sit and there not ready or there waiting on you. there have been times that there wasnt work for weeks and you would get a 40 hour garrenty but they had just reacently taken that away from us so if it gets slow you will not get any money for that week. theres nothing you can do about it but if thay have work you are making alot of money.
good,"Conduct scheduled and unscheduled maintenance. Maintain helicopters avionics, armament, and electronic systems. Complete Battle Damage Repairs. Assist U.S. Army as required with tasks and modifications."
good,"A large, diverse company like AECOM has the resources to pay well without posing much danger of company failure. There is a strong corporate culture of safety and training. Management at the local level was friendly and encouraging to staff. Co-workers generally were amiable and cooperative. The job was overall quite enjoyable, with a good balance of field and desk work."
good,"Once a great place to work, now plaqued by a indecisive management and budget problems"
good,a big company with opportunities to work on bigger progects
good,Confianza en el desarroyo de trabajos y confianza al trabajar.
good,"Nothing really to dislike.  My only complaint was the company is very tight in regards to company overhead dollars.  Company did not provide my team any compensation during a short lapse period where our contract was being renewed.  They didn't have to, but it would have been a nice gesture considering the work and the tenure of the employees involved."
good,"Typical work day. eat, sleep, work. nothing else to do. 7 days a week sometimes up to 20 hour shifts. I would learn to sleep standing up. "
good,"Desde el día que inicie mi jefe fue muy colaborador en las enseñanza, el día a día era trabajar y ver hacer los pedidos que nos pedían los clientes mayormente no tenía idea de cómo hacerlo pero mi jefe me enseñaba y aprendí muy rápido a desenvolverme y desarrollar mis propios pedidos."
good,"Working for URS can be shakey. I was laid off and re-hired less than a month later. I was again laid off about 2 months later. Working for them is OK, but it seems like they are more interested in their bottom line than the employee. Over the past few years the company took away all paid sick days, 401K matching, and changed paid vacation policies. All of this lead to my own worksite voting in a union in order to protect our benifits."
good,Learned a lot
good,"Within a month of being hired onto this company along with about 20+ other individuals they had a lay off. 5 months after that they had another massive lay off which ended my time with them. Zero job security, even for a contract job."
good,if you have worked any govt contract you know if its urs or L3 or asi or any other acronym they are pretty close. urs has slightly worse benefits then L3.
good,"Mclb... It's very taskful, learning advantages, the job is what you make of it, if you do what you suppose to do then your work day or week will go very smoothly"
good,URS is a mutinational engineering firm with almost 500 officesacross the globe. URS is a steady place to work. However advancement is very limited as they always hire from the outside. rather than raise from within as they place a lot of emphasis on acquiring resumes. URS acquires other engineering firms to expand into markets or countries.
good,"Responsibility, less management control. Ease. Multicultural environment. Enjoyable. At ease to work. Good working environment. Enjoyable. Workplace culture."
good,"Sometime union shop limits you earning potential. Check to see if their is a growth plan for you."
good,"Unfortunately AECOM management at the corporate level doesn't recognize or even understand many of the cultures with its acquisitions, only sees the corporate side of things. Many skilled, dedicated, long time employees from the previous companies were not recognized for their qualifications, dedication and expertise."
good,"A really good company to work for. the only reason I left was due to the contract ending. "
good,my job as a mechanic is a very good experience every body helping its other especially the m1a2 mechanics my supervisor very approachable no problem at all.
good,"Mostly paper work of a typical document controller site related works such as inspections , reports, drawings, minutes of meetings all those thing commonly processed on site activities day to day basis."
good,"Fantastic opportunity’s at AECOM! "
good,They have great projects and a lot of good people on the plus side.  Corporate greed seems to control this company and they would actually make more if they listened to their employees.
good,"Corporate life!  Safety is number 1!  A typical day for me was answering phones and email communication, greeting office visitors and clients.  The hardest part is dealing with accounting department that is located outside the US."
good,"The job is honestly like no other, and I mean that in a good way. Pay is good benefits are great. People will be people and as you know some are good and some not so much so there's that. Other than that I recommend."
good,"would welcome a call back. when I became unavailable to work on the night shift, the leadership wanted me to work on the night shift and did not allow me to return to day shift after my surgery.  Since  I was very productive and a hardworking contributor, I would be happy to return to work at MCLB for AECOM during day shift and for a cost of living adjustment.."
good,Company going though changes. Main business is infrastructure project.  Power construction business is suffering due to downturn in power projects in the US.
good,"work is fast and difficult. Many approvals but when you get something across the finish line, it is well worth it. I do recommend this company as it afforded me much opportunity."
good,"lower level mangers work well with workers. The higher level mangers seem to micromanage. Making workers uncomfortable and leave the company leaving the one that are buddy, buddy with the higher management."
good,"Your Review:"
good,A good place to gain a foothold in the industry or gain short term experience. . The laid back work environment is a plus. Terrible benefits and middle of the road pay.
good,"It's a job that pays o.k, If you have a good crew to work with. no training or orientation, lack of direction from leadership ,kinda figure things out yourself."
good,"nothing fancy, typical aviation contractor. when they took over our site nothing changed except the name. still continued all the same benefits and pay."
good,"I was an intern at AECOM for 3 summers and while it was a good job that I could have continued doing after school, the type of work I was doing wasn't for me"
good,AECOm is an interesting company to work for.  There are multiple rules and smaller companies that formed the whole.  The company focus was diverse due to the number of missions and companies involved.
good,"lots of travel"
good,"As long as you are assigned to a project, everything is fine.  Once the project is complete, you may be put on the shelf until something new comes along."
good,"There are opportunities to work with and mingle with other departments, and so it allows for some firm of cross training. And these opportunities are subject to how the department lead could facilitate and allow the team to schedule for participation"
good,Analyze and review projects.  Advance in Excel utilizing VLookup and Pivot on a daily basis. Managed reports and help with month-end closing.  Reconciled GL Accounts.
good,this job was a high demanding job that required a ton of hours to be worked.  Having a newborn at the time it was becoming harder to differentiate work and home.
good,Safety based culture with focus on conduct of operations. Total time accounting is used for exempt employees. Close group of employees due to working in this type of industry for over 20 years at various sites.
good,"They pay is above industry standard, the benefits are okay. The work hours are very stable but layoffs happen a lot and often without warning. People are often laid off based on their work area versus time with the company and performance history. There are also few to no opportunities for advancement unless you know the right people."
good,"Focused on safety and cost instead of mentoring and quality of products to clients and partners, often baiting and switching staff to benefit some but not all."
good,"My division of AECOM is nonconfrontational, supports employees who they are afraid of really.  Quick to pull the trigger on good employees while slow to address bad employees."
good,"Management cares about productivity and nothing else.  Part of an air craft reset team. Pay was reasonably priced,  for amount of work conducted. Management is ok."
good,"The salary and benefits are competitive for the market."
good,A huge company that is broken up into many parts that often don't know what others are doing or what assets are available outside of there own group or office.
good,"Worked on Brookfield properties projects "
good,"One team two many bosses with different directions and expectations. "
good,Working in this company is a challenge. Company must provide a good numeration package as per category. Company should provide good insurance facilities to its staff including the families.
good,"The time I spent at Washington Group was a comfortable and productive work environment, I learn to work in the field collecting data and to draw the survey plans through MicroStation and AutoCAD"
good,"This job is not for everyone. It is very tedious, and if you are not interested in this field do not apply for this job. Can be put on projects that are far from you so might have to drive long distances."
good,"As with the norm of the ACE industry, job security depends on the market timing and your project."
good,"I worked at URS and left before AECOM acquired the company. From my understanding, things are pretty much the same. great opportunity for young staff to take on projects."
good,"I was a consultant for a school district in which i ran several projects at one time.  AECOM did not follow me on a daily basic but held off site meeting at the corporate office to update on AECOM news/policies.  "
good,"As Logistics Manager I spent my day's managing field crews out in the field and solving any issue that might come up.  "
good,Good place to work with good pay and benefits.  The management is very relaxed and the company offers very good benefits.  Hours are full time but if you need to take time off the company is very flexible.
good,"Overall, I have been able to grow and advance within AECOM.  However, I feel that my immediate management was poor and did not cultivate good customer relations. I felt that the work environment was aggressive and uncomfortable, however I enjoyed the work very much."
good,"I really like my time at AECOM.  Although the commute is a killer, I am afforded the opportunity to work from home which makes its not so bad.  The people there are awesome."
good,"Very big company"
good,Local office was good to work for but such a large company that did not allow for certain incentives.  Work was satisfying but did not do private development.  All municipal work.
good,"Good culture. Great people to work with. They gave us lots of freedom to innovate and try new technologies. Great collaboration with co-workers. Enjoyed working there, but the salary was low."
good,the man in the hat ate a cat. A dog likes to chase badgers up the wall. Why does the midget like to eat cake. Where are my pants gone. why do I have to fill this out
good,"Good work atmosphere, nice coworkers. Something new every day. Good managers, low pay, decent benefits, got the best of both worlds with field experience and office experience."
good,"I didn't come in with a Bachelor's degree. If you have a good manager or someone here you can ask for work you will be okay. In my case, I've had good and bad experiences."
good,"Bad Working Environment because of management , Great Training, Relaxed Atmosphere, Independent work, Lots of Incoming Calls,  However no room for advancement."
good,Safety is our number one priority. Every morning before the day start we have a safety meeting or we call tail gate meeting. Then before you start your job do pre assessment on task for the day. Check all tools and equipment before use. Lunch and coffee break is also the time to review or check if there's some changes that needed to be documented or log before doing your task. again always double check what you are doing for your safety and others as well. Do not be afraid to ask if your not familiar what you will be doing. others will teach you and guide you so you will learn what you are supposed to do. Everyone is vey patience to mentor others. This company will give you lots of experience and new knowledge to do your job.
good,Contractor was a sub at a nuclear plant. Safety was medi-ocre and management in charge needs to treat employees more appropriate. Associated workers were great.
good,Was a good group of co-workers both in the office and in the field.  I was working there for less than a year.  Due to lack of work most were laid off.
good,"Great company to work for, I work in a smaller office so work slows down often in winter but also have times where we are way to busy. I would recommend AECOM but be prepared for threat of layoffs if work gets slow"
good,"very high volume of work and very productive, a lot of overtime but sometime not very productive due too all the overtime. No concept of work life balance, just production, production, production"
good,We sit around for an hour before being told what to do for a job. Then given the job and half the time don't have the equipment to do the job. Our shop chief doesn't know what he's doing in management.
good,Days at work we didn't really have much to do or want to do because we were underpaid. I learned how to work the IFTE system. Management was poor and didn't care about their employees.
good,good projects and good people to work for.  Traveled a lot - outside and inside usa.  Overall good experience with low salary.   Good first experience as a fresh graduate...
good,The company was productive company the job was made of teamwork and communication. The group worked together and did or safety work in the field to complete the task.
good,I enjoyed working at URS/AECOM.  The people were great and we were treated well.  I enjoyed the opportunity I was provided as well as the work environment.
good,A good place to work with advancements in the company. The job was scheduled to last for a short time once the mission(the destruction of the stock pile) was completed then we would all be out of a job. But we had very good bonuses  at the end.
good,"good company, work hard and you will go far, sometime the run out of work and tell you to sit which sucks. But usually when you call them they will get back to you"
good,"Responsible for 6 staff members on board Vessel, maintaining over1700 pieces of military war stock, used for live missions based around the Globe. Keeping accountability and record up keep on a daily schedule."
good,"Only worked in their Cleveland office for 1 week, so I really can't"
good,"Interesting experience at Aecom"
good,"One of the things I appreciated and enjoyed most about AECOM was the flexibility it allowed its employees to work from home.  "
good,"this was temporary job but had lot of exciting people to work with . work experience was different then usual , benefits of home trip was very nice  and enjoyed very much ."
good,"I guess it depends on where you have worked. It is a hugh company with multiple disciplines. Each region's focus is quite different, that my experience is not typical I guess."
good,Good management and work load in the beginning but then got struck doing same work again and again. Not enough opportunity to advance or do interesting work.
good,"This job was a good job where I learned several new skills. This was the first position I had which included multiple responsibilities and I loved it. My day started with answering phones and progressed to sorting mail, coding invoices, copying and binding reports and ended with preparing FedEx shipments. I was also responsible for maintaining office supplies and filing reports."
good,"A typical day at work was good paced and for the most part a joy to be there."
good,"With so many acquisitions over the past decade, this company seems to be bursting at the seams.  The rapid growth has come at the cost of corporate culture which seems to be missing as staff form acquired firms struggle to make their mark."
good,"There were a number of policies that I did not agree with, and could not get a reasoning for.  "
good,My work day was busy with designing electrical projects and overseeing the construction design from the beginning to the end regarding the electrical design concept of project.
good,The management and resources is just so so for AECOM as such a global company.
good,they have 3 shifts that you can work and after 3 months you switch shifts( if you work the first shift then after 3 months you will switch to the second shift). but it was nice for the most part. wish the would have kept the contract
good,It is a great job ! just no advancement.I am typically running from job to job sometimes its required but most of the time I just like to stay busy. Everybody gets along and works great as a team.
good,The job is easy paced on any given day. I have to be a self-starter and I learned the electrical distribution system on my own with the expectation that I train others. I taught myself to the point that I became subject matter expert in my department. Not a fair thing when you lose overtime to other people you train. The culture is about safety. There isn't anything challenging about the job except the ridiculous requirements by the government. The people make the job enjoyable.
good,"Good Company, they provide excellent welfare to their staff. They have excellent portal and network which expedite the work process. They provide training and keep us refresh."
good,Opportunities to utilize engineering skills and grow as a professional. Formed good relationships with coworkers and a few managers. Challenged with workload.
good,"It was good working experience"
good,"I learned alot about being a Mechanical Drafter at URS. I was able to"
good,I work directly with the customer and it can be stressful at times.  Due to the nature of the work there are a lot of details and variables that you have to solve problems for
good,"At the time I worked for this firm, travel over over 25% across the nation for up to a week or more at at time with long hours. This was stressful. Projects required long hours at time to meet deadlines."
good,This is the second time I've had ot review the same company. Sure wish I could get away from this ground hog day feeling............................................
good,"Pretty typical, large company. Lots of hours sometimes and less others. Big on safety. Met some really great people there. Sometimes there were opportunities to learn new things."
good,i spent 9 months working for aecom on an OCONUS assisgnment and i must admit it was an excellent experience and would definitely work with this company again.
good,"overall the company benifits are awsome but management is poor and doesnt think about employee intake on certain things we bring forth when asked. the most enjoyable part of working with AECOM is the building i was contracting at everyone was friendly. the typical day at work ive had the pleasure to meet very important people and learn up close and personal about certain things that occured in the past with the gorvernment, and also the people that helped our country."
good,"Management is not bad. The only issue is that it is extremely hard ( if ever) to get a promotion. it also depends on where you are ( position-wise) if you are on an administrative level, there are not many chances, or any at all."
good,"Depending on which department you work for you could either love it or hate it! I work for the federal services contracts and management is largely inattentive to what each site is doing. My personal leadership structure is more closely resembling a ""good old boys club"" than a productive, ethical, and morally capable management structure."
good,"Working with Aecom is good experience with design team developing confidence in your self"
good,A good opportunity to be part of a large organisation with access to significant projects.  Travel is encouraged.  Enjoyed the internal culture and attitudes of senior leaders.
good,Great place to make a detailed work plans. learned lean production planning.keeps a great safety culture.The hardest thing to do is to keep all work in  line with all the different supervisors.
good,People are great company not so much. Just too many changes. Not what I thought it would be going in. Was supposed to be temp to hire. but  3 years later nothing
good,IT is being outsourced to IBM.   Difficult transition of services and support.  The ability to execute complex projects and situations is hampered by complex computer and software demands.
good,"High demand of work and precision."
good,I have worked steady for 6 years there has been some up and down but for the most parts it is a good company to work for made some really great friends and learned and still learning the trades
good,AECOM acquired my former company URS. The business models were different and the consolidation of the two companies resulted in lack of work. Overall they treated us fairly.
good,"Worked in receiving,  A lot of rules and  regulations to get parts received, most transactions done on one simple program.  Warehousing is fairly simple but expectations to do a lot of picks and stows is high."
good,Very unorganized.  Management plays favorites.  Communication is not forthcoming.  Can be very stressful.  Change of environment is positive if communicated effectively.
good,"I worked for TC&B before they were absorbed by AECOM. Not much to say. Was 17 years ago that I left. People were good, projects were good. Just need enough characters..."
good,"AECOM had a lot of potential and good ambition. They seemed to struggle internally with previous employees, lack of project control, and internal business line competition between acquired companies. In general, the people were great, management was mediocre, and the workplace culture was focused on Landscape Architecture."
good,"Good place to work "
good,"AECOM was a good company to work for.  Good benefits as well as flexible work schedule. I was part of a RIF due to lack of contracts that were renewed, they were fair with my severance."
good,"Productive working on company Moral, to build better working place. Learned a lot working with Cash Apps, Billing team and Controllers which helps keeps DSO down."
good,"Great job to work for, I had a good experience and would refer anyone to this company.  I especially like the benefits they offer."
good,All the Executive Management compensation packages do not provide incentive to look after the well being of the people of the company. The corporate culture is not well maintained given all the acquisitions of companies that make up AECOM.
good,Not a bad place to work if you are young and want to make a career with the company. Management issues are the hardest part of the job. it is you against them most of the time.
good,"Job dependent on contract, ex military in leadership positions regardless of qualifications.  Good environment, low stress due to type of contracts received."
good,"The pay was great, the job wasn't difficult. The day shift hours were nice to work. I really enjoyed operating the stand up fork lift."
good,"This division of AECOM was a fun place to work over a 5 year period. "
good,"good experience working with great team doing good job focus on safety first and showing quality and enjoying work doing something i like do,learn from other and teaching too"
good,"Good company and people,nice atmosphere, flexible on start and end times. There are many online training platforms, just need more practical application and direction for the long term. Benefits are decent, just raised rates."
good,"no confortable"
good,"typical day went by kind of fast due to busy work and trying to not be fired. come in, get situated, grab tools and go out to the flight line. launch jet, recover jet, inspect jet."
good,This company had some the best group of people to work with.   Provided training needed for position and help with upward mobility.   Great referral program.
good,"As per community of one village the road of the village which initially determined by the villagers is not the proper and not the necessary road to be rehabilited. Therefore we requested to re-survey the road Rehabilitation project in it,s proper location which is in priority and necessity in the village and we did the job."
good,"No Comments, All aviation contract houses R the same. Sorry can't think of anything else to say about the job worksite. No one ever tells the mechanics if the milit. contract is extended or ended until the last moment."
good,"A typical day was hurry up and wait.  The Project Team would want something now and when they got it they would sit on the item."
good,"Before the new contract negotiations, this was a very good company to work for.  After the negotiations, everything with south at light speed."
good,"The camp has better rooms, private bathrooms, and food was satisfactory. There is not much of a gym to exercise in however."
good,"Nice place to work."
good,A typical day at work is finding out what testing and maintenance is scheduled for the day. Then assigning personnel to those tasks to ensure success. I learn something new everyday. It may be the way a system control works or a new procedure that has been developed. The hardest part of my job is working with other companies that are part of the project. I enjoy working with others on new processes and procedures.
good,"I  enjoyed working at Aecom. It is a Large Company Many Opportunities, well established Oracle training and system. Lots of Team Building and travel."
good,"everyday was like a new day, new problems, new orders, constant learning - on the job training.  I developed my Microsoft skills further.  improved on my data entry.  Co workers made it a joy to come to work on a daily basis."
good,"I was only there for a few months working on a project, but my overall review of AECOM would be pretty average.  It is your normal cubicle farm.  Leadership is very very hands off.  I enjoyed my time there."
good,They are zealous about preserving the work environment and providing a safe place to work. AECOM is absorbing URS Federal Services sometime this year. URS is the company that hired me.
good,"its ok just alot of calls but overall every job is what u make it"
good,This would be an infraction of my employment conditions to be specific. I worked outside of the office on Client assignments which provided me with independence away from politics
good,"the job was ok the atmosphere was bad from top to bottom. poor management and a good o boy click that not going to change! "
good,"since I don't work as a chemical engineer I find it very boring to sit in an office in a site area. "
good,Aecom was a fairly good company to work for. I learned a lot in my time there but they do pay less than you should deserve. The people are great but the upper management is very segmented.
good,Great team to work with.  Got work done in timely manner and everyone I worked with were easy to get along with.  Great boss and was always encouraging me.  And he told me I'd make a great Document Control manager.
good,works well with others and willing to learn new things well knowledge in computers I worked on all the safety monitors and air equipment managed staff to get the workers go out on the jobs site to supply air for the workers
good,"I work for a company recently purchased by AECOM and we are going through the transition stage at the moment.  I predominantly audit for health, safety and environmental purposes."
good,"A typical day at the office includes report writing, client and internal communications, conference calls, status meeting, and mentoring activities."
good,"Job started at 530am on a Naval Air station, with a job that didn't have too much work to do but continuously were busy doing work that was not in the job description. Management could have done a better job managing their people"
good,"Company is extremely top heavy, opportunities for low to mid level advancement minimal, including training/certification/growth classes; AECOM is only concerned with their money, not clients or employees, the most selfish company I have worked for."
good,"We here at URS are to do maintenance for Caterpillar, Inc. and we have one Supervisor and more that call on other resources to get the job done. Why are we here?"
good,"Ok place to work."
good,The company is ok but not very active or energetic. People leave too fast due to poor management or lack of vision or they get laid off. It doesn't provide much job security. Overall the company culture is lost due to too many acquisitions. It's too corporate and too big for a design firm.
good,Overall great company to work for to gain problem solving and time management skills. Also allows you to display your creativity and innovative skills.
good,Your average company has its benefits. management is willing to help out where they can and find work for the workers if not since its a large company willing to send you to other shops for work.
good,"Division payroll coordinator bi-weekly payroll for the IE group, review and run bi-weekly reports, prepare bonus , maintain payroll information"
good,"Was part of large corporate buyout."
good,I enjoy working at AECOM but most of the time I feel like I'm just a grain of sand compared to the whole company. It is very hard to advance to management.
good,Busy to execute the job site with full requirement of Contractor by doing the Calculation to be used for the site job. The site job to be checked for every progressive activities. Reporting to the Project Manager and Client representative at  site. Checking the Shop Drawings with all types requirements at site. Done the As-Built Drawings with Calculation.
good,"Working hand in hand with the military supporting flight schedules. you come in, get you assignment, check out tools, preform task. traveling voluntarily every other month or so. excellent pay."
good,"This is a global corporation, they are involved with all engineering disciplines and have many employees in many countries. They are focused on growth. The individual gets lost."
good,A typical work day was very good experience. I got alone with all my employees. Management was very good. The hardest part of the job was the 12 hour shift but i did not mind working it. however the most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my co-workers.
good,"routine work day "
good,I do not care to write a review at this time.  I do not believe it would serve a purpose.  It was contract work that lasted 4 and a half years but did not translate into permanent employment.
good,"Learned a lot about government work and contract work. Great opportunity to work within the government without being a part of it. It was a call center position so as with any call center, it became very redundant."
good,It is an ok company to work for I just would like to make more money. I work with great people. They tought me alot about my job and I hope to take all the knowledge with me where ever I go.
good,"Begin the day with the morning maintenance meeting to discuss daily flights and top priorities. Perform priority jobs first and then work on additional duties. Learned a lot about working together with military personnel and other contractors. Work environment is friendly and moral was always high. Hardest part of the job was knowing that internal movement or promotions were few and far between, so many  employees feel stuck. The most enjoyable part of the job is the great environment."
good,The job is very nice to have and great people but they under bid projects in this division (O&G). I am currently on contract and have been working here for almost 1 year and they still have not hired me on yet.
good,A typical day at work is just that work. There are no events that would enhance the employees mindset.  There needs to be more communication between corporate and the satellite. Co-workers aren't happy with company either. The hardest part of the job is every 3 years I have to wait to be hired by a new contracting company.
good,"I  am a very responsible,hard working person. And when i give off my best I am most happy. The hardest part of my job was when the people around you dont take the job seriously."
good,Decent place to work. Great guys to work with. No movement to move up into supervisor roles etc. Guaranteed hours and flights into camp
good,"I had ups and downs at this company just like any job out there."
good,URS was a decent company. The pay was good. The crew i was with was very in-experienced
good,"URS is a typical major consultancy. Daily life is revenue driven with a fast pace of work and little time to draw breath between projects.It is very easy to get the work / home life balance wrong, with the continual demand to work away and work 12+ hour days."
good,"Since going public in 2007, has lacked vision and tried several operating models and structures. "
good,"Typical day at work involved repairing and sustaining military vehicles and equipment.  "
good,This was a temporary contract and it was very dis organized. Seemed like everyone was always sitting around waiting for work. It did pay well and have great benefits and I did meet some good people.They need to work on their safety procedures and have more supervisors in daily functions.
good,They will throw you in the deep end. I recommend it for new graduates.
good,I have already provided review for this company and do not have time to write more.
good,"A typical day is very fast-paced, and I frequently feel like I am behind (along with most other coworkers). Direct project managers tend to be great although they are under a lot of pressure too. Upper management-way too many of them. Coworkers are great in my office, but it is an office-to-office effort, not company-wide. Hardest part is the inability to predict or control how many hours I work because there is no overhead control of my hours. No one says ""hey, x employee is very busy and y employee is not, let's move this from x to y."" While overtime is common in consulting, I do not believe the pay or time off balance that hard work."
good,"Nice place to work, relaxed atmosphere, every body does their job. You manage your time and your work load."
good,"typical day at work, nice co-workers and enjoyable environment"
good,"lots of communications, different people - nice staff. Hard working but still enjoyable"
good,Taking care of office employees computers.  Including adding/removing software/hardware.
good,My job contained dealing with customers and production of the distribution center. I worked on converyors forklifts plc and laser/thermal printers. I repaired and replaced broken parts to make sure production stayed functional.
good,to advance is what I'm looking for and have not had that opportunity.
good,"- very busy days always "
good,I spent my time supporting Engineering's requisition requirements and using SAP\SPM to accomplish this task.
good,"Fast pace job. The days went by quick."
good,"Basic work environment, they like to move you up from within. Not much into extra out of work events etc. Pretty much an 8-5 job."
good,determine needs of customer and procure materials/goods to meet those needs in a timely manner.  Juggle multiple tasks for multiple customers.
good,"An ambitious and self-motivated GIS  data processor and Database Specialist with 23+ years of experience, looking to apply herself for the benefit of a company that would provide challenging and continuous opportunities for professional and personal development."
good,"I started working at Sierra Army Depot for a contracting company called URS. At first, it seemed like a good idea, and in a sense, it was considering it got my foot in the door towards working as a federal employee for SIAD. The management for URS was a nightmare and the lack of communication and mediocre supervisory that was assigned was given blindly.."
good,everything was great... but the lay people off every quarter
good,God job but like all other contract work on Fort Lewis short lived
good,URS is a Government Contractor PBCDF Project Pine Bluff Arkansas.
good,"From what I remember it was a decent place to work, nothing else to add"
good,"I started work at URS in January 2013. To start off with, I really enjoyed working there. After the honeymoon period was over, it became clear to me, it is a very fast moving company. You need to be a character who is confident, deal with pressure and think on your feet."
good,"Good place to work, great big projects. Great learning experiences."
good,OK place to work.  Management is fair and communicates.  8-5 job.
good,The work was pretty simple learned something new every day the upper people in charge stayed involved plenty of cool people to work with getting use to working hand and hand with military the set hours of work played a big part after being in the military.
good,"My time at URS Federal was supporting the Federal Aviation Administration,learning the work projects and trying to build a working relationship with the managers/clients and coworkers."
good,Good company to work for. A lot of hours. Worked on a lot of different equipment.
good,"Overall company was okay to work for in the beginning. In my department felt like we were treated as children with constant checking to see if we were actually working and the way in which we were communicated with at times. When compared to the same departments within the organization at other locations, there was a difference in treatment.  My co-workers were great and the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to actually do accounting versus just pushing invoices."
good,"I get along well with my co-workers.  They are generally nice and intelligent people who are willing to help if you have any questions."
good,worked with all departments within the facilities group. good people to work with.
good,"We normally worked 12 hours a day 7 days a week. Each day was very unpredictable based on the short or immediate task requirements because of the nature of the mission."
good,would work for them again.busy most days learned different ways to do the job.coworkers were not at their best at what they do they would stand around while you do the work .
good,"Not much room to grow, lack of management support to advance career. They like to hire from outside rather than promote from within"
good,AECOM is a lagre company with a broad spectrum of projects around the world.  
good,theres no type of management. that was the worst work enviorment i ever worked in....co workers did alot of gossiping....horrible communicating skills
good,Received training from peers. Work overload. Great co workers
good,Was a greatly diverse engineering company that followed many different industries.
good,"Normal daily/monthly routines: run financial reports, review reports for proper revenue recognition, generate monthly invoices. Review financial reports against invoices, submit invoices to managers for final review, finalize and submit to client for payment"
good,"The job is pretty simple, we work hand and hand with the U.S. Navy to accomplish mission readiness of it's pilots and aircrew."
good,Not really careing due to haven to work for government. Learned a lot and met a lot of good people. Fun to work on a army base and see a lot of cool things. The company has management issues....
good,Contrator work has no place for advancement. Management was okay to say that the least but they always contradicted what they said.
good,Working with aecom as a Civil Inspector on road mentainance project is a very challeging role and brings a lot of information you can explore.
good,"During this time working with this company I did work orders for customers. I would be told by the customer we need 25 chairs and 3 tables on the 3rd floor I would deliver the materials on a flat bed to them. Then setup up the tables and chairs in way the customer wanted them setup. I also cleaned several bathrooms 3 times a day. Later I would get all the trash on 7 floors in the freight lobbies and take the trash out to the loading dock. I carried around a radio all day just in case I needed help or, if any of my fellow employees needed help."
good,High pressure; management does not communicate well; co-workers are generally great to work with and have good family values. Raises are minimal (1-3%) and no bonus structure.
good,"A big company, not possible to review it as a whole.... different divisions, more of a conglomerate of different companies...."
good,Company will be doing layoffs soon in Afghanistan. The hardest part of my job is being away from family & friends. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to connect with servicemembers.
good,URS is a good place to work to gain expierence on different aircraft. I have learned two different helicopters and multiple modifications for both the CH-47 and the UH-60. Management I feel lacks employee retention skills as evidence by the high turn over rate and dissatisfaction by the mechanics on the floor. I have very good co-workers that I can depend on anytime. The hardest part is changing my schedule last minute to get the job done and on time. I have always made it work but thats not to say it was not difficult. I enjoy my job and the people I work with and there is nothing I would not do to make sure the job is done safe and correct the first time.
good,I would work there again. Co-workers made it a pleasent experience.
good,Have the opportunity to work with international employees in various countries.
good,"Employer treated the employee in a professional way. I have gain vast experience in all fiels as far as planning/scheduling job. Management is supportive in their employee. My co-workers are my team. My hardest part in a job coordinating each decipline and some does not know about their job and giving wrong info. My most enjoyable part of the job is to oversee a project that is on schedule and within budget but that does not come along, one has to sacrifice and i would say project to be completed within time."
good,they where up-tight and managed poorly. the employees always seemed infear of the jobs.
good,The only probably I had with this company is the knowledge level of the management in certain areas. I believe because of the expanded opportunities they have they at times fill the position with a body rather than experience but other than that no problem at all.
good,"Good overall company, repetitive tasks for a controlling micro manager."
good,Review and approval of project documentations and setup for revenue recognition and policy compliance.
good,1. Typical work day starts at 8:30 AM and ends at 5:30 PM. Overtime is often required due to work load.
good,"Good place to get your feet wet, but looking for something more in my field of study. Great co-workers and flexible scheduling with management."
good,People are great to work with. benifits are not good.
good,"Typical Day at work involves coordinating and updating various staff the progress of work analysis and product. Additional tasks include budget management, work progress, evaluation of scope of work and schedule. The challenging part of the job is the update current and accurate data when the analysis is outdated ( project duration last 5-7 years). The enjoyable part of the job is the diversity of projects I am involved in."
good,Work is steady with great leadership. I love the Ability to work at your own pace. I learned how to work with others in stresfull situations. The hardest part of work with this company is lack on supplies to perform every task.
good,"I started tearing down and b/up of j-85 engines , worked test cell got my run license to run up the j-85 engine troubleshooting the engine than i became a sr. engine mechanic than i was laid off and i took a job out of town and want to come home and work"
good,Work with military and civilian personnel in the maintenance department. Job can be challenging when you have multiple maintenance actions going on with limited personnel available.
good,"Fast pace enviroment, must be able to multi-task. Great co-workers and customers."
good,"It is hot, dusty and poor living conditions.even 10 hour work days for 90 days and then a two week R&R. There are too many managers and very few qualified trades personnel. You are doing projects in a high secure area with sub par tools and material. I have learned how much money our government wastes on projects abroad. The most enjoyable part of my job is travel.."
good,Advanced from desktop support to corporate IT position. Typical day involved supporting Financial management and remote Finance users. collaborating with other corporate IT departments
good,i worked there for 4 years. got enough exprience. No enough guidline from supervisor
good,typical day: always very busy
good,"A typical day is mostly sedentary. There is opportunity for field work a few times a year. I have learned skills in using several types of engineering software. Management is pretty hands off. Co-workers are friendly, for the most part. The most enjoyable part of the job is the variety of projects you get work on."
good,declassified intelligence information according to presidential executive order
good,Working with multi million dollar aircraft is a tedious job only ment for the strong willed people.
good,"Enjoy working here, but not many opportunities for linguists"
good,A lot of work to be done and great people to work with and learn from. Management does what they can to give work close to home but that seems to be an issue now.
good,"Not a great office environment, learned a lot because I was able to take the time to teach myself, management seems stressed, people are nice. Nice that you get parking."
good,"1. If you are a job orineted and want to develope and promote, not your place."
good,Love the environment in a workplace such as this. I would definitely recommend a company like to to my fellow friends and family.  Thanks for the opportunity
good,A good group of people to work with. My concerns were a long and variable commute. Not being in control of my schedule and not having consistent expectations from leadership. Rarely given any sort of training when given new tasks and then was held to inconsistent standards.
good,"Fast paced work day. Need keep up with customer demands. Good workers,sometimes hard to advance.constantly changing environment. At the time i was there, overtime was not authorized"
good,"most days are very busy usually characterized by local and international meetings."
good,AECOM had a lot of excellent people but were so focused on maintaining a certain quote of billable hours that people spent more time focusing on keeping their billable hours up rather than doing what was best for the company. Not much room for innovation.
good,everyday was pretty much the same sometimes we deliver extra loads we receive more items then what were purchased and we did invertory every month and if  our 1 count off we would have recount everything
good,"I have worked for Aecom at both CNRL and Kearl. The difference between the two sites is night and day. Aecom work at Kearl was excellent, safe, timely ,accurate pay. Aecom work at Albian was good, safety culture was just average, pay was messed up. Aecom management at Kearl made you feel like part of the team. Aecom management at Albian acted like a bunch of thugs, threatening to fire employees on numerous occasions. Bus ride from camp at Kearl was to long, Wapasu camp for Kearl is ok. Bus ride at Albian is short, however camp is excellent. Once new camp is built onsite at Kearl, I think I will skip Albian altogether. HR for Aecom is pathetic, constantly sending certificates over and over to different people for same sight. Company would be much better if they organized their database with files on employees to include certificates and qualifications, it just does not make sense to send them multiple times."
good,AECOM is a good place to learn how to be a professional. A good place to learn real work in real engineering company. People at AECOM have good sense of knowing who really works and who fudges.
good,"Enjoy the camaraderie amongst employees."
good,wake up early show up to job site 7am work until 730pm the latest. management was ok basically was my own boss but had to report to a supervisor. all environmental and marine life. hardest part was getting up early.
good,"It's  diverse company, w various types projects spanning the years I worked there. Friendly work interpersonal environment. I went from knowing WANG [word processing] system to WORD, to Microsoft Word/Office. Worked thru expansion times, as well as downsizing times. Will value the friends and great deal of knowledge I learned over the years. The Company benefits were actually quite reasonable."
good,Large corporation with corporate mentality good and bad. the local GCC head office is based in Abu Dhabi but the major decisions and direction come from USA which can cause slowing down of decision making process. The company is large and cannot take on a lot of  interesting design projects especially architecture which is not the main company driver which is Engineering.
good,"My time with AECOM was mixed. Sometimes it was great, working on big and important projects, and sometimes I was stuck doing a technician's task because my managers couldn't allocate me enough work. The pay is okay - a little on the lower end, but they compensate for it with a nice benefits package."
good,"The typical day begins with an hour commute followed by a 10-11 hour work day 5 days a week where you only get paid for 40. The stress load has induced the aging workforce to experience a unprecedented level of strokes, heart attacks, depression/anxiety attacks partially promoted by the sites unhealthy available food choices and lack of decompression time"
good,AECOM is a fast growing company that has acquired many companies quickly.  I think they are still in search of their identity and outside branding/marketing strategies.
good,"I was field personnel so I rarely was involved with the daily functions of the office. The field personnel that I worked with were knowledgeable, professional and calm."
good,The culture at AECOM is not exciting. The pay awarded to employees is not rewarding. Looking for a more construction orientated opportunity and I cannot find this at AECOM.
good,Usually have a list of pm's to do and I do them.  Walk everywhere I go which I feel is unproductive.  Outsource jobs that could be done in house and cost less money.
good,"Company is a contractor to FEMA, work is where recent or large natural disaster is/was like Hurricane Katrina, recent TX Hurricane Harvey. You can be put in work areas that may be risky, potentially hazardous, so you have to stay alert. Pay is good, but hours are long and so is time away from home."
good,Large company project driven.  Good support staff.  Good benefits and retirement plan.  Good company for new engineers to learn private sector business
good,"Managing people challenging, but enjoyable"
good,AECOM does not provide the best path for someone with my background and I want to grow with my career. There is a large focus on client needs and I wanted to get a bit more focus on my career growth.
good,"Working at AECOM was an experience.I have learned a lot about the contract world and know how to handle job function in Accounts Payable. I worked very hard at this company, however it paid off."
good,Good work place but less benefits for contact staffs. it's good experience 1st resident engineer job. I had full authority to carried three consulting job at same time and helped by senior staffs when necessary.
good,"a day with new challenges for new learning"
good,"I had previously worked at Radian Corporation which was purchased by URS.  Both of these jobs were about as good as it gets in terms of the highly skilled professionals I worked with and the corporate BS of all jobs.  When URS was gobbled up by AECOM, things changed.  Aecom was all about the bottom line and if you aren't meeting the financial goals of the accountants that run this company, they start laying people off.  Some of this was due to the changing environmental landscape after the most recent election and the shrinking need for coal fired power plants."
good,This job is proof that compensation is not the only important aspect of a career choice. Management simply doesn't care what you do or try to help you unless they have to cover their own agenda. It is cut-throat and toxic at times.
good,"At my location I worked early days, long hours, and long weeks.  Management was a little scruffy at times but they constantly encourage to move upwards in the company.  Highly recognized company with many achievements."
good,The rules were constantly changing.  It was next to impossible to get anything accomplished.  The good thing is that no one seemed to care.  People would get riled up about stuff but there didn't seem to be any accountability.
good,"I have heard differently stories about AECOM.  I did not have a great experience with the company in Afghanistan. It could be a good company, I am not sure."
good,By working with AECOM SIKA-West I learned many things but my manager in there was not a friendly person and always made unnecessary pressure on her staff.  Job culture was good but we are always scared of being attacked because of insecure location in the city.
good,"Its Global delivery center no onsite work opportunity. "
good,"The company has undergone significant changes since the acquisition occurred.  Prior to the acquisition, they had dedicated staff, based on longevity and understanding their job roles.  However, with the acquisition, many changes occurred to accommodate the new culture."
good,"not a bad environment, nice people, too much work to be done all year long, very low salary, good benefits, terrible management"
good,Unable really write a review do to came off medical leave and got laid off and am not eligiable do to being on long term disability.
good,"Groupe Aecom France a ses avantages et ses inconvénients pour ses salariés en France."
good,It was busy days at work but it was a lot of fun. For those willing to assert themselves and stand out this company has the depth and breadth to win and succeed with managing major marquis projects across the globe.
good,Good people but be aware for layoff. Company closed Piscataway office. Long term workers let go when company was purchased.
good,"Staff at AECOM are a joy to work with which is what kept me there for the long run.  AECOM was built on company acquisitions and therefore upper management has been very unstable which has had a trickle down effect on the staff.  Morale to say the least has not been good for at least 5 years now.  Compensation and benefits however are excellent, so if you can wait long enough for upper management to get their act together this is the company for you!"
good,"Manage staff in accordance with organization’s policies and applicable regulations. Responsibilities include planning, assigning, and directing work; appraising performance and guiding professional development; rewarding and disciplining employees; addressing employee relations issues and resolving problems. Approve actions on human resources matters."
good,"Standards learned"
good,"AECOM is a multi-service engineering company that has grown at a very fast pace of the past 10 years.  I worked in the environmental business line, which is based on Chelmsford, MA - formerly the headquarters of the environmental service firm, ENSR."
good,"Overall, the company is progressive and on the cutting edge.  They look to use revenue to assist the employee in doing their job better.  They may have one person to do the work of three, but they give you the technology, etc. to be able to do the job well."
good,work with some good people always tyring their best. always working safe and looking out for each other.
good,"In general, this is not a fun place to work.  The people are good and work hard."
good,"The job consists of aircraft maintenance, incorporated with training missions for US Navy pilots which can be a grueling task at some cases. However, with well trained co workers on site, the job is fairly easy and, at times, enjoyable. Advancement, however, is lacking."
good,"A job reserved for the hard-charging individual. The job is exiting and  my weekend consists of a mix of Plane Captain duties such as washing, daily inspections, aircraft fueling and aircraft movement from one place to another ( from the flightline to the hangar or from the flightline to the wash rack)  Management has its hands full trying to juggle the needs and desires of the site's employees. The work ethic of the site is mixed, by that I mean some people go above and beyond and some do just barely enough to stay employed.There are tasks that are not very pleasant or glamorous such as washing aircraft or cleaning the flightline. Some parts of the job can be mundane or repetitive. There are no real hard parts of this job however, It can be sort of annoying to watch the same people volunteer to do things while others constantly loaf around. I love traveling with the squadron we work with."
good,"Its a real good place to work , you learn a lot and also you get to meet all kind of people, which makes it fun"
good,There were pros's and cons. the pay was good as well as the people and flexibility but the actual work was somewhat demanding
good,"Have learned a lot thru the years. Worked with same management for over 10 years, however contractor has changed. Co-workers are very diversified and easy to work with. I enjoy the challenge that comes with the job, constantly changing duties allowing me to learn new things in a constant basis."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of toll operations such as: maintaining equipment, checking lanes, answering the needs of the toll attendants and being ready for accidents or any other problems that could occur during my shift. I learned to be confident in my job duties. Overall management above me was pleasant but at times inconsistent with directives. We worked closely with one another so we became like a family. The hardest part was being laid off. The most enjoyable part was having a job that I enjoyed."
good,"A typical day at work is very repetitive."
good,I think the only thing I can truthfully say about Aecom is that I wish that they would have  a better afterplan for employees that are going to be ending a project soon or already ended a project so that employees would always have a job waiting or getting ready to start a new project
good,"Profasonal & Productive company;"
good,inspected and categorized weapons for disposition.  Used forklift to move material
good,I was there on a short contract and they micromanaged the hell out of you and they watched your time as if each minute was golden. They didn't even pay that well.
good,Aecom is one of the best companies on this planet. I hear and read about account being won by Aecom all the time via email. I am satisfied with the company in general but I do think at time that their clientele ask or demand the impossible from whomever they are in partnership with because at times It always a constant dispute on how ethic and arrangements are handled.
good,"Suite à l'acquisition de Tecsult par AECOM, la compagnie n'a pas retenu le conseil de gestion comme ligne d'affaire à maintenir et à développer, ce qui se traduit par une diminution importante des mandats à réaliser."
good,"We are usually on the move, moving product to designated areas throughout the maintenance center. The job is not at all hard, and I love it. My co-worker and I work well together."
good,"they just wanted you to work so many hours. no time for family, loved that they had this contests and parties sometimes."
good,AECOM has been an exceptional place to work. A flexible work environment that is keen to employees well being.
good,I have worked for URS at a few different job sites. My satisfaction with the job varied with different management and coworkers. I looked forward to going into work at some job locations and not others.
good,"Typical day at work started with checking e-mails and voice messages from the clients, construction managers and co-workers following by the preparation of project assignments such as design and production of construction documents, supervision of the junior personnel and responses to construction inquiries (RFI's) from the contractors in the field."
good,This position was also preparing me for the next position. Provided assistant to the Graphic Illustrator and created presentations for the Navy Captain.
good,"great job, decent co workers ,too much office politics among management!"
good,"I enjoyed the work hours, the good benefits, and the networking opportunities I had. Overall, it was a different experience for me."
good,AECOM's safety culture is excellent and among the best I've seen. There are always tasks that are challenging with plenty of support from not only management but others within the department.
good,Average engineering company. Good job security and ability to work on large variety of projects. Ability to transfer within the company is a plus. Standard issues with any large company.
good,We will start everything from scratch it is very hard to get where we need it for the engine shop even when I love it was still stuff that has not came in
good,Good working environment. Office location is excellent. Benefits can be better. Training and advancement is okay. Managers are committed and communication is open.
good,"The work/life balance is good.  My boss is great but he's not good at communicating.   I hear about things from co-workers before I hear from him."
good,Enjoyed my time there. Work was exciting and team was easy to work with. A lot of management so hard to move up. Do a lot of interesting work for the government.
good,"-First job in engineering.  "
good,"I enjoyed where I worked at, because of some of the people I came in contact with they was very good to me. My co-workers was good to work with also. It was a great task to work for this company."
good,"Formal work environment with clear job roles"
good,Being hired without an interview has its drawbacks it usually means the people you work for and with haven't a clue about your qualifications. Once proven to those making decisions however it is full steam ahead.
good,I have started working in AECOM kolkata from January 2013. I have learnt many engineering skills from here & given my best to establish the Kolkata office in all India  & international respect. All my co-employees are supportive & I have also helped my all colleagues to do better in their work. For all the people supports AECOM Kolkata have become an example in India for its quality & engineering works.
good,"Best part of job: wonderful colleagues and manager. Interesting work, opportunity to stretch abilities. Hardest part: upper management disengaged, never understood department's value contributions."
good,My experience was a fair one. Not very much enthusiasm during my time with the company. It's a good place for someone with typical expectations of a corporate environment.
good,"Great pay and work life balance. Don't need to take breakfast or eat before work, since there is breakfast food and snacks. Culture is not diversified."
good,"The interview and hiring process was thorough and efficient.  I was qualified by a recruiter.  The recruiter set up a team call with the Program and Business Unit leaders.  Thereafter, I met my hiring manager for coffee.  It was very informal and comfortable.  Lastly, we met as a group with the client to evaluate whether we were a good fit."
good,"The Fort Bliss transportation office has many rude, disrespectful, lazy employees. Other than the staff, AECOM took care of their employees. Great company to work for."
good,There are multiple opportunities for an individual to work on different projects. The growth within the company can be slow. Some managers don't understand the process.
good,"Government contract position on an effort that was coming to a close. Good work but subject to government micro-management and frequent changes, as well as infighting on the project team. Enjoyed the work, didn't like the rapid end with very little notice - not the fault of the company."
good,"As a designer, there were no jobs for me to work on. The hours were nice as you can take every second Friday off. It was nice to not have any projects at first, but after a while i had to quit."
good,"Better than other companies of it's size"
good,"Project based job with support from management."
good,Friendly atmosphere and good team experience. Good work culture and enjoyed working with management and friendly co-workers. Enjoyed extra-curricular events and celebrations.
good,"Have only experienced about 8 months on board. Nothing really to expound upon. Numerous facets to this corporation in many locations, global. Over 100K employees."
good,I got a great team and mentor although the work itself is very competitive and very stressful. Most of the managers are approachable.
good,"Great place to work.  Met a lot of great people here.  As far as advancement, this really isn't a good place unless you know people who can get you there."
good,"Great collections company, with good benefits, but a quite stress full work environment, nice cafeteria, close to uptown Houston, parks and Malls"
good,"when the economy is doing well this is a great company to work for but as soon as the economy turned, the company forgot its in the business of selling people. They forgot their #1 asset is their employees. "
good,"AECOM is rated 5/10. There were good and bad days. There were great and not so great managers.  The job was not hard, and the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with everyone."
good,"Job satisfaction  with supportive management  and engineering."
good,"Muito aberta a ouvir funcionários e sua criatividade, a organização é fechada e muita hierarquia."
good,Good company however job security was always an issue. Working conditions were not always the best as a result of low budget. There was never budgeted money for continuous improvements.
good,Good place to work and pick up some new skills. But the price of Medical benefits and no 401k match for for this size company is ridicules
good,"As an entry level HR Generalist, I have learned much in my three years with the organization on a spectrum of HR related practices and policies. I am currently seeking new employment due to a large scale acquisition by AECOM that has introduced uncertainty into my career's future."
good,"Very first job. Spent 5 years with the company, growing and struggling. What you really miss after you left is how great the company used to be."
good,"This was the first company I worked for in the oil field and it was definitely an eye opener for me.  Long hours, away from home were all a huge change for me."
good,"The pay is decent considering the work"
good,"Each job in this company is trade specific. If you are an electrician, that is all you work on. If you are maintenance, that is all you work on. If you are a crane inspector, you inspect cranes. Management wants to lower the number of employees working by cross training everyone. That is a good idea if incentives were given to those not making as much as those hired for that trade. Typical day on the job consisted of logging into computer and printing you work for the day / week / month. Filling out tags or paperwork. Completing assigned work. Signing off completed work with dates and times in computer system."
good,"-A good place to work at but needs improvement."
good,"Monitor, approve and assign USD tickets to Remote Support Analyst based on priority and Services Level Agreement."
good,"intelligent group and talented coworkers"
good,Had favorites and didn't treat everyone the same... Had good heath plans and ever 6 months everyone got bouns
good,"It's generally a good company to work for. Salary is among the highest in the industry, but job security is also worrisome when projects ran out. It lacks proper management which directly caused loss of clients. Co-workers are generally nice but exceptions do exist. I enjoyed working here most of the time."
good,"AECOM requires that employees remain billable to clients as much as possible. If you aren't billable to a client, threats get made against your job. People are constantly getting let go because they had no billable work. Otherwise it is a great place to work. Great co-workers, management is patient and friendly, lots of ways to get involved in the community, nice office atmosphere."
good,I had a great learning and growth experience while working for URS
good,Was a good company to work for. I would work for them again. Would liked the opportunity to to work some place else inside the company besides the defense contract part.
good,"Although I was permanent staff, I was not an engineer, which is their core business, and this office wasn't one of their big offices.  The people were friendly enough, and there were regular company events, but they weren't on the same scale as some of those put on by other companies I've worked for."
good,"Good money for area. dead end job no progression with in company, typical contract work. perfect for retired military.  that is all"
good,"Long hours and lot's of travel"
good,"I enjoyed working at AECOM.  I had a great manager who would tell me about his days as a child.  I loved listening to his stories and he shared his knowlegde of engineering.  I enjoyed putting work down on paper then seeing the creationf of what it would be ater it was built.  Sometimes, we had to work overtime but I didn't mind that.  That's why there was unlimited coffee!  The hardest part of the job was when there was no work.  It makes a day extremely long."
good,The pay was mediocre to say at least but this is of course a big corporation which values production with micro management. Advancement was little at best and no annual pay raises. Employees worked hard to repair the vehicles that were brought into them but no room for improvements or initiative.
good,Work with a good group of individuals at my location. Company doing the best they can to grow into this line of work.
good,"Good workplace, but working environment is rigid and doesn't allow budget for training or development. Opportunity to work on different jobs and designs."
good,"I am currently employed, and in search for employers with more growth. I have learned new programs and work with great people. Multi-tasking and in person clients relationships are a part of my daily and typical day. I look to continue my knowledge and increase my responsibilites to become more successful."
good,It is a very friendly work environment where lateral communication is encouraged. There are many layers of reporting and things sometimes are not communicated through the layers.
good,Taking calls from customers to insure they are comfortable and safe.
good,The TORCH program at AECOM hires a number of linguists in critical languages and is a good place to work for people interested in global issues.
good,"The company is still growing, there is plenty of room for improvement. Many leave and move on to other roles and look for new job opportunities.  The benefits are okay."
good,There didn't seem anything unique about this workplace.  The boss and coworkers were all easy to get along with and made working at the office a good place to feel you wanted to go to every day.
good,AECOM was a blessing in disguise for me financially. The only thing that I didn’t agree with was there was no hope for a raise in the future. They made us sign a paper to agree that we would only make the said amount with no raise. They eventually lost the contract and I was transferred to VSE.
good,The environment was almost identical to the military base that it operated on. Great coworker cohesion. Aircraft aren't in the greatest shape so there is always maintenance to be done
good,"The wisdom of the Company Leadership decided to move all of the accounting jobs to Manila, Philippines, Now, after almost 12 years with the company, I am looking for a job."
good,"There is no typical day as each day has something else in store, so that is nice. At least there is no redundancy.  In my position things could be extremely busy or it could be rather slow. I enjoyed my 15 years here, I just wish there was more advancement allowed for me."
good,"- Great team with wide range of skills."
good,"Great place to start out, with industry average salaries and the largest variety of projects and equipment to work on that you'll find in this industry."
good,"I was there for a shut down only 3 weeks, company itself was good. Did not have any problems. The camp sucked stayed at many camps but did not like cnrl."
good,This is a good company to work for as long as there are no layoffs planned they pay well with good benefits. always something to do and keep you busy.
good,I was only their for a short period of time.  If they have any opening in the mail room department. I wouldn't mind working there. They treat their employees as a person.
good,"Checking the phones for call in's (people calling in sick), gather time sheets, running a Daily force report for accountability on the refinery, inputting the time sheets into CCM (Cost Construction Management) to ensure that time sheets match the gate log and sending files electronically to payroll, checking  the company mail, updating safety reports, Hiring process (on-boarding), completing I9's to ensure that all employees are legal to work for the company."
good,"Like a huge fast-food restaurant. Lots of people involved to serve huge projects in time. Very bad quality regarding design product. Impressive quality regarding marketing."
good,"If you enjoy traveling then AECOM is the place to be. Most of the work is on federal government contracts, but some work is on smaller local contracts."
good,"Only did a short contract, but was what you would expect. Nice office, good interesting projects, and the renumeration was slightly above what you would expect."
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo pero demasiada carga no acorde con la remuneración.
good,"They are very safe and that is their #1 priority, but management doesn't communicate like they should"
good,"Need more communication between business units and districts. A lot of juggling personnel around the offices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 "
good,"My position was receptionist.  I liked the interaction with the visitors and callers.  However, the office didn't receive very many visitors or have too many callers.  A lot of the time I was requesting work or asking to help those who had heavier work loads.  A lot of the time I sat idol trying to look busy.  I don't like passing the time in this manner and would rather have a steady busy day!"
good,"it was nice working with this company in Afghanistan, I had joined a team of proffisionals"
good,Support on a daily basis all the Cisco equipment within the Airports.
good,I always enjoy my job when there are no hidden agendas at the top management. because it is frustrating when the subordinates doing their level best on the ground whilst there are decisions and deviations that are taken at the top level without communicating with those physically involved on the ground - it creates confusion and one feels stupid.
good,The Staff At the RRAD site are ok. But you never know if your gonna have a job from one day to the next.
good,took 3 months to finally get expenses reimbursed. hopefully they have fixed that by now.
good,Exellent company with outstanding benefits. Wonderful company who seemed to genuinely care for their employees. Holiday parties were over the top and the opportunity to get promoted was very much available and expected.
good,"All departments are excellent to work for, it simply depends on the manager you're assigned too. They can either make your 'work life' miserable, or a pure joy to get up each morning and go to work."
good,"Started off as being a very wonderful place to work but over time I realised that there is no room to progress your career."
good,"The offices were clean and well maintained with free coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and soft drinks.  The computers were fast and well maintained with all the necessary software installed."
good,the job is sometimes stressful but all in all laid back and is a fun place to work. I daily manage 5 technicians with work load and skill set. I manage a warehouse tech and also do inventory and ordering of material
good,"They pay particularly low, I have never been paid so low. The in town 10-4 shift is hard for a parent, They made us strip the cable and put it in a pile so the scraps, all of the scraps, should be taken infer reimbursement, they even wanted the shield off the tech cable in a pile, it was bizarre."
good,We were able to work from home and maintain a flexible schedule. There was little communication between our managers and the rest of the team. There was no room for advancement in our sector.
good,The culture seems to be changing.  I feel like they're treating the professional staff like temporary workers.  I don't see a strong vision from the executives within the company.
good,"Open work space with conference rooms available for meetings."
good,"They will work with you for Family matters . The floor supervisors are all pretty good , but the area managers bend the truth to fit there needs . The pay isn't to bad either."
good,"not consistant, big co large projects great to work for overseas projects La projects, many managers, many bosses and great salary and benefits good to work for"
good,I liked it because I got to travel to different providences with in Afghanistan I never stayed in one place I was always moving and learning new things to learn.
good,"Most satisfying was doing the job that I learned to do when I first joined the Navy, No advancement, Beware of the instructor pilots who think they are God- once one of them blackballs you, you are finished;"
good,"- nice day at work"
good,I'm assigned to a site where work is high stress. Not much contact with company. Joined with URS and it seems caotic. local management reminds me of the show survivor.
good,"I found that AECOM was staffed by some amazing people who do amazing things. The problem lay in the overly dense Corporate structure where the left hand often did not know what the right was doing. Re-structuring was constant, and although this was necessary pertaining to acquisitions, it was far too often and created conflict and friction."
good,"Good working atmosphere and company policies are very clear ."
good,The companys i've work for I loved it typical day was safety first then morning meeting on what had to be done then our team would break off an get it done best part about team work was we never got backed up nothing about working any job is hard theres many was to make jobs easy nomatter what it is. Management was amazing they never bothered us because the seen us work as a team an get it done.Most enjoyable part of my jobs it was it felt like everyone was family no one ever let the next person down
good,we worked with COR ( council of representatives) of Iraq to enhanced the skills for representative members VIP staff
good,The reason I stayed at this organisation (as URS) was because they looked after you so much. Everyone was so friendly and it was a great place to work most days. Great managers and supporting HR.
good,"It was a fun place to work for 22 years. Very good engineering staff consisting of all disciplines. It was disappointing to see our corporate office to decide to close our office in April 2010. Much of my time in the 22 years of continued service was spent on field assignments at chemical plants. The hardest part of the job was the traveling most of my career, Most enjoyable about the job was to see a project from the very beginning to startup of the chemical plant."
good,Employees with this company/contractor are just a number.  They receive so much money per head from the government.  As long as you show up for work and they get their money that's all that matters.
good,"was always happy to go to work.learned how to operate haule trucks heavy equipment and pumping systems "
good,I worked for AECOM overseas for 11 months and it really sucked because the management people were horrible.
good,It was all right while it lasted but since I am looking for another job i am not that great right now. OK well that is all I have to be saying about it well at least there was a good group of people there that I have enjoyed working with.
good,Great pay but management is almost non existant in my section. 12 hour day with 2 breaks and 1 hour lunch. Free Defac food. Free housing. Hard to spend much money in Afghanistan so you will save plenty.
good,"As a HR Generalist there is always something to do.  From recruiting, job fairs to onboarding.  In processing new hires to terminations, counseling's to discipline's it seems like it never stops."
good,"Work days are up and down, this was a start up for the company at this location and neither side was ready for the ups and downs. More cushion for error may be needed"
good,The company is overall good. The job security is not high. They wont help you to relocate from a country to country if you needed to do so.
good,Administrative Assistant for more than 3 years with my current company. Good working team mates and an understanding manager who stands for staff rights in any circumstances.
good,One of the best company in the world .but poor management.company provide different type of salary for same job. I learned lot of knowledge about the safety
good,The company has been focusing on Employee development and satisfaction in recent months. benefits could be better. not very competitive. Management can also be improved
good,Sometimes I feel like their focus is not organized and there are a lot of cases of wasted man hours due to direction changes and re-work
good,"I enjoyed working at this company for five years. I was very busy and enjoyed my job, especially the Human Resources because i was able to meet new people and get to know them one-on-one.  I learned a lot about engineering.  I really liked my first to managers.  They were fair, trusted and respected me, and didn't have to micro-manage me,  i got along well with my co-workers.  i was the ""go to"" person if anyone needed help.  They knew they could rely on me to resolve their questions or needs.  I don't think there was anything I would consider particularly hard about the job. Occasionally frustrated when trying to get something done with a deadline and being constantly interrupted. Although I had set responsibilities, every day there seemed to be a new challenge. I liked that because I was never bored. the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people. The Human Resources side was my favorite."
good,"Attendance Punching, Review daily work programs, distribution of routine works in various discipline, Check Meeting Schedule, preparation and distribution of Minutes. Attend emergencies. Weekly  and monthly schedule monitoring, Resolving pending Issue , arrange coordination meeting to resolve various issues."
good,Goopd company with minor leadership flaws. To begin the day we start with safety topics and then pass out work packages. Perform needed repairs on military equipment for fully mission capable. Once all faults have been worked off it is turned over to a quality control inspector to insure work has been done to standard.
good,Life is predicable and void of surprises. The union positions are what you would expect and secure. The non-union positions could use some attention and support from corporate.
good,Very competent and qualified team of professional. AECOM is a great employer dedicated to capacity building and high-end services to their Client. Very fast paced and competitive environment.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my career with AECOM. Up until this past year, I have had so many amazing and memorable experiences with the projects I managed. My ONLY criticism is not with AECOM itself, just my immediate supervisor who thought work included 24/7 hours and family was just a hobby once in a while..."
good,"Worked as a contractor at a naval shipyard, and my direct supervisor worked 3 hours south of me. All communication between me and my supervisors was via telephone conversations or email."
good,Management here was horrible they could have cared a little more about their employees. Our higher up threatened to shoot people on one of our shifts and nothing was done about it other then he was escorted off base by navy but came back 2 days later nothing happened. Our supervisors are awesome guys that will help you if you need to know anything. great benefits and awesome pay. you also travel occasionally
good,Tremendous opportunities within the organization if you are able and willing to mine through the structure. Not enough attention to building on internal talent.
good,The management never follow CBA nor care about quality of maintaining the aircraft but on'y to please customer. Still think your still in the military and at the beg in call!
good,Do not expect to get paid fairly. If you are looking for an opportunity to pad your resume this is the place. I was able to wear several hats while working for them.  When I found something that was better for me I was prepared due to all I learned while employed by AECOM.  However when the contract ended they weaseled their way out of paying their employees severance. They were very slimy in their dealing from that aspect.  Other than that ...no complaints.
good,Company needs to provide more training for new employees.  The hardest part of my job while working at AECOM was the lack of training on company procedures and policy. I enjoyed the working with the staff and hiring managers.
good,"Offers a good pension scheme among other benefits.  Actively supports progression to chartership. Offers responsibility in roles quickly, however it has been extremely difficult to relocate to another office."
good,"The pay is higher than most places I have seen. The work environment is the safest I have seen, but there is more management than work force. Overall it is a good place to work although the benefits are expensive and not very accommodating."
good,AECOM is a large construction company working its way into the IT space.  The company does not have much experience bidding on government IT projects.  Therefore opportunities in the IT space can be limited within the company.  The benefits offered are the type you get working for a construction company and not the type you would receive working for an IT company.
good,The company is overall good.  Job security is not high. They wont help you to relocate to another country if you really needed so
good,"I have learned a lot from my seniors in AECOM."
good,While working at URS I had an amazing boss and the team I worked with was like a little family. Everyone was ready and willing to support eachother. Unfortunately after being with the company for over four years I made the decision to leave the role I was in for better compensation.
good,I focused primarily on the accounts payable area for this large organization. I enjoyed working with vendors in tracking down payments and working with them to set up their accounts. My co-workers were great in my division and the management often planned fun events for the employees.
good,"Kadra zarządzająca słaba, bez celów strategicznych, brak wsparcia ze strony partnera zagranicznego, nierealne cele w stosunku do placówki krajowej, brak działów umożliwiających pozyskanie klientów prywatnych,"
good,"Louis Berger Group was one of my the best company for me, because I learned a lot there, I had my first travel experience there and my first time staying away from family and living in camps, working in a diversity environment, and I had very good and supportive colleagues there, we had lots of fun and sharring"
good,"Great place to get a start on your career. Lots of people who are willing to help you learn new things. If you are willing to relocate, get used to long hours and don't mind working on holidays, this is the place for you."
good,"OK, progressive, leveraging technology to break geography barriers."
good,"Typical day at work its normal,like any other day.Ive learned a great much of things that involve alot of different parts of the military and its assets.Management needs to reconstruct its infilstructure and change its personel.As for co workers some are ok to work with and some just dont really care.They just come to the job just for a check.Their is nothing hard about the job.The name of the game come to work,because your dependability its the most important thing when you represent the military and the company you work for.Its an experience for me being from new york something different and new.Its been a pleasure working for them.Thank you for giving me the opportunity."
good,"begin work at 07:00 by checking tool box and then gather tools I need to start . usually there is a lot of crawling around the helicopter while everyone gets themselves set to work. we use a lot of consumnables so , your up and down throughout the day. 9:30 is first break and 10 minutes later your back at it.  lunch comes at 11:30 or in some cases 12:00. thirty minute lunch break and now your on the downhill.  always eat lite because heavy meals slow me down. I worked as an aircraft electrician ,so my day goes by fast. routing ,clamping, tying, and terminating aircraft wiring requires you to be focused on the job and not the time -of-day. our managers were a good group of people, and seemed interested in supporting the mission. really liked my co-workers because, we all came from different walks of life. as with any new relationship ther are growing pains. hardest part of the job is the public restroom, and the most enjoyable part is going home at the days end."
good,"You'll be pampered in your surroundings. Lovely view."
good,Long hours on the job. Paperwork was the worst part of the job. Management was fair. The fellow workers were great to work with. Claims safety is a priority when it was slack at best.
good,"An average day at th job would consist of coming in at 9:45 pm for a safety briefing.  I would associate with my coworkers and a few comments and concerns would be traded.  I would then procced to my station or truck, inspect it and continue my work for the night."
good,"good company , benefits aren't great but offer multiple benefit selections of your needs, pay is good, can be a stressful environment, a lot of paperwork and rules to follow, easy to forget there's so many."
good,"Benefits aren't that great and they seem to be getting worse each year. The companies management tries to portray it's vision on where they want to go, but it can be conflicting for smaller offices that work at a local level (not global).  I believe AECOM as a whole strives for excellence and has actually delivered several well done projects.  A couple things I think need improvement is how technical issues are handled with IT, minimize the amount paperwork necessary to deliver a project, and provide adequate training to staff.  All of these issues the upper level management is already aware of and has (atleast in appearance) tried to take steps towards resolving.  Overall, I think AECOM is a great starting point for a career and there are definitely opportunities to move around within the company to find what suits you best.  Finally, the most beneficial aspect of working for such a large company is the networking that occurs between each office and the significant number of technical leaders that are excellent resources when delivering larger scale projects."
good,"Firm attempting to become world's premiere integrated infrastructure delivery company. But it is still held back by overly cautious, risk-averse management culture, especially in the realm of international business outside of U.S."
good,Every day was a learning experience working with AECOM. I would have never left if I did not have to relocate to another state. I would recommend this job.
good,"I have enjoyed working at AECOM, the people are very nice and the company is very fair.  They compensated well and they have great benefits for salaried employees."
good,"Austin AECOM was my first job out of college.  It was a small company with a great cast.  I learned mostly civil and foundation design there which is a great way to start a career."
good,"In this site, I worked from the foundation stage to nearly OP of the superstructure. I have learned more in different type of foundation works and it is my first time in supervising the superstructure."
good,Just outsourced IT so most people in IT losing jobs. But working there was good. I was a contractor so can't say much but from my point it was a OK place.
good,Mi ha permesso di maturare molto sul piano tecnico e gestionale
good,"A typical day at work consists of conducting daily job walks/inspections.  Meeting with safety team at army facility, commander safety inspections, training for new hires, ISO Training, accident investigations, data entry, workers compensation documentation, medical care, working in various areas with employees, shift changes, supervision to specific crews as assigned.  Safety meetings"
good,"Works and supports  the Office of the Commissioner and Executive Level Support and Office of Legislative and Congressional Affairs offering high level customer support to the Commissioner, Deputy Commissioners and other users. Troubleshoot and resolves issues on site and through the phone.Exciting work environment with the opportunity to meet with high level executives.The challenging part of the job is to ensure that you are always proactive and ahead of issues."
good,"AECOM is a good place to work"
good,"Well, I learn too much here particularly i work on bridge and underpass here in the project and get too much knowledge and technical information which is best for the rest of my carrier, apart from this i pass and fulfilled many ethical and anti corruption test. it is the best part of Aecom."
good,"- Had great opportunities to learn new things. "
good,"Overrall, AECOM is a great place to work.  It is forever changing, which you would expect from most companies.  A typical day at work can be hectic at times but always productive.  I learned alot of the processes of the AP Department.  Management/Supervisors were hard to work with towards the end of my tenture with the company.  I would say the hardest part about the job was having a suggestion or idea, and bringing it to Management or Supervisors attention...and them not wanting to change the process that they already had set.  The most enjoyable part about the job was working with my direct team memebers."
good,I would never go back to this company the management keeps who the like not who is qualified
good,Faber Maunsell was taken over by AECOM a number of years ago and the company went downhill from then on wards.
good,"Start with Prep of military equipment for blast, then after blast prep for Zinc coating, then apply coat of epoxy primer, then apply coat of CARC paint< then a final cammo pattern."
good,I loved working there but they outsourced many jobs overseas.
good,"My typical day was spent on the programming PLC and HMI, specifically PLC-3 and Advisor and Wonder Ware."
good,"Overall a good company to work for. Strong safety culture, a lot of smart folks. Strong ethics."
good,"I was hired straight out of College and really owe a lot of my marketable skills to projects I was able to work on at URS. Being such a large company, there are a variety of different projects going on during the good times which means a professional can really gain versatile experience. My only complaint was a lack of real interest in my development from my manager and constant long hours to complete a deliverable.However, your individual managers may do a better job of managing projects and be more interested in developing your skills."
good,"My typical workday started at 10pm, when the other side of the world was just waking up. As such, I cultivated close partnerships with contacts in England, Russia, India and the Middle East."
good,"Was able to learn from other employees, management was a little confusing at times to me personally. Crossover training was hard to come by during my time with the company."
good,"I worked a cupple seasons and projects with aecom and i really enjoyed it. "
good,I felt that I was separated from the majority of whom I had to engage with daily. But this is mainly because of the layout of office spaces at the airport.
good,"Excellent work place and office, supervisors and managers are friendly and helpful. Top management knows what their doing."
good,"Very professional and productive place to work as a team, great salary, good overtime, great per diem and hotel accommodation when working in the field. Safety standards are taken seriously here."
good,"Worked in a satellite office which was great for me, I prefer behind the scenes kind of work.The down side to a satellite office is the lack of cross training."
good,"Very large corporate feel.  My group was very small though, enjoyed my time with my group.  Wasn't a big fan of the corporate feel, but really enjoyed everyone I worked with."
good,"Had a good time and a great learning experience. Over seas is not a job for everyone, but it's always best to get the experience. It was great time. Save up while there well worth it."
good,"The company is very safety focused. They want to ensure that their personnel are working safely and have the correct PPE for the task. Also, challenges them to think about their tasks, the associated hazards, and how would they mitigate those hazards prior to begin work."
good,I was part of a team that worked on an after action review of projects upon completion.  AAR was an opportunity to understand how the project team worked together and ways to improve processes.
good,"overall  a  good  company,"
good,"I started initially working for Raytheon, immediately bought out by Washington Group, subsequently acquired by URS and by Project end, folded into AECom.  The acquisitions were seamless and the team stayed united.  It was a specialty case and unusual job in being a nerve agent demilitarization Site.  Lots of room for mobility and job diversity, industry leading compensation, and exciting work."
good,When I started working at AECOM straight out of college my coworkers were welcoming and informative in learning business practices. The office culture was very inviting and I think I could see myself working here for a while. The hardest part of the job is keeping a good work/ personal life balance.
good,"I was an employee of URS for about 10 years until the merger with Aecom. I was at the company for a total of about 12 years. I enjoyed the job while I was there. Your coworkers after being at the same place for a long period of time become like another family. The office is set in a nice area, easy on and off from the highway, making for a nice commute. I learned a lot and had the opportunity to work with several departments."
good,"A lot of constant changes but a good group of people to work with.  Benefits have changed over the years, but they have added additional benefits that you can obtain thru open enrollment."
good,"I worked with Aecom in 2017.  Shut down  at keal oil. 12 hours a day plus accommodations. Good company to work for. For new employees, they explained almost everything about your work and stress more on safety. Apprentices work under supervision of experience journeymen. Hopefully they will call me for another project."
good,Every thing is good but sometimes some issue r happening with team members about for work analysis and Distributions. Environments is good for working...................
good,"with a local minimum wage of $7, pay at AECOM is extremely good. however, there is no increase for cost of living, or upward movement. jobs are in short supply and a promotion is depends on someone above you quitting first."
good,"Great experience in construction industry, and monthly meetings with the project managers help me understand more about this industry and company as well."
good,"Fast pace, but great people. Management was very respectful. You had to learn to make fast decision. Hardest part of the job was the commute.  The work culture was also very strong."
good,"I worked for this company for 20 years. The company treated me fair. I wore many hats throughout my years; adjusting to constant changes in management, and job responsibilities. Very hectic days, busy all the time."
good,"I enjoyed working at AECOM and progressed through the ranks there. At each step, I had somebody I could look toward, even though they weren't a professional mentor.Their proposal management process is very organized; more so than other companies."
good,Pays good.  Work experience depends on which customer site you work at.  we had a high turnover rate at our site. AECOM is contracted to other companies to provide maintenance support. So  most of the issues we're due to the work culture of the client faclity. If you are going to be working at one specific client site  research that site before applying. Over all AECOM not a bad place to work for. My main reason for leaving had more to with the client faclity.
good,"Daily engineering and construction work in office and the field."
good,Focus on employee after hire is minimum from corporate level. Hard to get information on work front planning. If applying for a position make sure you know contract durations for any engineered projects. Seems to have no plan to upgrade policies and procedures to interface or align with current projects or future development.
good,"Taking the extra step to help with projects."
good,"Fun work environment, people are great to be around. Low pay but good opportunity to develop your skills, always busy, ever changing. Lots of work coming up in 2019."
good,"Great place  to work for a young, single person with no kids or pets because you will always be at work, until you are no longer needed. Very good pay but that depends on what you do and where you work.  Massive company and it feels like one."
good,"The billing dept is going through outsourcing and work load imbalances. Company is not investing in the tools for the job, rather in trendy morale boosting and customer service enrichment tactics in an effort to bandaid low morale."
good,"A typical work day was 6:45 - 4:30 M-Th, and 6:45-3:30 F with every other Friday off. The work culture was business like. Everyone knew their responsibilities and the atmosphere was positive. Management was positive."
good,"I was hired as part of an expansion of the division. Was never provided any training on AECOM procedures and was reprimanded within the first 30-day for not following procedures. This culture continued through my employment which created undue stress. When this was presented to management, management refused to offer training and stated I would just have to learn as I go. Approached management about the necessary tools to perform my duties and were met constant red tape and excuse why modern estimating programs could not be put into place. Also was forced to do Construction Management of which I was told when hired I would not have to do as the estimator. This also created undue stress and when I approached management about it, I was met with rhetoric, and told to suck it up."
good,"Although, the salary/benefits are good, job security is low as it depends on projects. In addition, the advancement is slow and is a better place to solidify your position and then apply outside for a higher position."
good,"People there are professional and really productive. Learns a lot, very useful experiences. The office environment is very nice.........................."
good,it is a fun work environment when there is work to be done. Durring the spring and fall months there is plenty to do but work dries up in the winter and summer. Trying to get billable work in the off season is like pulling teeth.
good,"promotions are hard to come by, safety is big issue.... upper management is poor........ good ole boy system for promotions..... nobody will listen to lower personell issues"
good,"Processed all invoices for 4 different job sites on 2 different systems.  Each job had it's own job code, so their was 8 different systems to reconcile when processing invoices.  Helped the business department ensure the EOM went smoothly.  Was tasked with other projects by the project manager himself and other managers from different sites.  Working on a construction site is not for the weak, you have to be strong and willing to work at a very fast pace."
good,"A great environment to work in, but can be stressful at times. I would recommend this company to anyone looking in the construction field. There is plenty of room for growth."
good,"AECOM has strick policy, including what kind of clothing must be worn. If you are caught standing for a second, you will get called out and called into the office. Breaks were taken out of our work days with a 30 minute lunch."
good,I had the ability to learn and advance.  The online training was easy to attain and a wide range of topics.  I had the chance to travel and meet an array of new people.
good,"Good company to work with and more opportunities to work with multiple offices and in different areas  of civil engineering, and industrial engineering."
good,"Good employer, needs to develop their employees better.  Very little training and development available to mid-level managers.  Benefits are competitive."
good,Very little team interaction created a very stressful work environment.  Management was a plus but didn't handle the  negative work personality at the office
good,"As a former employee of AECOM, I have found overall job environment as acceptable, never had any issues with the management. I would like to have fewer working hours though. Job security is an issue and you never know what's coming"
good,"AECOM is a very aggressive and competitive company with an environment of constant growth and change. They have several divisions including construction, energy, infrastructure and federal services. Most work is acquired through successful bidding and new projects typically hire personnel by contract."
good,"challenging work, lots of travel, nice gym, good café, multiple common kitchen with nice amenities(two refrigerators, multiple coffee makers, filtered water)."
good,"Nothing bad to say."
good,Progressed from E&I Supervisor to E&I Engineering and Design Manager after 1 year.  Moved from Baton Rouge to New Orleans office. Company is largest engineering company in the world with a lot of opportunity for professional growth.
good,"Albeit a terrific company, the management was a little over baring and at times extremely strict. The staff was great and the work environment at my site was welcoming, allowing me to network and make new professional relationships."
good,Responded to work order requests and checked site equipment as I made building rounds.My co-workers on the crew that I worked were well skilled which made the work day enjoyable.
good,This was an enjoyable experience. I enjoyed getting out into people's homes and being a part of the whole Build it Back Process.I was a consultant and so I did not know how long I was to be employed
good,"Great job with great benefits doing accounting, human resources, and office management. Company was Boyle Engineering and then was bought out by AECOM Engineering. Became more of an outsourcing post and I was laid off due to downsizing in Fresno area."
good,pay well and try to keep you working.... They have a good benifits package and follow a good safety regime. I would really love to work for them again.
good,un environnement convivial et agréable bonne communication.
good,"Overall, Aecom is a good place to work. The benefits are competitive with other companies in the industry.  The company is in the construction business and there were a lack of a steady flow of new contracts."
good,"Recruitment,  Selection, Salary negotiation, Banking activity,  Agreement Renewal, Exit interview, Vendor Registration,  Vehicle arrangment, Hotel booking,  Guest house agreement, Petty cash, General Admin etc"
good,"Everyday is different and poses new and exciting challenges. "
good,"I had to do help the senior engineer with preparing monthly reports. I had to do data entry. I also helped with scheduling, drawing, quantity take off, etc."
good,AECOM is an amazing company.  The Engineering/Construction division has done amazing thing all over the country.  The government contracting side is new to AECOM and I don't think it is in their wheelhouse.
good,"Good company to work for. Safety is number one priority and focus. Nobile mission that oversees the successful receiving, handling and destruction of the US Army’s chemical stockpile at the Blue Grass Project, which is the last remaining US stockpile of aged chemical weapons."
good,My Favorite thing was company get together  as company picnics and gatherings at amusement parks.A good way to create a brotherhood among coworkers and their families.
good,"Having a work truck was very nice not having to send money on gas to get to the job,just have to put in the time picking up people."
good,"Risk assesment, design calcs, wraaps, learned about bridge engineering, excellent work environment, very friendly management leading by example, always seemed to be free buscuits and cake"
good,I have worked here for 3 years and it has been a great learning experience.  Upper management can be more focused on business metrics than employees.  Benefits have become worse from year to year.
good,"I had a great opportunity to manage several large projects to support the transit industry.  As project manager, I led the design and construction of MBTA's newest train station in over 30 years in collaboration with a private developer."
good,"Good workplace, good work environment. Competent colleagues. Strong ethic around safety. Strictly hierarchical. Like any other organization of that size pros and cons."
good,"Every company's mood is set by management.  At AECOM, the manager's style was an in your face, verbally abusive, shaming.  I tired to get him disciplined, but he was too connected to the top of AECOM.  I left due to him."
good,The experience depends on the group. There is a lot of stress about being billable but not enough oversight for entry level employees to make sure they have enough work.
good,"Here I have learned more about deal with management,report etc. "
good,Very Professional Culture; Good projects to work with; lots of new things to learn; Sometimes you need to spend extra hours to finish a job in timeline;
good,Typical work day consisted of immediately performing pre-operational inspections of personal protective equipment and support equipment and then performing all required tasks needed to support the days flight schedule. Fast paced and very engaging.
good,"Good team culture and exposure to interesting, high value and innovative projects."
good,"This position was a great project opportunity but had an end when the contract was lost.  If you are looking for a temporary position, this is a great opportunity.  For something more stable and permanent, avoid project work."
good,"Great colleagues, but your work never went appreciated.  Although you held the same position as others in the firm, you were not paid the same, even when you did more work than the others that had the same job title as you.  More like a boys club when it came to salary.  Things may have changed since I worked there, but most people moved on to bigger and better things.  Very micromanaged after the change over from UMA Engineering."
good,Worked with good people who knew how to do their jobs well and safely. Had a decent foreman who helped when needed. Got along with co-workers who were always willing to lend a hand. The workplace culture is very safety orientated and safety conscious. Field Level Hazard Assessments are done daily to identify and mitigate hazards.
good,Teamwork between offices was generally good but I got screwed by another office when they no longer wanted to 'share' work with mine (work that they didn't have the resources to do).
good,Job was great and provided a good income for myself and family..A lot of interesting aspects of duties and spent many weeks on shift work of varies times.
good,"大公司有不同工作崗位分配好,各自有專長,但亦可提出想到不同領域參與,學習,如我便到大陸學習了4個月,再帶回香港應用."
good,"I spent a year and a half consulting on this project for AECOM."
good,I enjoyed working there for 2 years. i have nothing more to say on this firm . indeed requires more text for me to finish this review.
good,There are pros and cons with working here. The pros are you get to learn the aircraft and get familiar with the dealings of a line turn facility. The cons are you have to do it all OUTSIDE in the Vegas heat and wind.
good,"A typical day, open computer, answer email, order parts and tools in Maximo or My Supply cabinet system.  Process invoices, issue boot vouchers, do expense reports, update data bases for employee information and vacation time.  Enter time in Deltek, on Friday, approve entries.  Maintain different data bases for the client.  Reconcile credit card and submit report.  Receive material in Maximo system.  Maintain files.  Take minutes at safety meetings.  Set up all meeting and arrange for catering when necessary.  Process necessary paperwork for new hires.  Assist management with any/all projects as needed.  Best part of my job is interaction with Techs, client, and vendors."
good,Work was great as with team leadership and subject matter experts! A great place to continue on with expert level personnel.
good,"I enjoyed my time in GITMO working for AECOM, the work and projects were good, demanding of time and effort but rewarding all the same, I only worked with them for 10 months and completed the main project that I was hired for before taking a new position with Parsons."
good,Proper punctuality was maintained at workplace and fair relations with TL and good encouragement  in all aspects related to the project.Good recognition for fair work in the project and pay will be on time without delay with extra benefits.
good,good place to work  boss had problems with my ethnic background      good work  company can work on some things to make better their bosses and company
good,"Would be a great place to work if there were any hope for pay increases.  The job itself is very satisfying working along side with various  government officials,  There is no room for advancement, but much training is provided to ensure that everyone is the best that  they can be at their own jobs."
good,"Was a good company to work for, however I worked for Carson Energy as they were aquired by AECOM, the infant stages of the merger/takeover was very painful, I was hired to help improve their processes, my lack of experience, combined with low oil prices, i was unfortunately laid off."

good,A typical day at my current location consists of in processing and out processing Service Members of all military branches.
good,I was hard worker in my team which includes Service Desk\Desktop team. The work environment was fun and friendly through years I worked there. The IT Department was very small when I started working in Flint\AECOM and then grew to big team and I grew with the team. I have gained lots of hands-on and technical experience through 10 years working in AECOM. I always was motivated to go to work every single day and to meet the challenges.

I have been on many different types of projects that allowed me to gain new insight on the different type of contamination's that companies are responsible for cleaning up and how contractors are not just given the work of cleaning up a site but is won and what their roles are once the project is awarded."
good,"Performed aircraft maintenance for the military, on a contract basis. There was always something to do and the work environment was enjoyable due to great co-workers."
good,"There is a lot of new equipment that I have not worked with before, so the learning is enjoyable and interesting.    Since it is a government project there is extensive paperwork that can really slow the work process and does not allow for technicians to make on the spot repairs a lot of the times.  I have worked for some really good managers while working here and also worked for some that are completely disorganized that makes completing tasks difficult.  I work on a rotating swing shift that is hard on the body but does allow for a week break in between cycles.  For me, my co-workers are the most enjoyable part of the job."

good,"Great place while things were busy. Things are in transition now, which is why I am firing up my own job search. Great place for newcomers."
good,"I worked for one of my bosses for 17 years.  We were a well-oiled machine - great team!  I worked for another boss for 4 years.  We were a good team, working to become a great team.  I like working here.  I like what I do.  There are some great people here. My reason for job-seeking is job security is uncertain.  My favorite thing is getting employees excited about playing pingpong during lunch!"

good,"Aecom does a great job seeking out young developing talent that can be nurtured into experienced professionals and helps it's people advance to higher positions.

good,I have enjoyed my time with AECOM. Big company but you do not feel like just another employee.
good,Professional work environment. URS is a really good company to work for.
good,"Originally, the management structure and leadership of the office and business unit were good and set up for a growth in the business.  However, as new management positions were added the personnel brought in as managers were younger and were not seasoned managers.  Flexible work schedules allowed key management personnel to work from outside the office and were less available to be involved in the day to day operations of the business.  In the end, business volume declined and layoffs followed."
good,"Great people, Cool to work with foreigners. Looks of opportunity for contract work"
good,"Working for this company was a pleasure and the day was always full of multi tasking which made the day fly by, coworkers were great and management was always on top of things.The hardest part of the job was trying to make sure all job functions were complete by day end.Sometimes a shipment of parts would come late in the day and not much time left for getting them all put away.I enjoyed the responsibility of my job because I was the only person to it. There was only the one shift and I was it."
good,"Every day is a diverse workload. I love working with my co-workers as a team player. I have learned multiple aspects of the accounting, procurement and industrial requirements involved in a multi-million dollar company. The hardest part of my job is the lack of communication and training. I enjoy being the one that everyone depends on for guidance."
good,"One of the best work experiences, I'm grateful for the opportunity."
good,this was a contracting job for the military and URS personnel did not come around at all so there was not any real interaction with corporate people.
good,"Preping Military equiptment for Paint."
good,"A typical day at work included general maintenance."
good,"The day would typically start by reviewing requests for processing  engineering changes and records submissions for scheduling activities and tasks. Completing current task assignment would then proceed. During the day assisting staff by locating information, records, process applications and in-process documents was also integrated into the tasks. Other assignments that would be included were research projects, assessment of processes and services, and training staff on configuration and records processes."
good,I like my job. I just cannot work full time at this point in my life. I need to be at home more than I am right now.

good,"A good place to work for recent graduates"
good,This is a great company to work for. I really enjoyed work with the recruiting group and getting know people across the country. We worked well as a team.

good,"très grosse compagnie,"
good,"Very normal from Monday to Friday with meetings, co-ordination on services, resourses on projects, projects deadline with co-workers ."
good,"A typical day at work is to check the QMIS system for the statistical summary of daily logs, the pending works and inspections of contractor's work. I learned how the contractor work, what is their performance viz a viz with the project specifications. QMIS system is very valuable tool to rate the contractor on how they perform their jobs. Management can easily determine if the contractor is capable of doing the job and if it follows as per client standards. My co-workers are cooperative with each other as it is a team effort to deliver what the client need. The hardest part of the job is you have to issue Non-compliance reports most often when the work is not complying with specifications. As their is delay in the work execution, and these NCR's remains in the system until the contractor complies. The most enjoyable part of the job is you being in the quality assurance department is very highly respected. You are the implementor of the project and what you will say/order, contractor has to follow."
good,A lot of waste and lost effort was due to bidding on a new line of work. There were few people who knew the chemicals that were the central part of the activity.
good,AECOM is overall a good company with various opportunities for professionals.
good,"As site administrator I handled payroll, employee benefits, and various other aspects of the operation. I was always learning and finding better ways to do things."
good,"es una empresa que contrataba obras muy interestante donde la instalacion electrica era para grande superficies (teatros, residencias, colegios, hospitales, etc)"
good,URS is a large company so I can only speak for the southern Virginia operations in saying I thoroughly enjoyed working here. It is a good team where everyone is always willing to pitch in and help each other get the job done right.
good,"A company of this size provides the opportunity to work on many large, challenging projects. URS provides complex solutions to very complex problems."
good,"Had a great time until the company decided to relocate the accounts payable department to Austin, Texas."
good,"AECOM is a dynamic company with several different business lines such as Architecture / Engineering, Transportation, Water / Waste Water Management, Program Management and Urban Planning. I learned a great deal about all aspects of our built environment inclusive of ways we can design for sustainability of the planet. My co-workers were professionals who were constantly seeking to improve our services and who enjoyed project challenges and the commradery in the office. As the Project Manager, I enjoyed the leadership of these professionals and the client contact on my projects. It is facinating to learn the individual culture of each client and to detrmine what the key success factors were for the stakeholders. The most challenging part of the job of a Project Manager is to wear so many hats. We are responsible for the financial performance of the project, leadership and mentoring of the team, client relations, outside specialty consultants, contracts and working with the contractor during design and construction phases. Typically a Project Manager is simutaneously working on several projects, each with it's own team and particular project requirements. The most enjoyable aspect of a career in Architecture is to witness the completed facility and know that the client is satisfied with your services and their new building. It was unfortunate that AECOM decided to eliminate most of the Architectural practice here in Norfolk and had to lay off so many good professionals, myself included."
good,"Working in this company is to much pleasure for me because not only as consulting, its more bigger and wider company,"

good,Enjoyed working here very much.
good,"working for military overseas, I learned Dedication to the job regardless of the nature of the job how simple or how hard, every task is like a part in a big engine that runs the overall operation every single person is part of and important to that engine."
good,"My work experience has also greatly enhanced my professional development. As an illustration, during my six-month industrial attachment at AECOM Singapore in 2011, I gained valuable experience in sustainable building concepts. I was responsible for designing and optimizing a building air conditioning system to ensure energy efficient and low cost operation. I also became proficient in delivering client presentations as well as managing my time effectively given budget and schedule constraints. My main task was to design and optimize the air-conditioning system. I mastered the Carrier’s E-20 software for calculating the cooling load. For optimizing cooling load I had to vary the external façade, shading at the windows, window glass standard and other factors with the allocated budget."
good,This company has very good positions but I have found it difficult to secure additional work. It seems as though you would have to have someone in the company to recommend you for employment
good,"URS as a company and their policies wasw great, they realy do know how to take of their people that are mortivated to work. There were a few of the local staff members that had issues, but every company has that."
good,Challenging and rewarding place to work. There were lots of opportunities to learn and grow.
good,"good company to work for just need some changes. Management could improve, co workers are good, most enjoyable part of job is pay check, hardest part is pleasing the client"
good,Working has it's perks but there are somethings that could improve
good,"URS is very well repected, very well known in the engineering, construction industries. A very professional company that provided it's clients a superior project and a competive price."
good,"Интересная работа, есть карьерный рост. Дружелюбный коллектив"
good,"Learned how to become a competent engineer, put me through my qualifications was a nice place to work. The management team however doesn't appreciate the work put in and is reflected in performance reviews"
good,"Working at AECOM made me excel in so many ways, and i've learned a lot of software like revit, microstation and now i am learning civil 3d. I also got exposure to work not only in dry utilities but most of the time, i assist in doing some other services like wet networks, road and bridges and building project."
good,"Working at AECOM is very challenging but enjoyable."
good,"This company is very fair when you are sick, or problems arise to help you work through it to be successful. Competitive wages, insurance is a little expensive. "
good,"Great job, good company. Management is good, easy to get in contact with if necessary. Job pace is easy; can be hectic at times but reasonably so. Overall good work environment."
good,"I love the company- just had a bit of a hard time with everyone wanting to be “the boss” within the group I was in. I did my best to just do my job and stay out of the dissentient in the ranks but unfortunately got pulled in at one point. Managed to make it work though. "
good,"I had a regular 8-5 job with an hour unpaid break. The work can be tedious at times because there is a lot of data entry in Oracle, Excel, Documentum, and Access databases. You have to respond to a lot fo emails and phone calls every day but honestly the work is not hard. "
good,"AECOM helped me to grow and learn while also paying fairly so that I could get my degree. Management in my area isn't exactly stellar, but it's no better or worse than anywhere else I've worked."
good,The people and culture makes it a balance place to work. Management style is a bit different as you need to stay on top of things to be notice and advance to a position you would like.
good,"nothing out of the ordinary, nothing more to write about aecom so i am writing this to make my character count get up to one hundred fifty so if i have to write this again i will be forced to"
good,AECOM is a great place to work at with many great opportunities for its employees. The management allow each employees to contribute to projects and allows everyone to develop into a better worker.
good,"The Good:"
good,"Working for a huge company like AECOM comes with many challenges, constant change is one of them. It doesn't seem like anyone cares to teach new company initiatives, when something changes it takes forever for the average employee to hear about it and actually benefit from it."
good,"My responsibities included the perparation of drafts and invoices, contract overviews and journal entries.  Monthly responsibilities included project bulling reconciliations."
good,"My review may not be typical of all AECOM divisions or offices as it is a huge company so read my review with that in mind.  AECOM is a good company overall and is a good company for new workers, females and minorities.   Females seem to be represented well and treated fairly from what I have seen.  There are not that many other minorities but I do not think it is because of anything below board from the company.  Our office just does not seem to get very many minorities to apply.  The pay is good and the benefits seem to be on par with what similar companies provide.  There is a good balance of work and home life with AECOM.  There is opportunity for rapid advancement especially for someone interested in project management.  The working conditions are pretty good but IT support and computer equipment has not been all that good.  The worst thing I see is that AECOM does not permit enough paid opportunities to train workers on learning new skills unless they are lucky enough to have a mentor willing to train them on the job.  There are numerous on-line technical courses that one can take at no cost on your own time but very few classroom paid technical training sessions available."
good,"It really depends on where and what you work on. Some offices are have better workplace culture than others. Projects can be very interesting and have great learning benefits. However, the nature of consultancy is that there are busy and slow period. Slow periods are incredibly stressful when you are light on work."
good,"A typical day at work consists of meeting with Requirement Area Managers and Subject Matter Experts to assist them with analyzing their procedures to determine needs and task analysis.  I have learned that most none training oriented personnel have difficulty understanding the importance of training to improve their employee's skill and knowledge of their job requirements. Management at the site where I work do not understand the importance of the use of the systematic approach/alternative system approach to training and must be reminded of this on a regular basis. Workplace culture is defined by their attitude toward actually getting project completed and their roles within that goal. The personnel are very safety and quality oriented on everything that they do.  The most difficult part of my job is to achieve an understanding by the Requirement Area Managers and Subject Matter Experts of the importance of training and how training will improve their employee in the performance of those jobs.  Understanding the roles that each type of training style, be it classroom, On-the-Job, computer based (CBT), performance demonstrations, use of dynamic learning, or read/discuss activities, and how each type influences the learning principles that are required to achieve qualifications to perform task requirements relative to job performance. The most enjoyable part of my job is to observe individuals performing activities that were trained by my staff and observing that the training provided the quality expectations that I want to see."
good,AECOM is a company that pays well. They are also have an inclusive culture.  Their office is fast paced and very busy  that makes your day  pass quickly.
good,"In this company in NY I was directly involved and proactive with the client, the architect, consultants and subs. I was able to apply all my design/build skills. This for me is ideal"
good,"Handle multiple projects at all stages of design and construction, including periodic meetings with end users and the client. The design and construction administration teams are headed by project managers and discipline leads to adhere to the project deadlines and budgets. We developed a good easy flowing work culture to disseminate responsibilities and information. However, the firm has too many layers of management and not enough resources allocated to marketing and developing business."
good,The three year contract ended and was not renewed. Contracted as EHS Manager oversee all environmental health and safety work for fast paced cosmetic manufacture
good,"I would definitely work for them again, they kept me working steady for 3 years, and if you do your job they will treat you well. Great safety culture"
good,"When I started at HSMM the people I worked with were good people."
good,"Excellent client service."
good,"These types of work are great for a holdover job, excellent if you're retired military but the lack of progression opportunities and they took multiple years to move the pay up from the federally required amount."
good,"Productive and fun workplace with table tennis, sosial. I want to improve my carrier and work and the same time to travel around country after work or when I will have free time. Respectfull to management and around people. Love children, family and protecting environment."
good,"Good company, but billability was everything. If you were OH, you were in trouble. Also seemed to care more about selling the FTE than quality of work. It may be better as AECOM"
good,"job work good, salary good, no job security, management good, good job culture , overall aecom is a good company in middle east, seniors are technically good"
good,great if you liking working with your hands and using your mind. Availability to advance and decent pay. would recommend to experienced person. Good job.

good,"work on railway sites for the client network rail."
good,Lots of specialists and consultants working together. Opportunities for training courses were available allowing me to develop more skills. Workplace was friendly and lots of social events.
good,The days were a bit slow and there wasn't always enough to fill 8 hours.  The people were awesome and everyone felt like a big family.  The work culture was very relaxed but when there was work to be done it was everyone's focus.
good,"it's a big company, good place to work, nice co-workers, nice and new cubical. but the benefit is not so good. the health insurance is getting more expensive."
good,"Loved my job. I had a great supervisor and wonderful people to work with. I made close friends that will be in my life forever."
good,"work to your ability without too much oversight. "
good,"Great company, great pay, and benefits. Great co-workers, the work schedule is great and convenient for my work schedule."
good,To be part of number one company in the world is a great privilege. I enjoyed working with my colleagues and superior in the site and I learned a lot during my short stay with this company.
good,"best organization, good company for employ and given more benefit to Employ. and who is working with this company all are helpful."
good,"All the folks who run the maintenance desk are the same people who ran it in the Navy. So, in most cases, you've got the same types of problems."
good,"My working hour 8am-6pm Monday-Friday. Alternate with others team member to working on Saturday 2x a month. I have learned how to do outgoing/incoming letters, shop drawing upload on EDMS system and etc. I don't have any problem with hardest part on my job, because Im willing to do something new. but sometimes I love to ask anything about something Im not sure just need to confirmation. Enjoyable part on my job is I have amazing team member."
good,"The environment is pleasant, friendly and professional. I learned a vast amount of skill sets which helped me towards my management career. My co-workers were very efficient and diligent in working as a team. The most difficult part of the job was the internal politics, lack of planning, limited knowledge in managment from a production standpoint. Unfortunatly, there wasn't clear/consice descision making inwhich affected the direction of projects. There was 2 sets of 'laws' and alot of internal turmoil between groups. The most enjoyable part of the job was being sucessful reaching deadlines enlight of the time constraints/challenges."
good,"A typical day at work included document control to the public on behalf of FEMA. Must be prepared for much and sudden changes with proposals in Marketing. "
good,Manager of site supervision staff and backup support of supervision team Reporting on daily progress

good,A typical day at work starts by checking for empty bins that hardware would be in. If they are empty I would write the needed information to restock it. I have learned what type of hardware is used in military vehicles. The management seems to be fine. I enjoy working with my co-workers at Aecom. The hardest part of my job is keeping transportation from place to place to do my job effectively. I find that the most enjoyalbe part of my job is not finding any empty bins.
good,I enjoyed working at AECOM/URS as Plane Captain on H-60 Sikorsky helicopter. I learned a lot from different persons skill regarding H-60 helicopter.
good,"a typical day at work would include a quick review of the remaining day work activity and organizing the work productivity , I have learned how to manage my time properly to achieve the most of my duties and to leave satisfied with the results of my accomplishments , unfortunately our management had some discrimination issues with the employees and candidates ."
good,A great environment to start your training. Good work culture and ethics. Very professional team that encourages growth at all times.
good,"Overall work experience in AECOM is good. Here we get the liberty to think, design, research and play."
good,"Aecom was going through some growing pains transitioning from FLINT, to URS and then AECOM. Oil prices dropped and they had to re org. has been a difficult time for many."
good,"Fun place to work however working in a construction environment has it's challenges. Crowded work spaces and lots of distractions. As a result of current oil and gas market, job security was an issue for me."
good,"Lots of work time with little time off "
good,this is very tough time for me for leaving such type of company where i was learn most useful personal and professional things. But this time its good to move on in professional life.
good,"I started with Apptis, who was bought by URS and later acquired by AECOM. As the company has grown, the pleasure of working here has diminished. Apptis was a small technology company that had some large contracts with the federal government. That made them desirable for investment firms looking to expand their portfolio. As the company grew, benefits became less competitive and the focus on employees diminished."
good,"as with most company's you have levels of worker participation."
good,"The job was only vacation work. I worked with head engineer at the branch. I am always keen to learn, and the people that I worked with were always eager to teach me. I enjoy working with people and that was exactly what the job included. I had a lot of interaction with Engineers and contractors from different companies. The co-workers treated me in a professional way. As a student that was very much appreciated."

good,doing a lot of things at one time but an amazing experience to work in the engineering field.
good,A day of work is never dull. You stay busy with operations that are helping the bottom line. In this company you learn quick to stay focused on your job and be billable at all times. One learns to juggle billable hours and administrative duties. Management is caring and personable but has their own security in mind. Co-workers will never be forgotten and quickly become friends. The hardest part is to be in an administrative position and be billable. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with and the environment you are exposed to.
good,"Excellent working environment and team. "
good,Fast pace and quick judgements skills are needed to be succesful at URS Line Division. Co-workers are outstanding and have plenty of experience which makes my job as a Supervisor easy. The hardest part of the job is making quick and reliable judgements referring to aircraft readiness and mission ready assignments to be completed on a timely manner. Enjoyable part of the job is working with military personnel and the professionalism that comes along with it.
good,Monitoring alarms systems and answering calls for maintenance repairs in the building or surrounding areas. This was an overnight // day position it is a swing shift .
good,AECOM offering a good atmosphere to their employees to build a good career profile/experience.
good,"Pros - Great opportunities to work in different offices internationally"
good,"Taught me to become more independent and responsible in handling projects. Improved my engineering and drafting skills. colleagues are helpful in anyway they can. Submission would always be the hardest days wherein the drafter is responsible not only on drawing preparations but also document control, and transmittal."
good,"Started as a subject matter expert.  Eventually moved on to systems engineering work that was outside y comfort zone.  Left company for an opportunity to work in my field of expertise, fire support."
good,A typical day at work included revising drawing specifications. I learned that documentation in crucial in project management. Management was keen on improving technology. My co-workers were very knowledgeable.
good,This company provides you an opportunity to work with the best people in the industry. With footprints all over the world you have challenging projects to work on with great learning experience.
good,"good money for the work, contracted thru DOD great overtime if available"
good,"This is a very fast-paced environment, that can be very demanding, but the opportunity to work on impressive projects and get good experience abounds."
good,While the URS office in Dallas is small the company is very large and offers alot of benifits
good,work day tend to be very full on
good,"As a team lead, the most enjoyable part of the job is when the crewcheif or the pilot gets the aircraft turned back in to them after the Phase is completed. All post phase checks are complete. They are happy with the way you facilitaed maintenance on their aircraft. They also are pleased with the amount of time you spent on the aircraft."
good,Top ranked transportation design firm based on revenue going through a down sizing to become more effiecient. Currently not as competitive in an extremely competitive market due to shareholder expectations. Targeting larger opportunities that may result in reductions of geographic presence focusing on large viable metroplex areas.
good,I love the way this company operates. I have worked hard to create an organizational culture that includes all regardless of your background. I am really  impressed
good,"All the requirements and deadlines are clear. Outstanding communication platforms. Remote working option is the biggest plus of the company. Overall, great place to work."
good,"A good company, great people, very nice work environment.  Good place to work.  This company does a lot of great work all over the world.  Impressive."
good,The maintenance group at AECOM was driven and while understaffed was still able to meet the needs of the Air Force Squadron. Mid level leadership was great.
good,"Solid company to work for."
good,"Will ask you to learn, but when time to fill a position, expect BS for excuses for not getting it. They rather pull someone of the street new then advance one of their own, if it means a %10 pay increase."
good,Company promotes equally in training across all shifts. My supervisor wanted more out of us to become certified on a system. That Makes things difficult to take when trying to get certified to increase pay compared to other shifts
good,"lots of gossip spread by some employees, certain supervisor's play employees against each other at certain sites, other wise pretty good company. most of people were good to work with and pretty knowledgably, learned a lot."
good,Very fast pace company that didn’t care how long much you worked and always got the job done. Paid very well but not much room for moving forward in the company
good,"Struggled to have consistent work for younger employees. Good people but way too much management clogging up the flow of work."
good,"I have been at AECOM for approximately ten years. AECOM's core service relates to infrastructure including transportation, water, assessment, and environment.  AECOM seems to prefer larger projects requiring multiple staff needs and extended periods of combined site and office work.  I have been responsible for getting my own work through both tendering and existing client projects from both local and national offices across Canada.  Travel is part of the work.  AECOM has an extremely comprehensive health and safety program requiring a lot of paperwork which I am not always comfortable completing given my number of years on site versus in the office."
good,"it was a good company to work for, sometimes has issues with payroll but the people i worked with were great, would gladly work for them again in CNRL"
good,"The work was pretty steady. I mostly worked nights, so it was super relaxed and stress free. THe leads were pretty easy to work for. The Supervisors were very useless when it came to management. Hours and days off were pretty awesome."
good,"good working environment, enjoyed the people I worked with and for, I love what I do and the providers I work for.  Just did not have health benefits."
good,Work culture is all about your utilization rate.  Employees are widgets which must be billable to be worth keeping around.  Plan on finding your own work with no help from management.
good,"Overall a great career experience. I advanced as far as I could, then there were no longer opportunities at upper level executive management. Good office management in Greenville, SC."
good,Big company where Oil & Gas jobs doesn't mean a lot. Maintenance side it's way better than the Projects side. Good benefits but to much politics at higher levels.
good,Working with AECOM gave me a chance to learn about construction in the United Kingdom. I have learned about standards and norms. I also have been able to improve my English on a professional level.
good,I am part of a structured team that has an amazing management who supports your growth and pushes everyone to try to learn and excel. They do not limit us from wanting to spread our wings.
good,"Meeting every morning where we would get our orders for the day and then we would get to work. Learned how to use a packing machine that applied shipping foam to protect the product. Organizational skills were a must when getting all the proper pieces together for the order. The workplace was pretty relaxed and and efficient. Not really any hard parts to the job itself, having to leave was the worst. I enjoyed working with all the guys I had on my shift."
good,The management has been with the company on average 12 years plus. It is extremely difficult to advance because managers never leave the company. They provide training in-house to help employees do their jobs better and more efficiently.
good,"A typical day ranges from 8 to 12 hours depending upon active projects, maybe more.  Culture gradually became worse with takeover by AECOM management."
good,"you go through the safety meeting and bus ride to your equipment."
good,"Salary and benefits are very good, especially for those starting their careers. Flexible work hours and social activities that are organized throughout the year make for a good work environment."
good,"Too much work, not enough employees, low pay, rigid manager, hostile environment, no room for advancement, great ethical training, weekly meetings, great work schdule."
good,"Very competitive work there;"

good,AECOM was a relaxed place to work.  My supervisor trusted me to complete my daily tasks without looking over my shoulder.  They are very flexible and understanding of the work/life balance.
good,"Show up to work."
good,"Daily reports, safety tool box talks, progress photos, meeting minutes. Quantity check, process payment. Ensure work is being conducted as per the drawings and contract documents."
good,You are a number in this company. They process employees as long as they are billable and they will let you go once you are not needed. Will never go back to work for Aecom due to job insecurity.
good,It's a very good place to learn your skills as you will get to work on a lot of diverse projects. Work pressure is high and you have no life apart from work
good,"AECOM is a growing company that has growth opportunities to those that seek them out."
good,"Great company to start your career with- you will learn a lot within the first year. There are a variety of projects offering a vast skill set opportunity. Great people working there. However, in order to make decent money you have to jump."
good,"Though management turnover and strife was a looming factor for several years, those in charge now seem to operate with a reassuring fairness and steadfastness. Shop leads are the bigger issue, all of whom are prior Navy, and most of whom have carried over the ""I'm always right, you're always wrong"" mentality. Humility and questioning their own managerial styles are not a strength. Fortunately the union keeps people from worrying too much about said shop leads' bigger flaws."
good,"I wish I didn't have to leave (not by choice)."
good,"Work was usually steady.  Receiving parts coming in and sorting them.  Organization of parts by number and creation of a parts stockroom.  Inventory of the parts and use of computer system to replace and reorder parts.  Distribution of parts to mechanics."
good,"Nice place to work. However, too much departmental politics make you tense. HR department is as good as nothing, they dont have a working performance management system to rate the work done by you hence every time you need to fight for your promotion and increase in salary."
good,We were a sub-contractor at a government site. I enjoyed most of my colleagues and the management was outstanding. I also appreciated that my skills were recognized and I was pulled aside to work on several corporate projects that were not aligned with the customer site. I only left because our contract was descoped.
good,We had a great team and senior leadership during a huge growth phase for the company.  It provided a huge learning opportunity in the world of sports architecture.
good,It's an 8hr work. A lot of things you will learn in AECOM especially in your profession. The workplace is okay and the colleagues. The hardest part of the job is when you have a lot of jobs to do but you are not well compensated. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the company involved you in a different kind of project. And gave you a chance to enhance your knowledge.
good,"Had a good experience, until I was laid off. Lot of management changes and constant restructuring. Company is well respected and do a lot of work with government clients"
good,"AECOM was an excellent place to gain experience.  If you don't mind not being compensated for going above and beyond and learning new things, I highly recommend this company.  I gained a lot of knowledge and experience.  The folks were a great group of people to work with."
good,"The site office culture is always friendly and dynamic. Everyone knows one another to the extend of your family members that are in Doha. Everyone helps one another. One site office, one team, one family. That is the culture in Aecom."
good,"Excellent work ethic, great people to work with, all who are there for the right reason and have a passion for the work they do. "
good,"At URS/AECOM, I was given independence to chart out the projects that needed special attention and draw out the audit program. This required meetings with top executives and performing risk assessments to ascertain which project or process required scrutiny."
good,"Firma de consultanta serioasa."
good,"I think your experience will start from number two when you joint to any multi national company, what ever you how many experience you have in this field in the local companies, because the only thing you will got from the local copay is HOW TO WORK HARD IN SHORT TOME."
good,Company is great for those whole love to travel the world and learn all types on engineering. The company requires you to be strong in verbal communication to move up.
good,"My current company is a worldwide company, According to my experience it is  a best company for learning and increase skills,  Now quistion is why I am looking around ? Answer is very simple to seek new horizon also for a batter salary"
good,"I worked with Professionals. The work was a breeze, a lot of spread sheet work, complex filing system. My responsibilities were multi-facet, Human Resources, A/P, Payroll, and many other functions. Constant communication with the Regional office, as well as the Corporate office. The position required the ability to communicate with all walks of life and levels of department heads."
good,Great company it seems everywhere else but my work site. Our managers seem to always be doing something shady to cut us (myself and fellow employees) hours.
good,This company requires individuals to work hard. The oil industry is not a place to play as the work is serious and lives matter. Lots of fresh air on the oil fields along with opportunity to work overtime when the industry picks up.
good,"Was a good company to work for, but the oil and gas business went down. Work was work, I did accounting, and payroll timesheets for project managers of 150 employees, hourly and salary."
good,Manchester office has approximately 200 staff members.  A good diversity of staff. Good professional office to work in. A friendly office and management with lots of social events. Hardest part of job schedule and complete multiple jobs on time.

good,"start with a toolbox meeting, safety moments and safety issues, then work ahead and accomplishments, good teamwork, good management support, workers welfare and safety is paramount."
good,Hardest part of the job is dealing with management that will not support you. A typical day at work is solving problem after problem for the customer just to avoid criticism by management. I have mastered multitasking and how to operate in an environment of constantly changing demands at this job. The most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to travel.
good,"AECOM is a great place to work and learn Construction Management.  As a Construction Superintendent, I was able to interact with different contractors on a ""work order"" basis"" and learned more about RFP procedures and contract timelines to complete projects to final closeout."
good,"I enjoy working at AECOM as I am not micro managed and I am trusted to use my initiative with my work."
good,"Great people and managers and lot of growth and goals. The atmosphere is fun and friendly. The people are helpful in all ways. The company supports a lot organizations such as Breast Cancer and MS. Also, they have all types of vendors to come in a give employees exams for flu shots etc."
good,"Wonderful co-workers and immediate managers are flexible, willing to accommodate a good work/life balance. The particular office I am based out of needs more variety in their client base."
good,"The work days are long and slow, it is a good place to start a career as you can get into the swing of things and learn. I wake up at 430, catch a bus and am at work at 630.  I do not get back home until 5.  A lot of interesting things to do for a couple years and then you will not learn anything else.  Not a great place for advancement.  It is very political.  Remind you this is for the WIPP site.  I have not worked at a AECOM facility."
good,"Great place to work, people are okay benefits are good but room for growth is limited. Work is three shifts and in some jobs detachment is a must to go with the Navy. Great for retired veterans or newly mechanics."
good,"Worked here for 6.5 years and moved to various project locations."
good,good to work for keeps you going. large company and many opportunities many people doing good things for many peoples large areas of work over north america
good,This was a good project to work on. Carmon Creek accommodations were second to none. Food was very good as well. Very respectful work environment and the focus on safety was exemplary.  As a result of current oil and gas markets job security was a major concern.
good,The company is very considerate to all working moms. You could do flex-time or work from home. Safety is their number one priority. We always have a monthly safety meeting which covers all preventive measures regarding timely safety issues either from home or workplace.
good,Good company to work for.  Great safety culture.  Opportunities for advancement from within.  Sometimes project timing can be sporadic.

good,"very engaging to work with professionals, and able to push ideas further. There are many challenges to design a simple project. Working in a foreign country challenged my verbal skills and to project my voice in the design process."
good,A typical day starts with doing rounds and logging the building I work in and then getting my work orders for the day. I will completed these as time allows unless I get a service call in which I will go do that instead.  My co-workers are good to work with and very experienced and are willing to help if needed. The hardest part of the job is some of the labor intensive work required of the job but help is always around the corner if needed.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I get to work with on a daily basis.
good,Working at AECOM has taught me a lot about Civil Engineering and Design work. They do give me training opportunities which I enjoy and they do mentor me to the best of their ability.

good,A typical day at work included analytical characterization of field-samples acquired at a variety of coal-fired powerplants. I learned a variety of new analytical techniques and was given the opportunity to design bench scale models to assist clients in developing pollution remedies at the plant and test sorbent materials. The hardest part of the job was the travelling requirements. It was expected that you would travel at any given moment.
good,"I mostly worked on my own, but did have occasion to interact with other offices by phone."
good,Company is struggling financially and I have had my hours recently reduced.  I am now looking for other full time opportunities where my talents and experience can benefit me and my new employer.

good,"A typical day at work:"
good,"Working and establishing a safety culture in a region where health, disease, and climate challenged the establishment of safety for the workers health and productivity. The training of local workers on a accelerated schedule with climate extremes and the management of multiple projects over a (4) year period successfully and with a ERE that reflected safety excellence."
good,This company was a very fun and energetic place as well as a learning environment.
good,Pretty steady work flow but seasonally some very hectic days.  Short turnaround times.  Job training was very self motivated and self trained.  Great co-workers and have participated in several events outside of work.  The hardest part of the job would be last minute requests (usually Friday afternoons at 4:00) that are needed Monday morning.  I enjoy the satisfaction that as a single parent I was able to support my family.
good,Good Working Environment. Lot to learn from Seniors. Top Management is ok and clarity maintained. Co-workers are very friendly. The hardest part of job is thinking of commercial aspect rather than a good design.
good,"Engineering/design/drafting"
good,"take care about employees to re locate when ever a project going to end ,Having lot off business in Middle east and shuffle the employees in Middle east to survive the jobs."
good,"URS Corporation is a great way to gain corporate experience. However its challenging to grow within the company if, you are not located in a high profile office or there are not enough positions that may be of interest to you. Overall, it's the best job that I've ever had - and sure a new college graduate will appreciate a place like this."
good,Global leader in design engineering and construction management
good,"Nice company, I learnd a lot of things, good team and good work atmosphere"

good,"A day at work was very busy. Have to keep on top of more than one duty at times. My weakness is that I am too quiet. I learned to speak more. The management was very understanding and they kept everyone on their toes. Loved my co-workers. Overall, all of my duties were challenging but not hard. I would have to say that I enjoyed the people there the most. I have missed them."

I conducted countless environmental investigations which required soil sampling, water sampling, soil-vapor testing, and more. My time at URS was good. I enjoyed my coworkers the most. The company has really good people working for it. The relationships I made at URS are long-lasting. The skills I learned from my colleagues are the foundation for my environmental career."
good,A normal day would be busy getting work in and processed out throughout the day. The deadlines had to be met. Management needed this work processed in order to complete their jobs in their time schedule. Co-workers always pitched in and helped one another. The hardest part of the job was trying to retreive certain information that was needed to process the work. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing at the end of the day that the work was completed.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the various projects.
good,"As the customer service lead I am responsible for our work scheduling, vacation schedule, quality review, answering procedural question, clarifying procedures, assist with interviewing, training new hires, managing invoices, checking invoices for accuracy, maintaining and updating excel spread sheets for daily open work and maintaining and updating excel spread sheets with a run rate of all invoices received, files and maintain paper invoice, creating work order request, take customer calls, dispatching work to technicians."

good,Working with AECOM is great as you will feel that the top management treat you in the same level and appreciate all your hard work. They give equal opportunity to all and are open for suggestion from employee.
good,As a contract employee the marine side of the place could treat you with disregard but most of the marines we worked with were really nice and a joy to work with.  Some of the leadership treatment was based on personal feelings instead of quality of work.  If you were liked by management you were safe if not you would soon be out of a job.
good,"Good company to work for. Many intelligent people working for this organization. This is a global company and with that comes it's challenges, but overall the morale and culture were positive. Which allowed the workforce to flourish in their environment."

The management has taken care of the employee with good salary and benefits.  The good working culture with understanding working mates makes the job interesting and joyful. The hardest part of the job is learning Technical issues in engineering field.  The most enjoyable part in my job is all my boses and working mates gives me a dual respect so I can carry out my job very well and deliver the best to the company.
good,"Nothing bad other than the salary, which look like less compare to other company."
good,"It is an enjoyable place to work and it is a good global consultancy business with office all over the world, so you are able to work anywhere in the world."
good,"Its a good company. off course not everything in the basket of apple is good. There are some people that somehow get the job but you ,may wonder why? Just look at the good stuff and do the job."
good,Laid back approach to work day. Not much pressure put on employees. Easy hours and plenty of free time after work ended. Freedom at work lead to some laziness from employees but overall a good place to work.

good,"The job itself was pretty neat, however dealing with so many people in different situations made it kind of nerve racking seeing the different mood swings."

good,An excellent opportunity for a serious learner and unlimited scope for expanding your experience.The peer group are well experienced and can take their help in expanding your area of expertise.The company keeps up to date with their performance world wide by arranging meetings during lunch time.The top managers come and present their  on going projects to the employees.
good,Good company to work for. Good variety in Small and large projects with good opportunities to progress. Salary are around the average going rate but you tend to have to ask for a rise rather than be given one for performance
good,"The only negative is the benefits, it is expensive for the service we get,  pay is not commensurate with knowledge and experience, and uncertainty of the job.  Other than that, I had a fantastic manager."
good,well planned and organized work have been well done and successively achieved by followed universal and local standards approved and recommended by the designers and the clients to conduct quality control tests
good,"Love working here, job is easy and people are very friendly and helpful.  Most days are very relaxed.  Some days there are time sensitive matters that need to be taken care of."
good,"Enjoyed working there except I never knew if I was going to be on the next wave of layoffs. People were either overworked or left out in the cold due to cliquish attitudes between client groups. While management encouraged interoffice collaboration to keep people busy, very little was possible due to the constraints within the profit centers (which changed every six months). Annual reviews and career planning was a detailed process that was in the end a total joke, as upper management determined who was going to be promoted without any consideration of the review process, much to the frustration of the employees and supervisors. Then, while I was recommended by my supervisors and upper management for redeployment assistance, there was little help from HR after both times I was laid off."
good,"Working at AECOM has become my second home, which isn't too say that is because I spend every waking minute at work. This is my second home because of the relationships that have been built with my team. These are people that have become family. It makes it much easier to come to work when you are with people that you care about.Overall, it's a comfortable place to work, provided there is funding to keep the team going."
good,"The recruiting process was the best.  However, after getting to the location to work was very disorganized.  Having the background in the field was disappointing not to be able to use my experience."
good,"I only left because I was commuting over four hours daily.  The management that I worked for were good people; supportive and encouraging.  The working atmosphere was very nice, and I had everything that I needed to complete my job description."
good,Any part time paying pretty decent will be perfect for me all I need is a second job to make it in this economy of me without raises our cost of living is very hard to maintain
good,"Challenging with different projects and assignments ensuring constant flow of work. Intensity of work seems to run on intervals, with deadline rushes occasionally and period of pressing monotony. Good work culture."
good,Only good experience to share with AECOM.AECOM is a good place to work.Management and staff is very understanding .AECOM cares all staff and job security is always there in AECOM

good,"- Good management support"
good,"I don't know much about AECOM but they purchased URS (who I worked for) and I worked on a project.  If you were in with management, you were ok, if not, it could be a struggle.  I was a manager with them and I saw some bias on different things but the pay was great."
good,Know what you want.  AECOM has locations all over the world.  Know who you  are and what you want with the company.  Management team is the backbone of AECOM.

good,"Hardest part of the job is dealing with managers.  Pending on mood, time of day, different request.  No consistency as operating rules changed with the wind. Most enjoyable part of the job as my co-workers.  We all dealt with the same frustration, thus promoted a closer sense of comradary."
good,"i learned alot here and had amazing benefits and pay."
good,"Overall, a good company. Good opportunities for advancement. Job quality will vary depending on what range you work at. This is a contracting company, currently a sub-contractor of AECOM."
good,Excellent safety culture always kept up to date on changes on everything going on the work site.

There's an opportunity for driving some heavy machinery i.e. a forklift, and some type of heavy loader/unloader so it can make for an interesting day. I ran my own issue center and order supplies for aircraft maintenance, that was a new experience and it was enjoyable to learn. The benefits were ok. Hardest part of the job was working in the warehouse in the cold (no heat) and the summer (no A/C). The fumes from the materials the maintenance guys used could be extreme at times as well."

After a few years of helping bring together several purchased companies and consolidate 50+ domains, AECOM has moved toward outsourcing their IT department to IBM.

The workers at AECOM are very easy to get along with and a great deal of experience can be learned from them. Having some guidance at certain points along your career path at AECOM would probably be the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part would being able to go to different job sites regularly.
good,"Overall this is a good work enviroment, the Management group is pushing for the plant to go into operations, my views was the company was not ready for this move, there is still alot of work to be completed before the start of operations, the Management group in the Maintenance department is incomplete and dissatisfifing to the employees, investigations are incomplete and personnel are seriouly looking for jobs else where because of this problem."

There was always something new to be learned depending on whatever was happening.  I learned to be patient and tolerant of other individuals.  Management allowed us to do our job with very to little micro-management.  My immediate coworkers were extremely knowledgeable and helpful.  The hardest part of the position was the two commute one way, and most enjoyable part of the job was going home knowing that everyone else went home safe and sound."

good,"The overall experience thus far has been very favorable and has allowed me to broaden my horizons through various experiences that I have learned and benefitted from greatly.  The work environment was quite laid back, but deadlines were still very much important.  The workload was never so over bearing that missing deadlines was severely in danger.  I would love to be able to stay with this company, but at this time it doesn't appear as if that will be possible due to it being contract work for an outage."
good,Fun Workplace and friendly environment where they share their knowledge in a particular thing you want to know. They provide seminars and training's specially online.

Through my 4.5 years experience with URS, I have developed my construction knowledge as well as learned how to deal with various types of people from co-workers, construction management and Clients and their representatives. The hardest part of this job was the amount of travel and the remoteness of the job site (Northern Alberta) and I spent entirely too much time away from home and my family. The most enjoyable part of my job with URS was the ever changing face of the job as we progressed through the project. Every new challenge taught me more construction practises and solutions to various construction issues that arose."

General Atomics provides direct management and they are excellent to work for. Individual needs are always taken into consideration.  Lots of travel is hard on family life. The best part is serving the U.S.A as a civilian and the brotherhood created in close knit workplace."
good,Good team of professionals that encourage professional development. They expect you to put in the hard work and take care of our clients in order to move up the corporate ladder.
good,"Working the support queue for teir 3 support. Learned about windows 7 and Mac support and iDevices. My direct report supervisor was a great leader, but his supervisor micromanaged and caused n uncomfortable work environment. Coworkers were a tight cohesive group that meshed well. the hardest part of the job was the repitition while the most enjoyable was working and building a rapport with the different customers."
good,"I enjoyed working for URS over the 16+ years I was with then. Their mission was very hazardous and we all knew we would one day be out of work. At one time we had 1200 employees but by March the contract will end. Important mission of destroying all the chemical weapons stored in Utah and I was responsible over the years of maintaining the inventory, shipping and receiving the parts needed to keep this plant running to support maintenance and operations activities related to the plant.

We've achieved an awful lot together, increasing production by over 20% in the past year and consequently winning the Team of the Year award.  There's a great sense of cohesion and, while we all have our individual characters, we work very well together.  I really enjoy the team spirit.  Over time, the other team members have become increasingly dependent on me, as the Key member of the team, and this is another reason why I feel the time is clearly right for me to step up to a Team Leader role."
good,My day consists of checking my emails in Outlook to see  what needs to be done right away or projects that are not due until a later date in the future. If I have laptops that need to be imaged or processed I would work on those assignments. I also would have to do roll outs for new customers. I enjoy working with various departments of the State Department. I feel that the hardest part is working in small areas and not much time to complete a task of a customer cancelling on a project that was scheduled.

The hardest part about the job, is that I am required to work basically a 60 to 80 hours a week, which gives me very little time for family or social life."
good,"I loved working for URS Corporation, and would love to work for URS again in the future.  It's a great place to work, and the employees are friendly and seem happy to be there, which creates a comfortable atmosphere.  They are a fair company with great benefits and potential for advancement, except unfortunately in Accounting, which is my field.   The Austin, TX office houses most of the Accounting personnel.  However each department in the Denver office employs at least one Project Administrator/Accountant, which is my specialty.  "
good,Good front line manager supervision. Excellent communication
good,Leadership sometimes is lacking mostly because of government involvement of daily operations.  Overall not a bad place to work
good,I like working here but it doesn't pay enough to provide for my family.
good,"My coworkers have been like family, but upper/regional/nationwide management don't seem to place value on their employees.  Everything shaved to save a buck.   Moral is often low.   Upper management changes the ""rules"" at any given moment and without warning.  Salary and benefits are generally good."
good,"Good company, look over the employees needs and well secure."
good,"Monday through Friday, flexible schedule, leaned so much of the project design and management. coworkers were great. the hardest part of the job was non.  The  most enjoyable part of the job was during a lunch break."

good,"At URS there never wa a typical day. One day I might be filling in for sick receptionist or mailroom clerk, another I might setting up for a huge client party, re-decorating the company's condo for a special client or down at the Auto dealership geeting all the fleet vehicles outfitted with new changes. URS taught me alot of skills and patience. While I was employeed there my Department went through 3 different managers. The first 2 managers were both promoted to other areas within the company & I remained friends with them both. The hardest part of my job was people sometimes treating me like I was their personal maid. The most enjoyable part of my job was decoarting for events"

good,"this company is very safety motivated"
good,"My job duties at AECOM includes checking supplies inventory,printing and binding proposals for clients, receive and ship daily mail. I learned a lot at AECOM, and would like to grow and expand my abilities further. I feel that AECOM would not help me get there due to many changes hapenning within the organization. I get along very well with all of my co workers. The most enjoyable part of my job is having a coffee break with my coworkers. The hardest part of my job is when management don't communicate effectively."

I am involved in day-to-day contract execution and I provide in-field inspection services and safety/quality oversight for six wellway and four shafts in Madison Yard beneath Grand Central Terminal.

good,Working on a large DOE EPC project which presents challenges and allows you to see the results of your contributions.  Input is valued and expected; active participation is the norm.
good,"They mostly do transportation work, Airport and Subway station work, so if you don't like that don't work there.  The projects are not always glamorous and the clients can be quite difficult."
good,"Working for AECOM has been good. The part i like the most is the people  i work with. It was not easy after leaving the Active duty and back into the civilian sector; there is differences of how we communicate with co-workers and friends in the military then how we do in the civilian sector. It definitly takes time to adjust, but with AECOM it has been much easier because most of everyone are veterans. The pay and benefits i feel are fair, a little pricey on medical, but again everyone is a veteran and so we don't have to depend on company medical coverage."
good,"Inside politics plays vital @ AECOM, lots of guys who are mere figure heads receiving better pay than those who are more technically capable."
good,"At the outset, it should be noted that AECOM is a giant enterprise of high professional quality."
good,"Site management seems retaliatory and a bit restrictive. Feels like they forget that majority of workers already played the ""in the military"" game, but still try and run it like we're all just mindless drones."
good,Workload changes day by day depending on orders coming in from all across the world. On slow workload days there is always special projects that can be done to keep yourself busy. Management is good and respects people who come to work and get the job done.

good,This is a great place to work for.  Great benefits and advancement opportunities.  This company is a world wide corporation were you can relocation to various countries.
good,"Bosses are alright with working different hours and coming in late to stay working late. 9/80 schedule helps provide a great work/life balance. Not much opportunity to grow, due to lack of numerous projects."
good,"Love the variety of work from day-to-day. Benefits are great with the exception of the cost of health insurance (but I think that's most companies the days). The company provides each office with a budget specific for building employee moral and collaboration as part of their Great Place 2 Work (GP2W) Program.

good,Vast network company and it's professional team member working together. Everyone is professional & positive to work with. You will appreciate the working environment here.
good,"It is hard to give a fair review based on working experience in AECOM. Your experience here will depend on your job title, your department manager and your discipline. If the department you work has high revenue, staff in that department enjoy higher pay for less work. You will meet people who were extremely overworked and others who had a great work-life balance."
good,AECOM was a great company to work for and a lot of fun. I would have stayed with them as long as possible had I not been outsourced with IT.  The culture was employee friendly.
good,"It was just another everyday kind of job. You come to work, you go to your designated area and see the job through. If I had to go back to this job I would."

good,"The atmosphere here is very positive. Everyone is helpful and the feeling is that we are all on the same team. "

good,"AECOM has grown so much over the years.  They are a leader in the engineering world.  From the time i started to the present we have expanded to well over 100,000 employees.  AECOM is a great place to work where the employees are the backbone and make the experience worth the hard work."
good,"AECOM specializes in bringing in experienced, EHS professionals into various organizations to mature existing programs. They are pretty hands-off and allow their employees to impress their clients through hard work and dedication."

good,"I've worked on and off for this company many of years."
good,Day starts out with a safety topic and what the expectations for the day. Read procedures and sops. Most enjoyable is learning new things and making sure you leave home the way you came to work.
good,"Productive place to work.  The work was challenging and demanding."
good,Decent benefits and good pay. It's a good company to work for as a single person that likes to travel from place to place. Just hard to get a promotion.
good,"Good working environment, challenging and satisfying engineering practices."
good,"Good company "
good,environnement de travail très professionnelle.Situation des bureaux avantageuse.

good,"Attend a plan of the day meeting. Conduct a start of the day meeting with operators to talk about the days tasks and hand out daily directives. Ensure that the days tasks were completed in a safe and compliant manner following our companies four core values, Personal accountability, Procedural compliance, Technical inquisitiveness and willingness to stop. The hardest part of the job was learning to manage different people. The most enjoyable part was learning to operate the many different plant systems."
good,"Management"
good,"Overall, Aecom is a good place to work. Like many large organizations (approximately 100,000 person worldwide), unfortunate good old boys club culture seems to exist."
good,"Worked on and off with this comapny since it was flint never really a complaint about them, Look forward to working more projects with this company in the future."

good,The team of people I work with are a group of very dedicated and knowledgable people alway available to leand a hand to help you out and talk with.
good,"Great company to work for with many perks not accessible elsewhere , like the ability to learn from industry leaders, travel, creative liberties, and a flexible work schedule. My only qualms are with management, once again making it apparent the engineers have no business managing."
good,I dont know if aecom knew what to do with the division I was part of. Any review would be more of the company URS than aecom as there was virtually no change in work environment after the switch.
good,"In my case I worked as a loaned employee to another company, after URS was merged with AECOM.  I had very little interface with my AECOM management.  There are good managers at AECOM.  My experience with some of the URS management was not so good."
good,"Great Department Manager"
good,"My time in AECOM has been a great experience, particularly working within internal multi-discipline teams. I have been working with Sydney's top architects and clients giving me the right skills to forward my career."
good,"The atmosphere of the workplace is attractive to different nationalities and mindsets. In AECOM, I learned the best HR practices as it has a lot to give to its employees."
good,"Its A good company to work for overall, but they are some bad apples still floating around i'm sure they will be retiring before long."
good,I would recommend AECOM to anyone starting out in their career as for me it enabled me to dabble in several areas that I wouldn't have otherwise had the opportunity.
good,This company grows via acquisitions. The HR Department is very strong.  They are driven by policy and procedures.  HRIS systems are constantly changing due to streamlining.  Must be very flexible.
good,"Enjoy my team working there, Time for a change and broaden my horizons.  Management is important.  Traveling is probably the hardest part of my job."
good,"I enjoyed working at this job but the company moved all of their accounting to Richmond, VA.  I really enjoyed doing Federal contract billings and worked well with my team.  The last couple of years I worked doing conversion for multiple companies being moved to Oracle accounting.  The hardest part of my job was leaving."

good,professional atmosphere with high expectations regarding your own work. Fair and fun place to work on a day to day basis.
good,"Stepping out onto the flight line, no matter the weather, is by far the best part of this job.

good,AECOM has a good work culture. got to learn and understand  a lot of things from the company and through my seniors. we were like a family. could learn a couple of new softwares.
good,"I enjoy the people and the clients I work with/ for, however there is little room for advancement as the current contract is drawn up. The hours and work environment are top notch , and hardest part of my day is really the comm.ute, I enjoy what I do , so I don't think of it as work"
good,Its a good place to work but they made a few cut backs that hurt the pockets of employees. They should take care of the locals.
good,"I enjoyed working for URS.  I really appreciated the safety mindset.  Safety was really a part of my work and home life.  I also appreciated being trained in CPR, First Aid, and AED every two years.  These are skills to use wherever you may be at work, at home or at play."
good,It was great time working with AECOM's SIKA EAST project in Afghanistan despite of many challenges & hardships. I have learn a lot.

good,"Responsible for daily export movement control functions, providing sequence of operation and distribution of work, designates workers and assigns work. Provides movement control support for the surface, sea and air movement of Government Cargo through the U.S. Military transportation system. Most co-workers are individually responsible for specific task which we must all perform our role to a very technical and administrative standard in order to be successful."
good,"never the same from day to day"
good,"I don't know if it was the location or not, but there was a lot of down time. They help pay for school, therefore i had some time to get some homework done while waiting for a work order. It was easy to get along with everyone even the general manager. There was a lot of free training which will help you out later on in life."
good,"data entry all day"
good,Good and dedicated people and great work environment. My thirty one years of service shows URS' commitment and dedication to keeping employees employed.

good,"Repair and maintain Cabinet cooler, Oil chiller, Walk-in freezer, Coolers, Rooftop split units, Door Heaters, Cascade Freezer, anything dealing with AC units in building maintence and production"
good,It was a great place to work and great people to work with. Had lots of opportunities to learn about the Demil work from working in maintenance to operations.
good,"Review schedule, inspect and track work performed by contractor.  I learned a great deal about train Control.  Management was very supportive and responsive to all my requests and issues.  I had only co-workers from other companies, not AECOM."
good,There are lots of cross training opportunities at URS at Red River Army Depot. The federal services division is a little shaky now that the federal budget is subject to a vote every few months. It makes it difficult to rely on the future. I expect that many will be laid off but will offer a wealth of experience for a new company.
good,"I enjoyed working for AECOM, and would love to work for them again in the future.  "
good,"An enjoyable placed to work with great team leaders and supervisor,"
good,It is an excellent organization to work.  But you cannot go against the system.  New ideas are entertained to the extent that you can tell people about it but it does not change anything.
good,Great job the site has a great safety record over 17 million hours without a lost day of work. The hardest part of the job was missing the deer on the way to work. We completed the mission at TOCDF and the plant is coming down.
good,"Good people, good opportunities, good working environment."
good,"I am currently working on a project that will end in May. URS is the company that is currently in control of the customer service and call centers for TxTag tollways. All positions that are not management are hired from temp agencies though so there are little to no benefits (as in health insurance, accrued vacation days, etc..). The atmosphere of the workplace is very professional and focused."
good,"I have worked for AECOM and it predecessor companies for 26 years.  My skills lie in assisting managers, directors and external clients giving a first class customer service at all times. I worked in a small team of 8, 3 colleagues in the Edinburgh office and another 4 in our Glasgow office.  We all enjoyed a good working relationship with excellent communication skills across the business.  The part  of my job I enjoyed the least was handing over unfinished work to a colleague because of the time restraints of being a part time worker.  I much prefer to see things through to conclusion.  The most enjoyable aspect was using my years of experience to assist fellow team members, internal staff and customers."
good,"Good company to be with would still love to work for then. Team work and safety very important, fun working place with very friendly coworkers and management."
good,Excellent Company to work for with equipment that was needed you to do your job.
good,"waking up when the sun rises, eat breakfeast then go out in the field to our first structure of the day, then we would take pictures of the damage to the structure and note it on a form, and we would do this for every element of the structure and we'd inspect up to 10 structures in a day. "
good,"Enjoyed working there. Pay is great and so are the benefits, the downfall is that it is a contract job, Wish I could have been there longer."
good,"My day started with me checking my correspondence (voice and emails) to prioritize whom I needed to contact during the day. I also checked my tasks to make sure I didn’t miss contacting a client, making a phone call, or sending information to internal and external clients. I updated my records by running the aging reports, cash receipts report, and the unapplied cash account to make sure I didn’t have money unapplied. I exported information into a spreadsheet that had aging information for my clients. I used the spreadsheet to write emails to  my clients."
good,"Trend-setting company. Good managers. Lack of job growth. "
good,Nice. Very Relaxed environment mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
good,"I have been an on-site consultant my whole time with URS so do not have the 'water cooler' culture. However, in my on-site role, they allowed me to pursue the tasks with a minimum of intervention and trusted my professional decision making abilities. For any one confident in their skills and committed to success, URS will provide an environment in which one can succeed very well."
good,"Normally URS is consulting Firm, In Electrical Department we do from Scheduling at Beginning to Project to at the end Commissioning and Testing."
good,"I have worked a rotating shift for the past 8 years, working independently most of this time.  The most difficult part of the job is the night shifts.  I have enjoyed meeting many new people while working here, I am truly going to miss being a part of the team here."
good,"Long hours at the beginning of a project, but usually slack off.  "
good,It was a great place to work with great people. Fun environment and they really seemed to care about their employees.  
good,"A first in the morning we had a meeting talk abouth production end saifty I' learned a lot of things abouth diessel motors I' work in commponents therdown blowers ,and put them back thogether replace worn pars also turbos air compressors fuel ingetor fuel pumps wather pumps oil coolers I learn to work whit a lot of tools never had any ploblems whit my co-workers the hardest part of my day was make it tru the day long ten hours four days a week end sam times five or six days a week. be in my work area makin a difrence, make me feel good. the last thing the I did was refurnish fire extinguishers therdown end put back as new"
good,"Like all consulting firms, billability is important, however unlike other companies have worked for, URS doesn't hold personal time (vacation and sick) against you. There's paid overtime and make your own hours. I appreciate the freedom I have, the high responsibility I can have with projects and that I can set up my own career path. I feel supported in my growth and encouraged to be my best without compromising time with my family."
good,Was close to home. Loved working with the public but I felt the company lost a lot of clients due to charges. It seemed like they charged you for something every time you turned around. They focused more on the wealthy clients and forgot about the everyday worker.
good,"I get paid okay for what I do. I can't complain too much about it since I was asked what my desired salary would be. Benefits are expensive but not that different than the other places I have worked. Tuition reimbursement is listed as a benefit, but getting it approved it tricky. I am going to school for electrical engineering which is a main function of URS and still get denied each time I submit my request. Due to the nature of my particular job, I have had flexibility allowing me to attend classes during the day, which has been the greatest benefit. 401(k) match is comparable to other places and PTO is good with the option to purchase an additional week."
good,It is a big company with a smaller company feel. You have the advantages of a big company and the personability of a smaller company.
good,URS - Is an excellent employer. They trust that every employee hired has the ability to multitask and learn new things quickly. Im excited and looking forward to get rehired.
good,"Days at URS are good depending on the job of the day, I have learned that safety is the company's number one police. Management is up and down on a day to day bases pending on who is in charge, alongside management co-workers are insightful and helpful on types of levels. the hardest part of the job is staying on the page with management because of the frequent change in work throughout the day. finale the most enjoyable part of the job is positive working environment."
good,Large network of expertise. Global company with a presence in every major sector.
good,I was the lead Administrative Assistant for the Airport Department. I worked closely with VP's of the department and other department employees. Everyday was filled with new challenges and it felt good at the end of the day knowing I was able to assist my department in every aspect asked of me.
good,Generally a good company to work for. The company believes in keeping key talents. Lots of different areas to work in from infrastructure and power to government.
good,"Can't really say, the brought out our company. They are worldwide however."
good,Excellent work environment with advancement oppurtunites.
good,"Great work culture, living accommodation really nice"
good,A very professional corporate organization.  The management was supportive and helpful. I was allowed the chance to grow professionally and personally.  Work hours are strongly adhered too.
good,"Work when there is work. Big faceless nameless emotionless corporation. People are a cog in the wheel. Hire and fire. It was common for people to be on the job and receive a phone call (in the lunch room) to come to work where they were ready working. "
good,Apply the project management procedures and methodologies and best engineering standards for all projects under the PMO contract with Ministry of rural and municipal projects.
good,An enjoyable place to work. Lots of diversity and the work culture is top notch. A great team environment and great work ethic. Lots of opportunity for advancement since the company is has lots of facets and global.

good,Good Company to work for. Fellow workers and bosses are nice and respectful. Pay is good with a good work environment. Training is provided if needed and communication seems to be going well.
good,You will learn a lot from here. Soak it all in and it will set you up for an even better job. The pay is awesome. Probably the most money I had ever made at that point in my life.
good,I loved my job at AECOM. I loved the people I worked with and for and the work environment was great. Do something you love and you'll  never work a day.
good,"I strive to complete all job task assigned to me daily . I look forward to interacting with fellow personnel, setting goals and furthering my skills in all aspects of job assignments."
good,"AECOM was a fantastic company to work for. Located in the Sierra Nevadas, AECOM strives to complete all jobs in an orderly and timely manner while providing a safe workspace."
good,I was a supply tech and was responsible for making sure that the mechanics had the parts needed for the vehicles they were working on.  This required a high level of communication.
good,"Good environement but work was not what i expected it to be."
good,My typical day involves monitoring personnel and vehicles that travel in and out of gates on campus.  Also I conduct bag and personnel checks to ensure no banned material enters into the facility.
good,"Nice workplace, with fast paced collaborative team culture. Company offers opportunity and development along with overseas placements. Would recommend as an employer."
good,"The staff are all really friendly. Plenty of work breaks and an onsite cafe. The brekas were designated to you at certain time throughout the day, Plenty of rest rooms and facilities available to the employees."

good,"Company treats you well.  I had the opportunity to learn new things, including software and procedures.  I thought the company had a very diverse set of employees."
good,"Good management, good emphasis on safety, a give er get er done mentality in the field. Good pay and good working schedule's. heavy emphasis put on production, more of a ""cowboy"" type work attitude at the actual job or task itself, with less attention to safety at that point."
good,"AECOM has been a company made up of professionals who push the limits of what's possible and deliver on dreams for a better world.  AECOM continues to push Safety Excellence, Ethics and growth with its employees, contractors, all partnering teammates."
good,"This company has excellent health and 401k benefits.  "
good,"Work environment was very comfortable to work in. "
good,It is an international EPC / PMCM world wide company.  I have enjoyed working for them. They have great benefit package. Working on International assignment was great as well.
good,AECOM is an engineering company with technical abilities in many areas of engineering and construction management.  The company is very supportive of its employees and strives to make a comfortable work environment.
good,"We have people come in from all over and if you needed something they made sure that someone was helping you resolve the problem. One drawback was we didn't have set hours, we would fly all times of the day."
good,Great until the hooked up with Bechtel and the benefits went away and the good bosses didn’t go to the next job. They did offer any bonus program or didn’t offer closure bonus and lied about getting overtime
good,Good money and enjoyed the work atmosphere. The supply of tools and equipment was great.
good,"Long Hours, Good Pay and benefits. All of the problems that come with contract work. Management has a habit of throwing untested people at job vacancies and the PMO is terrible at taking care of people. Slowly getting better. If you've deployed with the military youll be fine."
good,"Job is demanding but there is complete flexibility to work at the office or remotely and hours are under complete control of each engineer. The expectation is that you will complete your tasks, high quality and on-time. The downside is that there is no time for learning curve and no support regarding processes and procedures. You're just expected to jump in and go and miss nothing...ever. You must be an independent and confident person. If you need or expect hand-holding of any sort, this isn't the company for you"
good,Good place to work would work there again very relaxed place to work did a lot of training for the position enjoyed the other operators that I work with they was very helpful
good,"AECOM is a huge Engineering Consultancy firm, but like all others is facing financial setbacks and thus reflecting on employees job stability due to market conditions"
good,in a large company like AECOM you always have an opportunity to get involved in something new or work with new people and clients. there is never a reason to be board.
good,"Aecom is a good company but to many heads and decision making power is not given to managers. "
good,"Albert Einstien College of Medicine has a diverse research portfolio with ample space and opportunities for growth within. Support and resource groups, as well as core facilities, are very helpful."
good,"A very good company to work for, good benefits. Unfortunately, the pay is too low to be able to maintain a decent standard of living, and furthermore, considering the experience, training and education I have."
good,I worked in AECOM for more than 8 years and the work atmosphere and management was great. AECOM mentoring and employee development program helps employees to progress.
good,"Now I know its not the same everywhere but at the Wamego, KS site Management was the best I've found anywhere else. There was pressure to get things done like anywhere else but I found the work environment pushed more for getting the job done right and safe rather than RIGHT NOW as some industrial places have regardless of the ""safety first"" culture which gets pushed to the background."
good,"My coworkers are around my age."
good,"The working days at the company differ: sometimes a day can be easy, sometimes overloaded with long hours. You can learn a lot from the work implemented."
good,"Professional attitude at all levels of Management."
good,I worked here as an intern so I really don't know anything about what it is actually like to work for AECOM. I bet it is nice because the company is so big that you can slip through the cracks and do nothing if you feel like it.
good,Enjoyed working with company and leadership. Mission oriented supporting the warfighter. Good pay and benefits. Company sought out the best individuals.
good,I work with some very bright and talented people at AECOM and have learned a lot while working here.  The company is huge and there is an opportunity to network with people all over the world.

good,"It was a Government contract for a Squadron of F16 aircraft at Holloman AFB NM, it was not to stressful work wise, location was a little difficult to adapt to due to the location of the Base"
good,"nice people, perks, salary, workplace, co workers, work scope, designs, vendor visits and inspections, reviewing 3d models and other related bim drawings"
good,"Each day that I show up for work I know that no matter the pace of the day, the team work that my co-workers and I will display will match and exceed the expectations of our customers."
good,"AECOM is a great company, provides it's employees with a great work experience. Chalenges its employees and motivate them. Porivides a lot of employee benefits."
good,"The work environment at AECOM is fast-paced and sometimes stressful due to the new program-of-instruction. The program is still in its infancy and growing; however, conditions will eventually smooth out with time and a lot of effort."
good,it was a great place but managers were ignorant and disrespectful. also was a fast paced enviorment and alot of good people to work with. always busy never slow
good,I enjoyed working with AECOM because it provided job advancements with a competitive salary. The work environment was not stressful. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with veterans.
good,No complaints. Working at AECOM is a job that pays very well but is not very rewarding.  Management is Satisfactory and supporting. Not a lot of Vacation
good,Great Company to work for. AECOM always took care of it Employees. Family oriented as well. I worked for AECOM 3 times through out my career. I would work for them again.

good,"The project determines your daily activities and if you're not billable, you're not employed. Get involved with multiple projects and connect with multiple groups within. Great experience."
good,I think AECOM in general is a good company. They have few locations and allowed flex schedule. They have good management and people to work with and job opportunities.
good,"A typical day at work was a lot of physical work, driving trucks, making deliveries, doing order points and ERC tickets, fixing office furniture, loading and off loading trucks. Besides driving a forklift, transporter, cherry picker, reach truck and a swing truck, I also used a key cutting machine and a engraving to make signs. In the warehouse checking inventory and logging in new inventory into the computer system"
good,"I am working in AECOM since last more than 10 years and found one of the best firm to work with."
good,"good project managers and sales persons to work with, they explained the job to me and when I had questions explained it to me to where I could understand it."
good,This was a good company to work for.  When I was employed with this company it was called URS Corporation Americas and was then bought out and merged with AECOM.  All of my managers were very good and fair.
good,AECOM is an overall great company to work for and to be a part of. The benefit package is comparable to other major companies. Management was  positive.
good,"Hardest part of my last assignment was to come on board with the client as the third PCM since the inception of the project.

Management was a bit tough at times but that's with any job.  Workplace was a fun place to work most of the time.  I worked w/ a lot of retirees and former military personnel so we got a long well.  The hardest part of the job would be things changing on the fly.  Last minute flight schedule additions or changes.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work outdoors (when the weather was nice) and travel to different parts of the country for training (Key West, San Diego etc)."
good,Because URS was bought out at this time by AECOM I am not able to give a review at this time. We had a lot of work that was to be done but was canceled due to the buyout.
good,AECOM seems to take care of its people. Sadly they get into contracts where they are the subcontractor. This limits project efficiency tremendously.  ..
good,"Workplace culture, offices environments, project work is good and complex"
good,"A typical day at my Job."
good,"This was a typical 40hr a week job, with good pay. I learned a little in the 3 months employed there. Management was pretty cool. Everyone pretty much got along at least to get the job done."
good,"In the time that I worked for them, they were fair to me and productive. Management has a lot of tasks to be filled and doing them expediently is important. There is always something to do, so there's never a real lull in the day. Projects are ongoing and the company does offer many avenues to train and learn new skills from. Training methods are strong but you have to be able to reach out for the help as well. The hardest part is probably devoting time to all the scheduled phone meetings that take place on a daily basis. There are times when you need to get a project done, but it will have to be put aside to discuss strategy for something completely unrelated. The performance management process takes much too long to go through (rating yourself and then scheduling time with a manager who's not in the same city becomes difficult). HR department is more helpful than most. They go above and beyond on a regular basis. Found co-workers easy to work with for the most part."
good,I enjoyed working at AECOM and grew a lot professionally there.  The work environment was very relaxed and allowed for remote work as necessary.  Management was pretty good although at times I felt like they found it hard to delegate some of their work.
good,"great pay"
good,Worked on exciting projects with very motivated engineers. Co-workers willing to assist when possible. Expectations of employee might not have always been clear
good,"Empresa ótima para se trabalhar, onde aprendi ainda mais as rotinas da administração de empresa."
good,"Fantastic atmosphere with friendly,professional, and safe teammates. Typical work day is an eight hour day with expected PM procedures, and few trouble calls. Great opportunity for advancement within the company as long the individual is willing to relocate. Training is always available."
good,"Quiet place, easy to get things done."
good,"Highly professional work environment"
good,"Good people.  Co-workers generally are team players. The facility is comfortable and safe. If you stay with the company, there is room to grow and advance."
good,"- good place to learn & grow up"
good,"Company was formerly URS corporation while I was employed.  I gained a wide variety of experience while working on many different projects for a diverse group of clients.  There was a nice balance between office work and field work, which created an interesting working environment."
good,located in Abu Dhabi AECOM is a very fun place of work with the kind of management we can work there and achieve great things in our career.
good,"Great place to learn about coordination between architecture and other disciplines such as MEP, Structures, etc... in large scale projetcs."
good,"The corporation is going through a restructure so not easy to review. Currently there are many areas of improvement. "
good,EGG/URS have been very good to me. I have had many opportunities to advance and add numerous task to my role at AECOM.  The people are great to work with and make the job so much better!

good,"had a great time working for these guys "
good,"this project was really helpful for people who were not enough knowledge, work experience, we were closely work with Ministry for Rural Rehabilitation and IDLG,"
good,I only recently started here and with the merger it is hard to know what an average day in my job really is like. So far it seems like a solid first job for an Environmental or Civil Engineer.
good,"Nice people to work with.Fast paced most of the time.I learned a lot about safety(work areas,people and equipment). Management treated me good."
good,Good workplace that allows employees to grow in their career path. Provide a good job work/life balance. Helpful in getting new skills and training. Occasionally too much red tape/paperwork.
good,URS is a very nice place to be employed. I enjoyed going to work every day.
good,"URS lives up to their core values of ethical behavior and safety focus.  I have been well compensated and have advanced through many positions across several contracts.  "
good,Really great place to work. Too bad they are gone. I would still be there. I hope to find another place as good as they were to work again. very safety conscious. I am only typing things to make the right amount of words now. so this is going to be a ramble due to the fact that they are no longer in business and there is no value to this review.
good,"I worked 12 hours a day, 7 days a week as required by Contract.. "
good,Have wonderful managers to work with; hardest part of the job is making sure that all time worked is billable.  The most enjoyable part of the job is it is flexible and for the most part laid back.  Co workers are great.
good,"- Great work culture, "
good,"AECOM Inc. is a wonderful employer to work with, it enriches your experience with so many professional staff and professional environment, it really offers you challenges and give you strength to face them."
good,"It has truly been a pleasure to come to work every day. New challenges, great environment, talented coworkers and a very supportive manager."
good,nice and group work with a good management and high quality of supervising
good,Great pay and benefits.  Hard to move up in company if you are not corporate.
good,A day at work consists of a morning start of stretch and flex for all employees. Checking emails and constant assistance in the office if needed. The co-workers are very friendly and knowledgable of the project and the most enjoyable part of this project is all the extra training options that the company offers.
good,"... because of its people and friendly environment I am still craving to go back any time. They do overwork you ""unintentionally"";)"
good,"I learned a lot working for URS in the Chem Demil industry with the process and managing equipment. Unfortunately some good things come to an end, we have completed our mission and currrently in closure."
good,"Each day brought with it new challenges. Being able to identify, discuss and resolving program issues made each day interesting and fulfilling."
good,"I found my work very fulfilling. Just knowing that the work I was doing would someday save a life in a combat zone made me strive for excellence. Our motto was. "" If it's not right, it's not leaving"". I would have to say that the hardest part of the job was seeing my colleagues being laid off, and being laid off myself. There were no typical days at work, as everyday there was a new challenge. I loved my job, loved my coworkers. Management was always quick to provide answers or solve issues"
good,"Government Contractor in the Demilitarization industry; focused on Environmental compliance, Safety of personnel, and Quality on contract deliverables. Worked with the best and brightest in the industry and was able to grow both professionally and personally with this company."
good,"Really enjoyed working for AECOM until the crunch came when it felt a little like it was floundering without a plan. "
good,"Working at the chemical agent disposal facility taught me a lot about the right safety cultures to have in the workplace. Put into an environment I knew nothing about, I found it both frustrating and challenging to adapt--and once I did, did I realize the opportunity I had available to me. 12 hour shifts, rotating days and nights."
good,going to work was great because there was new challanges everyday
good,I would highly reccommend any engineer or architect coming out of school to appy to this firm!!
good,"Upon the procurement of the original Morrison-Knudsen/Washington Group by URS - an engineering corporation - the overall view of the contracting world at URS is a bit skewed. The thought that all projects can be with a compliant contract and non-fixed price is unrealistic, and provides an avenue for early retirement for a lot of construction people at this company."
good,Great place to work and grow professionally. Challenges your professional and personal skills and knowledge.
good,Co-workers were great to work with. They were experienced and helpful. The job required a lot of paperwork because it was a government job. That was probably the least enjoyable part of the job. It was a good opportunity to learn about the nuclear industry and requirements for that type of work.
good,A typical day at  work is working with a group of people who want to succeed and be successful in every task they need to complete and to do the best job they can and not to forget to enjoy what we do and have some fun in doing it. Listening to other co-workers input and creating new ideas and new approaches to solving problems. The hardest part of a job is when there is poor communication and poor to no instructions and no support.The most enjoyable part of the day is when your tasks are completed in a time frame that you committed too.
good,"I am currently employed with AECOM and its a descent company to work for/ its very challenging and competitive. i have no complaints none whatsoever.

I've learned a lot working with URS as I maintain our SharePoint Servers, Data Link servers, RHEL servers and Map Servers.  My co-workers make the job enjoyable and are easy to work with.

Overall a great company choice for any career."

I learned an up close perspective of the new Army provisioning system and database LMP. The management team /company is great but on this contract, we are a sub to another company and I am not comfortable/appreciate the relationship. My co-workers are old professionals that know the inside and out. The hardest part of the job is working as a sub to another company that could learn a lot about teaming. The most enjoyable part of the job was being an important component of the US Army's mission accomplishment."
good,"The work Schedule is flexible. Since the work involves multi-faceted domains so there is always scope to learn new things. Since the projects involves dealing with different levels of client, value addition is required at every level and hence can fine tune the design at every stage. There is Team work and gets support from subordinates peers and bosses."
good,"This firm is not well know outside of professional circles, and it appears to prefer that. Expanding markets or changing course is difficult due to size of corporation.

One of my favourite days was with the environment sector as I was learning as discovering all the work an environments team has to do before building or knocking anything down. As my week went on I learnt about roads and buildings being put together and how much all of the background work is.

Management is very knowledgeable in the field and willing to resolve personal issues and problems. Everyone gets along very well and help each other when it come to accomplishment of the job. Hardest part of the job, is coming in very early, and having to work in the cold and hot weather. Most enjoyable is you build a very long friendly relationship with coworkers."

good,URS has been a great company to work for. I have worked here from 2001.
good,"Arrive at work have safety meeting, await for calls to be dispatched to record on daily log sheets. Lots of times you have to create jobs for yourself, because if you weren't certified(electrician/Hvac) you didn't have a set job distribution type program and if you had no calls that day you did whatever preventive maintenance you had to do if there were any. Management is new and learning. The hardest part of the job is having to create jobs and paperwork to match the newly introduced time management program. It was both enjoyable and somewhat awkward trying to do industrial maintenance under construction guidelines."

good,"If you want a career in Planning it  wishing to further your planning skills then AECOM in the UK should be avoided. From North to South of England they have to be the worst disoriented consultancy company when it’s comes to Planning and Project Controls. There’s no structure or form of guidance when it comes to planning. In fact the majority of project directors and managers don’t even know what planning is about who rely on senior planners!! To make matters worse, senior planners cover up there cracks who haven’t got a clue how to plan! It’s the blind leading the blind!! AECOM is an insult to human intelligence. My advice stay away!"

good,I began my career here and all the people have been friendly and I have learned and grown a lot in my career and as a person.

When you already know the job from your experience in the Navy then its like riding a bike. The hardest part of the job was showing up. Most enjoyable part was the travel.

good,"My day consists of documenting, transmitting, verifying, and retaining all phases of engineering drawings, evaluations, controlled and approved data for use in the field by design and field engineers; as well as entering and auditing all documents in our data base and Sharepoint.

good,I've personally grown and increased my knowledge of doing business with a worldwide corporate company. The training programs are logical and thought-out. Coming from a sales and marketing background to being in construction has opened up more possiblities for me to grow as a person and build on my career experience. The hardest part of the job has been doing more with less staff; running a 100 miles a minute isn't unusal. The most enjoyable part of this job has been to be apart of history in the making by daily watching a historical building go from the ground up... something my great-grandchildren will know I was apart of someday... It's awesome!
good,Diverse company. Great employees and benefits. Every day was a new challenge!
good,wonderful place to work for just when things got slow things happen such as release from employment

The management is driven and therefore encourage the employee force to be as driven in our mission. My co-workers are professional and encourage each other to work at our highest level of professionalism. The hardest part of the job is the rotating 12 hour shifts, I have been working them for 18 years. I love sense of family within my crew and enjoy all the competion with which we work to engourage the highest production we can achieve."

My job took me all over California, parts of Nevada, and one year in Hawaii with the opportunity to work on many ""High-Profile"" projects in each state. I learned my responsibilities well and earned the respect of my managers and co-workers as well as the contractors whose work I inspected. I enjoyed my job tremendously because I was completely confident in my knowledge and ability to perform whatever came my way. If I had not been trained in something, my manager would take the time and expense to get me that training. I enjoyed the great variety of projects and the fact that I was on the go all the time. We were so busy they let me work all the hours I wanted and that was my biggest mistake."
good,working in this company gave me experience and it was a great place to work. co-workers always there for any type of help

good,I really enjoyed the overtime. We would report to work at 0630 and secure the work day at 1730 thruough out the week then 0630 - 1200 on Saturday and off on Sundays. The work environment was typical. Nothing exeptional either way.

good,"AECOM Technology Corp provided me with the opportunity to hone my craft and profession as an Executive Assistant. I was able to wok in a variety of departments ranging from Engineering to Business Development. This allowed me to manage and maintain production budgets for major events, conventions, exhibitions and conferences."
good,If you have military experience then it is an easy adjustment to work with those fellow veterans. If you do not have military back ground then it is a harder adjustment to learn the proper skills necessary to get the job done. Dealing with military is not easy if you are a civilian and takes patience.
good,"I currently work at AECOM, and truly enjoy working with everyone in the Portland Office.  My day is usually spent assisting the Project Managers, and providing office administrative support"
good,"great job with all kinds of new crane work both on land and in the wet "

good,"Good organization, have good opportunities to show your capabilities."
good,"Good company to work for but mismanaged at middle level. I was part of an aquisition of a former employer. Did not provide support needed for executing work required. Most co-workers were great and responsible, but a few were not dependable. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management, the client and their different expectations. Responsibilites, resources and expectations changed frequently. The most enjoyable part of the job was winning the contract for the work estimated."

good,"A typical day is 10 to 12 hours with several meetings driving long distances to meet applicants and describe the grant process and gather information; return to the Joint Field Office to update the FEMA data base with meeting results and work on Project Worksheets. FEMA has often provided work space with poor heating or airconditioning. The computers and other equipment provided are often defective or outdated. The last used Projects worksheets were a combination of Oracle based data base with information imported from Excel and Word. I have worked in 8 states for FEMA and 4 Regions. The management styles in the various regions and deployments have been variable that require flexible adaptation. The learning curve to adapt to new equipment, software and management styles has to be quick to produce Grants for infrastructure repair or replacement. The end result is the best part of the job, seeing my assigned applicants receive funding to get their community back to normal."
good,"I had the privilege to work with some fantastic and talented individuals in culturally diverse environments in AECOM. "
good,"Great place to work, good environment, good co-workers"
good,"Consistent schedule, guaranteed hours."
good,"Aecom is a good company to work for but there does seem to be a disconnect between lower level employees and management. Direct supervisor are there and are available to assist with any issues. Now when it comes to managers, they need some work. They could also use a better training program, we truly don’t have one. When you get hired they will give you an orientation and try to touch base on certain topics. Now the topics are discussed before even getting to the software. Once orientation is completed then you start some hands on training. Unfortunately since there seems to be no care on a try training program they sit you with anyone. Not everyone is suited to train and you truly don’t learn much until on your own."
good,"Nice company to work , with good set technical people .Great knowledge gaining was an added advantage.Learned lots of technical design experience , picked up management skills."
good,Professional environment a lot of hard work goes into being an employee here. Is very fast paced in the hard work feels like you accomplished a lot so it definitely pays off in the long run.
good,World wide footprint and with unlimited opportunities.  Recently acquired a Californian construction firm and are experiencing minor layoffs in the construction group.  Post integration should be back to business as usual.
good,"I worked at AECOM for just over a year as a contractor on a government site. I rarely had any interaction with my management so my annual review, while favorable, had no merit. ."
good,"On a typical day there are many things to do in my position.  The Senior PMs are all helpful. The daily walk through of the site allows me to stay in the loop about how the project is progressing.  I am constantly learning and there is never a dull moment at work.  My team work really well together, its like we are a family.   Plenty of room to grow within the company."
good,"Mixed culture Organisation and Good Atmosphere to work."
good,"A typical day in an AECOM overseas project office starts with tight security check, and finger print attendance. I learned an effective way of formal communication in the main office. I liked my co-workers, and our Chief of Party was a great guy."
good,"I loved the URS Corporation team. Everyone was organized, friendly and professional. The Business Manager (then HR specialist) always thoroughly explained tasks to me that I didn't understand in a comprehensible way. She used jargon that I understood.  And I loved my boss.  He was always encouraging and I received great evaluation reviews from him. "
good,I have a great working relationship with my management and love the jobs that I am currently doing. I am provided with expanding my job details to Time Collection and learning more about that system.
good,"Processing vendor invoices daily, voucher corrections daily.  Got along with everybody.  We are all friends, we laugh but still get our work done.   The ideal supervisor."
good,"Having experience in qa/qc in runway,apron,taxilane,isolation bay etc"
good,The swinging shifts here are very bad for your health but day shift hours were great.  Most things here were great except for management tended to not be employee friendly and the job was an ending job so we worked ourselves out of a job.
good,"Great place for Professional Development"
good,"URS, now a part of AECOM is a great company.  I enjoy working with the people and I would continue to work there is the need for an architect continues.  Unfortunately, the company is mainly an engineering company and the architectural work is limited."
good,"Enjoyed the work I did, the people I worked with and the supervisors and managers I directly work for."

good,"Staff meeting to see what was scheduled for the day."

good,"Working for big business for other big business interesting field but the pay was poor, travel alot and not rewarded for what you do."
good,The people that worked for me are awsome. Enjoyed traing new Navy pilots for the fleet and traing younger technicians
good,URS is a good place to work with many knowledgeable people to learn and get good guidance from. At times the management of contracts can be very daunting and since the company is primarily a service provider the loss of a single contract can be detrimental to your career.
good,"This project required detailed contract reviews for the extensive lifecycle project proposal. I assisted with the reviews,and it was a challenge to all of the contract parts in propective, and meet the needs of the customer."
good,Enjoyed working at URS. Very laid back good balance. Learned a lot from other engineers. Everyone was very helpful and polite great workers and work ethic.
good,Great work culture over there. Environment and job security is good. Safety is primary measure in all activity. In short Aecom is a good company i feel at present as a current employee.
good,This was only a work experience opportunity therefore I am not able to give a complete review of the workplace or its environment. It was very interesting to see the different departments and transportation sectors and the projects they are working on.
good,Great company to work for! Program Manager very attentive to the employees needs. I have been with the company for 3 years. Only suggestion would be to provide raises!
good,"You can learn alot and grow with the company if you are interested. The only downside i didn't like is, there can be alot of traveling away from family so if you are a road warrior then it can work for u."
good,I feel we could do better but the leadership is risk averse.  We also don't approach small projects.  We wait for the perfect project that suits all our risk and financial needs and subsequently many people get laid off.
good,"With a company this size you turn into a number and there never seemed to be a lot of coversation of advancement.  I asked multi times over the course of four years working there and it never got brought up once.  And beware when you get hired on, don't expect much in the way of raises, they are pretty nominal."
good,Good company but was not straight forward with letting employees know of what was going on. IBM took over IT Services without anyone knowing and a lot of people lost their jobs.
good,"Great facility in Denver Tech. Center. New building to AECOM, it has a lot of meeting rooms, work out space, and cafeteria for employees."
good,I operate various types of heavy machinery and enjoy what I do and the people I work with. I drive army based tactical vehicles and tow the un-drivable vehicles around the depot the various needed locations.
good,"At the time i was working for URS energy now AECOM.  They kept me busy with challenging tasks that helped me along with my electrical apprenticeship. Management could use some help, if you weren't part of their inner circle, you suffered."
good,Went out and reviewed the roads and tollways on a daily basis. Interacted with other interns when completing a task. Use a lot of microsoft office during the work week.
good,"happy with corporate , they just were not willing to replace people who would not do minimum work ,only worked on one contract with them ."
good,Overall I enjoyed working for URS and appreciate all I learned during my time there. It was a fast paced environment.
good,"Fast pace"
good,Typical work day is sitting a console turning cameras or cars driving by. Even when you turn the cameras the way they want you to they come up with another crazy number. It is not so bad during rush hour but overnight it gets very slow and there is no leave way for it either.
good,"working hours relates in military hours. There are many good people who are willing to help. The management is alright. Most of employees are military veteran. The hardest part of the job is to be on time. The most enjoyable would be the people you work with,"
good,good working everyone worked together as a team.everyone knew what they need to do.
good,"1. Worked at late night."
good,"AECOM is a leader consultant in program management and I am glad to be part of this company member who develop one of the mega project in the region "

good,Great place to work with good people. Learning new stuff daily. Supervision works with the workers not against them. Team orientation philosophy on the work staff.
good,"Great company to work for if you don’t mine contract work, most of the contracts are at least one year long which isn’t enough time to get settled in with a family"
good,"Management was helpful. I enjoyed assisting service members with the shipment of their household goods. Aside from a little office conflict between some of the employees, I enjoyed my time with this employer."
good,Pretty great. Can not complain about being involved in exciting work. I enjoy the work I do and the people I do it with. Could hire more great people to balance out work load.
good,It was wonderful working there right out of college. I would like to not have to do so much drafting for work. I am locked in at the rate I started with with a 3% raise per year :/ which is not cool.
good,"I have come out learning something new in every job; the debits and credits don't change but I enjoyed being surrounded by people who bring all aspects of human experience and experties to challenge me."
good,Good people to work with. Paid for travel time. Worked long days. Some variety in the work so it made it interesting. Never knew when you were going to be called to work or when you would be off. Hard to plan around.
good,i would rebiled a engine and polish cranks cams rebild heads turn cranks and rebiled tank engine i would work 8 to 10 hours a day and keep 12 men with parts so they could put there engines together there was a time frame to be done so i did what i had to do
good,"Worked for Aecom for 3 years and learned lots of various different aspects of my trade I.E Residential, Commercial, Industrial you get to try all of them out!"
good,Was once a small family oriented company has grown to be the largest A&E firm in the world. I liked the small company but is also good that the company has grown.
good,A typical day would be to come into the office turn on my computer.  Check email.  Check phone Messages. Return emails and phone calls.  Scan documents.  Make workbooks.  Make travel arrangements.  Work on special projects.  Do expense reports and time sheets.  It was a part time job that paid $19.68 an hour and I was given a lot of freedom to work independently.  I was also given a learning curve and any help I needed was always just a call away.  Breaks are 30 minutes a day and Lunch is 1 hour.  It is important to be on time and keep your lunch time to an exact 1 hour.
good,Ive gained knowledge and handle a lot of projects with AECOM. Handle big projects which is viewed as the pride of the United Arab Emirates. Overall a very good place to work in.

good,"everyone was kind and eager to help as well has seemingly happy at the workplace. learned a lot and made many connections, was invited back for the next summer."
good,"I worked as a Piping Engineer Intern during my sophomore and junior years of college. Being a large business, URS Corporation had its pros as well as cons. What I liked about URS was its pay as well as opportunity for growth, and the ability to work in teams on various projects. The main con of working for URS was its job security. Being a contracting company, there wasn't great job security. I would actually prefer to work for a small business."

I learned to use Share Point, and to read and understand the task order RFP and contracts, and prepare deliverables. The management was professional and serious. I enjoyed my co workers but nothing was done to promote team building. The most difficult part of the job was watching the back log or inventory of work disappear. Our cost center depended completely on Air Force contracts so not having enough to do was the hardest part.  The most enjoyable part of my job was planning partnering sessions between clients and URS. "

good,"you have your good and bad days. but if you stay busy you will be fine. don't get caught up in the drama, and stick to yourself. There is many good opportunities to learn new things that you would never be able to do outside of aecom."

In May 2016 AECOM lost the contract which meant I had to either work for the new company at a lower paid title or resign, I chose to stay with AECOM and was offered a job at another location. AECOM is a great company to work for and the jobs are everywhere if one decides to relocate."

Aecom is a huge company with good management, and a good work environment. I have meet many good friends in my seven years experience with them. I learned a lot about coming together as a team to meet a common goal. A typical day at red river army depot would be fast paced, time goes by very quickly and a challenging yet rewarding day. Everyday and every truck is different so you must be quick witted!"
good,"I enjoyed the management as well as the fellow employees at AECOM Inc. Communication between employers and employees was very smooth and efficient. And the company benefits were also very generous."
good,"Resident Engineer and Regional Director are very supportive to the team and treats everybody with all due respect.

good,I have been very fortunate to work at AECOM. My managers are wonderful people and I have enjoyed working for both of them. I have been challenged and appreciated and the most difficult thing I have to do is leave. Unfortunately we merged with another company and the restructure is forcing people out. I will miss both of my managers greatly.

My responsibilities are to maintain all documentation for all Projects. Daily Reports and Daily Hazard Reports and Injury Reports are sent to me daily. I am responsible to archive this data, which is use in a monthly report for the President's Report. Also setting up meetings for the Chief of Quality & Safety in which I have to contact other Administrative Assistants and all parties who have to participate in these meetings and arrange the appropriate time for everyone. A monthly report is generated for the analysis for the amount of Lost Time Injury (LTA) and Recordable (REC) for each Project. These charts show the rating for LTA and REC which have to meet the BLS National Standard. The management here is great. They respect you and help you to grow in the areas needed. I have learned a lot working in this position. I am able to multitask; the importance of having the information ready on time; being a team player; and I need little to none supervision once a task is explained and given to me. The hardest part of my job is waiting for the information to be sent to me. Because sometime I have to wait for the data to complete my part of the report. The most enjoyable part of the job is the work atmosphere, which is friendly, quiet and no unnecessary pressure from coworkers. Which allows me to perform my job everyday with a pleasant attitude."

The environment at URS focuses on exploring the diversity and potential of each employee. URS provides quality solutions that meets customer requirements while providing a well-balanced work-life philosophy.
good,Great work enviroment. Is hands down the safest company I have ever been employed with. Managment has bent over backward in their attempt to find me employment within the company. My only complaint is that Govt. Contracts are subject to budget cuts.

good,"I really loved working here and never would have quit. As it happens with contract work sometimes it just didn't last forever. That's how it goes. I learned new things every day and I really like my team and the people we support. My management has been great with me and has taught me new things every day with a willingness to do so to see their employees succeed. The toughest part of the job is accountability, which is everything, but everyone rises to that challenge and it makes it much easier. The most enjoyable part of the job is the environment that coworkers and managers create together. I've never had a job quite like it. I'm sad to see it go."

good,"AECOM was the best employer I worked for, as I was responsilbe for 75 projects in the North Eastern region of Libya. I would go to the office every morning with a great deal of excitement and enthusiasm, knowing that something new is just round the corner. Everyday we had one of 75 contractors in our main office meeting rooms, Programme Managers came up to me with a planning or scheduling ""adventure"" on a daily basis ""literally"", we visited different places, with different project types, and both the contractors and construction supervisor were from different cultures and backgrounds, and what was very exciting is that we had them in one place.

good,"As a junior engineer I was often required to perform numerous calculations for energy efficiency on MS Excel. Many conversations and meetings were held between clients and project affiliates to be able to analyse the best interests of all the parties involved within the project. I was able to understand the financial implication of wanting more apartment space in a residential building project, the more square metres we could make available as Engineers the more money the client could make from rent. Represented AECOM as a mentor for work experience students Attended numerous continual professional development lunch seminars at AECOM to expand on my knowledge on the industry as well as increase my commercial awareness and meet potential clients.
