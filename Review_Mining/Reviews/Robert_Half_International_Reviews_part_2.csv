Professional, succinct, and with excellent communication skills. I am grateful for the many opportunities they provided. I was always paid fairly and honestly and on time via electronic timesheet systems that work. Any percentage they deducted was ethical and honest and I am happy to pay them what they are rightfully owed in the world of professional temporary consulting. The group in Palo Alto and the incredible team in San Ramon are worth every dollar.  Many may laugh at this aspect of the business, but I can assure you, getting prime entrée into many exclusive firms and institutions in the Bay Area is a bit harder than it seems; a Robert Half assignment can sometimes be the Golden Ticket to getting your foot in the door. If not, you have the opportunity to breathe rarified air and soak in the culture of corporations few will ever experience, but that so many desire.  Sometimes I think we should be paying them."
