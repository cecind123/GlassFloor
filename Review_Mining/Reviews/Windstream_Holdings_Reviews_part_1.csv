rating,review
bad,I was in the Windstream call center. It was not a good experience. Windstream workload and demands set on their employees were totally out of scope. The customers suffered from Windstream's lack of understanding on how to balance workloads. I would not recommend anyone applying for a call center position at Windstream.
bad,Company had no strategic direction and ran the business into Bankruptcy. Letting go some very talented employees. It amazes me how the BOD allowed this to happen
bad,Don’t go to work here unless you’re desperate for a job. There is no future working for this company. No raises. Promotions only if you know the right people. Constant layoffs.
bad,Everyone is leaving. Upper management has no idea what they are doing. Which is why they are bankrupt. My team was really good. Everyone worked hard and worked well together.
bad,"Windstream bought the old company I worked at, windstream was in financial trouble and was not given a chance to stay on with them. Was let go with a fair severance."
bad,I have been in call centers for 15 years my first question when my turn at the interview was will I have a sales quota? I was told no and that wasn't true. no transparency and frequent metric changes prevent making any money. No PTO.
bad,"Leadership is horrible and so are the employees!! Please be aware of the niceness, willing to help and after work conversations you have with your teammates!!! Dont be fooled!"
bad,"The corporate management here is awful. Local management is ok sometimes. Work week can get up to 70+ hours, mandatory. They threaten write ups if you don't comply with it. The work is stressful and you don't get paid what you should for doing the work. I do not recommend working for this awful company."
bad,"Not enough one on one"
bad,Th ed area I worked in florida was ran by very bad management that did work in the field and ne vfc re updated printd or there cadd system was ran by olb construction had no ideal as to how and do the complete job I have seen that so many times in th he telecom field just because your spending the monies does not mean the job is complete
bad,"I have so much to say but to sum it up this place is a complete hostile work environment on steriods! I was held in a closet, stalked in the parking lot, harassed by a manager....I still suffer from PTSD from the working conditions.   I wish  there was something I could do"
bad,"It is painful to wake up each day and know that I have to work another day at Windstream.  The area VP is in over his head and is downright rude and condescending to everyone else at the company.  Everyone absolutely hates working for this clown, but his boss is just as big of an idiot by promoting him in the first place.  Sales are down significantly and there is no way that this company can survive their current bankruptcy.  I don't know of a single rep in the region that is not actively looking for a new job.  This is the worst company in the industry and perhaps in the entire country!"
bad,"Management is ineffectual and inefficient.  Time off requests are processed by a third party, with no interest in the employee's well being.  Compensation is inappropriate for duties.  Stubborn insistence on using outdated, record keeping and update systems. Fear of automation boarders on cultish."
bad,"There were about 100 people working out of our building.  I can promise you that every single person in that building hated their job.  I had a work load that would have taken about 10 people to complete in a reasonable time frame.  And I wasn't alone. This was happening to everybody.  Then they just kept cutting more more people and just got worse and worse.  "
bad,"Had to pay HR rep in Twinsburg Oh $500 for a job. paid and was hired without anymore interviews, waived the drug screen and background check,  kind of regret paying for a job, but with a criminal record I had no choice"
bad,"Poor management, no accountability, bad behavior is rewarded. Deadweight has steady employment while hard workers are let go. If your manager likes you you are golden."
bad,"Their was no room for growth, The supervisor barely came out of the office to speak to you. It was micro managed and you were not treated with respect."
bad,"Constantly changing commission structure even in the middle of month and never to the advantage of the employee, long hours, poor upper management, no raises, no consistency and not everyone is treated equal, the only positive about this company is your co-workers are awesome"
bad,this was mainly a sales job. focused more on trying to get customers to stay with the company and buy more products. expectations were unrealistic and the force to make quotas was not something i wanted to continue doing.
bad,"If you can spew out robotic answers in an unscripted way and can be micromanaged and be ok with it, this is the job for you.Hours are set, your calls are monitored you have time limits on how much time you can talk and establish a relationship. It is encouraged to send thank you notes, but no time is given to do this."
bad,"Windstream has constant lay offs.   The company is not managed well.   The benefits and compensations are not industry standard.    "
bad,I knew more than my managers who were glorified PMPs non IT. They ran the department like a call center and did not understand the need for a quality interaction that would actually resolve the issue at hand.
bad,"As a contractor for Windstream, they were ruthless and uncaring, as well as did not pay well for the types of position they were hiring for."
bad,They claim to be a family. Management comes from less respectable call centers and enforce those terrible values on Windstream. Hours were 10-7 which is smack in the middle of the day. Staggered days off. Unrealistic sales goals. Poor training.
bad,"Management and the benefits are about as bad, if not worse, than the services they offer. Medical benefits are practically non-existent, it consists of a high-deductible plan which means you would be paying thousands out of pocket before coverage even starts."
bad,"Worked for a while in their Evansville, IN, NOC."
bad,"There were many agents who were given special treatment just because they were in good with certain managers. I was in a situation in which I was an abused spouse and even though I approached HR, approached my manager for any help or assistance that the company might give me, after working there a year they decided to let me go. I wouldn't wish working there on my worst enemy."
bad,"Company had many challenges. They couldn't install services in a timely manner. The majority of commission payment was based on Install. Hence tremendous commission issues. Management did not care their answer was ""overlook the issues and just sell""."
bad,High layoff rate. If you are looking for stability then this might not be the best company to work for. Compensation/Pay rate could be better as well.
bad,"Not a good place to work"
bad,says one think and does another often will blind side employees with misleading information. over a difficult place to work with any job security. leaving employees wanting other jobs.
bad,"Less than a month of hiring me they had already dissolved my specialized position and put me in a call center. Chained to my desk, scrutinized any moment that wasn't spent available on the phone. 100+ phone calls a day weren't unheard of dealing with people just as miserable as you. On top of the phone calls you have to program customer orders into the internet and phone systems that hardly work(programmed by the cheapest Indian sources available). If the calls are too severe that day and you don't have the time to touch an order, you're rewarded for your efforts by compelled to stay late until the work is complete. This could take 30 minutes, or it could take 3 hours. Every day was an effort in futility as you move the same number back and forth between the same two systems for absolutely no reason at all. When I started we had 20+ people, over two years they whittled it down to 10. Trying to do ""more with less"", they say. Insurance premium would have been more than 10% of my wages. I could have dealt with that if there were any benefits to it at all before a $6,000 deductible was met. Even after the deductible the coverage was minimal at 20-40% for a lot of things. If all this isn't bad enough you have management breathing down your throat, absolutely obsessed with meaningless ""metrics"" meant to gauge your performance. You can't even make a two minute call at your desk to your family to check up in case of an emergency without being reprimanded. On more than one occasion my boss hadn't updated the schedule and let me drive all the way in just to tell me I don't work that day."
bad,"Poor Management - no direction.  Constant layoffs, no job security, employees being promoted by who they know and not by skill or experience.  No confidentiality, Upper Management detached from their front line managers and floor technicians.  Low morale.  Doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results - the definition of insanity."
bad,I have been apart of 4 layoffs at Windstream. This makes for a very hostile environment and it kills the morale of the company. Windstream does not care about their employees.
bad,"Not Often.  We had a wage freeze last year,  but executive received their bonuses while salaried received a freeze.  The company does not care if the employees that they say they appreciate so much are able to pay their mortgages or not.  Take care of their families or not."
bad,"not a good place to work period"
bad,"Not paying enough to fix bad management mistakes.  After spending many extras hours to meet unrealistic expectations, I fixed or assisted in fixing many network problems.  I've achieved the MEF certification, and no pay increase, no promotion, nothing.  Just more unrealistic expectations to fulfill."
bad,"the Iowa jobs pay well for entry level around 15$ to start.   however, you are stuck in that role no real chances to move around and 1% yearly raises.   Most people that work there are happy"
bad,Very toxic place to work. It was like working in a high school full of adults acting like children. Very clicky. Very micromanaged down to the sec you get into work and the sec you leave it was horrible.  I lasted 1.5 years and I left couldn't handle working with adult children.  Someone always trying to throw someone else under the bus. Totally Ridiculous. I wouldn't work there again if it was the last place to work ever.
bad,"The 2017 fiscal year will be heavily scrutinized as the company absorbed Earthlink, showing positive on the financial statements, however the overall outlook in 2018 seems a bit dire."
bad,"Awful benefits. Management even worse. Stay away -- they are headed to bankruptcy. The 2018 benefits look a bit better, but otherwise prepare to pay most of your paycheck in benefits if you have a family."
bad,"Constant process changes"
bad,My time working at Windstream was not pleasant! I went into the postition very enthusiastic & excited for the position i was going to be working only to be belittled & made feel less than appreciated by management. i feel i was treated very badly & reported this to several peers who all felt the same. Management was horrible. they don't appreciate their job.
bad,Outsourced jobs because it was a cheap company. Almost 200 people lost their jobs over a few months and hundreds more over the next year. They did not care that the outsource effected so many families lives. When you are a single income it really hurts when they tell you this in 1 month before you are no longer going yo have a job. I would suggest no one apply or work there because it is not a stable job and the environment is not very good
bad,slow to no work management unqualified windstream does not care about their employees.  No raise for the last 10yrs every year they are taking benefits away from employees while mgmt receives bonuses and better benefits.
bad,"No time off 7 days a week, great pay, but no room  for growing.  Very old technology.  If you you really need a job go for it.  The insurance is a joke."
bad,Windstream LLC is a combination of numerous companies combined under one corporate management team. The company has failed to integrate and organize the company into an effective operation delivering excellent and reliable products / services to customers while maintaining a decent investment return for investors. Windstream offers numerous products and services to customers while providing poor quality and unreliable customer service.
bad,Company starts off with low pay. Must meet monthly sales goals. Must adhere to schedules breaks and lunches.No promotion within the first year of service
bad,Very stressful not customer serving not willing to structure support groups to better serve the customer! Training was very poorly administered. My first 4 managers I worked with at the company were very good at managing and comfortable in technical situations. My last two managers they were totally clueless on managing and even more lost in the technical world. In Windstream some people get positions not on their ability but more about who they are friends with.
bad,A typical work day consists of working escalated orders due to internal department delays. I have the learned the Project Coordinator must Project Manage their assigned orders. Management does not help with assisting on escalations. The work place culture is very stressful due to the PC is held accountable for all facets of the order which is the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part is having a successful turn up with the customer.
bad,"Worked for Windstream in operations support for just under 3 years. Worked under several different managers in a very short span of time. Was consistently responsible for several different reports for basically the same reason, all of which were redundant and were supposed to be geared toward some sort of long term plan to reduce install intervals. Very little actionable results ever came of any reports I completed when I did work there. "
bad,"Can't trust management.  Unprofessional in how they treat people.  It never fails, the brown nosers who kiss up to management always gets promoted.  Hardworking workers never get promoted. Get overlooked. Looking for another job. Would not recommend working for this company.  This is the reason why they are always hiring.  they are always hiring, that means that this company can't keep steady good employees-they all leave for a better company to work for.  if you get hired, you will always be working with a bunch of unprofessional people."
bad,"this company buys several smaller companies, making the sales associates compete with similar products in the same vertical. This is a data/network driven company, if you are on the voice side (UC/CC) you are the red headed step child, this is very unproductive."
bad,"VP level management refuses to focus on actual problems facing the company and provide no real support."
bad,"This is the most dishonest company that I have ever seen.  I left the company because I didn't agree with lying to customers and ""do whatever it takes"" to get a sale.  It's ironic that they call the position customer service, but that is far from the truth.  The majority of the management is a joke.  I worked in the telephony industry for over 10 years and would not recommend my worst enemy to work at this place.  There is nothing like going from working for a good company (Iowa Telecom) for 10 years and that company being sold to the worst company (Windstream).  You are not recognized by name here, you are just a number.  Gotta love that corporate world. You mean nothing to them.  If you have anything higher than a GED, do not work here."
bad,"The work I performed is not the problem there and I like what I did work wise. I have never worked for a company that is this hostile and toxic as far as the work environment. For a telecommunication company, there is no communication whatsoever. I have personally observed managers throw their entire team ""under the bus."" The only good part about this place is their employees who are so devoted and talented. It's sad to see these talented folks micro-managed and treated unfairly. The turnover rate in Greenville is high. We have filled out employee surveys and nothing has happened despite all the promises made. Our health benefits were good until last year. Many employees are looking for another job."
bad,Turnover rate is something like 80% management is cutthroat they value sales over people. Their health insurance sucks it is awful! They find ways to get rid of hard working employees watch out for HR they make up stuff. Horrible management Horrible place to work I do not suggest this evil evil place they are pure evil
bad,nothing good to note here as the corp culture and support are non-existent. mass exodus currently happening to all business units
bad,"Had to watch your back from start to finish.  Always someone looking to pull you down the ladder. (what ladder there was)  Mentality of grade school, no support from upper management, process and procedures are a joke.  Clerical work placed on salespeople. Clerks that have no idea how to run a company ...running the company.  No support people any more - WS saw to that,  earn under $40K, and useless, and you can work at WS.  this company is falling apart- from the inside- here today - gone tomorrow..."
bad,"Windstream by far is one of the worst jobs I have ever had.  In terms of management, processes and organization "
bad,You don't want to work here in this department.  No defined processes.  The way job responsibilities are dolled out between work groups changes weekly.  Moreover they change without notification or warning.  Standards that you are supposed to engineer to change every month.
bad,"Wind stream is a company whose main focus is SALES. This company does not care about its employees or customers. The service at wind stream is horrible and over priced. As a account manager you have to meet a 2500 quota every month, deal with recent unsatisfied customers, engage on conference calls, meetings and with engineers all while selling 2500 worth of products and keeping current wind stream customers happy. You are given a account base but that doesn't mean anything most of the people in your base have issues and even though your name is on the account and that is YOUR customer other wind stream employees can still sell to your customer and make money off of them! My manager at wind stream was unqualified for his position he was a white Caucasian male who showed favoritism and worked his way through the company because he had ""connections"" He never knew what he was doing and would always need the help of his team to get anything done. I would have one on ones with this man almost every week and every week he lied to me. Your job at wind stream is not promise you don't sell you don't have a job doesn't matter what you are going through your mom can die and they will still expect you to come to work and meet your quota.Please do not consider working here."
bad,"During my 5 year span at this company, we had our bonuses cut, our commissions slashed & our incentives downsized from flat screen televisions to half priced slushies from sonic, (which in and of itself was ironic due to the obesity issue that plagued the office & our mandatory enrollment in the company ""wellness program""). Then, management attempted to double our workload & alter our job descriptions with no increase in pay. All while having multiple gubernatorial state investigations held against the company for fraud. At least one of these investigations resulted in the company paying out $600,000.00 to the state of Georgia to ""end  the investigation"" according to the local newspaper. Nobody was able to account as to where that money went, but it did not go back to the customers. Ethically questionable management to say the least."
bad,they don't value their customers and only want sales. from the top down this is a terrible company who just don't care.
bad,Company with little to no future.  A few people at the top get paid a lot and the rest of the folks work very hard to make them look good.  Declining industry and poor management.  Favoritism abounds.
bad,"hours are alright, nice co workers, on the phone all day sell, sell, sell. Supervisors do not like to communicate with reps"
bad,"This was the worst company I have ever worked for.  I lost faith in the products I was selling due to making sales and the companies inability to implement what I sold.  In addition to Management was unprofessional, non supportive, motivating nor competent and not only participated in constant Human Resource violations but encouraged them with some of his favorite employees.."
bad,"This Company is the most unprofessional "
bad,ok place to work if you can handle poor management and high stress
bad,Nothing good to say about Windstream. Management was awful lots of hours.
bad,We were taken over by this company and after that nothing went smoothly. 
bad,Management didn't recognize the talents of their employees and utilize them to their advantage
bad,This is a stepping stone job that is constantly changing. You are required to work your tickets and be the call center for all inquiries and opening new tickets.
bad,"Management are clueless and they're always training you and not providing raises. Now, IF you do get a chance to get a raise. It's ONLY 1-3 %. Better believe the CEO owns a house in France and he's always posting pics from there on the company site and the 5 people that's under him got big fat raises."
bad,"This was one of the worst companies I've ever worked for. Not only is their management pathetic without any clear focus on how to make money, but they made seriously stupid decisions that made it impossible to make customers happy, like firing field technicians that were to install services, but were overworked and had bad attitudes, not owning the problems and passing the buck until the customer's demanded action that management really could care less about. Sales managers were also pathetic by only clinging to how are you going to make your quota this month, since they were scrambling to make financial ends meet, and eventually filed for bankruptcy.  Very dark, negative place to work."
bad,This company is built for upper management and corporate shareholders to gorge on.  They will lay off and try to contract you back at cheaper rates if not outright outsourced to India which is their preference.  They do not seem to care about their employees or customers.
bad,"I had a horrible experience in my one year working at Windstream Communications and reported into a manager that not only allowed the toxic and immoral culture, he nurtured it.  I reported observing harassment and receiving harassment and nothing was done to rectify the situation."
bad,"Windstream use to be a fun place to work, management seemed to care about you and your family, but buyouts of other companies has changed the culture. Management is not trustworthy and employee's tend to not believe anything they say or do. Employee's want to be treated with respect and not treated like they are in elementary. If you are late, you are to call Exceptions to make them aware so that your manager can give you a point. If this was a habitual habit, I would certainly understand, but for those that are consistently  on time and the one time traffic or something made them late, they should not be penalized. I would like for management to treat their employees how they themselves want to be treated. I very rarely have seen my manager or other managers that are consistently on time, they pretty much come and go as they please. Moving up or to other positions within Windstream is only about favoritism and not by skill set. The pay is terrible for our skill set and all of the different systems we have to learn. I'm not generally a negative person and can get along with anyone, I believe in having good attendance and following instructions on what is needed, but the culture at Windstream has become one in which I no longer want to be a part of.  Parking has gotten ridiculous, I am paying over $500 a year in parking and the pay already is terrible. Insurance rates increase yearly and it doesn't get any better. Lastly, new for this year is signing up for vacation for 2019. Who already knows what vacation weeks and individual days they want for the next year already?"
bad,Started working for Windstream in Feb of 2017 left in Sept 2017. Pay was okay. Management sucked! They lied about the job being a sales job so everybody started to drop like flies.  Customer's complained about the service being horrible and how techs wouldn't show up for thier appointments plus promises were broken and I felt stressed out from all these complaints including my co-workers whiched cause our call center to close after a year and half because people quit when they couldn't take it anymore.
bad,WIndstream was poorly managed and did not understand the area of telecommunications that they were attempting to begin to involve themselves. Difficult management on a personal level
bad,"No work life balance,  if you dont rant high enough in stats your stuck with an evening shift or weekends. They will eventually train you for all products but not increase pay. Customers are always right and dont exspect your supervisor to assist much. They never want to take supervisor calls so you will have to de escalate the situation yourself. If your just looking for something to hod you over until something better comes along its ok but there is no long term advancement. Also if you 30 seconds past log in time from breaks, lunches etc it counts against you as being late"
bad,The Management door was always a revolving one. They tend to change out Senior mgmt every  years causing many difficulties. They also layoff allot of people.
bad,Constant layoffs and constant decrease in merit raise increases year by year and the continuing lack of job security with the company. Along with the constant responsibilities put on and required to do by the front line team to make the higher up level departments work loads nearly 50% less with a barely noticeable as well as continuing year by year raises and merit increases for the front line team.
bad,Management stuck in 1980 micromanagement.  Not open to ideas to cut time and improve work load.  All about numbers and are required to manipulate result to give them the numbers they want.
bad,Internal autonomous departments prevent project management from completing projects on schedule. Project engineers must educate untrained cross-functional department members on how to complete their tasks in order to bring the project to completion.
bad,"the work was fine but upper management only care how big their  paycheck and bonus are,"
bad,"Everything is reactive, nothing is proactive.   Raises have been 1% for the last 3 years.  Health insurance decreased, however you now have to pay the first 2k out of pocket, regardless.  That is if you have the highest benefit available for employee only."
bad,The company has no idea what it wants to be when it grows up. They have acquired a number of good assets but do not know how to integrate them. The company does not have the patience that is required when turning around a market and rebuilding it from ground up.
bad,"Windstream has the potential to be a great company to work for. However, they are still making slow progress towards this change."
bad,"I was hired with the promise of creating a new position to fix the issues being had with the multiple billing systems. What I wasn't told was that I was replacing 8 people that were being laid off and they were to train me. Management didn't know the job functions of these people and could not assist in laying guide lines and or structure to my position. "
bad,"Major outages on a daily basis. Treated poorly by managment, account managers, NOC techs.  High stress environment."
bad,Most corrupt company I have work for in 35 years. If this doesn't tell you what you need to know I don't know what does!!
bad,Windstream laid off entire groups of long-term employees and sent their jobs to India.
bad,"This is by far the worst company that I have ever worked for. During my time at Windstream the company acquired 6 other companies, which obviously had an affect on the culture. They micro manage you and want to track your every move by having to open outlook (emails) and your outlook calendar. They act like big brother over there, literally standing over your shoulders watching what you are doing."
bad,Windstream was designed to be a dividend generator for investors disguised as a technical organization.  Upper management are selected accordingly.  This experiment has been on a failing trend for a fairly long time.
bad,"They bought out EarthLink and we went back in time 10 years upper mgt is terrible, they don’t treat employees good, I was there for 21 years and was only let go because I made more money then most other techs"
bad,A train wreck of a place to work.   Management I clueless and coddle the non workers.  No job security due to bankruptcy.  Run from this company.  Horrible place
bad,"Windstream advertises for Full Time employment. Do not be fooled. It is actually Temporary Employment. They are only interested in you to work there 6 months. Then they regularly do a layoff of about 300 people including all of the people hired within the last period. Upper Management performs their cost analysis every 6 months and if the company is losing money compared with the last 6 months, they perform a company-wide purge. There isn't any formal training for you to learn their systems. The managers are located in another state in another office and track all the work you do remotely using spreadsheets. There is no personal interaction, because everyone who is left, tries to keep up with all of the accumulated work."
bad,"This company cares only about profits, not their employees.  That can't even do simple Telecommunications installs correctly let alone keep their network up."
bad,Upper Management was not interested in improving processes or considering input from managers.  Some longterm managers were hostile to others.  Customer service was not possible due to lack of attention to best practices.
bad,"The people at the company are some of the best I have had the pleasure of working with, however, the culture there is very stressful because it is very hard to accomplish goals due to the systems and different teams you have to work with. Most of the management struggles to motivate their team members and are hindered in their efforts to improve the work lives of their team by upper management. There is little opportunity for advancement and the pay and benefits are sub-standard for the industry. Windstream tries to pay you as little as they can and whatever rate you enter the company with is basically where you stay. I would not recommend this company as a place to work to anyone I know. They also have regular layoffs twice a year now it seems."
bad,"No vision, no accountability, always looking outside for change, poor culture.  HR executive provided the vision and it was a huge miss.  you cant brand your way to a culture, you need to live it, and they do not."
bad,Company doesn't care about its employees....only the all mighty buck.  They have no concern for treating employees fairly.  I worked there for 9 years....they continued to expect employees to spend 5-15 minutes per day working off the clock to take the time to get out-dated computers up and systems running every day before you clock in.  Not to mention you do not get paid for working any time after your shift unless you are there at least 7 or more minutes.  They continually found ways to keep employees from getting the commission that they had earned.  The Devil is probably a better employer
bad,Working at Windstream is just a job and a paycheck. There is little attempt in having a company culture. If you'd like to just sit at a cubicle for 8 hours a day then this might be a good fit for you.
bad,Thankful for the new area of experience acquired in the brief assignment I had. it consisted of Microsoft OfficemSuite OUtlook
bad,"Great salary but that is where it ends.  Very hostile environment with most co-workers looking to leave as soon as possible.  Management seems not to care about getting you your tools to accomplish the job they hired you for.  I originally was told that this would be a day job, working 4 10 hour days, but after nine weeks I was told it was going to be transferred to the grave yard shift.  They might bring me back to days if the mood strikes them.  I would warn anyone considering working here to look long and hard at any other option first."
bad,"A typical day at work consist of working with 90% of irate customers/LEC's, because of the products and services that were provided. I learned how to work closely with Field Techs to help provide a better service for their customers. Most managers have personal relationships and not really concerned about their employees. The hardest part of the job was having to let the customers down, and the most enjoyable part for me was getting their services restored."
bad,You will be promised the world and we will not be able to deliver.  Windstream constantly is laying personnel off and it makes working there very uncomfortable.  Management doesn't seem to know what type of corporate culture they want to foster.
bad,Workable space essential to the needs of small to medium sized business organizations
bad,"This company grew large but not organically . It is the result of many mergers & acquisitions , none fully integrated creating disorganization. Executive management is out of touch & takes no responsibility for the lawsuit defeat and subsequent bankruptcy. Employees are treated poorly in practice but well in theory . There is no wage increase without a promotion - and there are no promotions. This is official policy , not an opinion. Massive layoffs of good tenured people is commonplace"
bad,Windstream is an interim position that you take because you need a job. The managers don't like innovation or any new ideas to combat a stagnant culture.
bad,"At Windstream you will be one of many unless you are good at butt kissing or know someone who can do you a favor. The management stinks and does nothing to improve their employee morale. As long as their backs are patted, they have accomplished their goal for the day. I would not suggest working here under any circumstances."
bad,management needed to do a better job of communicating between departments. Laid off good works and management for own gain but it backfired. Upper management is changing business model and direction every other year and not translating results.
bad,We were given goals that were unattainable. The entire dept had to work overtime on an almost daily basis in order to meet the goals set for the department.
bad,I knew my first few weeks with the company I had made the wrong choice. I had to wait several weeks just to get a laptop and login so I could do training. I sat at my desk for weeks with nothing to do. I couldn’t train I couldn’t make sales calls. As time went on things got worse and worse. The company culture was stated openly as “we suck less” than the competition. Awful company to work for.
bad,"Well another non communication company that didn't train how to do the job, and didn't want to pay the techs for Paetec that they bought because they weren't into paying the money for work being done."
bad,"Biggest problem I had was management. They will sweeten you up and tell you that sales aren’t a big deal and that they will work with you if you fall behind, but they honestly don’t care about you. They have humiliated me over and over again in front of other care reps.  Over time I noticed that it was harder and harder to get sales because the stipulations for their core products change constantly, and most customers are upset because what you offered them and what they are paying for isn’t what they’re getting. Management  doesn’t understand that, they just care about numbers. Also, you better not get sick because they will fire you quick over you being out sick if you have too many “points”. Reps have been pleading with Windstream to change the point system to accommodate to sicknesses and emergencies, and management told me PERSONALLY that I could easily fake sick, so that’s why we get a point for being out if we don’t schedule to be sick 24 hrs in advance. I don’t think anyone can predict when they will be sick. Don’t do it. The pay may look wonderful but it’s not worth your health."
bad,"Just a beat you down company, taking all your personal time and making you feel privileged to be working there. My advise is find somewhere else to work."
bad,everything changed after almost my whole class quit.. from what i understand the goals now are actually reachable so that makes it not as stressful. but when i was there my manager rose would not help anyone but her favorites. they say family comes first but that was a lie.. my baby and i were in a wreck and i was basically fired due to missing work to get my child and my self healed after the accident
bad,"Do yourself a favor, don't get on a sinking ship. Management is incompetent, and anyone worth keeping gets better offers elsewhere. The company makes terrible decisions, almost as if it wants to be bought out, if not go under. They laid off about 100 people on a Wednesday due to ""lack of sales"", and then the next day on Thursday announced they were going to have a pizza party to celebrate us all being there."
bad,"Long hours, no raises, poor executive leadership, no vision for the future, and constant layoffs contribute to low morale. I've worked for several different telecoms and this one is the worst one that I've worked for. Find anywhere else to work!"
bad,This place just kept spending money on consultants and outside 'help' rather than listening to internal experts.  Everyone is a 'yes' man starting at the top down.  And then the people on the bottom have to try and figure out what the 'yes' man said.
bad,I retired 7/16/17 i had chance to retire so I did. The work was very stressful sometimes working 24 hours a day and even more. The the stress I’ve had being on call 24/7 got very old.
bad,Laid off after 33 years of service - was call during my vacation time off and asked to come clean out my desk that my position was being eliminated - very unprofessional
bad,"I would not recommend this job to anyone. The atmosphere is one of chaos, stress, and frustration with no good reason for it to be. Management is unpredictable and impulsive, contradicting in their actions and words daily. You are in a constant state of distrust and frustration."
bad,"I'll make this real easy, if your not in to kissing butt for a living don't work here. Worked here 15 years, very hard worker. Looked over each year for people who had the same eduaction as me, and way less years. Year to Year your never sure if your going to have a job."
bad,Being offered the job a windstream I was excited at first because I felt like I finally had a company that I would be able to have growth and accomplishments. Then I saw reality. I was advanced during my interview that I would not have to sell that much and selling was not a major part of the job. I was also told the the role was customer service more so then selling. that is totally not the case. the team sups and upper management push the point of making sells down your throat. They care more about sells then the actual customer or customer serv. And it not like windstream serv is so great. I can't even count on how many times a day a customer would call and complain about their serv is always out or that their internet would stop working in the middle of them doing something. But yet they wanted us to sell customers more stuff; if thats not backwards I dont know what is. I will never work for another company like this.
bad,"C level executives are out of touch with employees and think customers are suckers. NO job security with this company, the last lay offs were a week prior to Christmas. Declining revenues and increasing expenses so all they have that they can control in personnel cost. Terrible company"
bad,"Worked for this company when they were called Alltel. Once hired your sent to a customer service training class which was great. After you pass the class your sent on the floor and all heck breaks loose. Unrealistic selling goals of phone products. We had a slogan ""SALE SALE SALE DSL""! One time the customer service department manager got on the intercom and told everyone ""your not selling enough is taking food out of my kids mouths"". Extremely high turn over because no one wanted to work in that environment. Managers didn't care about employees and nothing mattered but numbers. I didn't think it could get much worse by it did. They brought in an independent company to try and get the company ""on track"". These people walked around to your desk and asked why we were on calls longer than 4 minutes, why we took so many bathroom breaks, why we didn't offer a product etc. I left a few weeks after that."
bad,I am seeking advancement and there were no opportunities available with Windstream. I want to be in marketing and there were no ops available for advancement in that area. The boss ran the office into the ground and then quit.
bad,Windstream sucks.  This is only a job that you should keep until you get a better job.
bad,Micro-managed even when your hitting your numbers. Atmosphere in the office was dismal.
bad,Windstream has bought out so many companies so fast that they have never integrated all the systems so they just throw money at their issues and yell at the employees to get the work done.
bad,"No open communication, No Leadership, shady company. Co workers were ok but they all felt the same way. Luckily the division shut down."
bad,Everything is being outsourced. Understand that IF you get a job here you WILL be laid off eventually. The company is either positioning itself to be sold or is severely struggling to stay in business. It may be both.
bad,"The absolute worst job I have ever had, management believes they are above the rest and they use intimidation and strong arm tactics. I would not let my neighbors cat work there and I don't like cats. be warned stay clear of this cancer"
bad,Well paid for my time there. Grateful for a long and extended employment. Worked with some outstanding people. It's a shame that greed ran a fortune 500 company into the ground
bad,My immediate boss is very good.  They work with me and help me be a better employee.  But the executives seem to more interested in getting raises and bonuses than in their employees.
bad,So busy buying other companies they forgot about the peons who keep everything going.  Haven't had a raise in two years and now they're outsourcing the entire IT organization to IBM.
bad,I should have read and reread the reviews before coming to work here.   I have been through 3 different managers each expecting different ways to do the same job.  Not trained as well as one should for this ever changing technology having a slid show training for an hour doesn’t explain how to sell this feature.   I was assured this was a great company never seen so much turn over on one department.    Micro management down to every second.
bad,....................................................Mismanaged company.  No career path.  Lower than industry compensation.  Layoffs every quarter.  .....
bad,"low stock, lay offs, 3 different directors in 6 months, no set training, corporate America environment, hardly any support or knowledge training. It was a very difficult environment to become successful in."
bad,All the directors cared about was their bonuses not the lively hood of the employees. They laid off 900 people just to get their bonuses. My manager was awesome but was laid off right after me which is crazy. They always changed stuff on you without warning and then after i left my entire team left due to bad management
bad,Pay is slow. Stress level is high. Hours are long. Lay offs are regular. Part of the issue is the industry itself. I would only take job there if you are out of other options.
bad,"* Customer orders frequently wrong and most Project Coordinators don't seem to want to help resolve issues."
bad,"Would not recommend due to increasing financial instability and poor management which has led to loss of customer base/revenue and therefore frequent layoffs and low morale.  Put the customer first, and give attention to employees, rather than propping up the executive level salaries.  It had been a good place to work, but now it's got such  low morale."
bad,"I worked there for 9 months, by the 4th one, youd see how the policy for attendance and the job task has you hating the position. One more thing I hated was adherences - you have to be in your adherence throughout the day, they even doc your restroom usage. Most of the supervisors were extremely great, mine - I wouldn't recommend. People walk in and out of this company because they do not treat their employees worth nothing."
bad,"This company survives in spite of itself.  Inexcusable number of service outages coupled with poor field support has done irreparable damage to the brand in the Atlanta market, making sales' job a near impossible task in a competitive environment."
bad,"I work at Windstream as a contractor. They promised the world upon hire but failed to deliver a single part of that promise."
bad,"When I first started in 2008, it was a good company to work for. However, as it grew, almost exclusively through acquisitions, the corporate culture became out of touch with the employees. Over my last 18 months working there, there were many rounds of layoffs, culling nearly every work group and department indiscriminately."
bad,"Management described as rigid. Favoritism and Discrimination practices allowed, Commissions not paid. Install, customer service issues not resolved in timely fashion"
bad,The only way they keep people is the pay. They do not understand when your child is sick or when you are sick. They do not understand that you have a life other than there. I quit working there because it was crazy the stress they put you under. they pay is not worth your mind.
bad,"verbatim script that did not produce sales  sales. My manager had absolutely no idea what she is doing and is way over head. 6 people quit in my department within 4 months m. "
bad,Every year multiple times a year there are layoffs. There was a good ole boy system which caused qualified employees to be unrecognized.  Pay lack now
bad,Windstream is an okay company to work for while you are looking for a career.  The benefits have all but faded away over the years and the career opportunities are not there.
bad,"I was laid off from Windstream due to outsourcing of my job overseas.  I had many good years there, but the company is continuing to downsize and shed itself of quality employees which makes for a stressful work environment."
bad,"Their employee benefits and compensation is well below average, and they do not value their employees at all. The company is also in trouble financially."
bad,"My immediate coworkers are wonderful. Management, not so much. It seems that the less they know, the higher they get promoted. Atmosphere of ""do more with less"" constantly makes you feel unequipped for the job at hand. There is a total lack of communication, which is ironic for a communications company. Seniority hold more weight than actual merit. "
bad,"Company has toxic culture with perpetual layoffs and constant cost cutting due to declining revenue. "
bad,I worked for them for 1.5 years and during that time the quota was raised higher and it was already 50% higher that it should have been in my opinion after working in the industry for 15 years.
bad,I have never worked at a job where literally no one is there. I had a manager that I saw once in a years time. It is truly like owning your own business. The exception is you dont make the profits of owning it.
bad,"I loved my job, the technicians I dispatched, but the management was not pleasant and co workers would knock you down at the drop of a hat. When concerns would be brought up, management would call out the person with the concerns and make them look bad."
bad,"Management is trying to operate this ILEC as a CLEC which is impossible. The company does not have realistic goals to achieve ultimate success. They really need to take a deep dive into what really happens day to day and implement improvements while changing the culture of the business going forward.  If they did, they would realize the revenue they need to be successful."
bad,Not at all happy with they treat their non-bargained for employees. Pay was well below industry standards and literally no opportunity for advancement or promotion.
bad,There is no structure and the benefits are horrible for such a large company.  The morale is the office is low and everyone seems concerned about the future of the company.
bad,"Computer literate, knowledge of office applications, communicate with clarity both verbally and in writing, show active listening skills, ability to organize and handle multiple tasks in an efficient manner, follow through and shows attention to details, ability to work collaboratively with others and maintain positive relationships."
bad,"Could never get supplies for the outside plant vehicles were always broke down, lack of safety, no concern for their customers and leaving people without dial tone for months, that’s probably why the company is now filing bankruptcy"
bad,Companies upper Mngt is atrocious. Rules change on a weekly basis. Forced to take comp time in place of OT. Out of pocket expenses for travel tjhen later reimbersed
bad,"Interview process wasn't so bad.  Only thing is they  don't tell you that selling is more important than anything.  You have to offer on every call,  even to the customer's that's  can't afford the product.  If you're someone like me who needs a quite area,  windstream is not for you.  The floor  is super loud,  to the point your customers can hear what's going on in the background.  Supervisor are nice and willing to help. Shift bid every quarter,  so you better sell,  and meet your kpi,  if not you will be working on Saturday. Every other day computer doesn't work so you have to call help desk.  Money wise,  just sell and you will get a nice bonus check,  at the end of the month."
bad,"The higher ups finally looked at the ""spreadsheet"" and decided that my role was no longer needed, even thought I had at least 20 different people from across the company/country who told me otherwise. Sadly it was finally my turn, after surviving 10 different ""reductions in force"", not sure if that is a blessing, as it was always hard to watch friends/co workers go, it really does effect the moral of everyone. They keep talking away, health care, actual office spaces/move you across town, time off...so now it almost feels like it costs you money to work there.. Feels like a FAST sinking ship, swim at your own risk."
bad,"The company is making massive layoff's and reorganizing and doesn't matter how long, how dedicated or how much knowledge they will cut you anytime without notice."
bad,"You hit the glass ceiling with this company, no room for growth. You are limited to spending time in the field with techs."
bad,Very unstable work environment and management was out of touch with real market issues. Pushed for the number and not a customer relationship. Contradictive work ethic in comparison to their vision.
bad,Do Not Work for Windstream. I can't make it any more simple than that. You are better off working fast food or retail. This bit is for the one hundred fifty character minimum.
bad,"Working at Windstream is like trying to put together internet with sticks and stones with monkeys as support staff."
bad,"Windstream is without a doubt the worst job I've had in over 20 years of employment. The training is irrelevant to the day to day tasks associated with the job. The company itself makes the job more difficult than it should be with way too many different systems and procedures associated with each system. There is little to no communication as far as simple things like how to do certain daily job actions,  training and basic information for new hires like payroll, pay schedule and just the minor things most companies provide to new employees. The workers there are all nice hard working people but if you ask 5 people the same question you will get 5 different answers because there is no set structure or set way to do things. I was surprised how many long tenured  people there did not actually know how to do certain things,  thats not an employee problem thats an organizational problem. They basically throw you on the floor with very little relevant training and do not provide a good nurturing environment to help you succeed. I went over 6 months without access to a very common system used for customer assistance, then an additional 2 months without access to a vital system for every day production...what other company would allow that?  How can i give good service to a customer if i cant even access there account and the only information i ever received when asking for it to be fixed was someone will contact you...well they never did and for 2 months i sat taking calls without the simple ability to help the customer. The work atmosphere was good, good people laid back environment"
bad,Everything about that work environment was a terrible experience for me.
bad,"Learned a lot about telecom while working here. The managers I have are very helpful in explaining things that might not be understood.  "
bad,I started working for Windstream right before it lost its appeal. The culture changed when the executive team decided to freeze merit and change benefits.
bad,"Management is constantly trying to adapt the methods and procedures of it's most recent merger, which dosen't always work. The culture has change in the 15yrs i spent working for the establishment and as a result, the poor performance in production and customer service has diminish. I appreciate the years working for the previously named companies before the merger with windstream and the employees in which i made life long friends.  The company's stock value has dropped and Hopefully Windstream can bounce back ."
bad,"A typical day consist of answering incoming calls from upset customers,screaming and yelling at you because the tech either did not call them, did not show, or just did not fix the service when was at customers premises. This is daily not every other day, but daily! I have have learned so much that I taught myself in this hostile work environment, to learn self control, and patience in general! The management consist of three supervisors with zero management experience, zero coaching ability/background, no  advanced education background and zero team building experience. Promoted by the luck of who you know. The hardest part of this job is their customer survey's that customer return. When they deal with Windstream, and not the employee,, the employee has to take the beating. Once you choose this job, their is no structure, horrible management, no advancement, and no outlook, you become a body just renting a desk! Wen first waive started back in September  2016 everything management promised that waive has been crushed, forgotten, saying no we never said that, and a LIE. The culture is broken, so many unprofessional, one can tell they picked bums off the street.The hardest part is going in there daily, until the phone rings with better options, All are stuck, but looking for better positions. It's happening one by one. The most enjoyable part of the job is a great deal of employee's go drink their lunch on lunch hour. ONLY way to get through the day. The point system is 8 points and end of employment. most have over 8 and still sitting pretty. Ask yourselves why!!"
bad,"Management was very detached from employees. Very high turn over rate due to management. Training was okay, but did not truly prepare you for the position."
bad,The internet was terrible and I had a moral issue with offering customers upgraded internet service or offering internet service when it was such a terrible product that for many customers worked 15% of the time.
bad,"The account manager role was good, I used to look forward to going to work (as did others) but 1 year ago this last March things changed. The environment was changed to a call center, the pay was cut drastically, the lunch hour went to a lunch half hour and many times lunch and breaks are cancelled. When this happens the company typically buys everyone pizza so we don't leave our desk's and keep taking call after call. 3 seconds after the last call we get another and so on and so forth. Now, on the good days when we get breaks and lunches, any and all bathroom breaks are deducted from the breaks and or lunch.     It takes 25 different computer systems (not exagerating) to do our job and partly because registration keys don't want to be invested in. So each and every key stroke has to be manually tracked by the employee that is getting a new call every 3 seconds. The lies the employees are being told to tell the customers are rediculous. And since every call is to be ""1 call resolution"" and we are supposed to get each customer on and off the line as quickly as possible without sacrificing the call quality is entirely a joke. Well that's the Typical Day! "
bad,Never got trained to do job properly. My manager was hired after me and didn’t know how to do his job. Upper management is a complete joke. If you ask for help you are told that help is coming and it never does. Upper management cared treated lower management like slaves. Company is all around a joke. Do not work at this bankrupt thieving company!!!
bad,Windstream is the worst managed company I have worked for. The work environment is poor with low moral. I would not recommend that anyone I know to work there.
bad,Company is always changing including the upper management.  It made it hard to feel secure.  Compensation was good but the benefits were not good at all.
bad,micro managed and stressful that's it. did not feel welcomed in the company at all I was one of maybe 8 other minorities here and they made it very uncomfortable
bad,Responsible for managing the planning and execution of the overall product life cycle for the MPLS VPN product.Responsible for the overall operational success (P&L) of the MPLS product. Drove requirements for a streamlined quote to cash system/process for the product.
bad,"Constantly having to worry about losing your job here. There were monthly lay offs, and you were never secure about your job. The people they let go seemed to be random."
bad,Company is at a pivotal point in transitioning from a regulated telecom to an enterprise and wholesale based provider. Some do not think the company will be able to recover from the debt and spinoff of assets to the newly formed REIT.
bad,"No loyalty among teams very cut throat"
bad,At Windstream it's all about providing a dividend to stockholders and could not care less about their employees. Managers are all yes men because they are job scared and afraid to speak up.Don't consider working here in any position.
bad,"They play favorites when it comes to advancement, instead of prmoting most quilified candidate.  The raises are very minimal and the standard work precedures are useless."
bad,This company has no future in the modern tech world . This company keep doing the same thing year over year and they continue to be an old Bell Style company
bad,"Worked at windstream as a full time employee for a year and 6 months, was hired in after a 6 month contract.  All teams run insanely lean, C level executives and VP level people are all horribly disconnected from day to day operations."
bad,"Been working for this company for 4 yrs as a contractor, then finally was placed a permanent employee. After working there for so long, I hesitated about being  permanent. Windstream operates like a small business with no direction. Constantly making unwise decisions from removing effective applications to removing sick hours. Management act like lost puppy dogs and spend most of the time stepping on one another's toes. These multiple changes made within the company has made it unbearable to work for for. Dont even bother about promotions. Closet thing to a promotion is to go to another dept."
bad,"Yea you get to work on a lot of different things, but it becomes a factory and any customization, you have to walk the robots thru. Not very good and recognizing talent, NO personal/professional development. Training consist of pushing a button after listening to a manager explain some policy that does not pertain to your job of even department. Pretty horrible for sanctification. But is a steady paycheck and overtime weather you want it or not."
bad,"Work days included constant interaction with office staff and working at computer within company applications/other sites to prepare reports, request service records, respond/initiate emails, etc. The sale of telecom service by local AE's, Channel Mgrs and Acct Mgrs also required some customer interaction and knowledge of their orders as they moved from initial submission to installation.  I was able to learn the process and resolve problems that occurred so that deadlines would be met. It was extremely satisfying when I played a significant role in assisting the reps with this crucial part of the sale. "
bad,10 hour work days are typical.  The company does not have a standard protocol with training or day to day business operations.  The work life balance needs to be addressed.
bad,"I was excited to get this position because it was a well established company, or so I thought. Training was outdated, too much time spent on learning company's systems and not enough spent on actual product knowledge. Then once on the floor, coaching was non existent. I was constantly told, do this or your job is in jeapordy. Motivation...not at all. Then compensation was given to same top performers. It was never clear how that top position can be attained. I came across a lot of unethical sales practices but nothing was done about it. It was a nightmare. This wasn't by first experience in a call center but it sure left me feeling like I never want to work in a call center again."
bad,I enjoyed the work and the direct people I worked with but the upper management (CEO) changed after my 3rd year with the company and thing went down hill from there. Funds mismanagement led to a filing of bankruptcy in early 2019 and then more frequent lay offs began. Thousands of people have lost there job at Windstream and I was one who was cut in November 2019. The benefit package offered by WS is horrible. I know of no worse Medical coverage offered by anyone with a company of this size. Coverage is very expensive and basically covers nothing.
bad,"We are honored to have been named 2019 Best for Vets Employers by Military Times, demonstrating our continued commitment to hiring veterans and providing them with rewarding careers with Windstream"
bad,"My manager was great. But she was bogged down in so much red tape that we couldn’t get anything done. The companies reputation is questionable amid the Bankruptcy, and they have shifted focus on their core products 5 times in 24 months. The CEO bankrupted the company and was just given an extension and raise. If you are interviewing, make sure you have options and a plan B."
bad,"high stress with little support from management.  Workload increases daily, with no real opportunities for advancement.  Constant layoffs and unrealistic expectations"
bad,"Do you work hard? Have a known Stellar performance and results?  Don’t be fooled, you have no room for advancement at Windstream if you not a “Steady Eddie, “Yes, sir” employee.  Creativity, Questioning Leadership and Suggesting Alternatives is strongly frowned upon.  It is so sad how the culture at this company has fallen! Avoid this place like the plague!"
bad,"This is a very inconsistent company. They buy new companies and then try to become the latest company they bought. One BU gets eight percent raises to keep the Union out and the other BU receives no raises and has to perform staff reductions as many as three times in a year. Leadership fails to listen to the results of Employee Surveys. Instead, they insist the manager didn't promote the successes of the companies correctly. Employees pay for rooms out of their pockets while leadership enjoys face to face team building sessions through out the country. Many great people have given years and decades to make their legacy companies successful only to hear we are sorry, you are not needed any longer. Upper Management claims to be in touch, but there is zero evidence to support that. A typical day for me was 10-12 hours while being on call 7by24, so I am not sure how the company can claim they provide good Job Life balance. You work hard because you are scared of being let go, but working hard doesn't keep you employed. The sad part is it used to be a Great company."
bad,"Never know which direction the wind will blow Windstream so to speak. Different direction every quarter, management drove the stock from $31 to $1.75 a share."
bad,Joined Windstream after closing a telecommunications interconnect company at the onset of the economic collapse of 2008.  Hired as a Business Account Representative (BAR) to sell small to medium business products and services.  I worked the most competitive market in Kentucky with multiple competitors providing similar and better products and services at much lower rates and with faster delivery times.  Ultimately faced competition from an internal call center competing for the same customer base.  Faced with a corporate mindset to transition to the lowest cost of acquisition I had to move on.
bad,"Ok company to work for, until RIFs happen.  Plenty of different types of equipment and network to work on.  Great opportunity for experience.  Lack of training with and between departments of business process."
bad,"Worked for Windstream for a little over a year and a have. I started in customer care (which will be outsourced as of November 2018) and moved to CNOC. Unfortunately management is less than up to par but there are some good people that work there. When departments began getting outsourced the people would go but that work would fall on another department. By the time I quit our department was doing the work or 4 departments, all the while we were getting paid the same. We all got 1% raises around May which is a joke because we are already paid less than $30,000 annually. Management would not address regular issues in the workplace, so bad to the point over half the department had to go to HR about management."
bad,"If you're looking for a steady paycheck, keep looking. It's hard to overlook the terrible stock analysis and stay on task daily. A healthy company fosters a healthy culture. Besides that, the majority of peo people there are positive and friendly. People in key positions however do not like to be honest and open with your chances of succeeding and advancing."
bad,"People I worked with were awesome, it was the upper management that was the issue they changed their aspects of what they wanted Windstream future to be."
bad,About average in benefits and training. Some areas get a lot of overtime. Work requires working in rough weather with no backup. Supervisors often do not know the work that must be performed. Company is constantly downsizing.
bad,"they are losing money, in alot of debt, losing customers and investors..they are now making their sales reps take the brunt of that punishment but ""improving"" comp plans. which will result in talented sales rep leaving"
bad,Stay away from at all costs. Company is not financially stable and constantly cuts employees in a random manner every month or two. 1000s of jobs have been lost and will continue to be until company is acquired by another entity or is crippled from the loss of talent that it implodes on itself.
bad,They have made and keep laying people off and to much uncertainty with the direction the executives are taking the company.Our stock is below 2.00 and do not see it coming back up anytime soon.
bad,Company focuses too much on acquiring other smaller businesses without the proper tools to integrate all employees under one business model.  Very disorganized between multiple departments operating almost as separate entities.
bad,For the past 5 years Windstream undergone a series of company acquisitions. as a result it causes uncertainty in th future of employment in the company. just this year we have went thru our third layoff with more expected . put that with the lack of advancement opportunities . the employees feel a since of uncertainly in thier future with the company. moral is very low
bad,Management was very lacking in my department. No processes or Training to implement. Everyone was doing their own thing not following any given procedure. No quality checks ever done to make sure work was correct. Worst part of job was lack of quality management best part of job was people you worked with.
bad,Windstream doesn't have any Brand Awareness efforts in the New York Area or sales lead generation efforts. Windstream expects their sales representatives to generate their own leads. Potential customer customers are not responsive to cold calls.
bad,"Since the new CEO and management below him, the moral and work environment has decreased. prior to that, I would recommend then to anyone for employment"
bad,"Management is terrible...like many politicians they have no clue of what happens at customer or worker levels. This company panders to stock holders. They do not use or know about Telco standards, keep appropriate records on circuit layout, both which are truly disturbing since they provide network communications to you....the customer.  It's a shame...they could be better if managers really cared about employees.  If you try to share ideas, point out risks or vulnerablilites, or cost saving ideas, you're ignored or considered a threat.  Supervise by intimidation, which is no way to run a company.  If you are talented, don't waste your time with this company....run! Hopefully the Koch Brothers will buy out the company...they understand integrity, ethics, and know employees, even at their lowest level matter! Left and glad I did..."
bad,New management needed. Company in Addison never does anything fun its all about work
bad,The company lets you get overtime but makes it mandatory with a day or 2 notice and over time being in effect for months.
bad,"Essential to be very good juggler of time management for new business development, company meetings, trainings, customer meetings and presentations and post-sale project management. An enjoyable office environment and staff."
bad,"I was very surprised by the negative culture in this workplace, especially management. I have never seen such a high degree of customer dissatisfaction towards a company either. This job was a very rude awakening."
bad,"Management was terrible, non helpful, co workers were excellent, benefits were terrible, and the union did not help at all.   Worked 6 10 hour days for 6 months, with no time off."
bad,They say one thing and do another.  Day to day interactions with employees is very nice and professional.  The overall company direction is all over the place.
bad,A typical day at work can be pretty stressful. No one is properly in anything and the communication between groups have gotten better but are still bad. Can be a great place to work if you have people that will work with you and not against you.
bad,"Unorganized company from the top down.  Qualified , professionals they dont want.  They want workers with their pants dragging on the ground. Pay is below standard for that type of work as it can be very stressful."
bad,Not a great place for someone who does not deal with stress well. Very little training with full accountability for critical systems. Management is seldom and chaotic.
bad,"Enjoyed my job and worked with some great people. Had a really good manager, but some people not so lucky. Company is having serious financial trouble and outsourced many IT jobs to IBM offshore. They have horrible internet service and are losing lots of customers. There were always layoffs going on, especially around holidays."
bad,It was a very difficult place to work because you never know when a layoff will be happening.  Every year they would layoff between 250 and 400 people a year.
bad,maybe it would be different to work there as an actual FTE but as a contractor i cannot say i recommend Windstream to anyone at all. there is no hope of advancement and it is very apparent you are replaceable
bad,"Very heavy workload with unrealistic expectations in repair centers - wanting barely trained technicians to handle heavy ticket loads, calls and emails without much regard for technical quality."
bad,It is a good place to sharpen your skills and learn new skills.  Very busy which is a good thing because the day goes by quickly.  Nice to resolve customers' issues.
bad,The only ones who feel secure or are making any money are the CEO and a few of the higher ups.  Constant threat of lay offs and lack of any pay increase is not promising.
bad,"Just a place to work no real joy, many customers didn't like the company. When traveling to often current accounts and pasted accounts spoke of how unhappy their experience has been with this company."
bad,"not a good place to work, not competitive in the market, antiquated systems and quoting tools. management is disjointed and upper management has no idea what it is like to work on the ""floor"" so to speak. "
bad,Lack of leadership too many changes in the product line. Windstream did not take care of their employees. Stressful work environment. No career path in the healthcare
bad,This is a good place to learn a wide range of skills but not a career corporation.  Employee reviews are meaningless as merit increases are only 1.5% annually.  There is no incentive to work hard other than having more work dumped on you.  The incentive for doing poor work is that the work you didn't do gets dumped on the hard workers.  There is no fair system of rewards or punishments for work ethics.
bad,Telecom is an ever changing industry and the pressure is great to maintain the residential lines and find a way to group into the enterprise market. Management is often stuck in the old days and not willing to learn and grow.
bad,"After pouring my soul into the company to ensure the network operated flawlessly for the past several years and after 15 years with the company the company laid off me, the disabled employee, and the 68 year old tech and kept the younger guys that stayed in the office all day playing games on their PC and watching YouTube videos.  The manager cared more about those he considered friends instead of those that actually worked.  When the company bought Paetec the entire culture changed from that of teamwork to every man for himself.  The benefits went downhill as well.  Windstream stopped being an enjoyable place to work The management stopped caring about employees and the employees seemed to stop caring about their work."
bad,Not a good place to work. Upper management out of touch with employees. They have no respect for employees. Most middle management is pretty good. Great co-workers. Company is badly managed.
bad,Company focus is way off base in regards to work stability.  Management is very not consistent in its message.  No path to grow.
bad,This place tries to mix up duties between a call center and a real network engineer job.  The result is a high stress and toxic environment where little matters outside of your performance metrics.
bad,"This company was originally Cavalier telephone which was a great start up local telephone service. The opportunity to advance was not limited and the chance to learn the telecom industry from the ground up was there, you were surrounded by veterans of the industry. Unfortunately it was sold to a company called Paetec and eventually chopped up and then sold to Windstream. Management is and I guess still terrible, they have a ""Be happy you have a Job"" mentality and care nothing for their employees."
bad,"In just over six years the focus of the company switched from customer service in favor of pushy sales tactics.  Sales were expected in any call situation, regardless of previous customer experience.  Because of this work environment calls were being continuously transferred and rerouted to incorrect departments in order to ""cherry pick"" good sales calls.  "
bad,"If you like to drive hours away from the office after a 1 hour sales meeting everyday. Then knock on random doors until dark, and drive home. This is the job for you."
bad,Awful management!  Executive team has no real vision for next gen products or how to compete with newer technology.
bad,"A typical day at work consists of taking inbound calls.  A lot of repetitive calls.  Customers calling in about billing questions, repair issues, etc.  On every call you MUST offer and sell ALL products that customer does not currently have. The customers that call in are mostly rural/older clientele who are worried about money and do not really care to increase bill by adding internet products, protection plans, etc.  Typical shift is 10 am to 7 pm with two 15 minute breaks and an hour lunch.  The opportunities for better shifts come few and far between.  Commission plan constantly changing for the worse. Management is out of touch and unapproachable. Best part of the job was definitely the co-workers.  Steady paycheck, decent medical plan, okay incentives.  Not a fun environment to work in."
bad,"This company does pay well.  However, management is not honest.  You work way more than what was told.  This job requires sales more than customer service.  They sell equipment and internet that is not a good product and constantly find ways to keep from paying you commission.  This job is highly stressful and is a place for younger carefree people. "
bad,Windstream Communication was very hard place for me to succeeded
bad,"Unless your a ""favorite"" you are treated worse than everyone else"
bad,"if you know how to do your job the money is good, you work a lot of hours, not much room for family as a result great for young people with no children looking to gain sales experience"
bad,"Prepare to be micromanaged!! Every call (and they are nonstop the whole day) you take will be monitored and then you get to hear about everything you did wrong. You can work your rear-end off here and still not advance. It's disheartening when you watch someone who has been there only a few months (and you've been there years) get the job you deserved!! They do not value good employees and tenure means zero. They have no problem ""stretching"" the truth with customers and their sales tactics are AT BEST unethical. They want you to cram products down the customers throat and then berate you for the job!!! It's unbelievable. The only really good thing about this place is the pay....if you can stand it...for me it wasn't worth it anymore. Things are on a serious downhill slide for this place."
bad,"Their are constant procedure, department and leadership changes. The layoffs are too often. Their reputation is horrible and the communication about what is happening within the company is vague."
bad,"while they have made improvements they have a long ways to go. the process once you sell a product is slow and out of your control. the communication with the customer with where the process is, is not good. Not a team culture."
bad,The company rolled out new software way before it was ready. Wait times went from 5 minutes for my department to 40 minutes plus. There was only 30 people in my escalations department compared to 700 front line agents.
bad,Company does not care about their employees or customers  Upper management is running the company into the ground.  They let the management level openly discriminate
bad,"The only redeeming quality of this place was the pay and some of the people working there. Most of the information needed to do your job is incorrect or is conflicting in any of the multiple databases available. This company just buys up LECs and doesn't put the effort into merging the information properly into their system, hence why there are so many different systems needed to do a simple task"
bad,Management is disconnected from reality. Very few people are hitting their numbers and even fewer are making any money and this was before they filled for Bankruptcy...
bad,You will get paid on the lower end of salary plus ramp money depending on the department. Sales targets are high and commission is not that great. They promise you will make 100k at plan but you only get paid most of your commission when sales install which is very problematic. I have been paid much more commission at other jobs for the level of work and bs they have here. It's an average sales job at best.
bad,It's not the best but it's not the worst. Like any call center (contact center) there is favoritism. They do not take doctor notes into consideration.
bad,Currently any position with company is questionable and volatile with no idea as to what the future holds. Layoffs every quarter or more and no guarantee of having a job at any time
bad,"I really enjoy the people I work with, but we've had multiple layoffs since I started and it's been hard to make a decent commission because of our pricing and the comp plan structure.  I just don't feel confident in the company's long term prospects."
bad,"I am only currently still employed by this company because of the flexibility.   Everything else is horrible. "
bad,Not much just do not apply with this company. They have poor management from the top to the bottom. The new Director comes from a call center background. This position is not a call center.
bad,"Really enjoyed working there until I was laid off without any warning.  When I later asked my manager he said that he was unaware of the layoff until it happened.  When I asked if the director knew, my manager said he was surprised too.  Who makes the decisions here?!  Windstream seems to be struggling to find its footing in the industry."
bad,I enjoyed working for Windstream other than the company had four layoffs while I was there.  I don't understand companies that have layoffs and then turn around re-hire more people or even the same people.
bad,I enjoy the people I work with but if you are not in the management 'clique' you will be left out of decision making and opportunities. Communication from upper management is non existent.
bad,"Worked for Windstream for over a decade in many different roles. Was once a great growing place to work under the banner of Alltel but now feels more like a sinking ship where the resources are being placed on life boats before worker compensations and general business expenses. "
bad,"This company is not a good place to work for. Windstream does not care about their employess, only their customers that spending the most mony that month.."
bad,"I worked for Windstream for almost 7 years. At first the company was a very good place to work. Management cared and they focused on the employees and more importantly on their customers. "
bad,"Company provides all the benefits that you could want but the employee cost is very high, out-of-pocket maximums and co-pays are also high.  Company seems to be experiencing growing pains and they are still buying up smaller telecom companies.  I was laid off after 13+ years."
bad,"When I first started at Windstream, It was on its last legs however I did not know it at the time. For the first 6 or 7 months it was great, good money, good culture. After about one year in, the company started losing stock, people were laid off, others on mandatory overtime. I am not sure how the company is currently doing."
bad,Salary and commissions were the only thing that was good about this company. The leadership from branch manager to the CEO was a culture that needed refinement. There was no chance of career advancement.
bad,"Windstream talks the talk but doesn't follow up with action. There is talk of changing the company culture, of rebranding the company but it's the same thing as always. Layoffs are common. The company policies are selectively enforced depending on who managers like best. The people I work with are some of the best I've ever met, but I've seen them get stepped on and cut down by a corporation that only cares about the bottom line. I've learned a lot about how to deal with people and manage difficult situations at this job. I worked customer service for most of my years at Windstream and it's made me a better communicator. I've learned that the best thing I can do is be willing to learn and always be open to new things. I wouldn't recommend working at Windstream, but the experience hasn't been all bad. Like anything else there's good and bad."
bad,Previously worked for Earthlink until Windstream came in and changed the culture. Started laying off people when they stated that our jobs were safe. Was not happy with the buy out at all
bad,Stressful. Dreaded going to work. But paid the bills an had benefits. Co-workers were the best part of job. Upper management seemed out of touch. Layoffs every year. Seems everyone is edge just waiting for their turn as more and more work is being piled on.
bad,Its a horrible managed company a place of who know who will get you thru ...... good pay horrible insurance package friendly people the company was always going thru management changes
bad,"Financial troubles and connectivity issues process need to improve."
bad,"It's your typical sales job - grind it out chasing the carrot on the stick. If you do manage to make a sale, despite never being trained on what you are selling, there is a good chance that it will either fall apart during installation, or it will get deployed wrong - so kiss your commission goodbye. Once you actually make commission, there is a good chance that the company will restructure your attainment plan, so they can pay you less the next year. "
bad,"I have nothing at all to say here that may be detrimental to an opportunity to become gainfully employed here again."
bad,Overall this company was not too bad. But there were too many departments that handled different duties instead of a one stop shop like some competitors.
bad,"No pay increase even though management get their bonuses. Health benefit are poor at best."
bad,"Tons of overtime and commission structure changed often leading to less money over time. Management was extremely petty. While the PTO is great, it's so stressful you will wish you had more."
bad,"Every department is overworked. There are over 150 employees with a VP (or higher) title, but annual raises are around 1% on average for hourly employees. Management rarely has an opportunity to manage the teams, instead is constantly doing conflict resolution between departments and other companies. Depending on the department you are in, you will either have mandatory overtime, or be banned from overtime. The company does not put any priority on training employees or improving the value of an employee unless the employee goes out of their way to take classes on their own time. There is little-to-no employer provided training on anything."
bad,none to report......I find that the company has good management talent but will not nurture that talent nor allow the talent to be effective mentors to their employees as well...
bad,"I  worked at Windstream full-time (More than 3 year s)"
bad,"temporary assigment, great place, great people. i would recommend this company for people who would like to grow. the hardest part of the job was being assigned to many customers"
bad,Daily administrative tasks supporting area director of field service operations.  Twenty years in various positions in telecommunications company.
bad,"I was a project coordinator for Windstream Communications. There are quarterly layoffs, and I was once affected. I don't think this is a great company to work for due to the amount of layoffs per quarter. The insurance is high, and the management isn't structured."
bad,Was held to too many job responsibilities without the incentive to perform at peak performance. Top down communication without consideration for any of the requested information from the lower level.
bad,"Because Windstream does not have a branded name, and most people have never heard of it, the marketing expectations of the company are completely unrealistic."
bad,"Fun Place to work at times, with very laid back management style. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop within the company. Huge amount of Red Tape and politics, but this is expected of a big corporation. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them. The office started to get thin due to people leaving for better positions and not following company policies. Tasks got more difficult to complete as outlined by management because management was not local and support was very limited. There was a lot of variety and freedom in what I did each day, ranging from the monotonous tasks to new projects that were challenging and exciting. Network Jobs took to long to complete which ended in loss revenue for the company."
bad,"This company is trying desperately to fix itself, but it is too little too late. The company purchased several smaller companies, but did a poor job integrating them, and is now paying the price for that oversight."
bad,It was ok. Nothing special. Huge turn over and random changes. Not for everyone. The employees were nice though its just not for me.
bad,"The people who work here for the most part are good people. The environment amongst employees is good. The relationship between management and employees; however, is very rocky. The hours can be long for customer service. There is a constant hire and release of contract labor. You can be on contract for 2 years and let go at the drop of a hat. I saw it several times and thought ""that will never happen to me"". Well it did. I was replaced by a $12 and hour employee whom I was asked to mentor. I went through 3 directors and 4 supervisors in the 2 years I worked here. If your a travelling contractor look elsewhere. You can do better."
bad,Very stressful place to work.  Management pushes for sales and expects employees to probe and offer in 400 seconds.  You are expected to sell and upgrade products that don't work most of the time to rural people who have no other option for Internet or phones.  Probably the worst experience I've had with a job so far.
bad,"most coworkers are good, company doesn't seem to want to keep long term employees"
bad,"Windstream Communications acquired D&E Communications and cut back on resources in every department. Previous to the acquisition, the company was a great place to work. The customer was always # 1, and employees were the company's greatest asset."
bad,Call center environment with unprepared staff and overwhelming duties.
bad,"It gets old hearing about job eliminations, always wondering if/when you are next.  That answer came a short while ago for me.  Although it was tough to hear, it was completely expected.  "
bad,Company would like to deliver and drive towards customer experience however systems and internal processes do not allow for employees to be successful.
bad,very difficult for career advancement. Very little training opportunities. Work life balance is non-existant. Not many choices for flexible shifts. On-call rotation is difficult.
bad,"This companies is ran by way to much management!! over kill!!! New titles gets made out of thin air, that are pointless. I think they need to take a step back and come up with a new business plan to make this place what it could be. Job Security is something that everyone worry about everyday you walk into the doors, Advancement is there but when you're in a group they don't want to let you advance."
bad,Windstream was a good place to work in the beginning. Due to management. It was mandated that work weeks went from 5 days a week to 7 days a week. During this time there was a lot of stress placed on the entire team.
bad,"Not happy with advancement options. •	I am responsible for the development, planning and management of all aspects of assigned project implementation in a timely and smooth process. This included identification and understanding of the project scope, customer expectations, constraints and requirements; creation and communication of a realistic project plan; management and execution of the project plan tasks and timelines; identification of project team members and roles; development and management of project issues log; completion of assigned tasks within the schedule and budget guidelines; and data collection and analysis in support of key indicators and project status."
bad,"Attempts to focus on priority issues, consistently interrupted by lower priority issues due to lack of staffing. Different divisions carry different policy making it difficult to work between certain teams."
bad,"There have been multiple changes in upper management in recent months followed by multiple process changes and layoffs.   The general sense among team members is that Windstream will be acquired soon.   Nothing else make sense, good talent is leaving and there are new VPs every other week."
bad,I worked for windstream in phoenix Az . I loved the people I worked with but the company is going through rough times and is constantly laying off their workforce
bad,"Fun place to work, often micro managed. Work family balance is ok, still hard to get vacation days or schedule drs appointment."
bad,I believe that they are just financially struggling and it shows in the way that the office is ran.  There is only one go to person that has the knowledge to get answers from and there were 75 employees.
bad,"Create your own experience, but would not recommend wasting your time here. There is no job security, although they will try to make you feel like there is. The work is left for those who actually do their job, by the ones who don't. The tools used to assist are limited and aren't continuously stable and if they go down its almost impossible to effectively do your job (but you find a way). The environment and overall morale is unappealing. Its cool for a 1st time job, but if your trying to make a career out of it, id look elsewhere."
bad,Poorly ran company with old technologies and myopic mind employees. I would not recommend anyone to work there. I have absolutely nothing else to say about this company
bad,"Unfortunately, there was no room for growth or significant increase in pay in my position after 5 years. I applied for other positions, but wasn't offered a new role. I began looking for other opportunities outside of the company with better pay."
bad,"The upper management in the company at the executive level is poor at best. Continued bad decisions lead to more bad decisions and there is no accountability ."
bad,"Work was typically fast-paced, Answering phone calls and troubleshooting network issues simultaneously was a practical requirement."
bad,It's a company that can't get out of its own way. They've acquired so many other smaller companies but didn't truly plan on how to integrate them all. They have the right ideas but never plan far enough ahead for the execution.
bad,"Great initial training program, once out on the floor, it felt like a sink or swim atmosphere. In the short period i was there, it felt like it was always short staffed or there was turnover occurring under my staff manager whether people were leaving involuntarily or voluntarily."
bad,"Windstream isn't the most fascinating place to work. While the m-f schedule is appealing, overtime is a necessity if you plan to actually hit quota and make money. The interview process is a little misleading about the pay structure, definitely not one of the best commission plans I've worked under.  Leadership within the company is lackluster, there is a lot of obvious favoritism displayed throughout the department. Overall if your are looking for something temporary or are okay with complacency in your work I would recommend Windstream."
bad,"I worked at Windstream for 7 years. Over the past several years it really started to decline. There were mass layoffs several times a year, but they never pared down the bloated middle or upper management. They continued to make health benefits worse and worse and one year they froze the measly 1 - 2 % ""merit"" raises while managers continued to get their large bonuses. "
bad,Windstream was a small alternative energy company with a great idea poorly executed.  There were numerous financial and engineering problems leading to the eventual shutdown of the company.
bad,Constant layoffs.. Up coming bankruptcy. Organized chaos. No advancement unless you're part of the clique. every team works in multiple data bases. Zero unity and constant positioning for a power grab.
bad,"Since EarthLink was Merged (Acquired) with Windstream in February 2017 it was a matter of time before being notified of my position being eliminated. Could have left at any time, however, Thankfully, EarthLink had negotiated that all Earthlink Legacy Employees would receive a nice Severance if we were to stay on."
bad,"The company is growing so they have little time to implement systems that they inherited from other companies.  Great opportunity for a Consultant to get in there, find issues and resolve.  Requires technical skills, above average knowledge of Excel, ability to compose requirements and IT requirements for change."
bad,"Pay is decent but management only cares about saving money, not putting enough people on the actual 'work' to help the customer and employees. This so call quality is nothing but to keep their jobs and nitpicking.  If you use sick days they take out points.  Management let too many people take day off, so rest of other employees have to do overtime.  Blaming people for not doing tickets when we are understaffed and we have 15 to 20 calls in the queues. "
bad,I have grown to understand the urgency of emergency tasks and overall the sense of urgency associated with high level customer service. My typical day consist of following up with technicians and assisting them with daily task to insure they complete there daily task effectively. The management does nothing to further the development of the company by becoming actively involved in the growth of the company positively. My coworkers are very willing to assist and they stay positive. The hardest part of the job is the lack of training given or provided to all departments. I enjoy my hours.
bad,I found that overall there was very little oversight from upper management & a lack of process or willingness to improve processes.
bad,"Alot of documentation to learn from for those who can self teach easily. Hardly any training provided, Coworkers and direct management are great and do the best they can but policies and promotions are iffy and seem more relationship based instead of talent based. They are currently doing mass call center consolidations and it seems more are to come."
bad,I did like working here I just moved again and had my child before I could continue it. they were not very understanding or willing to work with people to accomadate needs
bad,Workplace flexibility is one of the great things about this company. Training for new positions is an area that could be improved for all departments.
bad,"The company itself changes so much so fast with little overhead. When I was first hired with the company we were told we were not doing sales. But the first week on the floor, we started doing contract sales."
bad,"3 weeks of training was insufficent for the job.  Most of the training was focused on Sales and products but not on the daily job and general questions customer would be asking along with Windstream processes.  Minimal floor  support, being told there would be lots of time between calls to work  on quotes and orders for customers, but much more work load than what the job pays. No smooth processes for getting anything done. The office is very quiet and the culture is not what I would expect for many tenured associates.  Most of the employees don't talk to each other in general."
bad,"As with any company the business model is to be competitive in their market, always looking for the edge and to get the better opportunity to be competitive in a competitive market. They have made poor management decisions."
bad,"Answered all inbound/outbound calls, assisted customer with bills, price plans, products tier 1 tech support, assisted supervisor when out on leave as point of contact"
bad,"The coworkers are great and the immediate supervisors try to help you anyway they can.  However, the overall push by the company is to sale, sale, sale and get off the phone. There was a push for better quality and customer service, but with everything coming down the pipeline it was always sales mean more. "
bad,I learned a lot and enjoyed much of my time there but the large number of acquisitions in a very short amount of time caused growing pains and network instability that ultimately is and will continue to cause Windstream a great deal of pain and challenges for their business customers. Personal Family and Work Balance was very hard to maintain though due to the challenges internally.
bad,Unhappy underpaid employees expected to work hard for a company hurting financially trying to compete with stronger companies like Verizon. Co workers worked together but got no recognition just constant threat of layoff.
bad,"The opportunity for advancement is pretty much null and void unless you are in the ""in"" crowd.  You must not have a vision of your own in order to advance."
bad,"Over worked, under paid leaving the Local Manager the only one caring about customers, employees and company reputation. Lack of processes, procedures in all areas."
bad,"Nice place to work.  Was well Trained. Job is not secure, no room for advancement.  Supervisors made promises only to have them rescinded by Managers."
bad,"My manager was awesome but at a corporate level there is no vision.  Constant changes for VP, HR, etc.  I learned how to use Xerox programs.  I learned a lot about construction for new phone service."
bad,I worked 14 years with this company trying to move them forward to stay competitive and they keep looking back to slow down to reduce there size and customer base to stay in the black. The health insurance slowly got less and less and more expensive. My manager was great and he told us under him that upper management has their way of doing business and that is that.
bad,"It is OK to work here,"
bad,"While at Windstream, I worked in the wholesale Carrier Access Billing department as a Finanacial Analyst II. Since Windstream is a telecommunications company, most of the work and its subjects are difficult to understand if you have never worked in telecom before which is what I encountered. With all my prior experience being in consumer banking and investment banking, there was a large learning curve for me. However, along with the challenges this enables you to learn a tremendous amount of knowledge and gain professional working experience."
bad,Need more hands on training available. More knowledge on getting more certifications and the benefits of them. Lay-off rate is outrageous. Overall a good place to start your journey though
bad,"I enjoyed working at Windstream, but I feel Windstream does not care about their employees. They are too eager to dismiss them when it serves their benefit."
bad,"Closer to the customer you are, the better off you'll be. Time on the job or with the company means nothing to higher executives, ofwhich 90% have less time with this comany than the techs who  walk up to the customer's front door."
bad,I have worked at Windstream for about 5 years.  The company was doing pretty well when I first started.  We were at $13 a share.  We are now at under $1 a share.  I have worked hard in any job title that I've been in.  I have been promoted multiple times.  The reason I've been successful is due to training and advice from good Directors.  Upper Management has literally made horrible decisions that have driven Windstream into the ground.  I don't think we will ever recover.  Unethical practices are regularly encouraged to meet numbers and keep stock holders happy.
bad,Jobs are assigned to you and you complete them in the slotted time. If this task is not completed they will be rescheduled. We applied network configurations.
bad,"Company culture and work life balance is nice, however there are frequent lay offs and a haze of uncertainty clouding the future. Mostly due to poor employee treatment and incompetent leadership."
bad,Interesting place to work. Looking for something else. There was not much room for advancement.I did like the hours I worked. As a whole the company needs some work.
bad,The pay scale was good but benefits were lacking.  Optional and vacation was good as well.  Do your best to get in the union areas they will help you in this company
bad,"Under the curve with technology and resources.  Usually on the bubble with pulling the trigger on high end projects. They don't have the proper people in the right places of their expertise's to help them get over the curve that would help them achieve appropriate standards and goals.  The work culture and people are very easy to get along with that are not inflicted by the (behind the scenes) managerial rhetoric's and big brother community schemes.  Management is ""usually"" NOT appreciative towards (the true) employee efforts.  Overall, the company is not that bad to work for.  They seem like they have a stable business which appears to be growing and keeping it's customers.  However, customer service and department management could use a face-lift as they have great employees and customers that are overlooked and un-appreciated.  They seemed to have forgotten their initial motto and what has been behind their great customers and employees all of these years which is simple ""viral loyalty""."
bad,Company is very closed minded in the types of people they want to hire.  Very little opportunity for advancement.  Prefers to hire contractors for short term then replace with new faces as opposed to offering to extend or hire on.
bad,"Middle management is fantastic. I love them up to and including my director. Beyond that they are disengaged, disconnected and mostly worried about their own bonuses. The CEO has a disdain for the employees, even stating in his blog that Windstream is ""not a prison"" and if you don't like it , get out. They expect you to perform the job functions of several people while giving 1-2% raises. Meanwhile the company is 2 billion in debt and the executives still get their ridiculous bonuses."
bad,"I did work on the phone in the morning, calling and making appointments, Afternoons were filled with appointments until 4pm and back to office to complete daily reports."
bad,"typical work day consist of 100+ calls"
bad,"They put you through 6 weeks of training, 2 in the classroom and 4 on the floor. The first two went well, all the management was super friendly and the people that would come through the classroom were friendly and nice. Once we got out on the floor and started listening to and taking calls, the environment had a negative feel to it. People weren't friendly, it seemed like no one liked their jobs. It was awful."
good,Company is not communicating with employees about the financial status and future of the company.  Health insurance is not very good due to high deductibles.
good,Alway busy for 8 hrs. We had a wonderful team who share their knowlege so that you can advance in the work place. The hardest thing about working there was when we were in training and was pulled out to help with the over flow of calls. I
good,"- Great stepping stone to more exciting opportunities."
good,"Though it was a ""fun and productive"" place to work, that was dependent up the management to whom you reported and the department in which you worked.  Others could be very unstructured and micromanaged.  Advancement is a very slow process and seldom happens.  Job security does not exist."
good,"the way they talked to me was a big problem to me, i was treated with little to no respect not just as an employee but also as a person. i also got treated as if i wasn't smart enough to handle the work being done. not a great experience."
good,There is minimal job growth opportunities.  The workload is extremely busy and the goals change continuously.  Management cannot seem to make up their minds.
good,install and maintaining cable and phone plant deal with customer and follow polices also trouble shoot issues that customers have with our services and product
good,Pres of company needs to think of others beside himself.  No raises in the last 3 years but he still received 180% bonus... reorg's constantly and each reorg causes procedure changes.
good,Layoffs every year and not enough techs to provide the quality of service that I fell our customers should receive.Management more concerned with paperwork and was not very supported in helping technicians.
good,Corporate changes constantly with antiquated infrastructure.  Many poor business directions  that lead to falling stock prices and poor employee moral.
good,Difficult company to work for as systems don't mess.  
good,"Thought the expectations and key performance indicators were too high to be routinely obtainable.  Lots of job turn over and unhappy agents,  Micromanagement everywhere."
good,"Windstream purchased Lexcom, a local cable/phone company. Due to this buyout most of the office staff was laid off after the total conversion was in place. As a result of this buyout I was displaced."
good,do not have nothing more to say sold phone and internet services never met anyone other than the 6 sales members was not in office long enough to make a good review or fair review
good,This was a horrible place to work.  Overall atmosphere is very negative.  The management acts like they are for you and they are going to help you advance your career but that is not the case.  Steer clear of osp.  Always overtime for projects that are uncoordinated and very unorganized with no incite as to what the end project result should be.  No set job description.   Bad management - who are out for themselves. This company is notorious for layoffs!
good,"Management has no clue what is needed to get the job done. "
good,This review should factor in a company in bankruptcy - once they emerge into the butterfly they hope to become hopefully things are more clear on direction and get more positive for employees.
good,Windstream has a disfunctional organization and pitiful leadership style overall. Many directors and above have no idea what front line employees do or need to accomplish the goals of the company.  Advancement in your career and within the org is only possible via re-org or executive order. Employees are treated as pawns with no thought toward partnership or even soliciting an opinion.
good,relaxed to a certain degree but always footing the blame on our department for most issues. Having to come to work knowing that sooner or later our department would be transferred overseas
good,"When I first went to work for Windstream, it was a pleasant place to work.  After a few management changes, it became less and less pleasant.  My first job there was outsourced to India to save company money, and my last job was contract position."
good,"Typical Day at Work - Highly stressful, chaotic"
good,"It's a job.  Sadly once they brought the destroyer in the sales department is slowly being dismantled.  Individuals are being held back for promotion because the head count is low but the person over the sales department will not hire anyone else.  It is obvious that he has n axe to grind.  We were told that we made too  much in commission then then capped us.  If you are looking for career growth, do not bother to work here."
good,If you want great pay and no time home with family this is the job for you! No common sense with management. You are just a number they don't care about you as an employee or there customers.
good,Support for the job was missing. Security was lacking.
good,"Typical day were meetings and scheduling with customer.  "
good,"It's one of those places where certain people are in a position through someone's else pull. There are some really smart people that work there. But depending on when a person got hired, they came in under a certain regime and got to move up quickly. Good ole boy system."
good,it was okay for the pay long days angry customers and then having to try and sell them more products. supervisors were not helpful upper management were snakes. i think that sums it up oh and they really didn't want blacks working at this location.
good,There is no loyalty to long term employees.I worked for the company for 17 years. I hurt my back on the job. After workman Comp. Settle with me for my injury which was at no fault of mines. They what they called laid me off. even going so far as to tell me i could reapply at in position that came available and would get first consideration and they lied. i have been reapplying for 2 years now and nothing. i would was loyal to the company for 17 years and the spit in my face.
good,"After executive leadership changes, Windstream went downhill very fast.  I'm sure it is a matter of time before it is bought out and hundreds lose their jobs."
good,"answering inbound calls, working with the local carrier to help solve customer issues. Updating customers by phone and email. Working in multiple different application to repair customer issues."
good,"I learned alot about switching and routing while employed on may different architectures.  Place was a zoo though."
good,"A typical call center job where you’re expected to be on time and sell as much as you can while ensuring the customer is pleased. Zero room for advancement, but the compensation plan wasn’t to bad."
good,Windstream a good company but spent most profits on buying of  other companies and technologies that did not sell. This caused market loss and layoffs.
good,"I worked extremely hard and actually learned much from the engineers.  However, the management (not my immediate supervisor) but the office management was extremely horrible and not professional with they way he managed the office.  I did not get along with him at all.  Luckily, I was able to avoid him at all costs."
good,"To be honest the job sucks. You have certain stats you are expected to meet but the company will not take into account if it's dead. It will all negatively impact your stats. They offer a monthly bonus, which if you miss 3 months in a row you will be terminated. They have unrealistic goals if you are on the later shift and you will be. You will get cussed out on a daily basis by customers and are expected to just take it regardless of the severity of the abuse. The only good thing about this job is the people. I have never worked with such wonderful people before. The pay is ok too. It is definitely not enough for what you put up with but it's ok."
good,"I work at the Network Operations Center in Little Rock, Ar and this is not a very good place to work. there is no growth, both professionally and personal, and the company does not value professional certifications."
good,The job is no that bad but you have to work a lot of overtime. Management can be rude and unhelpful but will not be on your back as long as you get your work done.
good,Upper management is full of harassment toward the female workers. Was only there for a limited time and was harassed by my own supervisor. Reported the many incidents to HR and nothing was done.
good,I was laid off after company was taken over. I got a good package when let go. Not much more to tell. I had to train my replacements in a different state.
good,"It's a good company but there are many changes being made in which the employee is not being considered. It had it's intense moments but very rewarding.  I learned a lot in regards to telecommunications, as well as in Project Management."
good,"Customer requests are logged in a queue where you must document the steps you've taken to accomplish the customer's demands. These requests vary from simple tasks such as name changes and call routing adjustments to more complex issues such as troubleshooting outages and restoring equipment. If you couldn't fix the issue, you were tasked with figuring out who could fix it and get the ticket to them. Your notes in your tickets are graded and surveys are provided to the customer's you've helped where good surveys can net you a few dollars. The hardest part of the job is balancing your queue and opening tickets for customers calling in for help. While techs may have similar quantities of tickets, the work required to accomplish the requests can vary greatly. My team was very close and made me feel welcome. Interacting with other teams, however, was often a hassle. My team scored highly in customer satisfaction compared to the other departments and my management felt pride in that, wanting to hold us to that standard to keep our customer's happy. I started this position with little IT knowledge, but they've taught me to work with switches, routers, and other telecommunications equipment."
good,Work life balance sucks at this company the calendar to request off was always closed and blocked. Management is real cut throat can’t trust them. I quit because the gave me an occurrence for being subpoenaed to court and made me go all the way to Human Resources to have it removed.
good,"stressful and not worth the pain. You get yelled at by customers, managers and co-workers about not doing something right but they won't help you they'd rather write you up and let HR take care of you."
good,"Nice place, great people but it doesn't give back to the employees. So much has been taken away from from them and yet they all put in countless hours with nothing in return."
good,In my experience it is almost impossible to receive a promotion-regardless of how well you perform. If you want a promotion you have to wait for someone to retire and their responsibilities being redistributed.
good,"Overall Windstream can be a great company if they treated there employees like the culture they try to present to clients. Meaning ""family"" Windstream is about the buck the benefits are horrible and they do not believe in compensating their employees. Its been 3 years and no raise and the cost of living only increases."
good,"The job itself is not a bad job, however the company is managed poorly and requires a lot of mandatory overtime.  The communication is not good and the company is not flexible."
good,"Executive management lacks consistent direction, too many layers of management.  First level (supervisory) management very good and knowledgeable.  Constant departmental changes as to who you report to and job functions."
good,"Over 100 phone calls from internal / external customers. Dispatched 60 technicians for work load, managed scheduling of technicians and covered any areas if employees called out of office. Most difficult area of job is meeting the needs the of medical customers with fully loaded work loads and over worked technicians. This was overcome by being able to accomplish all tasks, and getting any/all medical requests taken care of and technicians home safe and on time.  Being able to help our customers while keeping our technicians upbeat and motivated is worth a stressful day!"
good,The organization is in a very unstable flux causing management to be  numbers driven and not customer focused as stated. Employees are just ot allowed to perform the work without major gaps in business functions.
good,"Pretty run of the mill cubicle job, no real culture, very clique-y. Management isn't as involved in development and training, didn't really feel like i was part of the team."
good,"I was brought on as a contractor, which in hindsight was an issue. At the time I was just finishing up college and it was my first ""real"" job. I was incredibly excited to be working in such a fascinating field. I think Windstream is a great company to be with, but if you're looking to work there, make sure you get hired on as a full time employee with benefits rather than as a contractor."
good,I love my job and what I do. Management seems to play favorites and individual contributions are not looked at. It is difficult to work in an environment like that.
good,Managers use processes to manage people.  Leadership does not value new ideas.  Career advancement is not encouraged and not a priority.  Metric driven over employees.
good,"My typical work day, is coming in and answering inbound calls for "
good,"A typical day consists of contacting internal groups to deliver voice/data circuits.  Circuits require fiber or DS1 connection from other carriers, so there is more time attempting to expedite with other carriers.  Conference calls, meetings, and escalations are all part of the typical day."
good,Typical day is answering incoming calls of customers who are mad at the company because there is a high turn over rate. Management is ok. The co-workers are what get you through the day. The hardest part is having to sit there while the customer chews you out for something that is not ok with the company. The most enjoyable part is the co-workers.
good,"While WIndstream provides an excellent product portfolio, the corporate direction and focus was often unclear.  Ever changing management in the Atlanta market made it nearly impossible to focus on quota attainment.  Directional changes between hunting for new business and farming existing accounts changed on a monthly basis."
good,Nice place to work. Schedules are not flexible however. Parking is a nightmare. Building is nice. Busy department that seems to be growing. Hoping for chance of advancement.
good,"The job was enjoyable. However, the company did not care about its employees. There was no room for advancement and the management was not helpful."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job used to be just coming to work knowing that there was a chance that I would be utilized in other roles in the center and the hardest part was dressing up when corporate visitors came by.  My co-workers have always been enjoyable and great to be around.  We all were in the same position so we developed a kinship.
good,"The floor level coworkers including some of lower level management were great to be around, they would always lend a hand if you had any kind of issue whether it was personal or business related. The atmosphere was mostly happy in a business way."
good,"Telecom in general is an industry looking to make their employees do more for less money. The industry seems to be run by accountants with no regard for the customers. ""How do we make a buck?"" Brutal industry. I got a 1.5% raise in three years and was told to be happy about it, despite the company being a multi-billion dollar industry."
good,"Not good clear communication between the CPE and Network sides of the business.  Management is very focused on the top line, which has meant an erosion of profit margin and therefore the continual need to cut costs to maintain a healthy profit investors are looking for.  They sell a good bundle solution (network and CPE) but customers are challenged with getting to the right group to take care of their issues."
good,"Fasted paced atmosphere, great co-workers.  Like the management style. However, tough work/live balance due to the nature of the business and the hour of operation."
good,"A typical day of work consists of hunting sales leads, cold calling, door to door prospecting, scheduling customer appointments, attending networking events and doing whatever it takes to sell the product/service."
good,Call Center enviroement.
good,most enjoyable part of the job was a happy customer at the completion of a assignment
good,too much pressure for no reward and managment shows favortism
good,Do your job and you will be just fine. Advancement is possible but slow. Pay increases are possible each year provided like any job you meet the requirements.
good,"If you like to be micro-managed, then this is the job for you. Plenty of overtime, Union area, working alone most of the time. Great co-workers, good pay. Very poor health benefits (Obama Care)."
good,The culture has changed over the years.  You are not fairly compensated for the work that is required.  The system crashes often and there are constant changes to the compensation plan.
good,The field tech at Windstream are useless.  They hire whoever to do the job cheap instead of paying a qualified person.  The CEO here been transparent during the rebuild.
good,The company has changed a lot in the last 2 years.  Management has changed over and is mostly run now from managers that were acquired in the Earthlink acquisition.  Sales is hard driving
good,"I love the job. It is fast paced and different every day. The software is outdated and glitches every day. Trying to do your job is frustrating. As soon as you start hitting goals and making money,  they raise the goals."
good,"No clear leadership at my level, Little to no advancement, lack of quality training. Frequent changes in job duties and requirements. Lack of communication from management."
good,"little to no advancement, lack of quality training, poor leadership and communication from management. Continuously changing management and job role duties."
good,"I did like the work at Windstream, especially any changes that had to go in. It was a feeling of accomplishment when the changes went through and all was good with it."
good,"This company has somewhat of a work life balance. Most of the management was good to work for, however they needs to be more done to acknowledge the employees and create opportunities for career advancement. Overall, it was a good company to work for. Definitely need to work on being competitive with benefits and salary. Salary is way below compared to other companies."
good,"Windstream was my first and only foray into Local Exchange And Competitive Exchange Carrier business. It was miserable because I found that all of the carriers was terrible at service and delivery. I had roughly 40% of all my sales were cancelled. I had 1 client threaten to ruin my professional reputation for Windstream's failure.  Cohorts that had worked at AT&T, Verizon, or others told me that level or lack of performance was norm for the industry. No thanks. I will stick to technology and equipment sales."
good,"Work life, Limited advancement, limited training. Routine periodic layoffs"
good,The actual work is enjoyable with reasonable pay and okay benefits. The only reason for finding another employer at this time is that it is questionable how long the current position will exist.
good,"comp plan changes unexpectedly, poor communication from upper management, high demand but poor quality. things are not fixed on a ground level which snowballs through the process. Customers are overlooked and the customer to manager ratio is unrealistic to manage."
good,"Good job, just no room for advancement and no job security going forward due to acquisition of three other companies since I was hired."
good,"Windstream is okay, if you like ATM, DSL and DS1.  But there are other departments that I can't speak on, due me not working in those areas.  Management could be better."
good,Nothing is ever as it seems orders are never right. Windstream does things on the fly some times they work and other times it doesnt. Sales is the driver of this company.
good,"Unable to really give a review.  Windstream acquired EarthLink and eventually all positions in Atlanta will be eliminated, merging and moving everything to their Home Office Little Rock, AR."
good,Job duties involved interacting with customers throughout the United States auditing bills and verifying compliance with federal and state discount programs. Windstream is always looking for ways to do more with less. Windstream is extremely reluctant to invest in replacing old infrastructure with new infrastructure like fiber to the home.
good,"Nice coworkers, relaxed environment. Terrible back end processes. Organized chaos.The company needs to create a path to advancement and make it easy for the teams to be successful in their roles. The high turnover rate is astonishing."
good,"Fortune 500 company with a lot of internal issues as well as network is not updated in many areas for bandwidth,  Provisioning is not well-organized, Management keeps changing,  They roll products out before well-tested, Too much micro-management."
good,"Pay is good, work isnt bad.  Poorly managed company.  They eliminate as many workers as possible and take millions in bonuses.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
good,"In this day I usually work with upset customers as this company has many issues when it comes to fulfilling customer requests. However, the job itself is not hard. Basic computer skills and common sense are needed."
good,It was hard to feel good about promoting sub-standard service at high cost to customers. Call volume does not equal opportunity.
good,will explain in conversation. would love have to the convesation in person in light of windstream standards.  do not feel comfortable in in describing this. Windstream is good company to work for...just some things that i have noticed
good,"Worked at Windstream for (14) months.  Had three (3) different managers due to downsizing, ""re-alignment"" and changing structure.  When your manager is located in a different state, all he/she knows about you is what is reported in CRM software, the occasional conference call and monthly metrics.  Seemed like every three months, new corporate directive on what to sell, where to sell and to whom.  Lost a good manager with over 8 years with the company simply because someone else in a different state decided on what he/she saw on paper.  Either sell or you're gone."
good,over thirteen years working at this job.  Learned alot in this high paced environment.  Not sure why I have to write a review???
good,A typical day is spending on customer appointment and addressing customer concerns. Time management is very important. Co-Workers are supportive and willing to assist. The hardest part of the job is the system integration challenges however you adapt and make it work. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people.
good,A typical day at work included calling current account base to check in and/or follow up with customer inquiries.  The main part of the job was to renew and upsell existing customers.  Management expected account manager to be on-call for customers 24/7 and did not promote a work-life balance.  There were also several technical issues that caused outage of services which caused many accounts to churn.
good,A large organization that is still trying to blend the many companies it has assimilated through mergers and acquisitions. The local sales team was great to work with and the product managers were also quite helpful.
good,Cold Calling is your main objective if you like to make tons of calls and stare at a computer screen this is a job for you. Pay is decent and perks are great.
good,Overall good company but having challenges with network outages and disparate networks.
good,Not a bad gig. You do some ok things. It could be better. Like more actual work instead of busy work.
good,Only had one week.  Had a voicemail at 5:18pm on Friday evening that I was no longer needed.  
good,"The company split in 2006 and I enjoyed the project lead on system setup of the new employee benefit systems, leave of absence system and pension systems.   I thrive on a challenge. "
good,"Stock market is clear focus.  Customer Satisfaction - not so much.  When the stocks go down, you can expect some type of personnel changes.  Communication between departments is terrible.  "
good,"The pay was better than average and there are some very good people working there but, unless you are willing to deal with the internal stress of the feeling like you must comprimise your personal ethics to excel in this job, its not advisable to accept a position with this company"
good,i spend the day answering calls from field technicians and working orders sent in from customer service.
good,"Fast paced environment answering100+calls daily, which may require a lot of multitasking. Learn to be a fast learner with solving customer issues and de-escalating the call with angry customers. Although environment can be stressful which can affect you mentally and physically"
good,"Windstream has the best opportunity to rise above the traditional ""telecom"" company stereotype, but it has a ways to go still. While their product mix is top notch, the sales culture is still mired in the same backstabbing, ""sales-at-any-cost"", low ethics mentality. If you are not willing to steal your neighbors leads while they aren't looking, you will not survive."
good,great team to work for. Corroborative group that believes in remedying issues and work together to find optimal solutions for there customers. Management is informative and push for growth constantly.
good,"The day/day operations at Windstream were hectic at times, however, the workload and responsibilities made my position as an operations manager rewarding. My markets of responsibilities were in western NY and western PA. As such, there was considerable traveling required in meeting with my team and visiting the various sites. it was enjoyable to work with such talented colleagues."
good,At Present the company does not have much stability because of the industry evolution and technology changes. It is a very Volatile place to work as with many Telecom providers.
good,"Windstream provided a friendly and flexible work environemnt.  With a company as large as Windstream is, there was a great deal a flexibility as to locations to work from around the country.  Additionally, Windstream allowed for certain positions to be remote locations.  This was a great benefit."
good,"Good, long career here. Learned a lot in the telecom business. Good benefits and wellness program. Good pay. Could use better leadership skills. More opportunities for career advancement."
good,"The job itself is not for the weak. It’s not difficult but not meeting sales is not acceptable, and even when you do, it’s not enough. They always want more. It’s a money hungry company who puts all the stress on you to make those sales. It’s a stressful environment that is non stop. Personally, I couldn’t handle the stress anymore."
good,"Start at 8am start computer and emails"
good,Can be a great place to work.  Many departments to chose from. Many people will become life long friends. Hardest part is the benefits as they are subpar.
good,"I've worked there for several years now and only had one opportunity for advancement. I've been groomed for more and made promises, but most other promotions follow the good ol boy club rule."
good,Really business days. Not enough pay no increase in pay ever. Schedule and time off hours are never available. The most fun part about the job is my team.
good,If you want networking experience this is the place to go. Windstream is ok. A lot of Voluntold instead of Volunteer though.  I've been here a long time. It's pros and cons to every employment place.
good,"I first started working at Windstream in 2007, it was like hitting the jackpot everybody pretty much skip to work. But now that my department has been outsourced to Dominican Republic, I feel there is a lack of job security. I honestly do not know what's next."
good,Not a very great place to work at and has zero room to get promoted as well as no manager presence at all.  The management is unlikely to do anything about complaints and doesn't keep people working.  Wouldn't recommend it.
good,A typical day was monitoring systems and doing billing along with tollfree loads. I learned alot about unix and how our billling system worked. My manager was very hard to work for. He had no patience and was very 2 faced and that was the hardest part of my job. He did not know how to manage at all and felt like he wanted most of my team to fail.  Overall I enjoyed all the other employees I felt like a team with them. We stuck together and developed a friendship.
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job is the interaction with the employees.  I've made several friends in the 7.5 years I've been with the company and have enjoyed going to work because of them."
good,I look fondly at my time at Windstream.  The company has really transformed both in size and vision from when I first started working there.  In my early days it was more like a startup company than the behemoth that it is today.
good,"I think the top tier leaders have a great vision.  But it seems to be lost in translation as it moves down the EVP, SVP, VP flow.  I wish them the best of luck"
good,"Working at the Windstream data center was not atypical for data center work. Everyday had unique challenges, with working on a little bit of everything."
good,Very stressful  environment. You must meet sales quotas while working 40-50 hours a week no matter road conditions you are r quoted to be there . No job advancement opportunities
good,Executive leadership direction and personnel changes bi-annually. Quarterly revenues were missing street forecasts thus there were numerous reduction in forces layoffs the past several years.
good,"Management is flexible"
good,"Windstream is trying to redefine itself as a growth company. Due to a lot of customer churn, the company is offsetting that loss with consistent workforce reductions. They have a solid plan, and are doing a lot of great things to be successful in 2018. However, the environment right now is volatile."
good,The job requires too much stress put on the employee and the management for the sales department is very unprofessional. There is a lot of favoritism within the company.
good,They don't have a good product and terrible customer service. It has been difficult to sell their services. Customers don't like them. my boss didn't provide coaching or assist when I needed help.
good,"People working at the Windstream are the best employees I worked with, but it was lack of clear directions from the Management. They grow externally and not internally."
good,Decent place to work.Very good training program. New product offerings have made the company a lot more competitive in the industry.  I would recommend the company to a friend.
good,"The company is in so much flux, it is hard to know what is going on.  There were (5) major layoffs in the 11-months I was there.  Everyone is constantly wondering if they will have a job the next day."
good,Windstream started out ok when they acquired Paetec back in 2011. They switched to a business model they couldn't sustain and their pricing couldn't compete with other providers that were offering the same service at a minimum. As a result I was a victim of a workforce reduction.
good,"Working at Windstream could be a challenge and could be very rewarding.  I worked on the Help Desk, assisting internal customers and was a trainer for new members of the team."
good,"It's not a terrible environment to work, However Windstream's tends to frequently over promise and under deliver on the customer lever. Management  & sales departments do not know enough about our products to be effective at their positions. I would say the companies future is not heading in a healthy direction."
good,"Project coordination was a very fast-paced environment, that was highly stressful. This position left little job work/life balance as there were many hours worked during the day."
good,"I felt like my true talents went unrecognized because I was contracted as a transport engineer and the assignment was NOC provisioning. I was not given the opportunity to grow my skills and felt tat I was being under utilized at the NOC prov level.  Worked with some really good people for the most part but others were not so good to work with.  Management, i will leave that to another review for now."
good,"Company was good for a while, new CEO, new company directives, new acquisitions not cohesive or well planned. Large company whose managment changes frequently along with directions and target for market/sales. They do not have any handle or connection with their employees. Difficult to advance when your direct supervisor changes every 3yrs."
good,"Company culture is exceptional customer experience.   A joke.   Not drinking the kool aid.   Top Heavy.   Preach from the Ivory Tower, without firsthand knowledge from the troops.    Which way is the wind blowing?   Ask management so they can preach new direction.     Process driven company.   This isn't a sales company and the leadership truly is clueless.   Wouldn't be surprised to see changes if the stock continues to drop (even after the acquisitions --- Earthlink and BroadView)."
good,Overall good company to work for. Challenges from extensive workload and some lack of life/work balance. Good culture overall and good management as a whole. Senior Management is inconsistent with vision and goals of the company.
good,Management team was continuously changing which decreased confidence in the company.  Stressful because there was no organization throughout the company.
good,"Windstream was okay, but I've heard that Tierpoint is a step above.  Have considered going back, but still undecided."
good,"Windstream was, in 2012, a pretty good place to work.  It was getting to the point where it had too many directors and vp's and not enough middle and lower management and actual workers - the folks who actually make it all come together."
good,"-A typical work day at windstream is taking 40-60 calls per day"
good,"Not only does the right hand not know what the left is doing, it doesn't even know it exists- Acquisitions are made, but no integration after the fact- Big mess, and am embarrassed it took me so long to quit- Learned alot trial by fire, but lost alot of hair in the process- if you have experience and talent, go somewhere else"
good,the sales teams are not align by accounts or geography.  It is a free for all in the various sales regions...
good,"Windstream has implemented a corporate culture program that should help it to succeed in the future.  This program incorporates financial results, customer promoter scores, and employee survey results."
good,Windstream  was a fun place to work but their product was not a good product however the price of their product was a great price which made selling their product very easy. The immediate supervisors were great.
good,"Duties include high inbound volume of customer phone calls"
good,"Prospecting and running appointments daily."
good,"I work in a fast-paced, high stress VoIP repair center where we work independently and collaboratively to resolve service affecting issues within a timely manner. At Windstream, I have learned network routing and translations, data and VoIP. The management at Windstream is experiencing growing pains as Windstream has recently acquired PAETEC Holding Corps which is where I worked before we were acquired. My co-workers are hard working and very dedicated individuals who put all of their efforts in providing a positive customer experience. The hardest part of my day is how understaffed we are. The most enjoyable part of my work is that I am able to assist customers to find resolution to their service affecting issues, whether they be a network issue or a customer equipment issue."
good,"They are not worried about the workers, they would rather hire contractors and close down centers than to promote, pay, or care about employees themselves. God forbid you are acquired by this company you will probably be out of a job soon."
good,I have worked for the company for 20 years. It has been a good run. I learned a lot about the ever changing technology. I have met a lot of great co workers that have become lifetime friends.
good,"Decent but lacking in some places.  Can be very loud with strange politics and unethical behaviour. Also, it can be very pleasant and quiet.  It's  a blessing and a curse."
good,"Difficult to get promoted, even if you do the right things and provide exceptional value.  Not a very vibrant work atmosphere at the Little Rock headquarters.  Aside from the negative, there are respectful people in this company that are pleasant to work with, and pay is fair."
good,"Extreme sales pressure with unrealistic goals. Company’s product is good in some areas, and absolutely terrible in others.  Expected to sale the terrible product the same as the best.  Makes for awkward coaching sessions when going over calls with upset customers you’re expected to sale too."
good,"Customers are coming in to pay their phone and internet bills.  Many times they are late and want late charges waived or they want a discount.  You need to work with them to explain why these cannot be waived or if they have a legitimate complaint then you need to provide a refund for them."
good,Windstream was a good place to work but the uncertainty with thee= company's future made it stressful and hard to improve performance with constant workforce reductions
good,"Job was monitoring systems and running billing batch jobs on multiple systems, monitoring the backups of those systems and dealing with any errors which might occur by correcting the error if possible or calling the on-calls for corrective solutions as necessary  , Mainframe CA7, UNIX boxes and AS/400.  I worked remotely for the Twinsburg Command Center.   The people I worked with in Twinsburg were a really great bunch of people, including the managers.   The hardest part of the job was when the company started to farm out many of it's applications to companies in India, when needing contact them about errors many of those folks spoke very poor English, nice people but very hard to understand if at all."
good,"Good pay, not a bad place.  I have been there over 15 years and they are really flexible.  It has been a progression since day 1.  We have merged with several companies and its always a change. Embrace it!"
good,"Company is going backwards. Management seems not to care about what effects the work.  "
good,"A good hard worker , and my customers loved my work .  Very responsible   Good personal skills  always on time  worked overtime if needed  and help coworkers in  their areas  very good temanate"
good,"Direct management since I've been with this company have been great. There seems to be way too many personnel in upper management."
good,Windstream is an Ok place to work. A lot of layoffs lately makes one concerned.  No much room for advancement. There is also room for more training Typical call center.
good,The management at this branch was poor. Initially no weekends were required but become so. Unorganized management style. Overall unhappy with this job experience.
good,"Good place to work can be stressful at time rewarding at the end of the day when customers are satisfied, rapidly growing company. Family friendly, would recommend for employment"
good,"my job was eliminated after several buy outs that reduced our companies overall revenue. the company itself was top heavy. several VPs and way too many in management. At one point, i had 3 bosses."
good,"Its a good company to work for but I never got ahead because I was too remote to move up and to do the work that I was trained to do. "
good,"There are many pros to working at Windstream. The employees are great people, willing to help you to learn. The pay and benefits are good. Con's are depending on the job, family/life balance is not a priority."
good,"They do a good job, but days can run to be monotonous. Great people, Good Culture. The most enjoyable part of the job, was the relationships, and the people the you work with."
good,"Not given more headcount, technicians, managers, and leads are overworked.  Upper management makes decisions without regard for how it will affect frontline employees."
good,"The telecom industry continues to consolidate and Windstream has contributed to it through multiple acquisitions. This has led to high debt and many reorganizations."
good,Very challenging company.  Sales goals are unreal for a small town.  Very much enjoyed my co-workers and made several friends.  Have kept in touch with many co-workers since purchasing and moving to Florida.
good,Windstream is a company made up of multiple companies via acquisition.  Company struggles to identify their corporate culture.  Very high turn-over at the senior management level
good,"Great time in my career, where I moved from management level opportunities and challenges to director level for various IT Governance positions.  This was originally a company called PAETEC when I started."
good,"This was a merger from my company Earthlink. I do not have any conmplaints or much to add to the experience, it was only a short period that I worked under Windstream. I though loved my job as a security analyst under Earthlink.  I also enjoyed management and my co-workers."
good,"Day to day responsibilities includes managing your book of existing clients whom already have services with Windstream.  Growing your book and retention of existing clients are the priorities."
good,"There was always something new to learn which is always good. The company was corporate so you didn't feel valued as an individual."
good,"I enjoyed working at Windstream for the most part. The people, the positive work ethic and the culture all made the experience fun. "
good,answer phones and sold products explained billing answered questions about bill or products took call and ran three different computer systems daily had competitions for sales
good,"Working at Windstream is very challenging, fast paced, but at the same time rewarding because you learn something new every day"
good,"Overall products and services were good, by comparison to the competition.  It's your typical telecom sales job, go get new clients and sell into existing.  Most people are good to work for, however the sales leadership team never seem to foster a positive work experience."
good,Too many lay offs.  Employees were scared every month  thinking there would be another lay off.  The company brought PAETEC and everything changed and not for the better
good,"Troubleshooting, problem resolution and escalation requests top the list for daily tasks.  Working as a team is the #1 key to success."
good,"Job was good, as a network tech I was involved with a lot of projects I learned a lot working as a Network Tech maintaining the central office. installing and testing was one of my main focus."
good,"Your career isn't the focus, closing the sale is the focus.  The training is excellent, however, the leadership is not.  You are driven to make money and your career isn't important to the organization."
good,Time consuming not a family friendly job.. stressful with sales quota.
good,Windstream has been a good company to work as with all companies you have your pros and cons but overall I am satisfied.
good,Quiet enviroment busy and lost of work.  Excellent pay.  Co-workers were great to work with.
good,"During my time with Windstream, I have learned multiple pieces of equipment.  The Telecom industry is ever changing, and we have done a good job at keeping up with the technologies that help make us successful.  My co-workers are what keep me coming back.  I find getting to know people at work goes a long way toward getting things done.  The hardest part of the job is the workload, however we still seem to find a way to get things done."
good,a typical day is meetings every morning and telemarketing when I am an outside sales rep. The company has implemented a micro-management style that combined with the meeting times takes away my true prospecting and appointment time. My co-workers are great but all feeling the change.
good,"Fast paced environment answering100+calls daily, which may require a lot of multitasking. Learn to be a fast learner with solving customer issues and de-escalating the call with angry customers. Although environment can be stressful, but there is positive management available."
good,Technical positions are being outsource and losing many valuable people. The positions are underpaid but the people you worked with made the difference.The culture is drastically diminishing.
good,I learned a lot while working for this company and I certainly increased my telecom knowledge. Working from home was a perk but it took the team connection away.
good,"Windstream experience is something that is hard to describe, but is not made for those who are soft or easily get their feelings hurt. This is a hard environment, that is both professionally rewarding and emotionally draining. Compensation is strong, but culture and balance are a bit off putting."
good,A fast paced environment. Windstream offered ample training opportunities for career development. A quick way to learn about cabling and problem solving.
good,"I worked there for may years and several different jobs,  I learned a lot and they tried to make working there fun. helped a lot of customers,  that made me happy."
good,"I started in sales with the company. The stress level was very high. I was able to transfer to the financial department. The financial department was fun, rewarding, and more laid back. I enjoyed helping customers resolve their financial disputes."
good,Windstream is the real example of growth. They bring you in with minimum knowledge and train you to become expert in whatever role you are assigned to perform.
good,"If you were a head hunter it was very hard, if you had assigned accounts it give you a base to build on.  They have a good sales process and make sure you understand it."
good,"Cannot provide review due to form required to be signed to obtain my severance pay from Windstream. However, the pay was okay, andother than the healthcare, benefits were okay"
good,"I worked there for 5+ years and they did not appreciate me one bit. They do not pay enough money for all of the work thrown your way. The turnover rate is very high, FYI."
good,There is not much room for growth because the management team has been in place 10+ years. Windstream does have a higher turnover rate because of the quality of people hired.
good,"Assisted customers with home entertainment solutions through a consultative sales approach.  Interacted with customers in a fast paced, high tech environment, using multiple computer systems.Advised customers of all products available to suit their needs"
good,Windstream has taught me a lot over the years and has also trained me in my position to be caught up on up and coming technology. Overall experience is great
good,Over time stocks dropped and workload went down CEO wanted to go after the big fish and cast SMB to the side. This caused lots of financial problems in the company.
good,"Really enjoy working for windstream but there have been more and more layoffs, management just tells you to work hard.    I don't feel employee's contributions are something the company doesn't focus on."
good,"I was only a temp 3 month contractor there at the Help desk, but the overall work environment was not team oriented. I didn't feel welcome and it was difficult to get proper training. The manager had little communication with the group I felt.  Many of the HD employees worked from home every day - barely coming in once a month, so it didn't feel like a team and getting help or training was hard via Im with a group of 20 people all asking and answering at the same time."
good,"The company was a very positive place to work until they rolled out a new program that was supposed to bring all departments in one system. The system was so bad, we were able to do our jobs with the old system in read only mode. Our time spent trying to help customers went up 400%. Being one of a total of 40 top level reps, our first line techs, who did very little trouble shooting were dumping calls on us because the system was even more of a disaster than ours. We had more access, but we used every program we could , besides the new rollout and we were able to almost do our jobs. Techs in the field received the same program and it could take over an hour, easily, to get basic internet in a new customers home."
good,"The hardest part of the job was the ability to provide what was sold in a smooth and timely fashion. Also, within FL the company was singled threaded in regards to it network which provided a single point of failure."
good,"Check tickets, Service orders or trouble tickets. Call customers to let them know we would be working on their issue. Work the trouble ticket or service order in the order assigned and continue until all orders are completed."
good,Decent place to work. Just have to make sure its not a lifestyle.They will want you to work instead of family time. Other than that its a good place. Just have to go with the pace and not get stressed out.
good,"I worked for Alltel, which was the name of the company before it became Windstream and it was a fantastic place to work. I started in the warehouse and moved into purchasing and later data analysis. The company promoted from within based on your work, pay and benefits were excellent. I think the quality of the company went downhill after it was split up."
good,"the job is learning, and is a healthy upbeat company. the knowledge is always flowing. if you want to learn and teach yourself then wind stream is in the realm."
good,"When Windstream bought out PAETEC, there were thousands that lost their jobs & company culture changed for the worst.  Compensation for admin staff is very poor."
good,Windstream Communications is a company that is centered in a thriving industry. You have the option to work on several businesses as well as the opportunity to get promoted from within.
good,Enjoyed my time and had an awesome manager the last 2 years.  Unfortunately upper management cares about covering their butt with the shareholders and making it look like they made money and would rather just lay people off instead.
good,Work environment comfortable. Big parking lot. Very busy working space. Two employees to a cubicle. Ice machine. Several places in area for lunch deliveries.
good,"nice people to work with, managers and peers willing to help on anything you might need to further your knowledge, very pleasant atmosphere, free coffee"
good,This company is professional but the network is not in prime populations.   Rural areas.  When I worked there they were very slow to integrate new companies  and databases.  Pay meets industry averages and peers weretypically friendly.
good,Local telecom company that specializes in small business circuits and large scale VOIP offerings. They partner with longhaul carriers to supply ciruits
good,Worked 18 yrs with the company an layed off. Just throughout the last few years there has been no raises and hundreds of lay offs. I truly enjoyed working with all the employees there. Just wish the company had a little more to offer them.
good,"Working day was around 10 hours, I learned much about VOIP Phone Systems and Network capabilities. Very strict management but extremely knowledgeable. I enjoyed working with the staff and my manager, Interesting network services."
good,"If you are into the call center thing, could be a great job. I really didnt have any issues, other than I found out I am not a call center type of person. Management was easy to talk to"
good,"Daily spreadsheets, different types of equipment, last manager was great and very knowledgeable. And okay workplace culture, the hardest part was other departments communicating to keep the orders on task. To learn more about the technical parts of the communication business"
good,"Customer Service was my role, they stress sales, but didn't pay you as much for sales and they have a sales department. They have also done a lot of lay offs."
good,"Offering great products but pre-installs are challenging.  Also, it is hard to do everything with a skeleton crew which causes some issues with customers."
good,"The good old boy White is Right system is alive and well at Windstream. African Americans have no chance of advancement to upper management beyond the sales organizations. All other  Directorships, Vice-President, President, any CEO type positions in the other organizations in this company are all held by white men and women or other ethnicities of non African American origin."
good,A typical day consists of processing orders. People are typically unhappy at their jobs and culture declined over the years. No room for career growth.
good,"No complaints about the higher ups in the company, but day to day work was inconsistent and usually slow.  Many layoffs over the past few years which prevented me from encouraging others to work there."
good,"Local management is excellent, pay & benefits are good.  Co-workers are friendly and helpful with passing on knowledge of the job and always willing to help."
good,I'm a contractor and I started a year ago. The company was merged with Earth link and now there are laying off people. I'm not the best person to review the company. However my experience here has been very nice so far.
good,easy place to work great co-workers clean atmosphere management had hard time deciding what job to do first and changeof building ordersd orders in the building
good,"Fast paced, a great culture, learn something new every day!  If you are looking for a super fast paced environment, this is a great place to be.  Lots of new products and technology to learn as well."
good,Great job but I ran to health issues or I would still be there.  Friendly place and people.  Good insurance and great atmosphere Like I said if I did not get sick I would still be there.
good,"The job description changed very often, as well as our duties. I learned SIP, and VoIP services, and troubleshooting. There were days when lunch was offered as well."
good,Great team of people i worked with on a local level. The company has made some acquisitions and are going through a re branding process and are trying to find their way again.
good,"Selling High speed internet to business"
good,windstream has extremely high turn around rate most people only work a few months because of the schedule did  see a lot of concern for employees and it showed
good,I was able to work from home.  Worked 40 hours a week. enjoyed the people. Some of the management staff was great but a lot really did not care about you.  The moral of the employees was very low.
good,"Great people working at Windstream, however, job security is virtually not existing. "
good,"At Windstream you are a number.  They expect 150% but in a blink of an eye - you find yourself looking for a job.  Loyalty to the company is expected but sadly, not appreciated when the rubber meets the road."
good,"Supportive management, provides education and training that I did not see working with other carriers.Coworkers, new office coming, slowly improving technology."
good,Good place to work I like the place people are nice. its close to where I live. Everyone is helpful. Great schedule okay training. breaks and lunches are great.
good,"Good company to work for, just couldn't do the hours they were wanting. Good pay and benefits though and they also pay commission. if your good at sales then this is a good job for you"
good,"Windstream IT has a relaxed, but quick-paced environment. However, benefits are practically non-existent. Management likes to spend money on vendors rather than employees. Opinions go unheard."
good,"Work pace is relaxed and not at all hectic."
good,There is a fun work environment with a good management team. You do have a heavy work load. They do provide computer based training on many things related to your position.
good,Typical day at work is answering calls in an inbound call queue with a minimum calls taken requirement of 40 calls per day. You are required to meet specific metrics on a daily basis.
good,I enjoyed the people and the environment.  In engineering I had many tasks and enjoyed the different aspects of my job.  Learning new technology was always exciting.
good,Great place to start in telecom industry. Friendly staff to work with  and management is well knowledgeable. Diverse workplace and employees are always able to provide feedback for improvement
good,"Windstream Communications provides high-speed broadband Internet, phone service and Digital TV packages to residential customers as well as products and services for small, medium and large businesses, and government agencies."
good,The parent company of Windstream was less than impressive but the division of Hosted Solutions was a great organization to be a part of.  It was recently acquired and is now known as TierPoint.
good,when it comes to the review that I have of Windstream communications I would have to say that it is a productive work place and a good atmosphere to work in.
good,"The management is consistently changing and mass layoffs occur every quarter. The department I worked in had tons of projects available but when layoffs occurred, these projects were divided among other team members and added to their already heavy loads."
good,It wasn't a bad place to work.  They gave me a great deal of flexibility in my hours.  Pay was sub-par no raises and new hires were paid more than long term employee's.
good,Management is excellent. Beautiful office with opportunity to make uncapped commission. Good entry level position. Product knowledge training could be better. Must be a go- getter.
good,"I really enjoyed my job here for 6 years. A typical day would be taking calls, uncovering the concerns of the customers to sales products of internet, phone and tv. Place orders to get installed and confirm the customers solution to new services. Give due date. I took a least 40 calls per day. Also coached team mates on best practice procedures for calls."
good,Windstream is an interactive place to work and is on the road to being a very successful company. Their biggest flaw is not taking care of their employees and creating a positive environment.
good,Windstream is a good and stable company.  It has been in acquisition mode for some time gobbling up smaller CLEC and telecom services companies.  Work / life is tough to balance when a company is in growth mode.  There are a lot of good people there.
good,"co workers were friendly and helpful, management was knowledgeable, learned the communications business from the ground up. enjoyed working with the outside pant, engineering was a challage but enjoyed it."
good,I have grown professionally while with this company.  I have been challenged to think outside of the box and have learned more about my strengths and weaknesses.
good,Good company to work for. Still looking at making improvements. Having a broad range of products and services Windstream has provided an excellent learning environment.
good,"Here since 2011, good place to work.  I've met some amazing people, and I've acquired some valuable experience.  Tremendous opportunities are presented to you, and if you wait for it, your time will come."
good,"I found working at Windstream to be too taxing. Although I've been in the IT field since 1998, this was the first time I'd been in this type of Network Engineer position and found it to be a more a glorified customer service job that I wasn't happy with."
good,"•	Resolve customer inquiries, billing issues and product/service concerns"
good,"Responsibilities include prospecting new accounts, maintained existing accounts, and collaborating with internal business partners to maintain customer satisfaction.  Overseeing customer accounts.  Prospecting new business by networking, cold calling, research and referrals."
good,I would like to say that overall experience has been very good with this company also would like to add most managers there were good professionals.
good,i was commercial teller handling large deposits and waiting on customers inside the bank and also at the drive thru window
good,Process orders to hand off to translations so services/accounts can be disconnected. I learned to pay closer attention to details and prioritize tasks as the day went. The hardest part of the job was aligning dual orders to process simultaneously.
good,Good place to work but the pay is not commensurate with the skills.
good,"There have been numerous names on the door (NetTelcos, Expedient, Cavalier, PaeTec, Windstream) but I am still here going strong."
good,The lack of documented processes and standards creates a challenging environment and culture. There is a lot of potential opportunities available to the company.
good,The typical day at Windstream consisted of taking inbound calls of customers who had questions about billing or needing to make payment arrangements.
good,I enjoyed my time here and all the people I got to know. It was a great learning experience with sales . I became a better employee at this job as it allowed me to grow in my sales career with its continuing education with products and solution selling.
good,It was great company to work for but in recent years a lot has changed
good,"A typical day at work for me was striving each day to succeed for the company and myself as a whole. I learned about new products and services offered on the land line side of the communication business. My co-workers were more like family, I spent more time with them than at home with my family. I met some wonderful people while employed there. The hardest part of the job to me was overcoming the objections related to credit approval guidelines with today's economy.The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to work with the public, building trust and rapport with my customers."
good,"Windstream is a company built from numerous acquisitions, and the company is working hard (and is succeeding) in overcoming the obstacles associated with integrations."
good,"Fun workplace and great co-workers. I loved my job, Windstream did some restructuring and my position was eliminated."
good,"A nice place to work."
good,Management was changed all the time. HR was hard to get ahold of to ask questions. Co-workers worked together.
good,"calling on new customers, doing trade shows meeting new people"
good,"Fast-paced, high-stress job. Management focuses on quantity, not quality, which results in high error rate and poor customer satisfaction. High turnover due to burn-out and failure to meet sales goals. Not worth the risk."
good,"Typical work place is very busy, short handed.  Working here has improved my telecom knowledge.  Management could use some training, I love my co-workers, they are great people.  The hardest part of my job is lack of training.  I enjoy not working on the weekends."
good,Corrected all orders that was done incorrectly by the sales team. Called customers to get correct information.  Loved working with my team mates and helping others with issues. Loved helping customers
good,I really enjoyed working at Windstream. I loved the customers and being able to help them on a daily basis
good,Excellent benefits and 401k plan. In over 40 states- recently purchased paetek communications.
good,"Great work enviroment, working with computers, managing the work load, freedom to work at your own pace. Multi-tasking"
good,"Typical work day-check email and any important updates on product information, then start taking calls to resolve customer issues and make a sale opportunity. I learned how to multi-task with consulting over the phone, updating the account information and finding the sales opportunity all at the same time. The management is going through many structural changes. My co-workers were awesome people, very helpful and team oriented. The hardest part of the job was finding a sales opportunity and knowing that my job security is dependent on sales quotas. The most enjoyable part was actually helping the customers and learning what part of the service was well and what part needed improvement."
good,"The company provided good benefits and compensation- base salary + commission, as well as continuous training. Very focused on numbers- # of cold calls, appointments, follow-ups and sales."
good,I didn't like internet work. It just simply was not for me. I didn’t start at Windstream with a background in the field and I feel as if they didn’t give me enough time to progress
good,"Some Network areas are very understaffed and the Switching group is a joke-main job is now checking fire extinguishers, eye wash stations and helping other areas of the Network. Also checking generators, batteries and fuel which could easily be contracted. Lots of overtime and on call."
good,"Though the company took pains to create a positive work environment, the constant upheavals brought about by repeated company mergers/buy-outs created a chaotic environment, with multiple departments overlapping.  There was also always a fear of your job being downsized/removed altogether."
good,"growth opportunities within the organization are limited.  Typically, you need to go outside of the organization for any career advancement."
good,"It's all about financial survival. There have been multiple rounds of layoffs and several reorganizations. Improvement initiatives start and go nowhere. There are a lot of isolated groups, all competing for their own survival, resulting in por communication and lack of standards."
good,"It has been quite some time since I worked at Windstream the environment is typical call center the opportunity for advancement is very much a ""who you know"" kind of situation. Also, when they run contests they never check to see who was placing ""fake sales"" where they really just updated codes for the customer to new codes that kept the exact same services but looked like they made a sale this mostly only worked for internet sales. Not the best and not the worst call center environment"
good,New communications comany only about 10 years old but growing and purchasing other companies to enhance their product offering. Windstream competes against local cable and fiber providers
good,"The work is challenging, and the pay is great. However, there is a very high likeyhood of being downsized at a moments notice. Many employees are let go after many years of service"
good,"WS was a great company to work for in the beginning. The culture and work appreciate was great at first, but they management started putting pressure on agents to sale more even though sales was not a may responsibility."
good,"Some good opportunities to learn some new things. No need to work weekends or late hours. Never had trouble meeting deadlines. Management was good for me, however I've heard bad things about management in other departments. Lots of layoffs happened so people are always on edge about their job."
good,Sr Management would have done better if the team would have taken a closer look at the clec structure and made a few changes. On the ilec side more focus from engineering with the local upgrades with bandwidth would have been better. Too many complaints.
good,"Raises are few and far between, people generally get ""promoted"" laterally. "
good,"A respected and long standing business with coworkers with a career commitment to the company, until restructuring and buy out. Rewarding experience in a stressful environment."
good,Windstream is experiencing several reduction in workforce which creates an unstable work environment as job security is at risk. Windstream is moving away from TDM switching to Voice over IP which will result in additional job loss.
good,it is busy at times but other times it is dead. it just depends on who you're working with if you have fun or not. some of the team leads or supervisors do not do very much for helping.
good,"Windstream has a lot going for it, but the telecom business is very competitive and it's very difficult for any one company to thrive.  With time they will settle into what works for them as they've been trying many different ways to approach the business over the last few years.  So many good and intelligent people work there.  I know they will turn the stock price and their fortunes around."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Windstream.  The people I worked with were friendly and provided for a pleasant work experience.  The company provided lunch  on special occasions and allowed for plenty of personal time off, vacation pay, sick time.  The schedules were flexible as well as lunch breaks."
good,"Very fast paced - highly stressful environment with a strong emphasis on customer and employee relations. "
good,"Culture is a little dated; however, the have the desire to change.  They ask that you think strategically but incentives are structure in a tactical way.  Management is trying to make the changes to take the sales organization to the next level."
good,Windstream is a good company to work for at least it was until this year when they ripped away our health insurance. They also have a terrible tendency to not give but 1% raises for the past 3-4 years but the executives never miss out of their huge bonuses
good,"Overall, I would say the work atmosphere is great.  Lot of nice employees and great management.  However, I do not see this environment as a place where I could grow my career to where I want to take it.  Company is behind in the industry and as a result not perfomring well, so workers are constantly on watch as there seem to be not much job security."
good,"An interesting point-of-view of the network and its functioning.  Large inventory of differing vendors, so it's difficult to become extremely proficient on any one platform.  On any given shift you may work w/ equipment you've only seen twice in the past 6 months, so it's a regular habit of remembering the functionality."
good,I was working as a contractor at Windstream so I am not the best person to comment on the culture. The best thing for me is I can work from home all the time.A lot of good people to work with in the company is another plus...The job itself was hectic but working from home makes it possible to handle all the things going around.
good,"Depends who you work for I had a nurturing and excellent leader there, Fun work place with one manager that was supportive however her peers and supervisors seemed ignorant of basic management leader skills. No project management, communication plans, no operations management awareness, not trained on scheduling, planning and how to conduct staff meetings. I was able to grow and develop my leadership skills and do wonderful things to advance the companies objective, which was very fullfilling. They would listen you and your ideas. Colleagues and Learning was great."
good,"There are alot of career opportunities at Windstream. This was my first job in telecommunications and I have learned alot so far. However, the training program needs to be improved."
good,"Worked as Wholesale Implementation Engineer II, processing orders that customer's submitted, and ensured that the orders were done in a timely and caring manor."
good,Windstream is a call center. You have approximately a 4 week paid training. People who have previous call center experience seem to adjust faster than those that don't. The learning curve is fair. Approximately 4-6 months.
good,Windstream is a pretty good place to work. The main thing that I have seen that they need to improve on is customer relations.
good,"They are on their way to be a good company with new technology."
good,"Relaxed work setting. Schedule changes can occur at any time, but requests can be made to accommodate. Leadership provides direction as needed. If offering customer is your expertise or desire, this position will pay dividends for your energy and time."
good,Good environment and good co-workers. Good work hours and good pay. Supportive management.   few advancement opportunities. Training is very quick and vague at times.
good,"*Promoted and sold phone and internet service to small businesses in the Dalton and Chatsworth area"
good,"The PC will be responsible for planning and scheduling each customer through whole life cycle of provisioning process. The goal for this group is to provide the customers a consistent experience no matter who is involved in the task or what the task is for. The PC Major Accounts will be a SME in the areas of project coordination and will assist with training new-hires, as well as any on-going training within the department. They may be a back-up for the Supervisors and may be asked to assist in helping with queue management, handling complex orders and escalations"
good,"Windstream has wonderful people to work with but as for getting things done, it is hard to. Because of recent layoffs, teams are overworked & rushed; mistakes are made. Layoffs seem to be always hanging over one's head. Training is not what it once was."
good,Every day brings a new set of challenges and potential for accomplishments.  The downside of diversity--it is hard to prioritize and become proficient.
good,The pay and benefits were great. The overall culture was unpleasant and stressful. Management were more concerned with stats and numbers than changing the overall behaviors.
good,The job started out great! Now the job is dealing with a lot of changes which is causing a lot of stress. You would think that with the company begin 11 years old it would not be so much confusion as it has been in the last few months.
good,Windstream does an excellent job of one on one job training. I would recommend Windstream to anyone who was willing to learn and expand their technical abilities.
good,"When i worked at Windstream, it was a pretty good job. Good Benifits, Great Pay, Great Team Work. The only thing i didnt like was the hours, the every 2 week pay, feeling dumb everytime i ask for help, and the mental exhaustion. I spent entirely to much time at work, almost everyday it was mandatory overtime. and the customers are really hateful and rude, that does take a toll on you"
good,"Winstream helped me elevate the start of my career in sales with hands on education of products/services and approaches to overcoming objectives. Great environment, loved managers, layoffs due occur."
good,"Overall the work is decent. A lot of turn over in the customer support side.  Financial was good. It could  be a little hectic depending on the day of the week. Direct management seemed to be more about how they could look for upper management. At times, it was difficult to get your direct manager to listen to your ideas"
good,"Worked as a BSA answering customer calls for telecommunication company. Dealt with moves, adds and changes of voice and data lines and phone systems as well as downed lines and major outages. Also scheduled technicians, opened tickets, contacted all personnel required to preform job duties. "
good,"My co-workers are great and my direct manager is very flexible, understanding and easy to talk to. Advancement in my department offers very few opportunities. Upper management has made poor decisions recently that have negatively effected my job function."
good,Windstream is a very fast paced environment.  There are multiple opportunities to increase your knowledge regarding the ever changing Communication world.  The hardest part of the job is balancing your work load among multiple programs/systems.
good,My job consists of driving new logo's and increasing base revenue.  Also responsible for Partner relations and helping create creative ways to drive new revenue while building long term realationships.
good,"Worked for the company when it was just 3 years old.  Help them grow from 10 employees to over 35 in 5 years.  Great inuvative, cutting edge solutions that helped local PGH, PA companies progress their server infrastructure into the virtual generation."
good,"Although the company has gotten acknowledged by its rapid growth, it has left many employees as well as customers with more to desire as far as consistency in decision-making, centralization of data, and other important affairs. The particular assignment is interesting and local peers are decent."
good,"Office Manager/Executive Assistant supporting two VP's and 20 Channel Managers that report to them.  "
good,"I am not a good sales person because I treated customers the way I would want to be treated. For example, if their service cost $34.99 a month, their bill is really going to be around $50 because of FCC charges, taxes, ect."
good,Good money. Very competitive work environment. Surrounded by individuals who push you to succeed.
good,Typical internal audit shop focused on operational audits and SOX.
good,This was a great job for me to gain experience and learn a lot.
good,"The Local Sales Manager at my time of employment had little to no Sales Experience and tried to lead a team of seasoned sales reps (Myself Included). "
good,"No training, disparate networks, so challenging to get things done in a timely manner.  management changed often."
good,This is a great place to work. There are numerous ways to move up after being employee for a year. Processes made the job harder and more stressful than it needed to be.
good,"Windstream still seems to be finding its way among its larger competitors like Spectrum and Comcast. They've made some vast improvements over the past few years in terms of profitability, but in terms of day to day communication and clarity with its employees, it can be lacking. Constant layoffs and hirings and rehirings. It's a great place to work for a young professional. The pay is fair and the benefits are solid. However, I would not consider this a place to make your career."
good,"I was in the Test and Turn up department of the company.  When new equipment was put out in the field, we handled the configuration of the new device.  Company was not a bad company to work for, at least not in my dept.  I liked my managers and co-workers.  Was allowed ample time off if needed, as long as you didn't abuse it."
good,I believe Windstream need some improvements in some area to help the company run smoothly. I would come to work and for there to be 3 call center it would always seem like there was only one in the area we would have 200 peoples in the cue and the customers would be furious from waiting extremely long
good,"great comp, good customers..rapidly changing culture, getting better putting customer first."
good,People at the company are great.  Having a little trouble with their business service delivery direction and vision. Will Improve
good,A typical day at work includes working from a pre-determined list of objectives that are generated daily. The work may change from minute to minute due to off-shore integration and workforce reduction.
good,"Since I was the only person responsible for the company wide cell phones, I spent many hours other than my scheduled work day taking care of everyone's needs locally and out in the field making sure that the employees had working company cell phones. I learned the in-outs of the 7 cell phone providers, spoke to the individual reps daily to negotiate the best pricing/plans for upper management as well as field technicians. My immediate boss brought me with her from another state to help start the department/new company. Hardest part of the job was turning around cell phone orders in a 24 hour period with over 4,000+ cell phones. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting will everyone in the company and finally automating and training the administrative assistants on placing on-line orders for their divisions."
good,"We monitored and attempted to resolve issue on the legacy Cavalier Telephone fiber network. This covered 30,000 route miles of fiber ranging from DS3 up to an OC192/10G wave."
good,techs would give good leads for sales and sales wouldn't follow up. Upper management seemed to not want customers and let customers walk out the door.
good,I worked with a great team of hard working individuals. Company offered flexible work from home hours and great benefits with excellent company culture.
good,"My time was short there. During my role, a work from home job came up same money, so I took that. My manager agreed. Would go back in a heart beat if I could."
good,You would come in and log into system which took about 15 minutes because we would have to log into (3) different systems in order to do our work. I learned that I really like billing more than I liked provisioning (O/E). Coworkers were good about helping each other when we were in difficult situation. We were really good team together.
good,Over the last two years the Windstream work environment has challenged me to grow from a student to a professional employee. In the fall of 2010 I was selected to become part of the Windstream Financial Leadership Program. Windstream's leadership program provides recent college graduates an exceptional environment to learn the telecommunications business through job tours that last from 12-18 months. In my time here I have experienced multiple rolls throughout Windstream's Finance organization. These rotations have pushed me to learn the business in ways that would not be possible if I was in the same group.
good,wonderful work environment. Fantastic  supervision. flexible work hours. No pressure datelines and very sociable place to be apart. Pay could be a lot better
good,"My day at work is to to answer phone calls within a 3sec time frame to resolve customers issues, as in helping them make payment or make an arrangments for them. I have learned how to stay on task to be able to multi-task at a fast past inviroment. The hardest part of my job is the hours i work."
good,"Great staff. Great place to work, was a commission based job"
good,"The disconnect is as low as Middle Management to the employees sitting in front of customers. Which in turn flows right back up to higher level executives and so on. Upper and middle management are clueless as to what is happening to the existing customer base, as it is to new logo customers. No communications between teams and departments. They have open positions to hire people and yet still layoff existing employees."
good,"I truly enjoyed taking care of clients and getting new business.  "
good,"Full life cycle corporate recruiter for Sales, Customer Service, Provisioning, and Retention within the Telecommunications industry, responsible for working closely with all hiring mangers to provide the best quality candidates in a timely manner under strict timelines"
good,has a great family like culture. i enjoy that more than anything. I love working with people that care. They pay average. i need more for what I do. money is the motive
good,A typical day at work consisted of getting there 30 minutes prior to going to your desk to get ready to log in. We all said good morning to each other. We worked together we helped one another. We worked systematically as a team. I enjoyed  the atmosphere. We were like a small family all 18 of us we were the first training class in maitland.fl 
good,A typical work day consist of pulling my work from my work que and handling customer issues and working between customer and vendors to resolve problems. I learned how to use work related software across various platforms to accomplish daily tasks and the hardest part of the job is being expected to handle assignment that i was never trained to handle and not having anyone to help. The best part of the job was the flexibility in being able to work from home via VPN.
good,"Loved my job and the people. Learned so much about telecom and equipment."
good,This was a contract position.  Company was laid back and more like a family feel to the environment.  Don't really have a lot of feed back due to I was a contractor so I didn't get to experience the culture of the company
good,"Company OK but no job security,"
good,I would say that the most enjoyable part about the job is the people. They help you grow and learn with in the company and the company will always try everything that they can in order to help you stay with them. They never want to see the employees leave .
good,I enjoyed my supervisor and co-workers. The management was not very good.  I felt like they did not value the employees in our department.
good,I answer phones and place orders for customers accounts. Sales quotas were a little high. I learned several programs and different departments
good,"great pay but there is no support with this job and its hard to do everything that needs to be done, there is also not enough pay for what an everyday tech has to do to complete there job"
good,"Overall is a good company to work for. Dress code is very laid back."
good,As a systems administrator we were always innovating and introducing new technologies.  This gave us the opportunity to learn and stay up with the cutting edge developments.
good,"good team work.  Mgmt lacks direction.  Peers are great and it is very good place to lean VoIP products.  Worked with Ciscos, Adtrans, Junipers, SBC's, and Broadworks."
good,"Good company and dealing with new technology, I feel satisfied about them. and I learned a lot from them by dealing with multi vendor"
good,"Clock in, answer phones, assist customers with accounts and bills. sell products and services"
good,".it was a job, co workers is what made it fun. ot was added / deleted at any time, no advance notice was given but a few hours"
good,"-Send Local Service Requests to ILEC"
good,Inbound calls escalated to tier 2. Assisted customers in configuring routers for broadband use. Uses tools on hand to detect line issues.
good,Constant telephone customer service. People are not always as nice as they can be. No room for error. Very stressed environment. People cursing me on the phone was the hardest. Most enjoyable was the other customer service co workers that I worked with.
good,My typical day started at 5am and ended at 4pm. The Job required engineering equipment for new and existing customers for voice and DSL. I had over 200 ongoing projects and was constantly being requested to finish fore that 40 projects a day.
good,"Fast paced, come to decision points quickly, proper execution a must. This is a financial, bottom line, balance sheet fortune 500. It is all about cost and revenue. You must be focused on driving one or both of those elements."
good,Company is going through some issues but the work environment is laid back as long as work is getting done. There is a lot of room for improvement for the company as well.
good,"Good place to learn, good place to troubleshoot, a lot of resources, great management, nothing perfect, some days go crazy, other days are normal, I am happy with that experience."
good,the manager threw me under the bus and fired me because he had a chip on hi shoulder and the other guys didn't do anything to help me or speak up. needs to be union im your area or don't bother.
good,"door to door division was great. they pay was great and we got commissions. great team atmosphere and work alone or with a group. either way, great company to work for!"
good,"Windstream paid fairly and I work with many great people, the people worked hard and did their best to provide good customer service. Training was an issue in some areas"
good,"A local managers position is a very stressful position at times. Outages on any level is stressful enough, but it keeps me on my toes & my mind sharp. "
good,Windstream is a great company to work for.  Great upper management.  Engineers are the best!  Wasn't here very long before I got recruited to TW Telecom.
good,Really liked working for the company. Only left due to workforce reduction. The pay was competitive and there is opportunity for growth.
good,"Windstream is by no means a bad company.  It is however completely average.  Layoffs come at the end of the year work is monotonous.  They pay well enough but, I have a fear that companies like this will soon be at risk.  In the next 10 years I expect DSL to become a thing of the past and companies like Verizon and At&t with vast wireless networks to completely take over."
good,"Job  security good but very unorganized, purchased a lot of small telecom companies , WS has different platforms in place that are not complete and processes  not clear. They currently making improvements."
good,"Interesting place to work. It can be quite challenging, but overall, it was a good and lasting experience.. I had very good relationship with my co-workers and we treated each other with respect, dignity and professionalism."
good,I had fun working with my co-workers.  It was a stressful kind of position but the commissions were healthy and it was fun work.

good,"Worked customer reported issues regarding service for high speed data/voice circuits.  Customer base was wide ranging, but only vendor customers were knowledgeable."
good,We celebrated everything!!  I learned a lot about different job functions in Financial Services.  I was able to network and build relationships with lots of people here.
good,The workplace culture at the Rochester location was great. The people are what made coming in on a daily basis fun and enjoyable. The job itself could be stressful at times but when you could help a customer out in a timely fashion it made it all worth it.
good,"Overall the Company has great leadership but some of the people making decisions simply don’t have the long term best interests in mind, for the partner. I believe it’s improving and hope they fire those that are unethical."
good,stressful during storm season.  no communication between upper management and work force.  Always seemed like there was a big secret they were hiding.
good,The work life at Windstream was okay.  They did train you. A typical day of work at Windstream consisted of taking customer calls.  You did have a quota.  You had a lunch break and two 15 minute breaks.  management was okay.
good,"Lots of layoffs and outsourcing going on. Causes bad moral around the company right now. The group I work for itself is great however, we work together and we support each other. The raises could be better, however. Only once a year and small percentage raises."
good,Windstream offered the opportunity to have flexible work schedule and the ability to work from home.  With my family's crazy schedule I will need to continue this.
good,"I was able to obtain more experience with software such as SQL Server Management Studio and SQL Server Integration Studio. I had a great mentor who helped me in areas that I had less experience with. There were some days that I didn't have much to do but I was able to learn more about what my coworkers were doing then. However, some of the projects introduced to me were very confusing and I don't feel that I got adequate information to be able to understand what was going on."
good,"I enjoyed interacting with customers and investigating their problems, resolving them and providing intervention of future issues.Some customers needed assistance with their computers and many were elderly and required great patience and understanding. Working with some customers required spending longer periods of time to get first call resolution and I would be penalized for that which I tried, unsuccessfully, to justify."
good,My day typically starts with a meeting in the morning then I am off to visit some of the work sites that I manage.  I then have several conference calls during the day to ensure that all unified communications  devices work properly
good,Well I did not work for Windstream long. I worked for Earthlink that went in with WIndstream. We would work the orders that we had and did some training the Windstream people on our systems.
good,I have worked in several departments and everyone is hard working. They look out for each other and the company. Balanced work/life environment. Plenty of opportunities to advance within the company.
good,"Windstream Communications is an internet service provider & phone company which operates mostly in rural areas, and other areas where other telecom companies won't run lines. They do offer many good benefits. The work environment is very easy-going."
good,"Windstream is known for buying smaller companies then integrating them into the Windstream systems.  So things are always changing.  It can be stressful at times, but for the most part, it's not a bad job."
good,A typical day for me at WIndstream involved me working with one other intern to solve the current issue with our web application. We were left to our own devices on how to best approach the situation. It was a really good learning experience because it involved a lot of self learning.
good,"Over all local Windstream techs and manager good to work with, the knowledge of the Pittsburgh team was above above industry standards, outside support teams not well organized."
good,"I worked in the credit department, receiving & reviewing cases for credit requests. I investigated claims and notified, discussed "
good,"The atmosphere is relaxed.  Management (in my department, specifically) allow you to work without hovering over your shoulder.  There are team food days, team outings, etc., that make you feel good about the team you are a part of.  Like any job, there are challenges, but it is not a high stress-type of environment."

good,It was a great place to work. Learned a lot of new skills. Merger with Earthlink caused lay offs which I was a part of. Would like to go back but it seems that there will be more lay offs. Pay wasn't as high as I thought it should be.
good,"A small but growing telecommunications company, based in Little Rock.  Their sweet spot is small companies, although they keep trying to grow upstream."
good,"Not bad, not great either. If you like IT or are in the IT field it's a great fit. I, however, am not interested or inclined towards IT. I tend to sway more to the hardware side of things."
good,"It was great opportunity to work with such a great company. "
good,"Hired to weekends you never get a chance for a weekend off you will work every weekend as long as you work here, you can never get a day shift, there are not shift bids or chances for another shift unless someone is fired."
good,"A typical day at Windstream is on average a pretty great day. Most people are doing their work and working actively to complete their jobs. Everyone works together to complete a task, and most employees are willing to help one another out in order to complete their work. The most enjoyable part of my job is to work with my co-works effectively."
good,Most enjoyable part is the customers.  There is a wonderful work environment here within the workers although the benefits leave alot to be desired
good,"Work with customers on issues they were having with voice, data and internet. Troubleshot issues with Operations center as well as with customer."
good,"An excellent proving ground for Analysts. Wide variety of technologies from various sources including a surprising array of legacy equipment. Less restrictive than most companies in procedures and directives. "
good,I was constantly on the go to various jobs. Ran into problems on just about every job. Most problems were solved but not before running into overtime which was not paid. We worked a straight 8 hour day no matter if we put more hours in to finish certain jobs.
good,"I worked at Windstream/NuVox for ten years, mostly as internal support and project management. My goal and responsibility was to do whatever it takes to bring revenue to the company. My co-workers were amazing and the management was always helpful in helping me to balance life as a single mother. I enjoyed the people that I worked with and for."
good,The  hurdles  which  i  have  faced  here were  really  challenging  and lead whom i worked under was very supportive and encouraging
good,"Overall, I learned a lot in the telecommunications industry. Management could have been better in a sense they were not as knowledgeable as they should have been. Benefits could have been better."
good,great company to work for laid back environment I would recommend any one that is looking to learn about telecommunication that is a great start
good,"I took about 75 inbound calls per day sold at least $200.00 Internet and phone services per day. Assisted with trouble shooting, decision making, and escalations. I learned patients and knowledge of internet and phone systems. I enjoyed working with my co workers."
good,"Pay isn't great and benefits aren't great but work environment is good and great learning experience.  Lots of opportunities for growth and advancement.  Organizationally could be a bit better, but all in all no complaints."
good,A lovely place to work the staff was awesome its a very up beat environment and the company appreciate its employees. At this job I assisted customers with there landline phone service and home internet service.
good,Windstream was an lovely company to work for with good supervision and grate advancement options with and awesome work environment and I would do it all over if I had to and would highly command this company.

Anything from pots,dsl and t1 circuits and how they are wired out from the central office to the customers premises. Back office switch equipment that makes the service possible and Adtran/cisco IAD. Management requires me to work independently and the most enjoyable part of my job would be the satisfaction of knowing I play a big role in providing customers with excellent services."

good,"I learned a lot about hard work . getting doors shut in your face time and time again. So when you get that one sell, then you feel really good about your self"

good,"Windstream is a company that strives to take care of its customers. It is a goal oriented company. I have learned how to be better in the customer service industry. The management can be helpful, but I do sometimes feel like it is hard to go to them and ask questions. It seems like quite often I go to ask a question, and I get referred to someone else. My coworkers are great. They make the work day so much easier and are always there to answer questions."
good,"Very fast paced, and challenging daily, yet a very satisfying position. Great communication with the customer, and I had a fantastic team working for me."
good,"We have a meeting, then lunch, then be out in the 100+ heat, Management was great, Great coworkers, I liked be able to actually be myself with the team and customers."
good,Work hard and have fun at this small service provider with big dreams.
good,"People at Windstream are effective in their jobs, they tend to try to work as a whole team. Typically environment is easy to work in and management tries to support you"
good,Many good people are trying to develop new markets with new technology and some management direction decisions have not worked. Some purchases of outside companies have cost wasted money and time.
good,"Transforming with the company was key.  Evolving from a Service Provider to a Business Consultant, and Partner, and being successful at it, Rewarding!"
good,"Had some great experiences and some not so great experiences.  Co-workers were great.  Ultimately, it all came down to who you worked for.  Saw a lot of very unprofessional behavior from my direct leadership, unfortunately."
good,"Windstream is a  good place to work.....this company allowed me the opportunity to advance my career path into management in the telecommunication arena..... Being a  22 year Vet in Telecom, my career path involved management at this point in my life, however, I am not disinterested in being an individual contributor and just being a great support person and not lead a team."
good,"Good company, good pay, good work/life balance, most weeks are M-F, 8 to 5.  Vacation allowance is par with the industry. Healt benefits are good and comparable with other companies."
good,Windstream is a great place to work. The people are friendly and most managers are great. Problems would be lack of advancement and the raises were very weak. Money was okay but once your hired at a salary it does not change much.
good,"Productive, busy and learning new things on a daily basis.  I've gained numerous systems and process knowledge during my 17 years with the company. They have a good workplace culture."
good,My team was great and my manager was exceptional... Difficulty was that our responsibilities were gradually reduced and our metrics didn't reflect what we actually did.
good,"A typical day at work was usually fun filled.  While work and helping customers being the most important, the management team was always doing something exciting for the customer service reps to help us enjoy our day at work, when some days may have been tough.  At windstream I learned how to sell.  Which was a nice additional skill to add to my customer service experience I already had going into this position."
good,"The managers and Work environment is a 10 but the benefits and pay is a 2. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the customers. Management is great, but will push you to a resolution on customers tickets."
good,"Overall a good company.  There have been extreme changes to the benefit package which makes the health insurance unusable until a high deductible is met.  Took away the PPO."
good,Great co-workers. The company itself makes the job harder with new rule they want followed. Dispatch does not rout jobs very well. Sometimes local managers have no say in the area they are in charge of.
good,"A typical day at Windstream starts with calls from waiting customers right away, for the most part. Some of the calls will be from existing customers that may need assistance or to be routed to another department and a lot of the calls will be shoppers, not quite ready to make a decision, yet to take on Windstream as a provider. I have learned how to successfully turn the shoppers into real prospective customers, many times closing a multiple product sale. I love my co-workers. Most of them are more like family members than co-workers. I try to always be available to assist them with any situation as they do, me. Getting to see them and hearing about their lives, dreams and aspirations are probably one of the most enjoyable parts of my job, of course aside from closing a sale with a well satisfied customer. Certainly, one of the hardest parts of my job at Windstream is getting through the slow low-call volume days. It is difficult, as we as Sales Consultants are still expected to meet our goal. As for management, I suppose like in life, in general, you must adapt to who you are paired with the hope that they will get to know you as an individual and that they in turn will allow you to get to know them. I believe that, that formula is the key to a successful team."
good,Windstream is a good company but you are not compensated well for the work that you do. They also are the first company I worked for who does not have a bonus
good,Loved the company. Great benefits. They will not work with you on schedule. Babysitter quit on me and they refused to help out giving me a schedule to where I could use a day care.
good,"I have enjoyed working at Windstream. I was a Financial service rep.  My days at Windstream consisted of collecting on past due invoices.  I would call Business customers to collect on the past due balances and if they disputed the invoice I would request customer to pay the undisputed amount.  I would note the customer's account and would assure them that I would handle any issues that they where having with their account, which involved calling Sales, Repair or Billing."
good,I enjoyed my work and those I worked with. My manager wasn't quite as easy to get along with as the rest of the managers. The overall company atmosphere was great. Other area managers were friendly and offered unending advancements.
good,"generaly very busy days, constant work flow, which makes the day go by quickly with great management"
good,If you like a company that is moving forward and changes day by day this is the place for you.
good,nice place bad direction. hands off management. a good company to start your career. does not pay high salaries
good,"Throughout my career, I have experienced many opportunities to grow and expand my skills."
good,Great place where I learned many skills. Spent most of the day at the computer answering phones and giving new facilities for technicians to use in the field. Also worked on trouble tickets from customers.
good,I had the opportunity to learn about a lot of software programs. I was able to use my skills by navigating from several system. Its a very fast pace position.
good,"Main focus is on sales, 2nd focus is on customer service.... Many new Windstream competitive products are introduced to us quarterly and is MANDATORY you offer or try to upsell on EVERY SINGLE CALL!! Management is pretty much by the book and their attendance policy is EXTREMELY STRICT!! Management team is very big on micro managing and check on production stats hourly. They promote from within and have many perks."
good,Work at Windstream is challenging and rewarding.  We are a leader in our technology space and management encourages our success.  The company has aggressive and achievable goals for future success.
good,"Once you start n a position, there are not a lot of options to change the position.  As a publicly held company the sales teams changed every few years and the products available to sell changed as frequently not allowing a consistent growing of the sales funnel when goals and objectives change."
good,"A place where an individual can shine as he corporately works to achieve the companies vision, working along side some of the most amazing people.  Our group motto was never say never."
good,"Windstream is a wonderful company that is going through several transitions.  Once the changes settle structure can take place again."
good,Windstream let you work with autonomy. My manager was in another state. They provide on the job training for the position. They allowed me to work at home and in an office.
good,"The jobs is a decent job, its a bit stressful, but the money is well worth it. They have a very, very strict Attendance Policy. Most managers are kind, whereas some you honestly wonder how they got that job. There is also some slight nepotism in the workplace."
good,this is a nice place to work you are able to move up in the company. they have team goals and competitive with other teams. with options to make commission.
good,"worked various positions in department, performed almost all roles.  enjoyed people i worked with and interacted with.  later years became more difficult as management changed and at upper levels."
good,Very busy but stressful. Learned a lot about the telecommunications world. Manager was very busy due to time limits.  Work culture was push due to time limits.
good,Windstream provides great benefits and promotes from within the company.  I had the please of working with group of people for many years that are passionate about providing a great customer experience.
good,"Was able to advance within the company.  Allowed a lot of flexibility to help balance work and personal life. Management valued employee's feedback to help improve company.  However, poor management still by senior staff which seem to keep company in 'struggle' mode."
good,"Management will work with you"
good,"Windstream has tremendous potential, although there will be some growing pains with evolving culture. The discipline of caring for the ntwk has some room to improve and with the on boarding of staff through M&A activity, I believe there is a bright future for the company overall."
good,"The pay is very good, but the 2nd shift work/life balance is not for a family man.  They do give a 10% differential pay, which is great for off shifts."
good,"Co-workers are very supportive, sometimes hard to pin down as all involved carried a heavy workload."
good,"A typical day at work involves several conference calls and meetings with various teams, then action item follow up and documentation. I've learned many things about the telecom and cloud industry. The work place culture is undergoing a lot of transition right now due to the many recent acquisitions. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the constant changes. The best part of the job is working with the best people."
good,"I enjoyed working for my Customers Installing and Repairing Residential phone lines. coworkers were eager to help if problems arose. Most managers were very good, A few were hard to get along with."
good,I have been here for 3 years. There currently is alot of work due to being under staffed. It is a great company to work for. Upper managerment make some choices that are not liked by workers.
good,"I worked with EarthLink prior to the merger. During the merger information was scarce from the top down. Processes were not explained to everyone so some were doing the same things diferently."
good,"Windstream is a large company that has been built through Mergers and Acquisitions.  As such, it is difficult to identify either a career path, or the proper procedure to provide a consistent experience to our nationwide customer base."
good,Enjoyed the work at this company but the management team needed some work.  Was able to learn a lt about the telecom industry and how competitive it is.
good,"Management only cares about workers that are higher up, other than that decent place to work. Good pay, but not worth the customers you have to deal with. No work- life balance, they expect you to eat breath and sleep Windstream."
good,"It was an okay place to work for once you get past the fact you are stuck in the same job unless you make a lateral move.  If you are on call or apart of an escalation list, good luck getting a good nights sleep."
good,great management but training was terrible. I was an installation and repair tech for pots & internet issues. Unabell to travel due to my wife breaking hip on good old icy iowa concretete
good,"I was at this place for 15 years.. For 15 year this place took care of me. My supervisor helped me out, he would always stick by your side. I learned all about the major phone switches and VMS systems. I got to work from home. It wasn't a bad company to work for."
good,"nice people, nice culture but the hours were not good for me. really good people everyone works hard and together management are very polite"
good,"Typical day - canvass for new logos and meet with clients"
good,"It's a very self-learning type of environment, but the pay is wonderful and the people are very accepting and friendly. You can expect very quick turnovers and no opportunities to advance in the company."
good,"I learned more about routing/switching and voice networks here than I feel is possible anywhere else.  I directly interfaced with edge routers that controlled vast sections of thousands of large business.  I also became familiar with SIP messaging and signal flow in most of our modern TDM and VOIP networks.  The management was wonderful and the the environment was as good as a cubicle farm can get.  "
good,I had a good work Exp. at WIndstream but due to management changes looking for better place to work. I get to work from home all the time. Enjoy most part of my work.
good,Enjoyed my job....... great co workers and immediate management. fast pace and every day is something new. Great place to work. will learn a lot. Not a great place if you are lazy!!!
good,"My day always began calling all current customers, that hadn't been able to reach me through my (personal) cell phone, with call backs and resolutions.  In a call center basis, you always have your headset on, awaiting incoming calls- whether it was customer service issues, billing, new orders, move/ relocation, upgrades (and sometimes unfortunately downgrades to the economy, as well as, informing every customer of all new services and products that may be very helpful to them, within their company.  My goal on every sale was to ask deeper questions, inform and assist each customer, with upselling always the root of the goal.  We sat in a cubicle environment, so we were close in proximity, however that became very helpful, in case there was a question I didn't have the answer that immediate moment.  The hardest part of the position was having to hand your sales off to account managers, who then took over the account, because I always tried to connect and form a strong bond with my customers.  Overtime became a requirement when the merger with PAETEC began, so that was an adjustment- but I found it just gave me more of an opportunity to sell.  I really enjoyed the team atmosphere and the competitiveness that came along with it!"
good,"Work orders, answer the phones and assist techs with facility information."
good,"Sitting for 12 hr days on the phone and data entry, working orders with techs and customers gets a little stressful..People were nice to work with."
good,There are many teams which interact daily within Engineering. This helps distribute knowledge of the overall project process and relay updates. I like the teams/people I work with and work for.
good,Overall I enjoy the challenge of installing and maintaining the equipment.
good,"Signed into all systems to be used for the day.  Listened to voicemail and responded accordingly, checked emails and prioritized ""urgent"" issues requiring immediate attention, worked assigned portfolios according to days aged buckets."

good,I was provided with a huge amount of knowledge from all the knowledgeable and helpful employees that work their.
good,Windstream has the makings to be a dominant player in the national carrier space. Windstream products cover a broad spectrum of customer needs and their network is cowboy-tough!
good,Typical day at work is prospecting and setting up appointments for the following week with a goal of 8 appointments per week.
good,"good work environment, needs improvement with formation of MA team"
good,"We use agile methodology. Most of the times, each person gets to choose what task he wants to work on. I got a chance to learn and work with many technologies that i was not familiar with like JRules, Mercurial. Everyday starts with the stand up meeting where we give updates on what we are working on. This meeting gives us a chance to talk about any roadblock we are facing. Any team member who has familiarity or who has worked on a similar task would readily available to help. The hardest part of my current job is high standards set by team mates. This is actually good in a way, allowing me to improve myself . The team is what i love the most in at this place. Everybody in the team is really passionate about what they are doing, with really good work ethics. Its a fun environment to work at."
good,Management listens to employees. They promote training and knowledge sharing.
good,Good ISP to work for in the area. Great place to get started in a career in networking.
good,"Overall, a good company to work for. Never had an issue with coworkers. Lately they are hiring a lot of ghetto people with bad attitudes and manners with no regard to others. Other than that, I learned a great deal of customer service and sales. This past year the company had really started focusing on providing better customer service experience. Hardest part is always dealing with angry customers, but I am used to it, so it doesn't really bother me. I enjoyed becoming friends with my coworkers. The good thing i I formed special bonds with them. I'd have to say that was the most enjoyable part. To be like family."
good,Typical day at work consisted of assisting customers with service issues and taking payments. I had wonderful co-workers. I enjoyed working with the public and meeting new people.
good,"Good Overall Company, Good inter-departmental support, Company supported the customer needs"
good,Many of the people who work at Windstream work from their homes.  They have their own Video Conferencing software and all of the coworkers I worked with communicated this way.
good,The place was great until being laid off. The co-workers were knowledgeable and management was helpful. The only issue I ever experienced was at the end as I was laid off.
good,I had good work experience. Their only issue is company is more management focused than employee focused. Pay scale is good. Benefits are good. Again decent company
good,8-5 job.  Learned ISP technology.  Management frequently changes. Depressing work culture.  Understanding the technology. Collegues are the best part of the job.

good,"A typical day at work requires answering incoming calls. "
good,"There is a substantial training period.  The management is concerned with the moral."
good,"There is no ""typical"" day in the life at Windstream, every day is different.  I learned so much in my time there it is so hard to know where to begin. I learned all about configuration, implementation, and troubleshooting; building and testing DSLAMS, switches, and routers: new devices, existing devices, moving customers, collaboration between multiple different departments, including engineering, transport, logical provisioning, and the voice group to name a few."
good,Culture was great... everyone seemed to always be happy and CEO was very employee oriented. Always looked forward to coming to work and interacting with my peers.

good,"Great company to work for with good benefits and flexibility. NIce people to work with, including managent/directors. However, with recent merger with Earthlink, it hasnt been good. Over 800 layoffs within last few months. "
good,"The job was fast paced, starting with loading jobs to technicians and removing road blocks to help with job completions. The hardest and most satisfying part of the job was the resolution of customer service escalations."
good,Overall I have no complaints.  Windstream was a good place to work.  Its a stable community based local phone company that generally has very long term employees.
good,"I enjoyed working at Windstream, There are a lot of excellent engineers there and my manager was very supportive.  I would have liked to work there longer."
good,I learned a lot about reporting and accounting in this role.  It was a great experience working with the VP's of the IT department.  The company was a good company to work for.

good,Its a nice place to work for with lot of opportunities to learn new technologies specifically related to hardware like servers/racks/ports etc. The environment is nice to work for.
good,"I enjoyed helping the customers and walking them though their problems and their bills.  Customers would often call about their bill going up in cost, or even possible the issues with installation of service. We had to have a good mind for problem solving and multi-tasking"
good,I worked in provisioning on contract for 30 days.  Good people to work with very helpful.  Would make a nice full time career
good,"Nice company to work for. I like being self-sufficient, but I had little influence from my Houston office working in Kerrville. Our office was a way outside the ""home office"". eventually, I thought Houston lost interest in the Kerrville market as there was a transition to San Antonio taking over the market."
good,"The management team was not as helpful, if you asked about benefits or anything in that area, even with payroll, they always tell you to call hr"

good,"Windstream is great place to work has great benefits"
good,"Travel, work with a small team of 3 or 4 to install telecommunication equipment at remote data centers.  Physical work pulling and terminating cable to appropriate endpoints and make sure it all powers up."
good,"Windstream is a very diverse company in a competitive environment. Typical day at Windstream was the installation of VOIP phone systems and we answer trouble tickets to existing systems on the market. Windstream is an Internet Service Provider and they have a pretty large DSL market as well. The duties consisted of deploying small to large offices Voip, Hosted pbx phones as well as coordinating with IT and Telecom Vendors for smooth transition of voip and data services. Configuring Phones and other Windstream leased cpe to customer specs. Constant communication was kept between the Project coordination team to meet the customer and Windstreams deadlines. Independent responsible work was the order of the day. Windstream's Technicians as well as with most companies are the sole-representative in the field after sales. Professionalism and reliability had to be consistent."
good,This company always has it's hands on the latest technology in the telecommunications industry.
good,They pushed you to make the most sales but I enjoyed the work. It had a nice work / life balance with weekends off and no late evenings. Not much room for advancement due to the way the seniority system was set up.
good,This is a great company to work for. They have amazing benefits and everyone works as a team.
good,I have amazing co-workers who all have a team player mentality.  This makes working on projects and obtaining resource items very pleasant.
good,"Great Co-Workers"
good,All I have to say is that you better pray that you or no one in your family get sick because if they do Windstream will not work with you.
good,"Customer side call centers with engineering departments internal to support infrastructure. Departmental communication is lacking and call queues are disorienting. Benefits are competitive. Co-workers are well trained and diligent, but feel as if management doesn't know what their departments do."
good,"Get to work, log in to phone, check email, get on the phone with customers."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Windstream. Great Co-workers, fantastic management."
good,"Meet sales goals daily by canvassing assigned territory from door to door. Consult face to face with new and existing customers and extract detailed information. Using information gathered, make convincing sales proposition. Be able to read voice and body language of customers to determine level of interest. Follow up and keep new clients up to date on the status of their order. Being the face of Windsteam, provide the best customer service possible. Consult and update current customers on products and solutions. Tailor services according to customer needs. Build relationships with installers and technicians to ensure smooth transition."

good,Windstream is a compulation of many aquired companies. The leadership has made great stride in combining the companies to create a team that works together for their Customers.

good,"Windstream was a large, growing company during my tenure. They did a great job of managing the umbrella culture during times of significant change and growth."
good,windsteam is a close knit company to work for. Friendly environment that allows for a stress free day. Hardest part of the job is balancing all the changes that happen with policies and procedures.

good,Windstream is a private company that has plenty room of growth and expansion. It's great opportunity for one new to IT get hands on experience and start their IT career path
good,"Lots of acquisitions lead to counter-productivity among team collaborations, especially on the activation side it.  I have been removed from telecom for some time so my vantage point is certainly dated..."
good,"The HR Advisor role at Windstream is an extremely invaluable role that requires collaboration with benefits, payroll, HRIS, talent acquisition and compensation. Candidate background/on-boarding management, position management/requisition creation, unemployment claims, processing general HR related employee cases and owning the exiting process for resigning/retiring employees are the main responsibilities. "
good,"Great place to work. Very challenging and alot of support from Management.  Opportunities to advance and grow. They offer pretty good benefits, health medical and dental."
good,good pay and great work environment. coworkers were very nice and good family atmosphere. Good training for how to operate many different systems. Hardest part was dealing with upset customers
good,Moderate pay and room for advancement at the Tier 2 level. A person has to deal with constant change but a relaxed place to work. I would recommend this job to someone new in the technical field.
good,"Another round of layoffs. if they don't call you on Thursday your good for another week. The region I am currently working in doe s not have the air of longevity. Been 10 months and they still have not replaced the sign from the recent EarthLink, Windstream merger. Lots of empty desks and space."
good,The company has great people working for them. The work and outside life is balanced with great benefits. Communication has it's ups and downs and management is great.

good,I enjoyed the fact that they encouraged you to learn more about things which might (or might not) come in handy for your position.  My manager was very laid-back and yet no-nonsense.  You knew what needed to be done and he let you do it.

good,"Windstream was a fast-paced call center answering phone calls from customers with questions, complaints, and adding/removing services. We had sales goals that were achievable if you followed the procedures and policies. I met the sales goals all but one month while I was there so I earned commission. Sick days were used but there is a point procedure every time you used sick time. If you asked for time off in advance, the points would not count against you. You would get 7 points for the year but every 3 months a point would drop off if you came to work every day."
good,Nice people and pros in telecommunications. DSL gbond technology to provide broad band upgrade to existing customers has been a satisfying project to manage
good,"This place has real people working, no corporate bull.  These folks have lots to grow and should be a leader in the near future.  If your looking for a place to set roots this might be it."
good,"My typical day at work is taking inbound 30+calls in a call center setting ,conducting account reviews,  for small businesses customers. such as. contract renewals, upselling the products and services, disconnecting accounts."
good,I have nothing more to add to this review. It is a large enterprise environment with a multitude of different equipment.
good,On the local level the environment is great but on a corporate level it is cold and out of touch. layoffs are by a strict format with no real judgement used
good,"Understand business, set meaningful and practical objectives.  Telecom of course is tough; every evolving and very competitive."
good,"I helped customers make and maintain arrangements on past"
good,Great Company. Windstream is a great place to work and stays on the front of technology. I would recommend them to anyone interested in Telecom.
good,Intense auditing but laid back dress.  Got along great with co-workers and loved my manager.
good,Benefits are comparable.  Senior Management is out of touch with the business.  Different aspects of the business can tend to be high stress.
good,"Typically managed a queue of 15-20 trouble tickets and learned several different aspects of the communications network including facilities, routing and VoiP.  Management at this company was very helpful in every aspect and my co-workers were a joy to work with.  The hardest part of this job was dealing with irate customers and the most enjoyable part of the job was the same because by the end of our conversation the customer understood that I was always trying to help them."
good,"I love the people I work with. I love the benefits that Windstream provides."
good,You get to meet and talk to new people every day. flexible shifts. great benefits package
good,"Meet different types of people. Hard work and dedication can get you far. Being patient and focus on the customers. The most enjoyable part, winning prizes, ipads, tvs grills, etc in competition."
good,"Windstream is like many companies in that they are trying to do more with less.  On most days, I work 10 hours compiling reports, putting out ""fires,"" communicating with other departments, and coaching and training employees.  Because of this, working at Windstream has helped me to fine tune my time management skills as well as how to communicate with a wide array of individuals."
good,"A typical day at work would includes handling inbound calls, researching daily to resolve daily issues. You work as a team and as an individual. I learned that I am capable of being a really good customer service representative. I exceeded all expectations at this job. Some co workers were encouraging, others caused a lot of drama. The hardest part of the job was working with only women. Women equals drama. The most enjoyable part of the job was that you are not micro-managed."
good,A typical day includes cold calling and folow up calls with current and prospective customers. I use to enjoy our calling blitzes because of the competition in the office. I had a great team of people to work with. Management was again a leader. They worked their way through the company into the leadership position. They were instructive and exciting to work with. Excitment and enthusiasm were the order of the day...everyday. Assistance was always a call or an email away from our leader. My colleagues were a great bunch of folks. We shared ideas about the job and how to improve our work experience. Pot luck lunches were the best for cultural foods. The hardest part about working there was going through a merger. Was amess that was. The most enjoyable part was working with my teammates and my Sales Leader.
good,Conflict Resolution
good,"WINDSTREAM Communications is a forward thinking company who is 15,000 employees strong but still tries to keep company communications at the local level. They are always striving to keep their employees with the most up-to-date equipment needs to do their jobs as efficiently as possibly!"

good,Company have lots of layoff's.  Two many one off builds.  Over all I enjoyed my time at Windstream.  Lots of layoff when I was there. Management had unrealistic goals.

good,"Colleagues will make sure you are trained properly.  Work 3rd shift with the Manager's trust."
good,Management was outstanding. Products and services were head of their class. Culture was strong. I enjoyed coming to work everyday!  Customers were well taken care of by out support team
good,"I worked in a few different departments at Windstream. I have learned a lot while being there and was able to foster a new skill set. For the first few years there, there was a lot of opportunity for overtime hours. I was able to work in a team to learn from and bounce ideas off of. I enjoyed being given the opportunity to work remotely from home."
good,The position held great responsibility and I was giving the complete support of upper management. A wide range of actions were need for  daily tasks. I was allowed autonomy in daily scheduling that gave better outcomes.
good,I began my career in Telecommunications as a front line Collector and worked my way to Manger with tremendous support from my peers.  Management provided many opportunities and allowed you to show your expertise without hesitation and didn't fear pushing you out of your comfort zone to make you a better more productive employee.  Economic down turn and fierce competition resulted in pay freezes and frequent layoffs.  Management from the top down was always complimentary and gave recognition for those that would go above and beyond their daily duties.
good,a typical day at windstream would start by signing into your laptop to see how many work orders you had or how many troubles you had to fix each work order would take about up to an hour or even more then come around 1 you would have lunch time. After lunch you would finsh what you had for the rest of day.
good,I enjoy working with others in a competitive environment with room to improve knowledge and position. Daily campaigns ran with great prizes. Family oriented environment. Management are willing to work with you with job goals and are empathetic with personal issues.
good,Its very fast pace and it is a lot to learn in a short amount of time you will get a lot of inbound calls lots of unfriendly customers usually yelling at you about the service
good,Working at Windstream was a challenging and rewarding experience. I had exposure to a large ISP network and was able to work in multiple areas of the company from Corporate network support to ISP security.
good,The job was very challenging and was nice to have some calls that are the same but some that could be very unique. The location of the faculity was not the best if you are driving from the snow belt.

Teams as a whole provided a strong feeling of comradery and family, and management was very good at working with employee's and their personal/familial needs."
good,I have found that working for WIndstream has been a great experience and am looking forward to working here and trying out new departments to further my knowledge of the Windstream systems. I am a legacy Earthlink employee

good,"typical day at work is answering calls resolving problems. learned how to have patience with people who feel entitled to everything, great learning experience in sales and customer service. workplace culture is amazing, people are friendly willing to help, always a positive energy. hardest part of the job for me I would say was dealing with the customers where they feel it is ok to be disrespectful toward you because of the service. most enjoyable would be the people and workplace"
good,Great company with a lot of potential growth. Great managers to work with and peers. I worked there over 8 years and do not have any complaints. I have learned a lot throughout the years.

I can honestly say the company makes an attempt to make this place a great place to work at.  Sometimes they fall short of that attempt, but overall they are a pretty good place to work out.  Great hours because they work no later than 7 or 8pm during the week.  When I worked there you only had to work 1 Saturday per month and never on Sunday.  Also they offer commission and benefits."

good,Hours weren't the greatest. Loved that you didn't ever have to work on a Sunday.
good,"It can get stressful with the quotas that need to be met. Turning an ugly call into sale was expected. Even though it’s the best paying job in the small community I was in, it affected my health with high blood pressure and anxieties."
good,Typical day is pretty fast-paced but not too stressful. You can go take a break and have a coffee or eat. I learned a lot here and it was very hands-on/technical if you are looking to excel in your career and life in general. The culture and people you meet are awesome and everyone seems happier than most places. The job wasn't difficult until you came across some strange issue other coworkers may have not experienced yet. The best part of the job was the meeting new people and learning so many new things.

good,"Windstream's work culture is magnificent, it induces one to perform to their extreme best on a daily basis. Management interacts with staff in the utmost respectable and professional manner."
good,"The pay is worth all the frustration. It's highly stressful taking call after call all day long complaining about Windstream's terrible service. They know they have terrible service. Why do you think they have three call centers? The only thing keeping them afloat is the monopoly they've created in some areas. They definitely take care of their employees and that's what mattered to my paycheck the most. Customers get good customer service through the phone calls but actual service, forget It."
good,"I loved this job, until the dissolved it & sent my job overseas to India. I planned on retiring here. "
good,"Windstream is a growing company.  It's productivity is tied to it's ability to sell products to Enterprise, Consumer, and Small Businesses.  When sales are slack then productivity wanes.

My coworkers are extremely helpful and the management could use some work . The hardest part of my job is hearing the customers cry for things that others in the company had misinformed them of and the most enjoyable part is the smile that I hear in their voices once I solve their issue.

good,"Windstream is a great organization.  Growth for WIndstream over the last ten years has been explosive.  Putting all of the pieces of the growth and many acquisitions can be challenging.   Taking mostly a rural ILEC Telephone company to being a National Enterprise Technology leader requires stamina, good decision making, willingness to make mistakes and make the hard choices required.

I sometimes answered difficult calls where the customer was irrate and assisted in finding out what was wrong in order to correctly forward the call to someone who could assist them. I collaborated with company officers and other employees to understand their unique communication process needs to ensure efficiency and effectiveness. I assisted staff/colleagues with customer issues and other project needs as they arose.

With each organization change, management strategy shifted to understand the employee and inspire each to work toward a common goal:  meeting revenue each month."
good,A typical day at Windstread was much like Paetec.  I continued to learn more about network configurations for multiple locations.  The management was based out of another state; little or no supervision of daily appointments or scheduling.

And you can purchase stocks. Very family oriented company. When goals were met or exceeded the company would always treat the employees with something nice wether it was food or what nots for your desk. On your company anniversary (5,10, 15, etc)the company celebrated you by hand delivering a nice gift thanking you for your service. Has strong community involvement and support. It’s definitely a company one can be proud to work for and wear the company logo with pride in public. We at times worked 10-12 hr days but you didn’t mind because the company always took care of you. Sometimes management would not have to ask for OT we just volunteered to get the work completed taking care of the customers. If you ever have the opportunity to work for Windstream you will love it and want to stay until retirement. I would still be there but relocated with family."

good,"Advancement opportunities happen within the company if you hold tight and do not let go of your dreams and aspirations. I went from customer service to financial in a year and a half due to diligence and hard work. Customer service is a department of its own as the commission was okay when I was there. The quality was a pain, and certain scorers got a high by scoring low. Anyway, financial service is amazing. It is more laid back, and we are treated more like adults rather than children. We get OT if we want it. Financial does not have many openings. The reason being is because the people who come there stay there."

The hardest part of the job was with some of the techician's. At time's when you could not help them find the equipment that they would need.

If they do better, they get their first pick. It does drive you to do better for yourself. But overall, best work environment, amazing supervisors, and great perks. When they say you pick your success in the company, they are speaking the truth."
