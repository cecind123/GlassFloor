rating,review
bad,"Very poor pay, the coworkers were not helpful in daily job duties, no room for growth, conditions were poor at best, no management help, and would never feel like a career opportunity. Started as a temp worked my 800 hours to get hired on while others were hired on directly and not even work 1 full day never to return"
bad,Management Sucks. Communication Sucks! You are not paid correctly for what they expect you to do. No job security. Lack of management...………………………………..
bad,"You will learn in orientation “hear something say something “ but do not do that!!! Honestly. If you tell HR, they will go to that person and rat you out.  They do not care about your safety at all (if you burn yourself they pretty much laugh at you)  There are some nice people but if you are not a Trump supporter and aren’t ok with talking about abuse, criminals, racism or anything negative this isn’t a good place to work."
bad,"I wouldn’t suggest this place to my worst enemy. Everything about it is awful. Management is unorganized and uncaring. Coworkers gossip,cause drama and waste time while being paid. They can’t keep employees and have a hard time bringing more in because of the drama, low pay, garbage management and lack of advancement. I have nothing good to say about this place."
bad,It was an in house place to work the people that worked there for 20 years didn't like anybody else walking in the door. One trainer widget tell you to do something this way and the next retaliated do it this way it was a very confusing job
bad,"They have people there that discriminate against the LGBTQ community and HR is horrible at getting things taken care of, pay is not reasonable the only paid time off you get is holidays or you work a certain amount of hours to build up vacation hours paid off. They give you 48 hours unpaid time off, etc."
bad,After 10+ years with company was treated unfair. Not at all a good place to work. A lot of their employees are under the influence of either drugs or other. No one cares about good or bad production.
bad,There entire goal is to produce parts even if they don't meet their own standards. Demanding work schedule even when hired for a specific shift you are required to fill all the hours they want to fill orders. None to slight leadership and a very top heavy company.
bad,"Poor management, unfair supervisors, too much favoritism. Too cliquey and everyone too worried about what everyone else is doing. There are many employees there with more than 25 years invested and almost all of them would rather not be working there anymore. No professionalism at all."
bad,"I was working in a hostile environment. I asked to be moved. They changed my team lead with the promise of moving.  About 2 months after I was still experiencing a highly negative work environment and asked to be taken out of the cell. They asked for time to make it happen. I waited 2 months, they had not hired a replacement for my position and had made no attempt to move me. I decided I was done."
bad,"Hired for a temporary to permanent position. Unfortunately, they let me go for a very unprofessional reason. The trainer gives off a bad attitude and the other trainer just happens to be on vacation at the wrong time. Place looks run down and outdated. "
bad,"People talk a lot about each other and it's filled with a lot of drama. Work is boring and the managers don't care about how their employees are working. Disrespect from employees. Things stolen out of work locker. All in all, stressful work environment."
bad,"There are so many prejudices, everything from womanizing to racism! Everyone there (from the top of management on down) plays favorites."
bad,"I never knew what the day would bring, I would come in and from day to day and week to week and something would always change. I was never given an opportunity to ""Get in the Groove"" of things so I could excel!"
bad,"* Proficiencies in operating machines to achieve target production."
bad,"A typical day at Vishay was most enjoyable...I learned alot about the electronics business. The management was very good to their employees. Everyone I worked with were very nice and got along with each other. The hardest part of the job...it really wasn't hard. The most enjoyable part of the job, the work wasn't hard."
bad,"They treat you like a bunch of garbage, the supervisors only care about making a paycheck instead of the employees needs. If they was a chemical problem and couldn't talk they wouldn't care about your health they would just tell you to deal with it"
bad,"a typical day at work, for me the easiest part of my work with i'm w/ my co-workers."
bad,Vishay was not a family company. It was more of a Union company which is what it was. A Union Company. First Union I have worked for and would not work for a Union again. Bad Experience.
bad,no comment  bad management and bad pay. can not move to any other job. they will move you around with out consent and lower your pay. treat employees poorly
bad,"Vishay will close the Santa Clara site, the management level try to layoff their working people to save themselves. The atmosphere is not good since  2016."
bad,The most difficult part of the job is having to deal with a management team that does not get along.
bad,"If Vishay gave everyone in our IT department an engagement screening, I believe the over score would be around 35% engaged. 67% is usually the average score. "
bad,Due to the immense number of issues you usually work for around 10-11 hours daily. There is a lot of finger pointing and no one wants to accept responsibility for problems arising. Managers won't provide the necessary resources to address the issues which cause the technicians to resort to band aid solutions.
bad,Growth opportunities are less and also the environment and distance plays an important role. The management us unable to identify the potentials in their employees. Very stagnant environment.
bad,You can not make a living working just here. Almost every one there has to work 2 or three jobs to maintain a living. Very clicky and ladies talk behind your back and always in each others business.
bad,Un problème du management est du a la séparation de l'entité en plusieurs divisions.
bad,"Nothing special about Vishay. It is not an  inspiring place to work. Same routine, day in, day out. This is a place to work if you  just want a paycheck, not expect much else."
bad,Management is mostly garbage.  They move people from job to job which essentially creates turnover (or at least artificial turnover) in that people have to learn their new jobs quickly and without much training.  This negativity affects cross-departmental teamwork and communication within the plant and renders any type of cross functional groups worthless.
bad,they will hire you on as a temp and you can be a good worker come to work everyday and even work over on the weekend they will string you along like they will hire you and have to work for them a year or two and tell you they are not hire at this time that sucks!!
bad,"the supervisors are very unfair."
bad,"There is no time to learn anything. In your first week you are taught the minimum of what is required and once your week long training is done you get thrown into the deep in to try and figure out everything they didn't teach you."
bad,what I have learned as an engineering tech is that there is no way to move up. You need a 4 year degree to go anywhere with the company. You could pay a technician a little better to do most of the engineers job.
good,Over all I enjoyed working for this company although the hours I was scheduled for was a bit challenging doing 10:30- 7am. Learned how to use multiple machinery and detailed production.
good,For the most part of working at Vishay its not any hard work. A typical day there starts with pouring chemicals for all different types of customs....
good,No growth in salary ..... work place are not so good ... very narrow minded people are working here...
good,Overall great company with LOW moral due to management lack of detail
good,"Typical day was steady paced and the work was fun for the most part."
good,"In general, people were very polite and helpful. Immediate management not so collaborative. The training system wasn't user friendly and questions weren't always answered."
good,"One of the leading Load cells manufacturers in india.Happy to be a part of Vishay family for past 2 and half years. Myself is a production engineer , responsible for particular cell ."
good,collaborateurs au top expérience enrichissante trés bonne organisation du travail a réaliser
good,I love my company just wish there was more money to those who’ve been there awhile. Most new people start off making what some of us who’ve been there for years. Vishay cares more for the new help then the people who’ve been there for years.
good,"Working in the Laser department is stressful. A person has to run about 18-20 machines a day and make sure the machine is making the cuts right, cleaning the inside of the machine, making samples, and having QC check them."
good,"There is no much to say I work night shift when "
good,"Bonded together pieces - micro-chips, that were being used in cell phones and airplanes.  This was done 8 hours of the day. I worked nights 3pm to 11pm. Experience different leads and personalities.  Too many people giving orders.  I did not particularly like the schedule."
good,cooperation and helping nature of management is really awesome.
good,"Boas condições de trabalho, gostei da experiência."
good,"Too many hours. Schedule varied week to week. Pay was ok, benefits we're good. Paid holidays but had to work additional days to make up for ""holiday"" guaranteed work and no risk for layoff. Went through 6 supervisors in 5 and a half years. Big turnover so constantly training new people."
good,"Still very grateful given the chance to work for the company when I needed a job too badly."
good,"autonomie complète sur le poste de travail/"
good,"not stable , not good pay, not able too advance up in company, good benifits, clean work areas."
good,Learned how to operate in a stressful work environment. Need organizational skills to be successful here. Management is decent depending on your department but advancement opportunities are slim. Good mixture of young and experienced employees in most departments. Have issues with turnover rate and employee retention.
good,its my first company after college gives good opportunity to develop my skill and knowledge and seniors are very supportive.manage is good provide all necessary support.
good,"Most employees don't want to be here. Engineering gets a lot of clout, but big projects struggle to Get done. Defeatist attitude among production and office staff."
good,Working at desk in front of computer all day doing data entry. The pay does not equal the work. Expected to know a lot but the training isn't there. Learn as you go There is a lot going on...
good,"Very monotonous work. Some departments are sort of relaxed, but in others the bosses belittle employees to the point where i've even seen some older women break down crying. My co-workers for the most part were very pleasant and nice. The bosses are good for the most part but tend to go on power trips."
good,"Typical day varied from day to day. I was usually in different departments."
good,"Vishay is a good company to work for,they moved Production overseas, but if you are working in a different field Vishay looks out for their employees."
good,"it was so tedious and boring people would actually fall asleep at work. there were a lot of old people that worked there that were racist and still stuck in the ""old days"""
good,"Ping pong played with or without a table. Not an actual ping pong ball but words and attitude get pinged and ponged back and forth.  Most of management doesn't play because they don't need to, they have their favorites. It's bring your own paddle."
good,"When I began working at Vishay the workplace culture was great, however once the company was purchased new management came in and the culture changed."
good,Vishay is a nice friendly environment until you have been there a while then it seems like people think you won't leave so they can treat you the way they want.
good,"N'ayant fait qu'une alternance, le peu que j'ai pu voir était interéssant mais avec un avenir incertains (majeur partie de la production en Pologne)"
good,I learned about the new technologies and got to work with experienced people in the company. The workplace culture was very nice and the people were very friendly and co-operative. The most enjoyable part was there was everything new to be learnt and was very interesting.
good,"many things you experience with the field of the job."
good,"60 mensen totaal, in magazijn waar ik werten 5 man."
good,I joined Vishay to learn CNC programming for Turning and they put me in Hmc. I had a very tough time so i managed  some of my quality time to learn both hmc and Turning programmings and i learned some useful techniquies to edit the program codings.
good,Everyday is full of surprises because they moved you a lot.Typical work day is you will never know where to set up or which station you going to be working on that day.
good,"There is no typical day, always busy. There are PM's that need to get done on a normal day, on a bad day a system might go down, so that needs to get fixed right away."
good,My typical day at Vishay consisted of soldering while looking through a microscope and learning hand eye coordination. My supervisor and material handler treated me fair with goals to meet each day. I learned team work with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was learning the criteria and specifications of each model. The most enjoyable part of the job was all the friends I made through out the years I was employed at Vishay.
good,"Bra och lärorik arbetsplats med bra personal."
good,Really don't have much to say about this company. It was very boring. Inspected products under the microscope all day long. Co-workers were very nice and so was management. It was just not the right job for me. I prefer jobs that keep my mind busy and my body moving.

good,to many hours required to work. Mandatory overtime for the full 5.5 years I worked there. Made to work extra hours for paid holidays. Worked me to death
good,My programming skills was improved in this company but what I don't like on the company was office politics. It took 2 years before you will promote and salary is too low.
good,Great group of engineers to work with. I have learned a great deal since starting my employment here in 2004. Nothing better than  completing a project and handing it off to production.
good,"A typical day involves running reports, planning production orders for production to build for the week, maintaining master data and answering questions for co-workers and customer service."
good,"condiciones laborales buenas, me toman en cuenta para toma de desiciones en cuanto a mi responsabilidad."
good,you didnt know what you were going to do when you got to work and you could plan something and by the time you did it they changed it and didnt tell you.
good,Emails are a top priority in daily activity.  Emails range from reports to expedite requests from customer service.  Maintaining the balance of production output to customer demand is also a vital function in the position.

good,"Before the shift starts, there were small talk among us but the voice should be in minimum. Meetings are regular at least once a week. We do light physical exercises before the meeting with supervisors. There is also a mini Bible talk/sharing with our religious engineer. I learned a lot from him especially about the right attitudes towards work and personal life. If there are issues or problems about the quality of our work, we talk about it in a good way. We are always reminded not to repeat the same mistake. Attendance and late are strictly monitored."
good,"Its an easy and balanced place to learn and work from, people around you are friendly and help in any way shape and form that they can, i think the hardest part of the job is reaching your goal at times just because not everyday is going to be the same as the next,"
good,"Vishay is a good, solid company to work for.  It is very structured, disciplined, organized.  This is a good place for someone who likes rules.

Estar en comunicacion constante con los supervisores y tecnicos de produccion para que la produccion fluya constante. Evaluar y corregir situaciones que no esten correctas en el departamento, mantener la armonia y buen ambiente de trabajo con los compañeros. Tener en cuenta que todos los problemas tienen solucion.
