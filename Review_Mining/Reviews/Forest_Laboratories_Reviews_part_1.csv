bad,Would not recommend working at Allergan. Eleven years ago Allergan had a great culture one that encourage autonomy and personal growth.  the past few years that changed.
bad,"Forest Labs has excellent sales training and marketing of products. However, they did not follow pharma guidelines while I was there. I'm not sure if they do at this time."
bad,I was a former temporary associate working with the company and they only hire but kissers. I worked for them for two years and never got hired on. I was repeatively passed up by people who were there for three days ind i wad there way longer than them...
bad,"The work is very easy an 3rd grader can do it, but the work environment and management is extremely poor. One the worst company's I have ever worked for. If one manager doesn't likes you the rest doesn't either, you never get off at shift end time. The worker's most of them are lazy and they don't do anything about it. They just had two lay offs and the last year and a half if you have standards do not apply for this company. The hiring manager feed you a bunch of lies to make you think it's a great company to only be hired and find out it was all lies!  Only great thing this company has to offer is health insurance."
bad,"Not the same company, just the name remains.  No longer cares about the people, just the stock price and the C-Level stock options."
bad,This site is a joke. They sent me a fraud check to cash at my bank and which also got me in trouble. I will never apply to this company ever again.
bad,culture changed in last 10 months no longer a family oriented business
bad,"This was not a good territory and the management poor.  I would go on to something else.  Salary was low $50,000 and benefits not industry standards.  Very Cheap company car which was all the district manager talked about."
bad,"I was only paid 7.25 per hour for hard labor. most of the time the boss would take me on missions to get supplies with him put only paid me for working at the site. No compesation for time taken to gather supplies, which was daily"
bad,"My Manager is severely behind the curve. he/she has no management skills and covers it up by micromanagement, unprofessionalism and other hostile attitudes. "
bad,Constantly putting out fires and correcting errors that could have been avoided if better training was provided. The departments are all understaffed and we are each doing a job for 2+ people. No time in the day to do or excel at the most important part of a collector's job. Expectations are unrealistic. Management penalizes you for clocking in 1 minute late. If they paid more or made their employees feel appreciated I would overlook some of these things. Thankless job.
bad,"There is limited opportunity for advancement at Allergan.  They want a ""certain"" type to work there.  Not everyone fits the bill, regardless of one's educational background or work ethic."
bad,This company has gone downhill fast since Actavis took over 4 years ago.  The culture is just check the box and you feel no sense of purpose. Just a bunch of hanger onners.
bad,It's awful to see and hear from others how poor or non existent the culture is at this place.  Management (including Jr/Sr/Executive) is so poor due to the fact the CO only wants to save a buck by putting inexperienced and bewildered people in place just to follow orders like clowns and repeat their superiors like parrots.  It's a good place to stay away from!
bad,"I see all these reviews that are good...what they don't tell you is that it depends on what department you're in...sales is great, R&D great...Facilities is horrible, managers are not quailified to clean dog kennels, they have zero working knowledge of facilities nor people skills."
bad,"The best day of my life will be when I leave here. Management is a joke, especially on the SkinMedica side. The most MICRO-MANAGED job I have ever had. Steer clear, there is ZERO work life balance with this company, and they sell our products online on their own website! I wanted to work in pharmaceuticals...this is more like Avon."
bad,"Started as a consultant worked 15 hrs days. A very dog eat dog atmosphere very petty and insane amount of nepotism. When I was hired permanent my job did not change no growth, and it was encouraged to lack ethics in decisions. CEO flaunt his homes by showing pictures, and senior management makes leud race, gender and religious jokes. I felt totally robbed when I poored myself into this job. Wish I quit after a year but wanted stability for my family and all I received was stress and lack of respect from the leadership."
bad,This is an awful company that does not value their employees. Employees who were misusing company funds were kept on board while other ethical employees quit. Management is completely oblivious. No career advancement or training opportunities. RUN away very quickly!
bad,Empresa con crecimiento hasta 2019. Mucha rotación de personal. Los nuevos gerentes no tienen liderazgo y prácticamente nos hay comisiones pues las cuotas son inalcanzables.
bad,"Typically I am required to work 50 to 60 hours a week to ensure that all deadlines are met as per the requirements of the site senior leadership; with no overtime compensation.  "
bad,"Allergan is a company without a culture. There is no idea from upper management of what they want accomplished. They just know they want more from their employees while providing less for them. "
bad,"The culture at Allergan was not a positive one. Supervisors micro-manage, the department did not know what direction to head in, and overall morale was so low. The way sales reps communicated with us was poor. There is a very low chance of career advancement. I started with a team of 30, and by the time I left there were 11 left. The environment is depressing and the aesthetics, not much there. "
bad,"Nothing can ever go correctly."
bad,It's like working in a prison. Drab walls and stuck in a cubicle all day. Talking to you Co workers is discouraged. The management is poor and thier break policy a joke. If you like dealing with entitled people this is the job for you.
bad,Management needs a makover. Not enough people to do the job. Stressful days. Some employees were ridiculously nasty and impossible to work with. People moved along without a care. Job security also in the wind. Felt like high-school. And why no CEO? Glad im gone.
bad,"Since merging with Actavis, work life balance is non-existant.  Do not even apply to this company if you can't work 70 hours a week.  Management puts extreme pressure for more and more work to get done in less and less time with a smaller and smaller staff.  No one has time to assist or train new employees.  Now with the Forest merger top management committed to Wall Street that they would achieve a billion a year in synergies (salary reductions).  Thus, they are cutting to the bone.  If you join now you will be very likely to be cut within six months if you last that long.  If you interview ask why the incumbent left.  I recommend you avoid this company at all costs."
bad,"I have been working at Actavis  full-time"
bad,"A typical day is between 9-6 and the managers expect you to work more than normal working hours..........reason behind is US based company....horrible managers......very non-cooperative"
bad,Patient and Physician services Department is ran by someone that has very little educational background. The department has very poor communication and isn't organized very well. The people in the department aren't treated equally and I believe that people in a department like that should get the same treatment across the board. I would not recommend this department to work in.
bad,5 years at Actavis as a chemical processor. Horrible training. You will be discplined for doing something wrong even if it's the way you were trained.
bad,Management is horrible! Very poorly trained DM's that get promoted to early.
bad,"Forest believes it is a serious multinational drug company...and are sadly mistaken! They have too many processes, not enough resources and a phony superficial corporate culture. It always seemed like the company was trying to do things on the cheap by cutting corners. Basically it's not really a company that one could feel proud to work for."
bad,Worst unorganized facility I  ever worked in. Management spends too much time meeting and debating about doing work instead of actually working. Its like working for the government everything is politics.
bad,"Allergan honestly feels like a sinking ship. It is a company that is making billions of dollars a year in profits but when the share price dips below $165 they start ruining peoples lives by laying them off. They claim that it is because they are ""humble"" enough (their words) to accept that keeping share holders pockets extra fat is what is important. It is really sad. Just 3 years ago we were all proud to be a part of this company, but greed rules the day. I am still employed so this review is not out of revenge.It just an honest opinion"
bad,"- Good benefits"
bad,At interview  I was told it was an office that had banter. It was lifeless. I was micro managed. No one talked not only in my dept but in the open plan office generally. The job required two screens of which only one was available. They had over a month to get my work station in place. Many of the longer serving staff talked about wanting redundancy now Pfizer have taken over. Management did not engage in staff and was often out of office.  I lasted two weeks and was so miserable. Sitting at a screen for 7.5 hours a day is unhealthy.
bad,"There was a time when opinions mattered, when effort, ingenuity and looking at things from a different view mattered. That ended when Watson ""bought"" Actavis. Actavis management took over. European mentality that Americans were inferior and their opinions meant nothing was pervasive. To question was to put a target on your back. Only the sheep who were fed to political wolves remained. "
bad,"First shift works 10 to 12 hour days and the new ""supervisor"" acts like a child. I would not recomend this company to anyone. You will work pointless weekends. The raise that you will be givin isn't worth the one year wait. The co works are good people but severaly miss treated by management."
bad,They do not care about you as a person. You never know when you have to be at work. Management sucks!!!!!! Turn over rate is high. Not a good company.
bad,What they do as a company can give you personal fulfillment knowing what you do can help others but the work environment is very uncomfortable and if you are not a favorite to the managers and group leads they will give you a hard time until you quit or they set you up to be fired and making complaints as a temp.or permanent worker doesn't change anything.
bad,I worked for Forest Labs as a contractor and they treated their contractors as disposables.  They did not value their work force at all and would not invest in their development.  I would not recommend this place to work at to anyone.
bad,This company is being positioned to be sold.  Would not recommend unless needing something until you can find another company with better long term prospects.
bad,"This company was a great place to work, Managment has changed and it seems as though every change made was pulled out of thin air and put into existence. This company pays well and does not care for its employee's due to the great pay. They micromanage and do not take feedback very well. They have several unqualified people in management who do not know what there doing. They value friendship over anything and do not have policy's in place but will make up one and tell you to follow it. If you love chaos and good pay this is the company for you!"
bad,"I have been with Allergan Eye Care for many years."
bad,"Une ambiance de travail déplorable et les responsables protègent la personne qui harcèle les autres. Je n'ai jamais travaillé dans une si mauvaise ambiance de travail..Dommage, les locaux sont très agréables."
bad,"would not want any friends or family to work for this company. very stressful, very unorganized. unpredictably. unfair to employees. advancement very hard to come by."
bad,"I worked in the Waco, TX facility. "
bad,Very disorganized and low company morale. High attrition rate and non-competitive compensation/benefits and poor management styles are rarely corrected.
bad,Very stressful they don't work with you you never know when you going home so don't play Nothing ahead they play favorites and talk about their employees like dogs good money Bad Company
bad,Good company with great long term prospects.   The people are extremely hard working professionals.  The Management is strong and very well balanced.  I would recommend that anyone interested apply for a position at this company
bad,great benefits but looong hours and a stressful environment down always make it worth it. awful management...and some times mandatory overtime...12= hours 5days a week..come on
bad,Very stressful and poor work life balance.  Management is terrible and untrustworthy.  Constant worry about job security.  No freedom to sell/be yourself in selling situations.
bad,Overall company is good with good benefits but the management is difficult . The policies of the company are really very good but there is always a sense of job insecurity because of constant mergers .
bad,"Extremely long hours"
bad,Summary sums it up.  Morals are completely lacking in management.  I was looking to leave after the first year and would have except that my relocation package required me to repay it in full if I did.  i know several other people left for the same reason.
bad,"Product surveillance department was divided into two groups. One was call center, and the other group did the investigation of the products (main work); however, both were categorized as product surveillance representatives I (other positions such as Product Surv. Rep II is senior and III is team lead).  Read the responsibilities carefully to make sure you are interviewing for the correct position. Call center representatives could not volunteer to work on projects. Meetings were sad. There was no enthusiasm to work as a team to improve existing processes or work on new projects etc.  Some senior team members were working under tremendous pressure to improve the call metrics. Senior team members were not crossed trained. Work-life balance was poor regardless of having an awesome employee engagement committee. Quiet place."
bad,"leaders in aesthetic business. Centralized mentality, Slow decision making and resistance to any type of change. , Recently expanded in terms of people but gaps in essential support functions like medico-marketing. continuous change in strategies. majority of people are in their job for less than 2 years which driving in a lack of harmonization. high turnover due to management created unhealthy environment with high instability and feelings of insecurity."
bad,"Management is unstable. Career advancement is promised and then withheld."
bad,"Its good money, but its the hours , because we have to work certain amount of hours and be laid off for 3 months and I can't do that. I need find work where I don't constantly have to be laid off after reaching certain hours."
bad,Always changing environments with no strategic IT outlook.  Most time spent trying to integrate all the different companies due to all the M&A over past few years.  No opportunity to grow your career.
bad,Allergan has alot of benefits but its not really based on work rather your promoted are not its based on who you know. Not my style
bad,"Ueberzeit wird nicht ausbezahlt, Work-Life Balance fehlt."
bad,allergan is a company which has good salary package & benefit but the overall culture & the managment system is not up to the mark.
bad,Disconnect among the senior leadership and director/ED level. It work culture is not homogeneous but leaders from different acquired companies continue with their earlier company culture and promote colleagues from their earlier company. Not much respect for people.
bad,"After so many M&As, those who could left and those who couldn't remained. Toxic culture, most are insecure and working out of fear of losing their jobs so brown-nose to stay, and out right lie and make up stories to make themselves look better than others. Great products but upper mgmt. cares little for employees and works you to the bone. Learn a lot if colleagues share."
bad,"I took a pay cut since I heard how great Anda was. Their bonus structure is horrible.  Barely make any money, and can't even keep up with bills.  DON'T LIE TO PEOPLE JUST TO GET THEM TO ACCEPT A POSITION."
bad,"I am employed as a research scientist.  I find the company disorganized and chaotic.  The management lacks people skills and are constantly micro-managing scientists.  "
bad,In my opinion Forest is a place that a person should plan as using as a stepping stone to better places in the Pharmaceutical industry. The company so mishandles their representatives in almost every way imaginable that it is hard to know where to begin a review of the sales side of Forest.
bad,"Ask.a.lot of question in the interview to understand the job. They will have you doing the work of three people, but that's not stated in the description."
bad,"Too big and disconnected.  No transparency.  So many great people, so many different leaders.  Lacked focus over my tenure.  Vision was too narrow and company focussed."
bad,The financial department was in flux at the time of my employment with workers coming in and out of the department. The company was in process of being bought by Allergan therefore most employees were being let go or relocated.
bad,"Change in the pharma industry is inevitable, but Allergan takes it to a new level.  As long as you're comfortable with shifting priorities and reorgs you'll be fairly compensated and surrounded by a lot of smart folks."
bad,"Dysfunctional work atmosphere.  Cannot trust senior leadership.  One of the worst place I've ever worked in.  If you have no choice, then go work there.  But DO NOT leave a good job to join this company."
bad,"It started very well, with an excellent boss who valued, nurtured and took care of his employees. Then with a reporting change, it all went downhill.  They do have some excellent products though, just very poor management."
bad,"The group I am working with love to laugh.  The group is now participating in the walk challenge.   Also, the group love to indulge in eating pizza when a project goal has been met."
bad,"selling devices, aesthetics and pharmaceuticals for a top notch fortune 500 leader. innovative and growth pharma on the frontier.  Selling to physicians, hospitals and group purchasing organizations and having the ability to negotiate contracts is a must.  you need to be driven and a leader. Management qualities"
bad,"Overall y a good company to work...But not a healthy organization."
bad,Great company to work for over all.  Florida locations are great.  The yearly bonuses were good.  there was opportunity for career growth.
bad,Good worklife balance - terrible practices and management
bad,"I work in Eye Care and not all Area Managers are bad but my Area Manager, he is a MICRO-MANAGING NIGHTMARE!!!"
bad,"busy and steady work, but lacks communication with supervisors and employees. Different shifts get to do different things from the other shifts. Supervisors don't know how to treat their employees or to talk to them.The hardest part of this job is being trained on all the areas and not being left on one job or position."
bad,"Manage day to day trouble tickets in Remedy, hated to leave but had a great 8 years"
bad,Il faut adhérer à la culture d'entreprise qui est de diviser pour mieux régner.
bad,"The pay and benefits are good, but the management is terrible. It’s based on who you know and not what you know. Pretty much the brother n law claus in this company. The rules only apply to certain people. No matter how big of policy is broken if you are in the right click it will be swept under rug and the person that broke rule will be promoted . There is no point having data integrity meetings at this place"
bad,Theres is sabatoge In the departments. The upper leadership tell you one and do something different and hold grudges. The team leads hire family and friends and advance them before others.Its more about numbers than quality my team lead was a family to the following shift only different last names it was more about setting them up for a good a shift but when something is done wrong nothing is addressed just covered up because they are family.
bad,"For my Customer Service Representative role, we are on the phones at all times during the day. There were few opportunities for growth and a high turnover rate for this department."
bad,"culture at allergan is a mess because of all the mergers.  think twice about coming here, no job security at all and upper IT management is awful.  not sure about other areas of the company.  Irvine (legacy Allergan) people are rude and act like they know it all."
bad,"I felt under a lot of unnecessary pressure at Allergan."
bad,"Lack of strong management combined with decreased stability due to large company wide layoffs."
bad,"Company atmosphere is changing as new CEO doesn't care about anything other than shareholders pockets. As an employee of former Forest Laboratories, Actavis doesn't care about the employee as much as Forest did."
bad,Oversee and coordinate the day-to-day running of projects by assisting and supporting Project Coordinator and Managers in their daily duties. Acting as administrative support to Project Coordinators and Managers on projects.
bad,OK place to work if it's still around after layoffs and acquisition
bad,"très bonne entreprise mais pas possible d evoluer j etais opératrice au sein de cette entreprise, je faisais du mirage,clipssage,et conditionnement en blister"
bad,Lots of due diligence to cover in a days work. Which is something I feel proud to accomplish at the end of the day. Enjoy dealing and working with onboarding new employees and educating them with company policies. As I workong h the recruitment side it is also an enjoyable experience coordinating and bringing candidates in from the outside.
bad,"Empresa com processos engessados e com gerência antiga e sem ética profissional alguma."
bad,"A big company issue is difficult to get the resources or tools to make tasks easier."
bad,"It's an okay job for getting your foot into the door of corporate America but there's very little room for advancement and management is skating by. You're treated like a child and there isn't any reason I would stay at this job long, especially because the pay is no where near competitive for the industry."
bad,It's okay... Not much to say. Basically filling in words to reach the next screen. I don't feel obligated to elaborate on my experience with any given company.
bad,"Work/life balance is lacking.  With multiple acquisitions, it is almost impossible to get day to day work completed.  Projects are assigned and then forgotten about unless they directly impact acquisitions."
bad,"You work alot of hours in compounding, your supervision is not where it needs to be."
bad,"It is generally a very quiet and steady paced environment. Yet, there are times when projects pick up to the point of overload."
bad,"The overall work is mind-numbing, its hard to care sometimes.  I learned a lot of computer programs, but there is constant pressure to meet numbers.  Management is decent.  There is not much room for advancement.  It seems the level you need to obtain to get a promotion or raise is always changing."
bad,"This company had great pay, but the culture with in the company was horrible. Management did not comprehend the duties of their workers and there for created a demanding work load that was impossible to complete. It was a lot of misunderstanding among higher level and lower level workers. Proper materials were never available to complete task, which led to missed deadlines. Shortcuts were often taken to meet deadlines, not in compliance with government regulated agencies. With a better management and increased communication this company would be a lot better to work for."
bad,"Stuck in the 80's, hospital team full of retail leadership, lack of ability to address unique situations - one size fits all mentality, do as we say and don't ask questions"
bad,It is know dermatological company and we are respected by doctor as we promote the products in scientific way.Imcrement is not so good
bad,"Pharmaceutical Development company with a business model focus on in-licensing products at different stages of development from other companies. Market branded products primarily in the US. Company is going through transition period, needs to increase revenue and profitability."
bad,I moved from CA to TX for this company. It was a great company to work for in CA but in TX there were a lot of problems. Work day was great but the work load was very outdated. Management was too new and did not understand the work that went into consignment. The Benefits were great. Free coffee and televisions in the break area.
bad,"This is very difficult company to work for. Beyond normal expectations. This culture is not normal and is a Forest based position; not Allergan. Several products, high stress, and never any positive feedback!!! DM in KY very difficult -both positions open in Ky due to issues with him."
bad,Did not care much about improving the facility nor adhering to basic safety requirments when brought to managements attention.
bad,"a typical day at work"
bad,It is an unorganized and frustrating environment to work in. The workload is heavy and there is a serious lack of proper training and training material.
bad,Before Allergan was acquired by Activas and before the hostile takeover Allergan was a great company. They provided great benefits and continued training. Promotions were hard to come by and some people seemed to have a more work than others.
bad,Set up the machine put the table/ cap in the Hooper then thread the label on the machine for a pre -start then check the line for clearest to run
good,"Currently doing a contract with Wellesley Therapeutics calling Gastroenterologists, GP's, pharmacies, and General Surgeons."
good,"This was a 'what have you done for me late' culture poxed by nepotism and favoritism.  Whomever schmoozed the most was acknowledged, not talent and hard work."
good,You basically are a ping pong ball going back and forth between what your managers monthly goal to what products are you going to have next quarter.  Not a good taste of the pharma industry.
good,30 min lunch. Team communication through IM only. Lack of training. Good benefits. Young team members. Yearly raises. Moving locations to an unaffordable area.
good,"The company culture depends on the business unit.  Seems like much has changed, and higher management is not employee-friendly at all times. Still, a good place to start, maybe not to stay."
good,"Not a good work/life balance.  Salaries need to be increased to stay competitive in the market and to keep employees.  For such a big company, it needs to pay employees better."
good,"no communication between departments and rules made up as they go along, full of clueless staff from supervisors upwards."
good,"This feedback is strictly related to Allergan roles in selling commercial pharmaceutical products.  Allergan has a good pipeline of medications.  The organization has changed significantly due to acquisitions.  The immediate divisional and regional management dictates the working/feedback environment.  The company has shifted significantly toward hiring very young people averaging 1-2 years of sales experience.  The initial pay is very low relative to the industry, and raises are minimal."
good,You don't know if you were guaranteed to work day to day. They have long lay off periods. They gave you no chance of going from temporary to perminant.
good,Continuous change of processes causing lack of organization and inconsistencies across projects. Better communication within teams for best practices is needed. FSP teams require more work than just oversight.
good,No consistency. Change in products comes rapidly. Not much time to digest new information.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was learning about the success of the products I sold.  The patients giving feedback to physicians with how well they were responding to the medicines.
good,"Ten Hour work days in the field visiting physicians and another two hours administrative work on a daily basis.  I learned the inner workings of medical offices day to day operations and the art of repeat rapport sales.  Management could improve in their support and coaching.  Much of what I learn on the job is trial and error.  The most difficult part of the job is gaining access to all of your physicians.  I work I highly called on territory and doctors often do not have time to see every rep that walks through the door.  The most enjoyable part of the job is earning the respect and trust of the physicians.  When they know you are providing useful information, services and solutions to their practice they look forward to seeing you and that makes it all worth it."
good,"Allergan runs most departments on 12 hour shifts, each shift begins with a start up meeting to inform everyone how their lines are running and to make us aware of any upcoming changes. Working here I have learned about the different Aseptic levels and environments. There's a lot of repetitive lifting, walking and standing on each line."
good,"Although the workload is still similar, since Watson acquired Actavis the general tone and morale of the company has degraded greatly.  What was once a long term career opportunity it has become a company of CYA.  Employees are no longer empowered to make the right decisions or to manage their own workload/actions.  Employees are generally overworked and given little resources to accomplish their jobs, but will ultimately be held accountable if the end result isn't in the company's favor."
good,"No thank you at this time.   I typically do not comment on social media platforms.  If anyone needs to know, just look me up on linkedin and identify yourself."
good,"Too much change, poor management, no real advancement, poor training and resources for new employees, poor employee engagement and social interactions. Very ""clickish"" and ""mean girl"" personalities once they hired so many 22-28 year olds."
good,The job is full of drama. From the temps to the supervisors. I loved what the job produced but the structure of the company sucks! The 3rd shift boss is super wack!
good,"Five years at Allergan Liverpool. Expanding workplace but terrible management.  Some intetesting biologics projects. Scientists/Snr scientists should expect weekend working, inflexible hours and relatively low pay compared to other companies."
good,Responsible to work pick and grab pharmaceutical products as a team dependable quick pace. Gets irritating when other employee's not paying attention on work duty and falls behind expectation.
good,"Impossible to make the highest commission with the goal formulas and layoffs were a factor. Management changed with every layoff and there was little consistency among them. With a couple of important patent losses, layoffs are looming for 2018."
good,"shortages of equipment, resources, and guidance prevent employees from fully completing their work in a timely manner. If you like staying 2-3 hours after working a 10 hour shift this is the place for you. Opportunities to move up are few and hard to find. No room for growth at this company"
good,"Job was fairly fare and its a good company to work for.Great company cant say to much but it was a great working environment, Great company no complaints"
good,A typical day would be 8-5 know have all your paper work in time your samples must be accurate once a month.  Being your own boss in your territory. Always know your competition.
good,"Local de trabalho com estrutura tranquila, pessoas agradáveis, equipe excelente, porém, empresa com processos engessados e falhas de gestão tornando muitas tomadas de decisões centralizadas na gestão e não na equipe. Protecionismo de colaboradores por parte de gestores e camuflagem de problemas."
good,"It was good  learning for Me during my stay at JLM.The company had many Employees benefits like Family Medical policy."
good,"A typical day at work would be standard for a customer service rep job. Logging in, tracking the previous days emails and getting on the phones. What I learned is how to lead new trainees onboarding through teaching how to streamline the call process. Management was ok but more of a playful setting than goal oriented which is fine but the accountability was still there. There weren't coachings and when there was it was mainly personal stories back and forth. The hardest part of the job was trying to move around in departments. The most enjoyable part of the job were the customers."
good,Highly regulated industry with constant changes. Work colleagues were great and teamwork was at an all time high when the crunch was on. Never a dull moment at the office.
good,"I love being a Specialty Rep! With this company, I was able to call on Urology physicians and learned a ton of new things! A new system of the body, four new productive and efficacious products, new management and new team members.  "
good,Although a large company the individual sites are small facilities.  A great place to gain experience and professional growth. If you are looking for advancement opportunities in position and compensation this may not be the place for you.
good,"Very hectic environment dealing with several country sites and preparing each site and country for initiation."
good,"great products, excellent compensation. I learned a tremendous amount about teamwork, healthcare, compliance, and was fortunate enough to have had some wonderful managers and partners during my time there."
good,"Allergan has been going through a lot of turmoil since I've been on board. Divisions are being closed, employees are being cut, no new drugs in pipeline to create job security."
good,I enjoyed working for Forest prior to the acquisition by Actavis. Post the Actavis purchase of Forest company and quality couture changed rapidly.  Upon the Merger with Allergan and the divestiture of the Generic business unite the Quality Climate has improved. Challenging work
good,Good company to get into pharma as the training and culture are decent.  Competitive but it is a team selling environment so if you have a lazy teammate it affects your paycheck
good,"Forest Laboratories name was changed to Allergan, before Allergan, Forest Laboratories was a really great company to work for. Great benefits and work life balance."
good,"Pros: The people, the products, and the benefits. Sometimes we got catered lunches. "
good,Company culture is unethical and management encourages unlawful behavior. Small company with a lot of visibility - I would not choose to work for them again.
good,the culture in pharmaceutical companies is very different than any other organizations I have experienced.  It is very much like a 'caste' system; where employees are forbidden to communicate freely with anyone at a higher level without going through 'proper channels' to respond.  Even in response to a direct request via telephone or email.
good,"I worked  for Forest Laboratories as an Admin III. I didn't have much opportunity for growth as I don't have a background in marketing or legal. I enjoyed traveling for work and having a nice, clean peaceful environment to work in."
good,"Very political environment, difficult to advance, very little appreciation for employees.  The company makes a lot of money but never uses it to improve the company culture and employee satisfaction."
good,Large Biotech company with many great products and leaders in the industry.  Products have a great reputation and are well thought of by doctors and staff.
good,"visiting top volume offices and pharmacies, growing business with these providers. Pharmacy follow up, speaker programs, lunch and learns. Hard work to hit goals."
good,the territories are quite large and the training was excellent. the expectations for new employees is vast given the geography of the territory. good management and coworker. the hardes part of the job is the size of the territories.
good,"overall rating 3"
good,Taking over a lot of US companies and laying everybody off.  Management could be a lot better.  They do not care about their employees
good,Obsolete maintenance practices.  No room for advancement. No room for suggestions leading to updated maintenance practices.
good,Management needs to be trained to manage and HR needs to stop turning a blind eye to bad management techniques.
good,"nulla di particolare, una normale azienda del farmaco per la quale l'obiettivo principale è sempre stato il business. In questo vortice spesso purtroppo ha perso di vista l'aspetto umano del dialogo e della gratificazione e tutto questo era sempre più evidente al crescere dell'azienda. Per il resto comunque si tratta di una grossa multinazionale, con ottimo listino di prodotti specialistici ed in grossa espansione in tutto il mondo. Un'azienda che sposta parte dei guadagni in ricerca e sviluppo, altro punto molto importante."
good,"Allergan is going through a difficult time now and on the defensive for a potential takeover. Allergan's conservative, management heavy, cumbersome processes and complacent staff have allowed it to be in this position and now have to make drastic changes to try and block the takeover."
good,Intensely high paced global manufacturing site with diverse workforce and management.
good,"The bulk of my overall work was done within one to two days, then for the remainder of the work week there was a lot of down time which made my work days very slow.  I work better with a consistent work flow and I work very, very, well under pressure and am very much a multi-tasker.  I have learned how to work very well with very diverse personalities.   My other co-workers that I didn't interact with on a daily basis were absolutely wonderful, they will be the one's that I will miss the most about my job.  My work atmosphere was not very comfortable...very bright white, white, walls, white floors, bright light, almost snow-blindness, long term it was affecting my health therefore decided to resign."
good,"Depending on the task of the day.  One day I could be cleaning the support areas and fill rooms.  Other days I could be running the production floor.  And a few days I could be doing all three.  I would pull and stage components, set the fill room and pack floor, verify line status with line support and assure all paper work was up to date and ready for production."
good,Allergan is a good post college place to start. Raises are non existent.
good,-Poor Communication across the board
good,A challenging role with opportunities to expand one's professional background. Interactive and collaborative culture with solid collaborations with industrial and academic companies.
good,Legacy Allergan was a fantastic place to work  Ever since the merger with Actavis it has really changed.  Ultimately most of upper management is legacy Forest and they have subsequently weeded out most legacy Allergan employees.
good,"Ja foi boa."
good,"Lack of common sense and close to zero product expertise from the medical staff. Poor compensation regardless of amount of work you can do. There is a lot of talk about quality, but quality is the first thing to go when trying to save time."
good,"Ton of driving but great opportunity to establish great relationships. "
good,"Great starting company for those interested in Pharma. Your days are fairly uniform, you learn a lot about how the pharma industry works. Management could be better, and you never feel much job security, but coworkers are amazing, and they do their best to make it a fun working environment."
good,"This company forgets about the workers who actually do the job.  Big Pharma at its extreme.  Office-club management, no recognition of years of service, and no career advancement."
good,"The site has recently changed to focus more on GMP production and less development work. This results in lots of cross training but can mean being spread too thin across disciplines.  Scientists are required to been proficient in all aspects of production, from lab to GMP."
good,"In order to have a good work environment, all the employees should be treated the same.  If some employees are giving favoritism over others, it will create an unsafe environment, therefore, it will affect the production and alike."
good,Department growing that has been implementing improvements. Focus on quality. Normal eight hour work days with two breaks and a lunch.
good,I worked in records retention and was a temp employee. My duties were limited and direction was given to permanent employees. Good paying job to have and many options to move around the company.
good,work was stressful long hours with no appreciation for employees hostile management rude and not caring of employees feelings coworkers were pleasant but also alot of drama and favoritism. the hardest part of the job was the lack of respect
good,"- Good place to work in especially Eye care franchise with knowledgeable team members and good work/life balance."
good,"Company good, upper management doesnt care about reps. no job security. free car, free gas, but your a delivery guy/girl to offices if they dont write your products and expect you to bring them food every time your there."
good,recent events have forced management to make hard personnel decisions.
good,"The job consisted of 2 shift patterns .Day shift was from 6.30am until 14:30pm and evening shift was from 14:30 pm to 22:30pm. On arrival at work we did a shift changeover and were given details of our days work and what stage the machine was at . On arrival in to glatt room we checked machine status and all recorded data from previous shift .At forest I learned more about product coating on wurster glatt coating machine and sieving of products on russell finex seperator machine.Management at Forest were very approachable and very easy to get along with . They emphasized that their door was always open for any queries we had . The workforce at Forest were very easy going and made me feel very welcome as if I had been there for years . The hardest part of the job were the cleans , which could take up to 3 days to complete and then the room had to be swabbed to make sure if was free from cross contamination . The hardest part of the job was the early mornings , getting out of bed at 4.30am to travel to work in Dublin and then travelling home in heavy traffic . The most enjoyable part of the job was the sense of comradery between all employees at Forest which made the working very easy and enjoyable."
good,"From day to day is different, but essentially I work with investigators who are enrolled in our studies. Sometimes this involves paying patients for site visits, sometimes reviewing potential errors on forms, and resolving inquiries related to devices."
good,Unrealistic expectations from immediate supervisor. He was new to the position.
good,A Allergan é uma empresa que nao te passa seguranca para dar continuidade no trabalho. No momento que voce pensa estar bem voce pode ser demitido. Sem contar que a supervisao nao olha por voce. O que compensa é que eles nao pagam mal tem beneficios e os colegas de trabalham la fazem do ambiente o melhor possivel.
good,"Very fun staff. Management very laid back and understanding. Boys club though. They do not appreciate hard working women. Will tell you what you want to hear but rarely follows through on promises. Good place to get pharmaceutical experience. Definitely a stepping stone, Not career company. Lowest paying in the industry"
good,"It's a good place, as long as your not interested in career advancement.  They tend to hire  from outside rather than promoting from within.  Corporate office has a great cafeteria and gym."
good,"working at allergan was great in the beginning. now there are too many changes rolling out at one time, creating mayhem throughout the packaging department. most of the time the upper management strives for numbers rather than quality."
good,"Allergan Canada has settled well after a series of mergers in recent years.   There is a good pipeline, good new leader and really good people generally speaking.  There is the freedom to succeed or fail with and appropriate amount of corporate governance."
good,"Need to re-boot and will be great again "
good,"With minimum and within politically charged environment, one must find his/her own way to ""prove"" successful. Many managers are egoistic and plain insulting."
good,"Première expérience dans le domaine pharmaceutique,  intéressante, malgré que le travail soit vite répétitif et peu enrichissant sur le long terme. "
good,"Un empleo exigente , de responsabilidad  , cambiante"
good,Management was not helpful. Learned a lot on my own because I didn't have the help from my counterparts or manager. Had way too many products and no support from team to collaborate together and be successful.
good,Forest Laboratories did not have room for growth in the production department. They also did not encourage expanding our knowledge with advanced computer classes. I learned more about Powerpoint and InDesign and didn't really advance in other programs such as web design. The responsibilities grew but the salary did not grow significantly nor did our titles. The people in our department worked well together working as a team to get our projects completed in a timely manner and meet the deadlines.
good,"Opportunity to do do lot of work, very lean organization so you are responsible for lot of things, which is great for your experience."
good,Productive and fun workplace with learning of new products and equipment. Before Allergan got bought by Actavis environment and workplace culture was enjoyable. Do not know of them anymore due to being laid off due to acquisition
good,"Micromanagement at all levels, Company has outgrown its appeal.  Excellent product with great benefits for patients and good work life balance, however management is not loyal."
good,"Great sales organization focused on increasing customer awareness through promotion to doctors and pharmacists.  High energy, competitive, self-motivated people do exceptionally well.  Need to be adaptable and enjoy change."
good,"Compensation was great, work life balance was great, however, worked through 2 RDs, 3 DMs, and 2 rounds of layoffs in just 1 year.  Culture really depended on the managers in place.  Half was good, half was terrible."
good,"Very professional & organized work environment.  Excellent facility.  Very structured."
good,Great job if you don't have a family. Work every weekend. Fun atmosphere but only people straight out of school get promoted. Lots of hard workers there but they're stuck in the same spot. Hire more tenants then full timers
good,"Learned how to Initiate, maintain, update database and set up complaint files according to 21 CFR and Quality Management System. Also learned how to submit regulatory reports to the FDA."
good,"Specialty Position developing and growing relationships with Ob/Gyn’s, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and office staff  while promoting Women’s Health Products in large geographical area."
good,Due to the pharmaceutical background of Allergan it was enjoyable to learn the aspect of how they run things other than the way they managed things
good,"I have been employed at Actavis (formerly Watson Pharma, Inc.) for almost 14 years. There was a lot of stability in my first 12 years at the company, but change in management due to recent acquisitions has resulted in shift of company mission and culture. The company would be better suited for someone who works well in ""big pharma"". I learned a lot through my various roles at Actavis/Watson, such as strategic planning, writing business plans, forecasting, project management and team building, and managing a product team. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with very smart, engaging people and learning new things from them everyday. The hardest part of the job is trying to get innovative ideas blessed by management and getting the budget to carry through your brand plans."
good,"A empresa tem uma forte cultura organizacional. Neste período que trabalho, venho adquirindo conhecimentos nas áreas de gestão de performance, foco no cliente e estratégia de negócios. Embora seja uma companhia de ponta na indústria farmacêutica, ainda mantém em seus quadros de funcionários algumas práticas e lideranças obsoletas."
good,"Traditional company,  use to be stable.  But not sure how the company goes from here. Research will be impacted. benefit is not very good, vacation"
good,"Overall a good company to work for. Recent re-structures affected several units. Good work/life balance, decent benefits, tall structure with many levels of VPs, directors, and managers."
good,"Starting at Allergan was a great opportunity for me to prove myself. I was offered the position for receptionist while I was temping there in the first month that I was there. "
good,"This job is very demanding, however, the people make it very rewarding and enjoyable. Work hard and be seen and they will reward you financially every year."
good,It was a nice place to work but at some point you stop trusting management. Fast paced and busy but infrastructure is constantly changing so its hard to feel comfortable and safe in your postion.
good,Empresa que oferece produtos muito bons em mercados desafiantes
good,Många härliga arbetskamrater och en bra team spirit
good,This review is for Forest Laboratories and not for Allergan. Forest Labs had issues with the directions the senior leadership wanted to take the company which ultimately resulted in the acquisition. The people who worked in the office were great.
good,"Giornata di lavoro stimolante, a contatto col pubblico, ho imparato a relazionarmi coi clienti"
good,"Global interface and work place"
good,"Although officially owned by Allergan at one point, I did not actually work for them.  My employer was Actavis-Watson Laboratories and we worked in the generic space, not branded pharma."
good,When I worked at Allergan they were going thru so many changes and the environment was very unstable.  I had 5 managers in 3 years.  Also I found upper management was only promoted for who they knew versus capabilities.  Very week organization in my opinion.  Forest came in and took over the company and promoted people that were only loyal to Forest legacy.  People at this company aren't paid to think only paid to follow.  My opinion of this company is they won;t be a survivor in ten years.
good,"Too fast paced.  Department went from 2 people to 8 people back down to 2 people.  Company couldn't decide if they really wanted our department or now so, hence, department was disbanded."
good,Need to be able to work at a fast quick learner to troubleshoot machines you will be working with able to stand for long periods of time ans some heavy lifting up to 30lbs
good,"les locaux sont neufs,ambiance de travail correct,travail varié,l'évolution impossible."
good,I have not spent enough time with core Allergan team members to provide meaningful feedback on the organization.  Most of my interaction with the team has been through the systems integration of LifeCell to Allergan.
good,There is a lot of constant organizational change and restructuring.  Many people have left due to these changes.  Would be good to maintain some consistency.
good,"The people there are great, fun and welcoming. It is a relatively laid back place to work. The hardest part was keeping up with the ever-changing company goals and business structures."
good,Launched new products with this position..  Had to seek thought leaders from Miami South to North.  I have exceptional customer service by bringing a positive approach by being solution oriented.  Medicine and health is my passion and I have accomplished great achievements.  I have built outstanding relationships by adding value to my accounts.
good,"a typical day at work is waking up to a ton off messages, there is a great communication aspect, which is what i actually like. New managers often- huge turn over rates."
good,"unless you had a role of standing or being able to move around while working, you probably will end up falling asleep. has to be one of the most boring places i have ever worked. but everything else like benefits and pay, great."
good,contract work only didn't hire me permanently even though did great job loved boss no notice just cut me off one day said contract was up but contact company told me not my boss
good,I have enjoyed my time at Allergen and it has provided me with opportunities to grow and further my career in the pharmaceutical industry. There is a focus more on packaging rather than quality and as result one side circumvents the other.
good,"This isn't the worst job out there... But also not the best. Culture has been changing drastically and you can feel both the field representatives and the inside sales teams getting exhausted. "
good,Good company out of Israel that no longer has a rep here in NM. Was able to use resources and relationships to help gain access in the hospital atmosphere.  I have enjoyed each job I have had in the past.
good,"culture can be good but also miserable, we need leadership to show value to their good employees to keep them engaged. Continue to invest into your employees future and check in to see what they need to continue a happy and health environment."
good,Womens Health Division. Central/West region is an incredible place to work. Experienced management with great opportunity. Best place to be at Allergan besides Dermatology/Facial division.
good,"Te entregan las herramientas adecuadas."
good,Overall work experience is good. Learning exposure is limited as it is a trading company. Learning more about managerial skills. It gives pleasure in building the team and guiding them in their achievements.
good,"good work environment . good time to work with Allergan."
good,There was a sense of urgency and accountability that I liked with Forest. It offered some diversity in the disease states and products being promoted.
good,"Management needs work, but they are improving. The labs are crowded and there's not a lot of space to work, but again, they are improving."
good,Days go by fast since your working in a fast paced manufacturing enviroment. Coworkers are willing to help out out of a jam. After resolving equipment breakdowns you get a feel of accomplisment.
good,I enjoyed meeting and interacting with the physicians and their staff.  The products I marketed to them really did change patients' lives.
good,I learn new things everyday.  Totally enjoy working here.  There are so many nice people to work with and the training program is great.
good,"I learned more about SAP. A typical day was busy, fast- paced and long. The most enjoyable thing about my job was learning the different types for forklifts."
good,"Allergan was a great place to work. I  learned many new skills that I can use in the future such as Inventory control and material management using the SAP system. The co-workers were friendly and we always helped each other when needed. the perks and benefits were great. We had a cafeteria, an on site nurse, even a concierge that would handle dry cleaning and car washes. They also had a gym, basketball court, a softball field and other athletic activities. Health, Dental, and Vision insurance were really good as was the 401K retirement plan. "
good,"Growing pains, but not yet a good place to work for. There are lot of issues with mergers. Poor communication."
good,"one learns many different things, great for resume building."
good,"This company was always in transition, therefore, responsibilities changed constantly. Fortunately this allow for exposure and growth. I learned the severity of compliance as it pertains to the pharmaceutical industry. Management were somewhat distant from the level I fulfilled, but my was position was to provide assistance to my co-workers by aiding them in completing there tasks. The hardest part of the job was getting the full picture of the goals and direction of the department because the company was in transition and was acquired. The most enjoyable part of the job was the camaraderie,"
good,10 years of sales and marketing experience and many good people.
good,"Closing down LI Plants, company is closing all Long Island plants mid 2015"
good,Allergan is a good place to work. Your promotion and appraisal only depends on your manager. There is high growth opportunities to people with high potential. Basic systems  are still under construction and you may have to run from pillar to post for small thing.
good,Learned how to pack medicine for doctor offices. Also learned how to read expiration dates for certain medicines.
good,"Nada contra a Allergan, creio apenas que acabou um ciclo que durou 15 anos."
good,This was a great place to work until recently. The new CEO has sold Forest to Actavis. So there will be no more Forest as of June. Now we are all being super micro-managed.
good,"I prefer to not comment specifically.  The industry as a whole is a fast paced, fun place to work if you have good products and great people to work with."
good,Forest has a great working environment.  Working in a team environment is very informative and a great learning experience each individuals ideas are bounced off one another.
good,Fun place to work with great people.  Realy enjoyed my time at Allergan
good,"Everyday it was a challenge to build up clientele and interact with new clients in order to initiate with the conversions for the sale."
good,Profesoinalmente ingrese en un momento de compañia que estaba en cambio en la region en el momento mas complejo del pais en los ultimos 15 años (2000) por lo cual la experiencia ha sido relativamente buena como primer experiencia de Jefatura pero en un entorno muy complejo.
good,The enviroment was enjoyable as well as the co-workers. The company is currently experiencing growing pains in which process improvement needs to be in place.
good,"Forest provides a dynamic and challenging work environment. I've learned how to effectively manage projects, people and priorities. Each day is different, which forces me to handle change and stress well. The hardest part is juggling many initiatives with stringent deadlines and the most enjoyable is that I'm never bored. "
good,"A typical day at work starts off with about 10-15 emails, then certain items you need to do, along with a meeting or two a day. The management is good, but new to the device industry. The co-workers are amazing and make a great team. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the constant change and new directions the company takes. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping others conduct a clinical trial."
good,Allergan is an ideal place to begin a career for those who are interested in the pharma industry.
good,"Fairly tedious, but we were allowed to listen to music in the file room"
good,Experience included a number of opportunities. In the almost 12 years I have worked at Forest the growth of the company was tremendous.
good,A fantastic company with excellent recognition but very demanding
good,Smaller orgainization allows for multiple hats to be worn.
good,"Not great for work-life balance, but if single, and can thus afford to put in the hours, you will be compensated well for your efforts s goal setting was fair for me."
good,In allergan most important learning was to be the best in terms of knowledge and values.
good,Allergan provides a work environment that encourages one to learn on the go.  This fast pace work environment encourages reps to be nibble and entrepreneurial.
good,"The job pays ok, bit not as much as other pharmaceutical companies in the industry. The employees are great, the management has a disconnect with the operators."
good,Stellar products. Mostly highly talented talent. Unfair compensation plan for the neuroscience division which allowed territorial and geographical uncontrollables to have a negative impact on sales performance goals impacting compensation. Advancement opportunities if desired.
good,"Allergan has a lot of project opportunities for quality improvements. It’s a good company to align the management culture with the quality system and regulatory agencies. The company need to restructure management, has a change mindset focus on quality and following procedures and regulations. It’s a good learning place."
good,Started my career at Allergan and it was a great place to work and the leadership was generally very supportive and allowed individuals like myself to create their own career path. Good place to work due to high growth in the 80's
good,It was a Temporary job while I was in college. It was a good job. I really loved how willing they where to work with my school schedule. Also it was a great work environment where we all got along and worked as a team.
good,"It was a new contract for the company, It has some challenges, but it was a good job. Very stressful troubleshooting equipment for people that are not computer illiterate."
good,"- Meeting scheduling"
good,"Great Job, Customers, Direct Supervisor, and Regional Director.  Huge Territory that required many overnights with plans and driving.  No upward mobility due to the continuous layoffs."
good,As I worked from home I did not go into the office that much so I cannot talk about the day to day environment in the office. I did learn a lot about myself in that I am very disciplined and can work remotely or as part of a team. There was no hard part as such as all areas can be testing but the most enjoyable part was the travelling and also dealing with all the different people day to day and managing the booths at the congresses.
good,"Allergan is a good place to work at, however promotion from within is available but isn't commensurate with the opportunity so this is a place where the company can develop"
good,Great place to work and sharpen one's skills on electronics and robotics. They have pretty advance technology and a great budget for maintenance. Unfortunately the company was in negotiations to sell and techs that were on a contract were let go and I was a new tech so I was let go.
good,The company will develop you and help you grow. Each department has its own culture but enjoyable. A typical day will keep you busy from the moment you arrive until you leave for the day. Management’s door is always open. A rapid growing company.
good,"Good company with great benefits prior to the Actavis merger. After the merger happened, everything became unstable for legacy Allergan employees and many were let go."
good,"The majority of my career was with Forest Laboratories prior to the Allergan acquisition.  Forest was a family oriented environment where management and employees worked hard and cooperatively to ensure the highest quality work was achieved.  I am proud to say I had a successful 16 year career with this company until the acquisition, which resulted in the elimination of my department as well as all its employees."
good,"a typical day is fighting fires. Great systems. "
good,I am greatly appreciative of Allergan giving me an opportunity to break into a new industry. Soon after starting however rumors of a hostile takeover and then later news of the Allergan buyout put a damper on the initial enthusiasm and proved to be a trying time. Being impacted by the layoffs was disappointing as I had fostered such great relationships with those I worked with and from whom I learned so much from and attribute my fast growth as a Study Management Associate.
good,So many steps for approval. Managers nee to give more autonomy to employees.
good,"iam very happy to say,my client is very close to our team"
good,All the co workers are very good and helpful.It is good to work here but for my long term career growth i am looking for a good company.
good,"This is a great company to work for. I wouldnt hesitate to recommend it to others in need of employment; however, it is best as a starting point or a resting spot. This company is not a final destination for your career. Don't expect much lateral growth."
good,"Allergan is a quick growing company, constantly looking for acquisitions, etc. They have a good bonus structure, rewarding those who do well.Pipeline is rich but losing patent on Namenda will hurt."
good,Good overall company with solid pay structure and clear path to management. Unfortunately going through a lot of changes and lay offs and/or mergers and acquisitions are frequent.
good,"Lot of responsibilities"
good,"Overall, this is a good company with great values and integrity."
good,Great training program for sales.  Really enjoyed my direct management and team.  Upper management seems to always change directions and push salesforce to the extreme when stock prices are low.  Decent compensation program and a fun environment!
good,"In lieu of recent of goings-on in the company, job security is scant.  There is little faith in upper management leadership.  Many long-time associates talk of leaving."
good,Allergan is dedicated to providing cutting edge medications to increase the quality of life for people. Allergan provides great benefits and opportunities for advancement.
good,"Allergan is the result of mergers and acquisitions and as such comes changes and job uncertainty. As with all changes come some good management and some arrogant management, with the latter a reason for good people not to stay. When you hear the peers of the bad manager even criticizes them it make you wonder why they are kept on in the first place."
good,"La valoración general es positiva. Ambiente de trabajo grato y donde puedes aprender en el día a día acerca del sector de la empresa."
good,"Supported the product complaint system at Actavis through; leading and managing product complaint investigations, performing data analysis and trending of complaint information to proactively detect signals and take appropriate actions in a timely manner. Subject matter expert in training others in quality process related to post-market product complaints/adverse event associated with Actavis/Watson products in accordance with department policies and procedures as well as applicable FDA and international guidance and regulations"
good,"Company has solid products"
good,great company to start off your pharma career. POD type stucture. New Drugs which mean job stability.
good,Co-workers are very friendly and helpful. I am gaining very good experience in the field of my interest.
good,Good place to work but opportunities for growing professionally are very limited and some managers prefer to take an outside applicant rather than internal
good,"Start my work for Forest Pharmaceuticals before been acquired by Actavis "
good,bonne entreprise bien organisé malgré que ca ne convenait pas à mes attentes
good,"Forest, before buy-outs and new CEO's, was n awesome place to work providing a great work and life balance where you were HIGHLY rewarded for exceeding sales numbers."
good,Allergan is a good place to work if you want to break into Pharmaceutical Sales. Massive layoffs recently occurred & are likely to happen again before more hiring in the years ahead. Solid pipeline for 2019 & ahead. Great benefits & some DMs are incredible to work with.
good,"The employees and managers are very cool, friendly, and understanding people. The overall atmosphere is one similar to robots. There is too much monitoring and requirements to be glued to the chair and computer,"
good,Wonderful District Manager and colleagues.Great products and support from Marketing. Training was lacking and laborious.  Very cheap with meals and creature comforts.
good,Allergan changed greatly when we purchased them it as no longer a open door business everything became very closed doors no communication or information was being provides
good,"Allergan (A.K.A Actavis) use to be a fun, friendly work environment. However, since the management decided to close the site in Corona the workload has increased and employees have decreased. Everything is being rushed to transfer all the methods in time to shut down the site. Management only cares for the metrics being met and not about the employees."
good,"I enjoyed working at Allergan.  Like any company, restructuring and layoffs are real, and often.  In addition, professional and personal development wasn't delivered as anticipated and management wasn't able to clearly communicate concerns or plans of action to address.  "
good,Good company to work for but after the acquisition of Actavis the culture & management took over and decided not to renew my 6 month contract with them.
good,"Allergan is an extremely interesting company to work for with regard to research and products. All products are unique when compared with typical pharma products in that nearly all must be injected or inserted. "
good,very detailed training during new hire period. hardest part about my job is knowing how long it will be available
good,"Great Opportunity to learn about the manufacturing of eye care products, aseptic conditions and quality systems.  "
good,"There is a lot going on at Allergan, there are many many opportunities for growth and career development. Allergan is focused on employees following a career lattice rather than the traditional career ladder."
good,"Allergan was a professional place to be employed at.  Day to day activities include maintenance of EHS programs, addressing employee safety concerns and working with management to build sound EHS programs."
good,"The first day when I joined  Forest Lab I didn't have any experience of the pharmaceutical work. The manager and co-workers were very helpful. I started to work for the R&D department and I learned to work for all kinds of machines, and the rules of the oral solid GMP manufacturing. The co- workers that I worked with guided me through the process, we all worked together as a team to complete a project. The hardest part of the job was when we were running the clinical and feasibility batches. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I completed my batches."
good,The work is easy and it doesn't have any challenge.  There are not good opportunities and advancement. Poor management.
good,"All in all a good place to work."
good,Allergan Medical is a place where research gets done quickly.
good,"I was blessed to work with this company for over 12 years.  I started with Forest Pharmaceuticals which Allergan, through mergers and acquisitions , ultimately owned.  The workplace environment was competitive and performance based,  Allergan was a blessing to me and rewarded me with much.  I am a better professional due to the training and culture Allergan afforded me."
good,"I enjoyed my time working with Allergan. The training is great, co-workers were great, team environment, great product, innovative, and great benefits."
good,"Una empresa buena, donde se me brindó buen trato, crecí profesionalmente y me dio mucha experiencia."
good,"No quedarse solo con la operación indicada, sean proactivos y puntuales."
good,"overall a good place to work with a mix of young and experienced people in a multidisciplinary culture and environment."
good,Allergan offers many specialty areas to work for including Hospital focused on antibiotics. I really enjoyed my time here and regret moving on due to their desire to not sell in the hospital space.
good,"Se aprende mucho, hay muchos retos diariamente, el trabajo no es rutinario."
good,"Allergan is a great company to work for, however at some point in time it becomes a work and go home type of situation. You become burned out due to a lack of headcount in certain departments. At times, the workload becomes overwhelming and it is not easy for the small teams to stay afloat without lacking in another area."
good,"The QC Chemistry Lab gives opportunities, but the managers are not willing to go to bat for their employees nor do they keep their word. The managers expect employees to get extra work done on top of a full workload even if there are not enough hours in the day."
good,It was a very good company to work for at the start but as with many large companies there were changes in the business philosophies and management which in turn changed the culture of the company.
good,I like the work environment and the workers are friendly. Optional if you want overtime. Supervisor works with a good fit schedule for you if you need.
good,"Lots of perks, company car, gas card, insurance is covered.  Lots of windshield time. I would travel to cities 6 hours away to visit just a couple of doctors."
good,Allergan is a pay for performance company.  If you exceed your goals you will be compensated fairly.  the culture has changed over the past few years because of continuous downsizing/layoffs.  The most enjoyable part of Allergan are the people that work in the field.
good,Have fun and enjoy the experience but try to grasp as much knowledge as you can for the jobs in the pharmaceutical industry will last for at least 4 to 5 years
good,"Working with people who work hard at what they do.  We work from 7:30 AM to 7:30 PM working at the same line all day.  The hardest part of the job is standing for 12 hrs, in one spot .  Working with good people."
good,"This company has lots to offer and seemed very stable.  One day into the field, a downsizing was put into effect in which 225 reps were let go in the PCR division."
good,"It was great experience, and I have learned much with Allergan. Busy workdays, a lot of independent learning to be the best at your craft.  The company is a growth pharma company, change and adaptation is a must. Best part of the job is the people as in my colleueges,  and the customers."
good,"always on the phone, learned a lot about pharmaceutical industry and business development, micro manage style management, workplace culture was about a lot of team gatherings and meetings, not the hardest job ever as long as you have a passion for sales, most enjoyable part pf the job was learning. Plenty of business prospects and contacts to develop."
good,this is an alright place to apply an work for. just very unorganized and after 3 months you have to reapply. they tend to send people home if theres not enough work available
good,"Although the company has undergone many changes there's a core group of people that are great to work with."
good,"Great job to build your skills in the medical field. Very demanding with interaction with providers, staff, and pharmacy work. Building relationships with staff and providers is very important."
good,I would recommend.  It has grown and changed a great deal since the last 1.5 year.  The company is bring more processes and procedures.  This has its good and bad.

good,"I am grateful for the years at KMGL for teaching me how to be a hungry salesperson working for 100% commission.  My co-workers were fantastic and helped me to further grow in sales.  However, it is difficult to endorse a company that gives so little support and compensation to their sales staff."
good,Pfizer is the company that every healthcare professional knows.  I was always proud of my product portfolio.  Physicians responded with respect when Pfizer products were being discussed.  Truly a marketing dynamo
good,"It is a good place to learn and it was enjoyable to work with people there. I gained a lot of experience there, for examples, CMC, regulatory documentation, project management, CMO/CRO, statistic analysis, DOE, ..."
good,"It has been pleasure working for Forest Laboratories, Inc 18+ years. I have growth and love the people who I have work each and every day.  What I have learned from upper management never give up and persevere toward your goals. The hardest part of my job is making sure I meet the assigned projects before the deadlines. The most enjoyable part of my job I missed was working with my coworkers as a team player having so much fun.  I"
good,"This was a great place to work with good life/work balance and job security. However, it was acquired by Actavis in 2014 and it has changed since. Understaffed, overworked, no direction for the Irvine site."
good,"Leading the Actavis Global Brands R&D Project Management Department was exciting and challenging because numerous drug products were in various development stages at any given time, and geographically diverse cross-functional project teams and external alliances with development partners had to be managed simultaneously against aggressive timeline and budget constraints.  In addition, the Project Management function had to be efficiently integrated following several large acquisitions by this aggressively growing company."
good,"Excellent work environment for those that like to work independently and not interact much with co-workers.  Must be detail-oriented, punctual, and self motivated."
good,Actavis is one of the best companies to work for.  It has a unique culture and very friendly people. It is a world class company.  The company is expanding and so much to explore.
good,Started each day very early with a study calendar breaking down task for the entire week. I was able to plan accordingly based on projected projects and timelines. Staff very friendly and always willing to jump in no matter their level or position.
good,"A fast growing company, on the move!"

good,"Allergan is an excellent place to work and develop your career.  For those of us impacted by the recent consolidation, we were provided with a good severance package and other benefits to help us find new employment."
good,"A typical workday for me will be, get to work at 8: 00 a.m.,  check in workday to make sure my trainings are updated (SOP's and Test Methods), if not train on required training, go to lab, set up my instruments and glass wares for testing.  I will then obtained my workbook or notebook as applicable and start performing my test per Test method or SOP while documenting every step accurately and precisely.  "

good,This is pharmaceutical company that has been bought out and is leaving LI
good,"good work/life balance"
good,"Hours are flexible as long as you get the job done.  AGN needs to look into differentiating what a manager and leader is.  Co-workers are fantastic.  Hardest part of the job is knowing that AGN has a lot more potential to grow if they understand that the people they hire for managers and leaders are a factor in setting the culture. An example is that some employees who should be individual contributors are rewarded by promotion to manage people, where in fact they are stifled by it.  "
good,"One of the best sales development/training environments I've ever been a part of.  Calling on physician's, nurses, PA's and NP's to drive prescription growth in the primary care, Gastroenterology, Psychology, and Cardiovascular markets."

good,"Overall, Allergan is a good place to work. "
good,"Fun place to work "
good,"Allergan is a fast paced global organization with a primary focus on it's strategic planning and mission. As a result, audacious initiatives and mergers has created a change readiness culture."
good,"Allergan had a great work culture that started on the primary care side from Forest pharmaceuticals.  It was highly competitive, fast paced, and most people had a sense of purpose.  Change of CEO and the merge with Allergan, changed the culture to more of a big pharma culture that moved it towards making a lot of changes with a lot of restructuring."
good,"Great place to work, a lot of room for advancement if you know the right people. I learned a lot working for Allergan. Just choosing to continue on a different career path."
good,Company that promotes from within and will reward those that perform for sales results.  A lot of different types of roles to advance your skillset.  Good Variety of Specialty roles to promote into.
good,"I joined Forest Labs specifically because of its reputation as a stable force in the industry, it possessed consistent  and robust pipeline, and because of its people and culture.  It was an exciting time, but 3 merger/acquisitions in 4 years was definitely a ride."
good,Empresa com flexibilidade e integrada a TI. O ambiente de trabalho é cooperativo e trabalho em equipe.
good,Perfect if you're interest is in pharma industry. Pays well and very flexible with hours! Expect projects to be account driven but overall employees are nice.
good,Working at Allergen can be a typical 9 to 5 however its highly dependent on your own career ambitions. I work in an office based role so there isn't much interaction but the workplace culture is very friendly and family orientated.

good,Good place to work and learn the industry and how to focus on the interaction with the Doctors.  The work life balance is good.
good,"Fast paced, with quality management /coworkers that keep the work environment  fun and interesting every day. Offers school assistance. Great place to start if you are a recent college grad."
good,"Muy Competitiva"
good,"It was a wonderful team of people to work with, the only negative was that the corporate culture was to cater inordinately to the whims and desires of the sales force. Forest also allowed certain departments to spend excessively because they  were deemed to be special or elite.  It was not a typical corporate environment where cost savings was a high priority."
good,Great environment to get your foot in the door when it comes to corporate finance. Had great team members who were encouraging and willing to teach me. Mana
good,coworkers are very helpful. good to have stock of reagents!!

good,"This was a position that challenged me, advanced my skill set, and furthered my medical sales career."
good,Great campus in Irvine. Limited advancement opportunities.
good,"During my time there, I worked first shift in the Alloderm cleanroom which had changed to 4:30-4:45pm 12hr shifts which was put in place. The teams are divided from A - D in both Strattice and Alloderm. You deal with human and pig skin tissues all day using proper PPE equipment."
good,"Overall Allergan is a company that truly does care about thier employees. Pay and benefits were top notch. The downside was it is 12- hour shifts which can severely hamper any work life balance you may have. Always playing catch-up as not enough people were available for the task meant overtime. Not a bad career, just not suited for my lifestyle."
good,"Contracted 8 hours days, some overtime after hours"
good,"Allergan made me believe that people who work hard actually get promoted and recognized.  I had many good managers, and one really bad one during my 7 years there."
good,"Malgré mes qualifications et l'aval de mes supérieurs, je n'ai pu prétendre à un poste à la fin de mon CDD"
good,Allowed the engineers to do their work.  Projects were properly funded with good time frames.  I would not want to be an employee of any company Allergan purchased as their time to remain employed tends to be very limited.
good,"Allergan is located in Goleta, CA and has a small office there. There was plenty of parking and the company was very flexible with working hours which helped people who were communiting 40 miles to come into work."
good,Pharmaceutical sales.  Challenging and numbers driven.  Make or exceed quota...golden.  Fail to hit goals...chopping block. Wide range of products.  Great compensation.
good,"Rapid changes, new roles, consolidation, methodical, traditional, conservative, cautious, many silos, people skills needed, turf battles, technology / product focused."
good,"* Great leaders"
good,"Competitive culture, mediocre base salary, high bonus and incentive potential.  Opportunity for advancement and many products in the pipeline.  Some products going off-patent in 2018, resulting in 3 billion dollar loss."
good,"O dia de trabalho na Allergan é bastante intenso, com diversas atividades diferentes, o que proporciona um bom aprendizado."
good,"buena empresa para trabajar, pocas posibilidades de desarrollo dado el tamaño de la afiliada en España, pero en lineas generales, buen ambiente de trabajo."
good,"Going thru restructuring, subcontracted kids out. Great atmosphere to work in and great people to work for. Do a lot for their workers and a lot for the community. Vacation and sick time are very generous."
good,"Sales roles are fast paced, competitive and intense but rewards are good and teams are for the most part very supportive.  At the entry level, people can feel micro-managed but relative to the industry, it is not bad and those who follow the path do extremely well.  Management is generally supportive and provides good direction.  Overall, the culture is strong and people are passionate about what they do and the products and history they represent."
good,Good solid company. One of the largest Phama companies in the world. Great products and people. Many different divisions and opportunities. This is the perfect place for someone looking to grow and move up the chain.
good,"A typical day was busy and very fast paced.  An extremely   challenging work day balancing phones, constant interruptions with high turnover and training new hires.  Workplace culture was is challenging most of the times with such high stressful demands."
good,"Great company, good comp and benefits.  Have to be OK with constant change.  Management is supportive of work-life balance but too much works gets in the way."
good,"Allergan is a strong company that has always had a great culture.  The work/life balance is good.  The benefits and good, but have been slipping over the last few years.  Following the merger with Actavis, the company has been overly focused on mergers and acquisitions and less concerned about research and growing existing product lines."

good,"Very good, competitive company to work for."
good,"I had worked for Botox Tx and its a product with so many FDA approved indications, like no other product."
good,"très beau site "
good,"Irvine is in southern California. Nice small town. Pleasant weather. Very comfortable for families with kids living here."
good,good Workplace and company with good work culture with great response from customer and business assocites..but work and life balance is less.
good,"The company is going through a lot of transition due to the many mergers that it has under taken. As a result, they seem to use a lot of contractors, but they are not fully utilized. Therefore, even if postions open up contractors do not have an advantage to fill those positions as managers do not understand the capability of the contractors. Also due to the many mergers, the positions from the many companies are not harmonized. Directors do not have direct reports and some have to do their own journal entries."
good,"As Actavis bought out Forest labs and are now closing the Long Island plant, I really don't have much to say."
good,"Company growing by leaps and bounds, constant organizational change. Enjoy working with Actavis very much. Management always willing to help you grow and let you know where you are doing well."
good,Actavis is a very good organization to work for that offers a challenge on growing your career as well as an exciting place to work .
good,"I worked as a set up Maintenance worker which involved huge responsibility as the production line relied solely on the correct set up of this line."

good,"Utilizes lean resources maximally, a lot of working managers. Great place to work."
good,"Great place to work, but difficult to get promoted due to lack of employee turnover."
good,Typical day is 9-5.  Although I do come in during off hours to either finish an experiment or finish a report.  Work day is flexible and people are friendly and professional.
good,Allergan is a great company with many opportunities to branch into various fields of medical sales.  The job is challenging but rewarding.
good,"Infrastructure is lacking at the moment, but they are moving in the right direction.  A great place to learn new things, be heard and respected for what you know.  One of the best views of NYC!"
good,"My departure from Allergan was to relocate back to San Diego and ensure the health and wellness for my mother.  It was what I needed to do at this time in her life."
good,Great place to start your career as the company is very stable and still growing.
good,One of the most driven companies I have ever worked for. They know what needs to be done when deadlines appear and make sure that those deadlines are met.
good,"Empresa desafiadora, mas extremamente agradável com relação aos colegas de trabalho."
good,Good pay (Pharmaceuticals). Managers opinion of how you sell will ultimately decide your fate. (Goal attainment is team based so you share your numbers whether good or bad). Overall great company though.
good,"bon encadrement, système management très hiérarchisé, j'ai apprécié leur gestion de la qualité par rapport à d'autres entreprises."
good,"Very stressful and frustrating place to work."

good,"Constantly evolving, compressing, streamlining to maximize output and improve business processes.  Top Talent, friendly people working together to manage tight business practices."
good,"I enjoyed my career at Allergan but it is not for everyone.  The company went through 6 or 7 major transitions (acquisitions, mergers, divestitures) in less than five years.   The organization was constantly shuffling so job security is a constant question and goals were constantly changing as priorities and managers shifted. "
good,From 3 to 6 pm there was some interaction with people 911 calls and alarms mostly when  the office was occupied. After those hours the office was quiet and I just needed to do my tours and  check for all issues pertaining to weather flight delays or some catastrophe. Watching a high value freight kept me busy and any 911 emergencies from other sites.  As a whole it was a very relaxing comfortable job in a pleasant environment.
good,work a short time with the company. My DM was amazing and understanding. The training was near perfection. The company needs to let some corporate officers go. be prepared to have a paid vacation they have had four layoffs in five years and will not tell you once you leave your job to come onboard that you will soon lose the new job. I would go back to work with the company if given the chance. Loved the team and company just not too much on corporate officers.
good,"There is great access to doctors, staff is fantastic, my manager is great.  my team mates are the best and most professional people i have had the privileged working with."
good,Have been in the sales domain where i worked as a senior territory manager. the training team at allergan is excellent which helps and prepares every sales professional to be the best in front of their customers.

good,"Empresa com nível de qualidade muito avançado, muito dinâmica e próspera."
good,"I worked on the networking/security team at Allergan. Pretty much a standard sort of position in a large, global enterprise. Some days were extra busy, a few were pretty quiet. A good mix of standard operational support and implementation projects."
good,Good solid company. One of the largest Phama companies in the world. Great products and people. Many different divisions and opportunities. This is the perfect place for someone looking to grow and move up the chain.
good,I was an intern and it was extremely boring. My boss was a relaxed guy and I didn't feel pressured to be perfect. The job just wasn't for me. I'm going for mechanical engineering and the job just wasn't what I was going for.
good,"I think that Allergan is a smart, forward-thinking company with a pleasant culture.  There is a definitive work-life balance permeable throughout."
good,"It was a pleasure to work in this company, I was part of the team for 15 years, I found it as a great team and a company with a good future. A typical day at work begins with assessment of what previous shift had done and what is priority at the moment according to management business interest for the day"
good,A lot of change as they want to grow each year with buying new companies. You get to experience and work in a lot of different disease states and patient types
good,Allergan is a nice company to work for that offers many opportunities with great benefits.  The Orange County campus has amazing talent. Work hours are flexible for most positions.
good,A typical day at work with Allergan varied. I held lunches most days with doctors and staff of the clinic. I learned to be patient and how to make someone's day better. The hardest part of the job was that sometimes the doctors would be extremely busy and not have time to visit with me and go over the products I was representing. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and building strong relationships.
good,"After the Actavis merger and Allergan purchase, there was a rapid change in management  ( three managers in three years) that created a very challenging and strange work enviroment."
good,"Es buena empresa, pero busco crecimiento personal y laboral"
good,"Great benefits, a lot of hard working individuals, exceptional customer service, fun place to work. Staying pro-active will help you with day to day operations."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Forest. Everyday was a new learning experience, and I worked will with my direct manager.  I liked getting to work on different projects and learning new procedures daily."
good,"It was a great experience working through Advanced Clinical. The manager was awesome and always cared about how his contract workers well-being. Overall a great experience. "

good,"Good working culture and environment, support from managements, lot of learning during my tenure, a complete team to work with"
good,"it was a new exposure for me in ophthalmology, prompting this segment was really a feel good factor for me in the entire pharmaceutical  experience which is unforgettable,  mainly the culture in the company was in the multinational style which keeps the good relation  to employe to employer,"
good,"Empresa que zela pelos colaboradores, principalmente, quando o assunto é segurança. Apresenta um salário agradavel para a maioria dos colaboradores, e dispõe de diversos beneficios e programas de qualidade de vida."
good,"Work-Passion-Perfection-Earning"
good,"This has great upper management but when certain areas were further looked at, the management lacked in many ways. My immediate boss would always talk about us gaining his bonus, which I felt was very unprofessional. There is also a lot of communication problems between our immediate supervisors and their bosses. Company is a great company to work for other than that."
good,"While work days are very busy and demanding, there is a sense of camaraderie among the people I work with that make the job enjoyable. My fast-paced, hands-on position requires some professional training, but anyone can do it if they so desire."

good,"Very friendly and diverse atmosphere"
good,"Good salary and family life but Indian company culture .behaviour of management team is not according to standard of MNC companies. Product quality, marketing strategies are excellent and enjoying the field work."
good,"The culture here is great for if you want to continue to learn and grow in your career. There is a big emphasis on development. In the production departments, the job can be quite stressful. However, most other areas and enjoyable."
good,Allergan has great training and bonus incentives. The only issue with Allergan is that their base pay was not competitive compared to what they required from reps. A typical day at work would start around 8am and you would get off after you've seen your 10th-15th office for the day. The job culture was amazing and your partners are always one call away ready to help you. The reason for that is because your money is their money so your success impacts them. Management is decent overall and getting questions answered or problems fixed wasn't usually too challenging. The most enjoyable part of the job is the cool company car(known for having nice company cars) and working with your partners to achieve sales goals.
good,"Very Satisfying job, great atmosphere. work 12 hours 3 breaks, great benefits. Good part of the job is working with others and having a sense of accomplishing something at the end of the day."
good,"In my time at Allergan I've consistently been put in position to learn and grow.

good,"It was a good company to work for, unfortunately my position was eliminated."
good,"As a part of this esteemed organization I learned so many things.."
good,"I have enjoyed my tenure at Allergan and appreciate the fact that the culture is very performance-oriented; however, this at times can lead to a lack of collaboration and communication among teammates."
good,"This information is worth lots of money, will be willing to provide information once a job has been offered by another company or business. In the meantime keep guessing."
good,"au sein d'allergan, je n'ai que de bons souvenirs avec un cadre relationnel et hiérarchique à l’écoute et axé sur la performance. c'est une entreprise fondamentalement dirigée vers ses employés."
good,It was extremely competitive and high paced.  Based on discussions with other reps in the area from other companies there are better opportunities available which is encouraged me to look.
good,"Allergan is a great company with tremendous products to sell.  Every day is an opportunity to have a positive impact on the lives of thousands of patients.  The company provides fantastic benefits and the opportunity for career growth. The pace is fast and the expectations high, but the payoffs are huge."
good,Fast paced agency with demanding clients and tight timelines.  Awesome benefits and a decent work culture where people work hard but do like to have fun.

good,they are a very strong and well-focused company. They pay attention to training their works and are happy to see them grow and develop. I would work for them again if i get a chance.
good,Forest Laboratories is no longer a company. It got bought out by other companies.  The Forest culture is dead and buried.  I cannot comment on the Allergan culture or its CEO.
good,"As far as warehouses are concerned, this was a laid back place to work but we also took our jobs very seriously. Management was great and co-workers worked hard."
good,"8 years of experience in one company ""Allergan"" reflects the great culture and the amazing team i have worked with."
good,great company to be a part of good corporate culture.  Pod system was a bit frustrating but it worked with the right leadership like in my personal experince with the company.
good,.............................Growing Pharmacetuical Orgnaization is fine. Hires some intelligent individuals who are more than willing to contribute to the growth.

good,"Allergan offered a wonderful entry level position that allowed me to learn a lot about the industry and offered lots of incentives to earn extra income.  Within 2 years, I was given the opportunity to advance to a specialty position where I was able to expand my skills and take on new challenges and opportunities. The pressure was high, but it made me a better sales rep in the end. Fun, high energy culture that offers lots of support."
good,A great place to work.  I liked my manager and my co-workers.  The benefits are great as well.  Its a company you can stay with for a while as long as you don't get caught in a last in first out scenario.

Possibilidade de crescimento pessoal através de cursos on line e presenciais e coaching com o gestor direto. Profissionais de alto gabarito sem deméritos e com muita facilidade de desenvolver pessoas. O ambiente de trabalho, respeito e benefícios da empresa proporcianavam um alto grau de satisfação.

good,great company to work for with a great opportunity to advance your career. very obtainable goals and a very big learning opportunity. managers I had are very awesome
good,"The goal at Allergan is to offer patients and healthcare providers the best medications in various therapeutic areas. I enjoyed working at Allergan because of the corporate culture, amazing management and my team was nothing short of exceptional. As a Territory Representative, I had to meet certain KPI's, however, I knew every call to a provider boiled down to quality over quantity. This was re-iterated by management as well, which made my day-to-day duties less stressful because I knew I was empowered to make impact and be bold in my sales calls. I learned that gone are the days of just speaking with prescribers to seal the deal. The total office call was just as important, and this included pharmacy calls and relationships. The hardest part of my job was overcoming objections dealing with managed care and insurance plans/coverage. It was tough getting my branded medications approved under specific plans where coverage was not accepted, however, with a strong team working diligently for these patients, we were able to win some battles. Of course, you can't win them all but we sure did try our best to do so. Although a typical day consisted of driving to medical offices and promoting my products, which may sound mundane, it was definitely short of that. Every single day brought on new experiences and challenges, which made my job even that more interesting and worthwhile."
