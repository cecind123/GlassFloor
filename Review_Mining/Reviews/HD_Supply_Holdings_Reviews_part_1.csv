rating,review
bad,"Old women bullying and lying to create drama . It was the worst job I’ve ever had. They have an odd clique who’ve worked together for 20 years and they still act like they’re in high school . "
bad,Drivers r easy to get along with. Management is not there for the drivers. Not always available to talk to . Never around when u need to answers. Seems like they only there to fire u then u to help u.
bad,"I would never recommend  HD supply  to nobody.thats the worst  place to work at.in the summer  it's  extremely  hot .that company doesn't  have air conditioning and  in the winter  no heat..that place needs to be shut down. and filthy, dusty,dirty it's not a good place to work  at."
bad,None they were very not nice to me. They are not nice to the employee's! And to their customers.  They didn't want to fix nothing was broken in the warehouse or the store.
bad,"Don't wast your time "
bad,"Routes are sketchy, after training you get all the workload , lots of favoritism, underpaid for workload ,management meetings are a joke , would not recommend to work there with the current management, have to fight over equipment needed , safety talk is also a joke there ."
bad,"very horrible place to work . the people like coworkers are nice but management is beyond horrible . "
bad,"This job has one of the worst management ever... i will never wanna work here ever again.. i wouldn't recommend this plave to anyone, ever.. horrible, horrible."
bad,"I have been with HD Supply for over two years and plan to leave as soon as I can. There is no room to advance unless you're the managers pet, being good at your job isn't enough.The pay is mediocre and so are the benefits. I've talked to countless fellow employees who say the same thing and feel stuck in their dead-end job. Management is a complete joke, they are two faced, show blatant favoritism and use employees any chance they can get. The work culture is poor, it's cliquey, people gossip constantly and spread rumors. It feels like High School all over again. Everyone appears to be miserable who works here including the managers who do very little of anything. Find another job where there's a future and you aren't treated like garbage"
bad,"My personal opinion, they where to focused on my personal business. Would ask things that didn’t pertain to work. They made Promises with no intent to fulfill them. Misinformed me about different things which led to me just putting my two week in."
bad,DONT WORK HERE  16-17 hour work days. They make you start working at 3 am and you leave at 6pm but they only pay you 40 Hours even though you worked over 70 hours a week . They offer free lunch because their is no time to leave and go get food. Huge dome cameras   all over the ceiling like prison.  One of the Male Managers is SUPER BI POLAR stay away.
bad,they give you no raises. they force you to transfer. they do not care about they're workers at all. bad place to work for. im looking for a new job as we speak.
bad,Easy work but managed poorly...Stressful to a point where you shouldn't be that stressed if other departments did their job your job wouldn't be so hard
bad,If you like being mistreated and disrespected this is the place. These people treated me like trash. Then at the end of my 90 day probation period they fired me for no reason! When I asked for a reason they just said I wasn't up to their standards yet I was doing my job 100 percent every night! This place is full of favoritism and gossip! Caution stay away. Trust me you don't want to work here period.
bad,"They hired a bunch of customer service associates, then about a year later layed off many of them and replaced them with temps. My manager was the most incompetent I've ever seen - he sat at his desk all day and watched movies on his laptop.  The company lacked solid direction and seemed to be floundering.  I would call it a sweatshop environment."
bad,Worst company ever liers trashed warehouse. Don't Cate about employees just about getn work out too much favoritism stay away too physical low pay they work u into ground it's a dump
bad,"Horrible place. The most stressfull jobs are the lowest paid. Favoritism is huge. BEWARE! This goes for the contact center and the warehouse. Raises are a joke, unless you are close to the sups."
bad,The job is easy but management is so bad to point where you dont want to come back to the warehouse and I feel like if you going to work me hard you should pay more
bad,"The only thing good about this company is your off on the weekends... nowhere to move up in the company. This company is very top-heavy.. outside sales get 3 figures by just answering the cell phones when you have the drivers and Warehouse guys sweating their butts off for them to make little to no money when it comes to a raise what a joke....."
bad,"This is a place that was great to start out but then it tuned bad. You have management favorites and they get away with everything and cry to management about everything people are doing to get them in trouble.  Then you have the hard working people who get nothing for there hard work and dedication. This is one place that you should not work, if you want to stay at the bottom."
bad,"When I first started at HD Supply, I really liked it and really liked my supervisor and the other people on my team. But due to a departmental reorganization in April 2019, I now have a new supervisor and a new department head. The latter is a micromanager, to the point where no one in my department is allowed to work from home, even when the Internet on my machine at work was out of order! It took IT 3 days to fix, during which time A) the company paid me for three days to sit and do nothing, B) I was 3 days behind on my deadlines, inconveniencing my coworkers, and C) the company had to pay me overtime for nights and weekends that week to make up the work. If I had been allowed to work from home while my office Internet was out, none of this would have happened. But it was more important that they have eyes on me than I actually get work done. CRAZY!"
bad,"Do not work for HD Supply UNLESS you LIKE being lied to, over worked, treated poorly, unorganized, or poorly communicated with by leads/managers. Starting off, they falsely advertise the position and bait you in with false bonuses and promotions. The location of the job isn’t even correct, it’s based out of Santa Rosa and not Petaluma. They work you overtime just about everyday and will demand routes be completed. This company was the WORST I’ve ever worked for within my whole career. No one will help you guidance or honesty. Even after numerous attempts reporting HR with my concerns, they threw them right out the window. No one will listen to you, or “SET YOU UP FOR SUCCESS” as their motto states. If this sounds at all pleasant then maybe this is the job for you. Good luck!"
bad,"Useless management with dated thinking and micromanage all employees. Avoid like the plague.  Better environment and more respect working fast food or retail.  "
bad,"On ,multiple occasions I was shorted on pay, the mangers do not work with one another. They cannot keep a DC manager for longer than a year and there are no inter-departmental communication. The snack machines are over priced and while they are currently under construction they don't know how to run their business."
bad,"After a huge shift in management (drama caused some higher ups to quit/leave), this place is terrible. The new higher ups do not respect employees and work full timers like dogs. They make it seems like they are offering you a service by forcing you to work overtime. It wouldn’t be so bad if these new people allocated resources better which would cut down on forced overtime. If you have a family, do not expect to ever see them during the workweek. Also, good luck if you have a sick or injured family member because these new higher ups expect you to put the company first. They pressure you into staying longer even if you have other responsibilities or commitments. It used to be decent place to work but not anymore. I’ve heard that it has progressively gotten worse since I left."
bad,Company is struggling to keep employees and does not care for them. They cut hours to meet lines per hour for warehouse personnel. Sales representatives are horrible at communicating and blame the drivers and warehouse personnel for their lack of involvement with their clients.
bad,"If you plan on working here full time, dont. If you plan on seeking future promotion..dont.."
bad,It pays my bills. Poor management skills. Alot of favoritism goes on. Poor pay for what they ask of you. Hours are not guaranteed. They need to work on their management skills.
bad,It was a new position they extracted from another position. Lack of training and supervisor went from understanding it will take time to learn the position to you should ALREADY know how to do the position. Not a good working environment.
bad,"There is a clique culture. It reminded me of a playschool. Manager was too busy trying to make you his buddy to manage his staff correctly. I didn't need snacks and treats every other day, i wanted respect and to be spoken to and treated as an adult. Being told what to do by fellow workers is wrong, isn't that what managers are for? Too many chiefs, not enough Indians. Work related injury forced me to slow down and was why i was fired. Do not work for these people, no matter how much they tell you the benefits are great. They'll fire you 2 days before your 90 days are up to save themselves money."
bad,"Worse place I ever worked for, worse management they don’t know anything l, drinking and smoking o the job, silvery unprofessional just trash !!!! I would never recommend anybody work for this company I don’t know about other states but Arizona HECK NO"
bad,"Think of working here? DON'T... BE FOR WARNED. This is by far the worst place to work ever. Management is so unstable it unbelievable. You confine in them with personal matters, they tell everyone your business. They talk about one another to employee's. The pay is not worth the work. Not to mention you have no time for a personal life because the work hours are super unpredictable. The workers are miserable because they hate their jobs. It's sad these people manage a company and do not no what they are doing. They don't care about the employees just about money."
bad,"I'm not interested in writing a review on HD Supply, Poor management, and not a good place to work for. Management does not care about there leadership team."
bad,They always play victim whith the employee. Constant shift changes and never steady work except when they demand 13 to 14 hour a day. Mangment is a joke and had no communication skills
bad,Poorly run company. Current workforce leaving in droves. Cannot keep employees due to poor management. Company makes promises they cannot keep. Total cut throat environment. One of the most disorganized companies I have ever worked for.
bad,Work days are extremely long and you are expected to finish all deliveries sometimes upwards of fifty per day no matter what the situation was or whatever happened
bad,They are a nightmare to work for by way of the highest micro mgt techniques on the planet.  Salesforce is a punitive tool that they will call you out on daily basis regardless of your sales figures.
bad,"no thank you , hoping to leave soon,  toxic place to work and no one cares. there saying it is what it is ""... Salary is not enough, they want 20hour days to work and weekend as well."
bad,"The manager was new to that position, and when she got stressed out, she typically would take it out on everyone in the office. The manager at times could be verbally abusive."
bad,"meeting with about 10 customers.go over property needs."
bad,HD Supply workplace culture was clinical. The sea of cubicles at their New Braunfels location is a nightmarish pattern that will be etched in my mind for many years to come. The management was not very forgiving when I was having medical issues.
bad,The job is very easy and fun the the lack of management and communication between manageme nt and associated needs alot of improvement they do take advantage of the good workers and not push the associated whom lack with their work performance..
bad,"HDS is cutting in San Diego and hiring in Atlanta GA. they will burn you out. They cut back on employees to make the shareholders happy. bonuses went away, along with advancement."
bad,Typical day at work was horrible. sometimes the machines was not working but they still expected you to make your numbers. They would not even send you any help.
bad,management did not know what they were doing. no proper training in positions no SOPs in place. poor follow up very demanding not staffed enough to complete work load
bad,"the work is not hard just bad management and no job placement "
bad,This place lacks teamwork and it has bad leadership. The work they make people do has no compensation increase. This job really prays on people who are desperate.
bad,Management lacked the ability to provide great customer service. They were influenced by employees who were against what was best for the customers of HD Supply.
bad,"Unless you like working as a number, being treated as a number and never seeing the numbers in your bank account increase I would suggest looking elsewhere! This company only rewards brown-nosers. Managers are salaried and sometimes work over 60 hrs a week with no additional compensation. It is hands down the worst company I ever worked for. They constantly tout their market share, and their Billions in profit, and then share this profit with their employees by NOT sharing it with those that made it for them!  It is a culture of ""do better, do more"" with absolutely ZERO reward for going above and beyond."
bad,"work culture is ok"
bad,Management is a joke no support what so ever. People are really mean and extremely lazy.No direction of any kind. Hours are long. Pay is good. Most of the time people standing around not doing there job. There is boxes and trash all over the floor.
bad,Bad upper management.  Likes to cause fighting amoungst other branches and staff.  Very shady dealing with upper management and certain customers.  Stay away
bad,HD supply is a good company with a management staff that is not consistent and changes plans constantly not allowing the employees and other managers plan their day.
bad,"I applied for PT retail cashier and was hired in with other candidates on the same day. After 3 weeks on training, management still did not even train me on the register. They only decided to put the 2 other hirees on the register instead of me. I believe it may be a possible discriminatory issue since I was not hispanic and didn't speak any spanish and they did. Not a pleasant place to work especially working in a company that favors hispanics only. That is absolutely wrong especially if your working hard to help them in any way."
bad,This is a cut throat environment where managers conspire to fire employees. these managers do very little work in the branches and put all the work on the supervisors and sales reps. This is a place where you have to watch your back and can't trust anyone. a lot of nepotism.
bad,"If you don't like spending time with your family throughout the week, working LONG hours/not getting a set time when you're get off and no advancement in a job unless someone in a department you're looking to transfer in...then this job is for you..."
bad,"The GM and Assistant GM of this place tend to have a lot of ""customers they know"". Discounts are always given even on items that do not appear to have defects at all. customers treat you with little to no respect and get away with it because they ""Know"" the GM/ Assistant GM."
bad,"Hard work, fast pace work place, very fun and respectful co workers.Its a teamwork environment and a good learning experience in a face pace work field."
bad,"ok,so this place has so much wrong with it, no flexible schedule,no good pay,the cashier get more respect then the people actually do the work and ur pretty much forced into working overtime. i missed so many memories and events because of this job. never again will i be put into slave working"
bad,It was great when I first got there. Then they fired a couple of people and the place went down hill. Then they closed the branch.
bad,great  coworkers but no growth. you can not move up.it could be better if you can move up.salary is very poor.they will nickel dime you.best part is the coworkers
bad,The office culture is unwelcoming and impersonal. I was hired as a temp worker and did not get a very welcoming impression.
bad,"You punch,go to daily meeting where your told how badly you are doing.I've learned your opinions do not matter,shutting up and smiling is how you advance.Management does not care to advance you if they do not like you even if your skills and contributions are above average.The workers are diverse,friendly,some hard workers,most will do little as they can possibly get away with.The hardest part of the day is maneuvering inside the warehouse,unorganized and unsafe, ( safety hazard ).The best part of the day is lunch,breaks and clocking out."
bad,i did not enjoy working for this company because all of the employees were very rude and much more concerned with drama and gossip rather than doing their actual work
bad,This place is a joke. Under paid and you got to deal with a guy named jerry that is a total idiot  the boss tim is a ocd drama queen. There is no way to advance in this place. The drivers are so lazy and moody. I worked there for 4 months and quit. I was a warehouse associate 1 and was treated like a slave why everyone were lazy. Juan is the only cool one and a hard worker.
bad,There is no job work life balance. For the amount of work your asked to do the pay is not sufficient. Management is very unprofessional and cold all the way up to HR. NOT A GOOD PLACE TO WORK
bad,Dysfunctional work place about to close. Associates ran the facility to long and poor management left in charge in facility
bad,"don't work here, they will work you to death. Horrible management and the rest is history"
bad,"Very tough working environment.  Very low employee turnover, so there is no opportunities for advancement."
bad,"There is no positives when it comes to this company. Make sure you do your research if interested in joining HD Supply Canada. Question why they would close down a complete division and also multiple locations in their industrial side when the competion is opening up more branches. "
bad,"terrible place to work,management takes no responsibility for anything.burden is placed on driver for customer satisfaction ,even when they have no control,high stress ,low pay say they are customer oriented when all they care about is the bottom line,customer really has no signifigance!!!"
bad,Would never work for this company ever again or refer them to anyone. The training was very poorly done and there management is the worst I've ever seen from a company.  They also never mentioned during training that they required any overtime. Would not recommend this company to anyone.
bad,"I Would not work for this company to save my life. They tell you things to keep you in the door, but when it comes down to it your left in the dark. They love firing people around the holidays, and when it time for a raise. Management is TERRIBLE..."
bad,"Daily invoices"
bad,Great company. would recommend anybody to work for them. kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
bad,this was the worst job in the world.it was not the company it was management
bad,"A typical day in the Call Center at HD Supply was one being chain down to their desk with limited chances to move around, and when one does move around they are being monitored and watched. The job calls for you to be at your desk and ready to take calls at all times, calls are monitored as to how many you take, miss, and how long you are on the phone. There is also mandatory over time whenever the company decides and at whatever time of the day they decide to let you know due to a very very high turn over rate, I saw four people leave (not including myself) in the short amount of time I was there which was two months. Management, Managers and Supervisor are very lazy and do not take calls and or do anything to help the employees out, all they do is have meetings all day. 40% of co-workers are nice and friendly 20% are negative and the other 40% walk around looking like the walking dead from exhaustion and being overwhelmed with work. The Call Center at HD Supply has to much responsibility and has to due the work for all the departments in the company. What I learned from HD Supply is to screen the companies that I am interested in and apply for better, making sure it's something I really want to do, not just to jump right in and take a position because I want a job, Most of all to read the Reviews from former employees, and that's just why I decided to write this review."
bad,Poor Hiring practices
bad,Non-managerial coworkers were great to work with. You can get overtime. Management is less than spectacular and there is a lot of favortism that goes on in HD Supply Facilities Maintenace DC#13. Would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"typical day, doing all my job duties."
bad,"They hire you and then tell you that you must work overtime avery day. When you ask about it they tell you that you have to do it or resign. Management has it do it there way or the highway.Most worker do it because work is hard to fine,"
bad,i worked for this company for seven years and was harassed and threatened all the time. I did learn warehouse skills and enjoyed the work itself.
bad,you can not trust what they tell you .i can not believe the favortism that goes on in this place.
bad,It’s a good place to work the people are nice the hours were good the management were good the trucks were old warehouse was good I recommend you getting a job there
bad,"Most manager only care about their number and what bonuses they're trying to accumulate at the end of the year. When the drivers try to communicate with them about an issue on the route or a property they're delivering to, they brush it off as the driver complaining. The company also has these same values."
bad,Everyone was layed off due to them moving all of our jobs to Colorado. I left because I found a job thus losing  my severance. I then found out they were going to keep certain people. I was one of them. So I lost my severance. I went back and they fired me because of a disability they were made aware of.
bad,Bad management. Poor leadership. Managers are very disconnected to their employees and sleep on the job. Rates are unattainable and want to send people home when lunes are not met making others work twice as hard. A lot of favoritism.
bad,No development or training.  Totally based on “who you know” for growth and simple leadership.   I’m so happy to be away from the company.  Horrible work life balance. Their focus strictly and solely on bottom line.
bad,"The workplace culture at HDS is that of brow-beating and fear for your job daily.  Management is supposed to encourage and applaud exemplary performance, not tear you down for it.  The Charlotte division is clicky, and if you are not in the club, they make sure to save you a spot in the unemployment line.  I was a 12 year veteran with this company and received ""King of the Road"" distinction for the last 6 years of my employment.  I was at work every day, on time, and was incident and accident free for the entire length of my employment.  I had a great rapport with my customers, apart from a few folks who were just mad at the world, anyway. For my performance, I received less than 1% raises, NO raises several times, minimal or no bonuses, and not an utter of appreciation.  (Fortunately, I never expected it and HDS did not disappoint.)  I was bullied constantly by management (and their minions, who pretend to be management), and ultimately forced out after 12 + years by a pint-sized Transportation Manager with Napoleon complex for running a GREEN light.  (Yes, you read that right!)  See, if management decides they don't like you, you're toast.  They find clever ways to ""pad"" your personnel file until they can get enough cushion to satisfy state labor laws and let you go.  They have no regard for their employee's personal lives or financial responsibilities.  Rather than being professional, they make it personal."
bad,Management is poor. They have no idea how to treat employees. If your a brown-noser you can make it. But a hard worker they give you more work. The company is a no!!!
bad,"This review is for Home Depot At Home Services, not HD supply.  They were a miserable company to work for, but they helped me gain experience to get a better job."
bad,Management is not good. The hrs are too long and you cant leave until the work is done. Plus the CEO went to jail for fraud. I worked there for about two yrs and I wouldnt want to go back at all.
bad,Each sales vertical was managed to seek out opportunities regardless of effect on other supporting verticals. Pay structure was not managed well at all to give incentive to help each other within the market.
bad,"Summers were hot , no A/C under heavy workload conditions"
bad,nothing  good to say about thid company because they care about number and not there employes and they don't hire from within and only out side andgiove the other employese a chance to advance.
bad,"They need more people in the warehouse, instead of just one person running the whole show. Manager has a terrible attitude all the time, and he curses at all of his employees. The most enjoyable part of the day is when you get to go home."
bad,"Lack of management. Upper Management has no clue. Low Pay, mediocre benefits."
bad,"I worked in Customer Service for over a year, and knew from day one that there would be no advancement. Management staff are terrible robots without any consideration of the employees. Most demoralizing and dehumanizing treatment I've ever had, and I have had many jobs in my career. ALL employees are looking for other jobs and advise temps to keep moving. Company has been laying off customer service staff as of June of 2014, and keep pressuring existing staff until they resign. Also, some CSRs making $14.00 and hour, while others making $12.00, and seems to be no reason for dispcrepancy. So sad it is a terrible company, because they have great customers. SKIP THIS EMPLOYER and keep looking."
bad,Work anywhere from 11 to  14 hours a day. Picking orders with the Jennifer System. I learned that any managers who tell you that you should be grateful to work here is a horrible unprofessional boss and they really dont care about there employees. Management only cares about themselves. The hardest part of the job is when you punch in for the day. The enjoyable part was when you punched out for the day.
bad,Management routinely contradict themselves. General Manager is TERRIBLE. They will fire you and not tell you the reason!
bad,this place bad these guys to too busy help there friends out instead of doing things the right way
bad,Very poor Management
bad,The management of this perticular area is terrible. They want you do much more than what you were hired to do but do not want to compesate pay you for your talents. The management even asked us to work on Saturday's without pay and be compensated by a dinner at a local restaurant. They need new management desperatley.
bad,Horrible place to work. The rollers were never fixed on the conveyer belt. They refuse to show you new things. It is very clicky...nobody stays there long.  I have never quit during a shift but I did here. It was pure lies
bad,"The Supervisors and upper management are extremely and disturbingly two faced to their associates yet, are deceived into thinking that what they 'gossip ' about does not get back to the regular associates lol.  They will not attempt to pay you for what you are worth and will completely ignore you (by their actions of not following through) if you ask numerous times to learn and do more-to even justify a higher pay rate. Associate Appreciation would cause this place of work to flourish beyond measure."
bad,management never there they all come an go on to next one.life work balance did not excited. upper management used your ideas as there on. Never thought o would make as long as I did working 15 + hours a day.
bad,"Worst place to work unless your white, no advancement opportunities,it's a revolving door for employees. The bosses don't care about safety no help is given with heavy stuff even though it states 2 people to lift or carry. Worst place ever."
bad,My manager for receiving was the best but the store manager thinks he knows best when in reality he just sits down and expects you to answer questions he has even though you are new. Always forgets things within 5 minutes and would rather have you break your back for a low wage.
bad,"Great place if you want to start to working while still in school. It's better to stay as a part time employee, that way you study to get a better job in the future."
bad,"They cheat customers as a practice.They have vocal racism coming from management.They pay meager wages,with unrealistic advancements or raises.They discriminate against disabled employees and treat you bad."
bad,"No management whatsoever to many (stops) delivers, very low pay for a cdl driver if you don’t mind low pay go for it"
bad,"Just Stay Away. Backward thinking, high pressure sales with a ridiculous over priced structure. Us and them Management style. Imagine if the Mean Girls grew up and ran a Sales District. That is HD Supply."
bad,"The company has drastically changed and now focuses more on driving lines per hour verses sending quality product to it's customer, while sacrificing the overall safety of it's employees. Yes, the hours are demanding, however, that might be a plus to some. Overall, cooperate has failed management by simply not training them on correct processes, or providing them with enough staff."
bad,They don't have enough staff. People disappear and take long brakes and luches and management does nothing about it. Complained many times nothing ever done. So if you wish to do most of work yourself go for it. Needs better top management.
bad,"this place has the worst mgt i have ever had the displeasure to work for. total contempt for all staff. They do not follow company policy in any way as it pertains to staff. there is not one person under current mgt that does not want to quit. if you go to hr, you will be forced out. I saw this first hand on two separate occasions.  when one of the mgt was asked what he liked best about mgt position, it was stated, ""the power"".  completely  unprofessional. i do so hope that this is only indicative of this one store. and if you do decide to leave, expect to be labeled ineligible for rehire, notice provided or not."
bad,"poor management"
bad,Terrible management and working conditions. Over loading trucks to an unsafe level. Very liberal company with government connections. If you like working in unsafe conditions this jobs for you.
bad,"Low pay, high benfit cost, poor management, and unrealistic expectations for the employees.  Overall terrible place to try to get ahead in life.  Good luck making any money to survive if you have a family.  The insurance is astronomical.  Quick to write people up without knowing ANY facts."
bad,As a driver I was rushed always called me to ask how long will it take. Long hours. They do not care about a life away from work. They acted is if they owned you. Low pay  invited only a few to dinner. Others were left out. Not a team
bad,Pay not good at all long stressful work days with nothing to show for it managers are terrible at planning always understaffed and over worked no one stays long
bad,"the company has lost sight of what is really important, they have cut all important qualities that made the company  greAT liike inventory delivery etcetcetc"
bad,Unfair management treated certain cultures different ways than others terrible problem solving & work is moved at a slow pace warehouse manager spend his days following the Indian girls around
bad,"Management is horrible. High turnover, yet HR doesn't care. We started at 8 am, and didn't leave till all the picks were done. Didn't leave till 9pm a few times!"
bad,"This company prides itself on its core values but doesnt practice them. Management is a joke,Regional HR is young and dumb,and inexperienced. Very high turnover, company doesn't care about their employees, WMS is old school from the 80""s company is unorganized. Management stays in their office and doesn't know what's going on , their leads are friends of theirs and cover for one another"
bad,These guys are really bad they make you do all the work load ready to clock out on time so you must be finished with your work before you clock out clock out at 10 minutes after you supposed to because it works not finish the fight
bad,"In my years of working for HD Supply, management was always an issue. From the corporate level they do not monitor their Branch & District Management very close. I had caught my branch manager changing commission codes on my sales tickets, when i turned him into HR they turned it over to the District manager. District Manager pushed everything under the rug and nothing happened. Once caught changing codes he found other ways to mess with my pay. This company is all about Corporate!"
bad,This company is suffering greatly. They can't seem to keep good people because they are to greedy with the bottom line. They keep pay scales at bare bones. They have to many closed door meetings and keep everyone in the dark. They overload their sales team with so much paper work they can hardley  get out of the office. Then want to know why you haven't made calls. They complain when you need time off for family and honestly they do not care about employees. If you work here you will become a number nothing more. Think long and hard about it if your considering a position here
bad,"The job pays well, has benefits, and lunches are paid for; unfortunately that is all the good news I have and the rest is just bad."
bad,"If you like being treated like a dog by upper management, this jobs for you. If you don't ever want to advance, this jobs for you. If you like to hear your boss talk about things he doesn't know, this jobs for you. If you like to fear speaking up or thinking out of the box, this jobs for you. This used to be a great place to work until they started hiring upper management that has no understanding of the business or the ability to even listen. They put it all on there associates and show no appreciation. The only reason I'd go back is to feel how good it was to quit again. DON'T DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,"writnig reports and searching for customers, HD Supply is a big company and fast paced. When you first join, it takes a few days  to get to know the business units, but if you work in one business unit, you may not need to know the others right away.People are friendly, However, there are too many managers."
bad,This place is horrible to work for. You must stay for overtime and are expected to. There are never 8 hour days and if you leave after 8 hours they consider you leaving early.  Severely understaffed and really overworked. You are told when  it is ok to leave for the day. Tney talk to you like you are a child.I would recommend avoiding this place
bad,"This may be a perfect job for some, but was exactly the opposite for me. I did not enjoy the long hours or the type of work I was asked to perform. there was Very little time for family and life."
bad,It started out well.  Then general manager turned out to be a lier.  Keeps hiring all his past co workers as upper management and never hires from within even though he claims that's his goals.  He is the biggest fake out their and his inner circle are a bunch of yes man/women and dont care about their workers.  This place is losing all their customers and sadly I'm still working in the field and office trying to make a difference
bad,We had to work until the jobs done management wasnt that good. I did loved the overtime but you never know what time u will be going home that what I hated the most.
bad,"Management team is horrendous. HR is a joke. This place is a narcissistic safe haven with very high turnover rates. High majority of management and others that advance are white males. If you are someone of color or are a women, you will have a much harder time advancing here. This place will leave you feeling mentally and physically drained. Raises offered annually are pitiful. Do not waste your life or time here!!!"
bad,"poor management "
bad,"They push you to do more when you are already physically tired and doing overtime upwards of 12 hours."
bad,"You are always in fear that you will lose your job. They have consolidated roles and each person has the workload of 3 people (at least). I was very upset, after devoting almost 9 years to that place, it was my life. Just to be let go with no notice at all. I am heartbroken that ""my family"" just kicked me to the curb."
bad,Very Stressful and long weeks. Spent almost every vacation working. Management will not assist to aid in creating a better work life balance. Would not recommend this position.
bad,"Inbound calls taking phone orders for catalog items. This is a business to business company so most calls were from other businesses. "
bad,"you would work there under the constant threat of being given a documented discussion and that three of them you were gone. we were constantly told that we were replaceable. If you questioned them you were told if you don't like it hit the door. You were given a lunch break any other break was at their discretion. Management would change SOP(not that they have an SOP) at least every two weeks, They have no one to keep track of the supplies you will need to do your job. You are constantly running out of paper, bubble wrap, boxes or tape, which make you job harder. Yet you are expected to meet your numbers or get a documented discussion. You also have to work with the radio blasting hard rock all shift long."
bad,"Work life balance does not exist. There is no real culture. If you're a manager you will work 50 hours a week or more and hourly you will work even more. HR can't be trusted. The directors and leaders from top level management have no clue how to run facilities. It's all about sales and the stock price that is all. You will work hard and be rewarded little. Public company so it is all about the stocks. Nobody sticks around long enough to grow. Managers constantly are at each others throats. The pay is okay, overtime is there, but it gets old after awhile. Safety is out the door when it gets busy. Not a good experience. Not at all. Nobody is ever on the floor to know what goes on."
bad,Run fast and don't look back. Management has no alignment strategy and is constantly restructuring. Employees are stressed out and given empty promises that conditions will improve but they do not. Training of new employees is minimal and you are expected to Sink or swim. They do not allow remote work and office presence- time in your seat- is valued more than results.
bad,"Very negative work environment."
bad,Management did not care at all about employees or maintaining a decent office environment. No money allowed to spend on customers or improvements at the branch. No plan moving forward of how to improve branch performance compared to local competition. No intention of hiring enough staff to perform properly in the market. Generally amazed this is supposed to be the largest national company in the industry. You would think it was a company ran by a very tight owner with no ambition.
bad,"Expect extremely long hours (over 12 hours a day most days) with very little extra break time. Management is a complete joke. They can not even make sure necessary supplies needed to do your job are in stock and let the slackers on the line do as they please (personally seen people take 2 hour lunch breaks with no repercussions). Very irritating for the hard workers there. Upper management will lie to your face about everything from compensation to whats expected of you. Absolutely zero regard for people who have been there for a long time, and good luck ever moving up. My advice? If you do accept a position here (WHY?!), use it as a resume filler at most. Don't bust your butt, it's not like the supervisors are usually around anyway."
bad,There is no training for the position you are working. Not enough equiptment forthe job. Hr can't do their job correctly and manditory overtime is required including saturdays. Pay is too low for what they want.
bad,Bad management no room for growth you get passed over for advancements supervisors only looks out for the people that they likes benefits aren't that good
bad,"Dashcam is always recording. So no matter what you are doing, your privacy will always be invated. Conversations over the phone is heard very clearly."
bad,"At HD Supply as a sales rep you are treated like a child.  The job is micromanaged from the minute you walk in the door; clocking in, how many calls made, time in between calls, timing of breaks, lunch, etc.  You are treated like an entry level employee instead of a sales professional.  The management is the worst out there.  Favoritism is off the charts.  If you are liked, they will manipulate the numbers in your favor and if you are not liked they play with the numbers to get rid of you.  Sales goals are set so high it's almost impossible to bonus - unless you are one of the favorites.  BEWARE OF THIS PLACE!!!!!  Don't quite a job based on the promise they give you during the interview - because it's all LIES."
bad,"In Long Island city NY Kenseal branch have a team of 9 to 10 employees and out of that team one is a receiver that do nothing, but just received all the deliveries, one person to go around all days doing inventory and another person to the shipping. Out of the other 6-7 employees there are 3 supervisors that do nothing, but just ball boosting and harassing other employees and supposedly routing trucks and pushing house truck."
bad,"Management is awful, horrible judge of characters and are inefficient. No AC during the summer so it's like an oven. No heaters during the winter so it's like a freezer. Management doesn't move you even though you work there for a month and are qualified.  They just don't know how to manage and the system is out dated and inefficient."
bad,My training was good but once they let you loose they have very high expectations and your supervisor will not want to bother with helping you catch up to speed. My supervisor never allowed us to talk to our neighbor if we needed help either. if your a non-social person this place is perfect. If you are social do not apply here. I was forced to quit and I left in tears from how much my supervisor put me down instead of trying to build me up.
bad,"HD Supply was my first full time job, I worked in customer service for 4 years. I attempted to grow within the company but was not given the opportunity to advance."
bad,"Management team (Kent, WA) all new and inexperienced to run or lead a capable team.  Hours are overtime everyday of the year.  Leadership tells you one thing then does another, never keeps their word only constant excuses why they do not keep their word.  The hours are extreme, and you are told if your don't work more than 8 hours I would not have hired you.  Management has nothing but excuses and blames the laborers.  HD is a great company, but they are bringing in management with an Amazon zeal, we aren't robots.  Employee Turnover is high no time for life only work with endless promises that never transpire.  The building doesn't function as a team, each leader is asking for advice from their leaders not those that are actually doing the work and if left to do the work it gets done when No micro manager (perhaps in name only) is out for the day.  Inexperienced management that will not listen to veteran workers, the few that are left.  The laborers support each other the management is only out for the titles they hold, most should not, some very deserving.  The BS and h ours are not sustainable, great checks at first, but no sleep, no good meals, nothing but work and guilt trips to will you to work, from then on.  If you can wake up eat breakfast then pack lunch and a dinner and lots of snacks to keep you going these long hours everyday!"
bad,Work crazy houses. You never have time off to be with famil when you request time off Your denied hard for work home balance management isn’t what it should be
bad,don't do it .. don't you dare put yourself through that for the chump change they'll pay. It is an 'our  market' kind of place  and if you aren't '1 of those chosen' they'll be sure to let you know you're
bad,"Working at whitecap is not for everyone. They low ball you on pay.  You load your own truck and unload it by hand at times.   Going from job site to job site unloading and dealing with  contractors that are just mean.  .Some drivers had lifts most of us did not and They refused to get more donkey lifts.  Trucks are older and in poor shape. "
bad,"They will slave and tire you out and have one care in the world, promised many things such as extra driver n warehouse help. Instead hired one person and he essentially was just a driver. I can go on forever but I won't"
bad,The company was great to work for in the beginning but as it grew larger things changed. Many coworkers were great to work with. I gained so much know during my tenure there.
bad,"Too many problems, learn nothing new just problems. Managers and leads were so lazy, they didn't train new employees well. When you see the problem and report to them they just ignore or just say something to make you go away. No communication with employees. Most of the people worked there just lazy & careless. Just try to solve the problems while you go in your day."
bad,HD Supply does not value the employee. We were understaffed and underemployed but they still demanded more of us. We were overworked and underpaid which brought extreme stress and discouragement leading to a severe drop in morale. All they care about is pushing product. Your opinion means nothing!!!!!!!!
bad,Houston FM facility only allows drivers to work 4 days a week. Would be a decent job if you were allowed to work. Delivery manager and operations manager are very nice but have no idea what they're doing. Its a good job if you only want to work a minimum number of hours. Full time is 32 hours.
bad,HD Supply could be a good place to work at if Drivers didn't have to load their own trucks then go out and deliver too many stops. Drivers come and go like traffic because we are overworked and underpaid. The management is a joke and don't really care about the employees. I would suggest anyone to run away from this place.
bad,"HD Supply was a great company when I first began, and now the company’s dishonest ways and favoritism are rearing their ugly head. I had so much hope in my future here, but they seem to be trending in an unfavorable direction."
bad,"Been with this company a few years now currently at the Charlotte, NC location. The pay isn’t that great for the work they ask of their employees especially working in all elements. The mangers/supervisors are terrible, unprofessional and inconsiderate the least. If you’re looking for a job with position advancements this is not the place."
bad,"Almost zero training. Dropped into territory with nearest client 30 miles away, furthest about 85 miles. Spent 4-5 hours per day getting into and out of territory."
bad,"Poor management, seriously high turn over in the department.  Unrealistic expectations.  Work isn't hard, just no structure and no resolution to on going problems.  Nothing ever seems to get resolved."
bad,I've been with the company for over 3 years and there's too many flaws. Management tends to change every so often because of corporate indecisive attitude. Promoting is solely based on relationship rather than skill and hard work. Paid is not that great since each department has a different pay rate. Hardly no advancement at all.
bad,Was just unhappy with the overall daily operation of the company with regard to their treatment of all of the associates. No opportunity for advancement and severe cut in benefits.
bad,"Really poor mid level management. No support or workers, must kiss butt to get help. Only worries about getting themselves ahead. No way will I ever work for this company again"
bad,"Hd Supply is a company out for self .They doesn’t respect the hardwork of their employees.There’s a lot of favoritism,they pick and choose what percentage of raise you get.They start you off at $12 and 3% is the only raise they give.They Demoted me to Supervisor with salary pay and demoted me to lead yard man and hourly pay without telling me."
bad,"This location, and summary is very simple you have too experience the employment too really understand just how unsanitary and unsafe the facility and general areas are. This is the type of job that should have been on undercover boss. The major roles are the least paid, and the hardest worked, yet when looking at the annual sales, was the main seller through the annual fiscal year. The management should really step-up and create a safe work environment, rather than sitting in offices all day, complaining about calls, or worrying about joking around. Keeping a safe environment work zone, is key too a safe and injury-free work zone."
bad,"I was at the Albuquerque location. It was one of the worst jobs I ever had. The training is poor, and the other co workers are worse to work with. They talk about you behind your back, and set you up to fail. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy."
bad,"- Typical day at work, come in & work as a team to get the job done."
bad,"I work for HD Supply for Over 13 Years and when they came in with new mangers the new mangers let go all the whole front end of mangers and employees that been with the company for over 13+ years 😥 it's sad that they did that to alot of the employees because some of the people's "
bad,Management was completely one sided and always gave you the minimal raise regardless of how well you did your job. You could never do enough to please upper management.
bad,"A typical day at work pick orders load and unload trucks help customers. some of the people you work with are alright and others act like they had a bad day everyday. What made the job so hard was, it seemed like we were short staffed everyday and we always worked like four hours over the time we was supposed to leave."
bad,"This company is so unorganized, the workers run all over the management, Pay is low but hours are long. Would not recommend anyone working for this company."
bad,"Managers don’t acknowledge new team members or your work ethic and play favoritisms. And the team leads give you tasks just to send you off meanwhile theysit around and do nothing and are sometimes rude if they don’t like you . The hiring and point system is very low as well , you get points off for every little detail which is why they keep hiring new people all the time because the new workers either quit the job or get terminated. The work environment isn’t so comfortable and nobody makes you feel welcomes ."
bad,"From management to dispatch no-one takes responsibility. Everything is blamed on the driver. "
bad,This place is pretty much like Home Depot. The building makes any weather extreme by that I mean when it’s hot outside you’re melting inside when it’s cold you’re freezing and it might not sound important to mention but it really is. If you get hired for part time you will stay that way you will never get extra hours. Management has their favorite people and they get special treatment.
bad,i learned how to check all marechindice for damages and called my customers and let them know what was damaged and talk to my boss and see if we could work on making a deal with the customer or send back and have another one shipped out the next day
bad,Great pay! Horrible leadership! Liars...broken promises of a 3rd driver that we desperately needed but never got!!! Understaffed to say the least!!!!
bad,"IT job systems"
bad,"Inappropriate Interview space . interviewed at a food retailer"
bad,waited for benefits to get never got straightened. had to wait for open enrollment for benefits to get started again. but was made up for later
bad,"working atmosphere was stressful, very poor management"
bad,I work at HD Supply in Orlando fl as a warehouse associate every job has its pros and cons and I have a few dealing with this job first the pros. It was a small company only 8 people working in my department so there was no feeling of being lost when at work you also had your weekends off . The supervision and management were also great everyone there were like family coworkers help when you need. Some cons the work was sometimes backbreaking with long hours 12pm to 11pm no time in the day for anything the pay was also very very low!! and the benefits were also bad overall not a good place to work am happy that I left that place doing something better only my god honest opinion.
bad,I worked in gardena for a little under 4 years... the job was great bu managment was unfair and the only way to advance there was if u were to suck up to managers not because u worked hard or how uch u knew... the like to use u everyway posible and not pay u for the work... I was a cashier buti was never at the register... I was all over the store covering different departments and when a position opened up in any department I would apply and never get the position but I would be more qualifed then the person that would get the position... no matter how hard u work there if a manger dislikes u on a personal note u are stuck in the same place u start off at...
bad,Started out like a lost puppy but with the guidance and patience of my direct supervisor I was able to overcome obstacles in my way and developed my own routine and pretty much knew what to do on my own each day. It was good while it lasted.
bad,Management is horrible lazy unfair drama starting with head office power tripping favouritism management being perverted male dominated constant comments On
bad,"Would not recommend this job to know one, pay is okay but the management is so unorganized and supervisors have favorite employees, and treat the rest unfairly and do not know how to talk to their employees and also don’t know how to run a shift. No opportunity for growth."
bad,"The job is very stressful, communication is low and demands are high. Pay is not great at all and there isn't any rewards for great work. Feels more like forced labor with low pay. I WOULD NOT advise anyone to work there."
bad,"A typical work day is made stressful by the interactions with management and quality control. The focus is on the production and movement of project, but the company does not take into consideration their lack of resources."
bad,Disorganized labor miscommunication no team atmosphere. I would pick and pack items all day long. I would ask for help and no one would help me. Management doesn't care if you don't have a life
bad,What is set in stone one day is not the same the next day. No ones schedule ever stays the same when everybody is supposed to have a set schedule. Moral is very low.
bad,"Many people were bitter about the previous move of head offices which put a lot of people out of work. This also affected sales in 2016 &  2017. The company is trying to recover and there are a lot of great efforts being made. This is a difficult industry, customer loyalty is near impossible as most customers are price driven."
bad,It was just okay as a place to work. They really are a big giant machine and you will struggle to have your achievements ever be acknowledged or noticed.
bad,"""Good old boys club"".  Ineffective people in leadership roles, politics, no communication about status of company and direction.  Inventory management does not understand that you cannot sell product if it is not in stock. To much focus on achieving Wall Street expectations and not enough regarding the customer's experience and trending customer needs and wants."
bad,"The company was ran very poorly and unorganized. There was great potential for the company that was not exercised. If there had been good organization, the company would have been a good successful company."
bad,"No leadership, don't care about you. Don't know how to work as a team. Management change numbers so they can get their bonuses. Don't work with outside of work."
bad,"Worked at Whitecap for a lot of years and have only seen it go downhill. Assistant branch manager leaves whenever he feels like and warehouse supervisor has a god complex. Recently just hired a former employee that didn’t work for them a whole year and is already making more than me. Sometimes it’s not what you know, it’s who you know."
bad,"bad management be ready to do everything but your job. you will be told and i quote ""everyone can be replaced you mean nothing to this job so don't think i wont replace you if you have a problem"""
bad,"If you like an environment where you need to watch you back at every turn, then this is the place for you.  It's full of two faced people and management.  They say they care, but all they don't. Treating people like robots is second nature to them. One mistake is not tolerated."
bad,"Terrible place to work. No management out of Birmingham to help just shut up and do the job. When you get hired they try and act like it's a great company but it's not. The peope,that stay here are job scared or they would quit."
bad,Please do not make the mistake of working here!!!! I wouldn't let me give 1 star the hours are ok but good luck trying to get a new shift !!
bad,"This was originally a great place to work but unfortunately in the fall of 2014, with the IPO trading far beneath the projected price and the stock continually staying stagnant, the board elected to eliminate many positions across the country.  The company ended up letting many people go just a year and a half after going public.  I made it through the first two waves but I too eventually was taken out along with almost everyone in the New York City area.  I learned a tremendous amount working here and I still enjoy keeping in touch with former clients and members of the team.  There were many lessons learned about the politics of a changing and adapting Corporation in the midst of going public after 40 years of growth in the private sector."
bad,"Bad management "
bad,The work/ life balance in this job is horrible. You work long hours. The managers have zero interest in your well being. They often threaten you with disciplinary action if you want to leave before the work is done.
bad,"too much nepotism in same departments."
bad,This company has amazing people. There is definitely a big family feel at the company. Management however is TERRIBLE. It's either their way or the highway....don't waste your time here unless you want to blend in.
bad,"Only care about the dollar. stuck working long days, sun up to sun down, and they get upset when you say anything about it. Would get mad when you'd take a break. Warehouse/yard guys were just an afterthought."
bad,"Overworked, underpaid, poor management, and dangerously unclean air makes this place a nightmare to work at.  Management implements poor work strategies and refuses to hire adequate workers for the amount of work flowing through the facility."
bad,"A lot of politics, inequality, lies, and poor management. The managers lie to their employees about most things. The company states that it is family oriented but all you are is a number."
bad,Not a good place to work for unfair management style. Contractor were not treated with respect and was given task that no one else wanted. Permanent staff felt as thought we were taking job positions away from them not giving room for movement in there field
bad,only promote people they like and don't offer any full time unless you're friends with a manager and they never stick to your schedule needs.
bad,Management has the mentality of do as I say not as I do. Therefore the management will not apply all the safety rules to themselves but yet they will discipline employees who do not play by the rules. I think this is a very bad example of management as they are not role models like they should be.
bad,Some of the issues I brought to there attention about safety and the cared about the dollar more than than the employees safety !!!!!!
bad,"I worked at HD Supply in St. Louis Mo. The actual work was easy and could be fun, but the G.M.. was only interested in the shipping dept, and actively disrespected the recieving department. Would have us go and help pull orders for sghipping letting our own work back up and then tell us we had to stay late to get our stuff done.  if we were able to get done on time an were gettiing ready to leave for the day, he would stop us and tell us we had to go pull orders so that ""shipping could get out at a reasonable time"". We were told that everyone would be accountable for what they did, but recieving always had to come behind shipping and clean up their trash messes. I walked out one morning when I was told to clean up after shipping, and if I didnt like it I could leave. So I left. Write ups were and everyday thing in recieving"
bad,"Was once a great place to work with great people who seemed to be trying to work together to make a better work environment for everyone while also solving problems and making a profit. Once corporate came in and changed the structure of everything and relocated departments, the moral is so low and everyone is scared. I see more changes coming in the future that will only mean more layoffs. Corporate says they care about employees, but their actions show the opposite."
bad,"The company really does care about the employees well being. However, Management needs work in sensitivity training, and basic human relations skills."
bad,never know when you are going home. come in at 9am and leave at midnight.production standards are set but they dont tell you how you meet them
bad,"If you're not in the ""Good old Boys Club"" you'll never make it at this company"
bad,This was a very fast pace and demanding work environment. Wonderful co-workers.
bad,"Misleading selling practices, terrible inventory reporting, extreme micro managing. Management style is berating and condescending probably the worst big company Ive ever worked for."
bad,"I’m just going to be honest here, this is bascailly a”in-between” place of employment for all warehouse associates. Meaning,  if you are looking for immediate work to handled business at home, then apply for a chance to be employed here. If you’re looking for a long term place of employment to grow within, steer clear of here. The only real hours you will get are from the months of May until October,then after that from October til May, you will probably get 30 hours a week. You don’t get paid much for what you really do for real and there is no opportunity to grow in this company. The only reason I got all my hours was because I got promoted to a warehouse associate 2, but the raises weren’t even that much. Even with my new position as a warehouse associate 2 with all the experience I had accumulated (which was 5 going on 6 years worth) I only accumulated $2.65 cents. Summing up that I got hired on in April, 2013 making $11.25 an hour and when I left in January, 2019 because I was offered a better employment opportunity my hourly pay was $13.90. That’s sad and a sign that this is a “in-between” job as I stayed in the beginning of my review. They only give you one raise throughout the year and it’s an annual raise, and as you can tell by the $2.65 that was awarded over a 5 year spand, it ain’t much. You can be the best employee, never calling off, never getting points, always meeting your employment goals for the entire year and they will still give you like a 30¢ raise. Then your co-workers aren’t no better, but that’s another long story that I choose to not discuss because"
bad,I learn a lot of things that I didn't get a raise for. management was always under each other and not worry the work that had to be done. they didnt know what they was doing. they try to get people fired that knew more then them or challenge the stupid things they come up with.
bad,"Poor management, tons of favoritism, annual increases didn’t cover cost of living. Used to be about taking care of the people, now it’s all about taking care of your Mgr’s. Public company is all about numbers. and Mgr’s never lead by example."
bad,"Good peers"
bad,"-inflexible work schedules."
bad,"The frontline associates are some of the finest people I have ever worked with and that is the only reason the overall rating is a two.  HD Supply is trying to restructure the sales staff and have eliminate most management with any experience ahd have hired new management who are detached and delusional form their client needs.  Most middle management, except for a few, are merely robots repeating corporate mantra.  If you have a territory which coincides with management's vision, you have a chance at success.  The odds are you will receive very little support and all problems will  be on your shoulders."
bad,Hd supply was a fast paced to work at very easy simple go on about our day but management was horrible said things that never were taken care of managers had preferences for workers .
bad,"Company went public and lost sight of its customers and associates, its all about the shareholders, period."
bad,"Regional Manager - Great all round professional attitude (even with a joke) ..."
bad,below average pay and terrible benefits. Management at New Braunfels Call Center was fairly incompetent...............................................
bad,Help process orders for manufacturing associates to produce. Management overwhelmed with daily task to maintain a productive environment. Always had projects to assist with the workload of leadership team.
bad,The workers that work hard get no appreciation and the ones who suck up to the managers are the ones who get praised which sucks. You can easily move up by being a suck up. if you are a brown nose this is the job for you. Management never know what is going on and the way everything runs is really messed up. I worked here for years and couldn't take it anymore. A typical day would be work right away after stretches and if you are a favorite well you don't really have to pull the numbers. You will get the easiest job they have.
bad,"Short staff for our night crew. Never get appreciate for our long hours of work. Good people to work with, but the management is really poor. Lack of communication from them often puts the blame on workers."
bad,"I was hired  to get 1 of 4 routes available.  Once I started they took me off of the route that I had then told me that I was going to do a Virginia  route. I became a cover driver which did not sit well with me, but being a team player I did that for a month. I still never was given my own route and continued to be thrown on different routes. I did my Job well and HD did not care as long as a body was on a route all was good..... DO NOT SETTLE FOR THEIR BULL!!!!"
bad,this company could be better with the right people. alot of structural issues within the company. pay was ok and benefits ok nothing great.all about the numbers
bad,This company was a dream job for me in 2007 when I attained employment. As years have progressed management has changed often and drastically resulting in a shell of the company I began working for. This job has evolved into a mandatory overtime job (between 7-10 hours weekly) leaving little to no time for family life. Benefits have changed over the years so now they are worse than when I started. I work in a (Line Haul) part of the market and have been passed over for a job change/advancement with this company twice so there is no promotional prospect with this company. The biggest benefit of the job is the pay scale and weekends free.
bad,"HD Supply acquired USA BlueBook who is a distributor focusing on municipalities water and waste water supplies. USA BlueBook was a web based distributor and hired on field account reps in the beginning of 2012. "
bad,"Good compensation, but do not work the customer service side.   Leader is unequivocal in 'passion' for customer service but unable to define goals sufficiently.  Excellent operation from the purchasing, technical support and other management."
bad,"Since my first day as the supervisor for the stocking department I was able to tell that this company was a land slide waiting to happen.  Unfortunately, a joining a fortune 500 company like HD Supply isn't all it's cracked up to be.  Senior management is a joke, never knowing when an issue should be made.  The managers and those who you report to on a daily basis have been there so long that they are blind to the necessary changes that needed implementation.  When I innovative idea is presented, they merely look away as though nothing was needing improvement.  Management and management alone is going to be the downfall to this fortune 500 company.  Currently, and for the past year, they have been using SAP ECC-EPP, a system that they know very little about.  They waste your time with useless seminars and meetings, but non of which carry any importance or weight when it comes to daily functions.  The amount of brainstorming that is being done only to have to action taken is ridiculous.  "
bad,"Inside sales I Fort Wayne,IN all I did was lift boxes, you make the sale, take material to your customers car you have to pack lift stage merchandise...lack of training you have to figure everything out nobody teaches you anything. Branch manager won't allow overtime but if you are a friend of his like the other inside sales rep well you will have overtime...awful place to work lasted one week.."
bad,Productive
bad,"Very promising when you first start   Then you realize that you are always short personal which prevents you from completing your tasks  "
bad,"Be prepared to work 12 hours or more, work-life balance is nonexistent. Raises are yearly and only about .05 - .30 cents. The work itself is not bad, but the mismanagement makes work stressful."
bad,"Not a happy place ;  in meetings they tell you one thing ,, about safety and after meeting ,, every thing they talked about goes out the widow..               The best part was driving my truck.. Love too Drive"
bad,"Working there is good if you are well-liked. Get on someone's bad side and you are blacklisted across the company. Finicky management, scared employees...."
bad,"Sales dominate the culture. Top heavy in management. A good place to start, however lower than average wages and benefits make it difficult to maintain any long term hourly employees."
bad,Its a job. I wouldnt recommend working there and I didnt not enjoy my experience there. There was alot of favortism and managers did not keep their word.
bad,Very cut throat work environment where I was threatened many a time. Left and found a way better job. Not everyone was bad there were definitely a few people that were lazy didn't want to help out to the point where they would endanger me on the job by not watching out or not helping when trying to handle an extremely heavy load like granite.
bad,"Job consisted of loading and unloading trucks. Delivering material from warehouse to clients homes, or business. Lifting heavy items 50lbs + various amounts of distances consistently."
bad,"Things are rarely ready to go, despite being told that they are or will be. Run your butt off trying to get things ready, then get called often to find out why you haven't delivered a specific delivery yet."
bad,The customer is not the priority of management.  Inventory levels are poor and a lot of items are always out of stock.  Because of this our customers use our competition
bad,"Great learning environment for all aspects of Transmission, Distribution, and Substation Material Management. Day to day working with Journeyman Electricians and Field Leads on all new and existing job building for Transmission, Distribution, and Substation power lines."
bad,"Nothing fancy, clock in for your shift and you get to work. A lot of bending/ back breaking work for 8 -9 hours a day five days a week. Management has their favorites and those that are not are left to fend for themselves."
bad,The compensation is not appropriate for the amount of work required for the position. The change in benefit plans created a financial burden that was not offset by any increase in pay.
bad,"Didn't care about their employees after Home Depot purchased us, took away a lot of our benefits, no one cared about safety, they ran several industrial generators inside with doors closed, made us sick, demanded you go outside on propane fueled forklifts during lightning storms to load or unload trucks"
bad,HD Supply was an okay place to work.  There were not many opportunities to move up within the company.  They track everything you do.  How many phone calls you take and how many emails you do.
bad,"During a day to day work experience it was unfair because some individuals were treated differently then most. with that being said the work did not match what people were getting paid,"
bad,Room for growth is nonexistent in this company. If you aren't a manager you have no potential in growing. Pay to work ratio is ridiculous. We work too hard for little pay.
bad,"The day would start by cleaning the warehouse of any trash from day before and than by pulling any same day delivery's that the driver drivers are waiting for, keep on picking items till it's time to go home."
bad,A very efficient call center focused on numbers and time. I felt the CUSTOMER got lost in all the numbers.
bad,not a place i would recommend a person to work if looking to advance for a place of being organized.
bad,management was always late and never knows what to do leaving it up to the forklift drivers
bad,I thought it was a steady job but the Managers played too much favoritism.
bad,I didn't enjoy this employment. I was not given the proper support and lead needed from management to perform my duties. I wouldn't work for them again. It was a bad experience.
bad,"Management is poor in delegation. Unsafe working conditions. If you're a hard worker, expect to do others work. Quality is the LEAST of their worries. Associates are not held accountable. Much of the time, packaging items poorly or shipping the wrong and/or broken item(s). But hey, Returns needs work too, I suppose."
bad,"I was at HD Supply for 7 months.  The atmosphere is at times strained by the certain personalities that work in the store.  There was little to no training when I started.  There is no support when it comes to learning the job.  Everything is done manually, not much work done on computers."
bad,"Company is need of major leadership change. Job roles and responsibilities are unclear and no one takes ownership of things, and as a result, no one seems to be held accountable. Everyone seems to be trying to prove themselves, taking credit for other's work and then blaming others when things don't work out. Projects are approved with inaccurate cost/benefit, and often seem to run over budget. Little to no collaboration between departments. Salaries are decent but other benefits are pathetic."
bad,Working for this company was okay in the beginning. But as time went on it was more and more frustrating to come to work. Pay was not up to par as well. Management is inconstant.
bad,"HD Supple was one of the best places to work about two years ago."
bad,I went in at 7am and answered calls for orders and returns and check status of when order would arrive. The manager only liked certain people and only promote them. The pay was not enough for all the stress of the customers and having to make every call end in less then 4 min is very hard especially if there was a problem with the order or the customer didn't know what they wanted and you would have to wait for them to figure it out.
bad,When i first started to work there it was i nice place to work. When the management changed so did the culture. It became a very unpleasant place to work.
bad,The HR department along with management do not believe in advancement of their line workers for some reason.  The culture is not one that believes human capitol is the best for the company.
bad,This business is closed down and has been relocated to another area in Houston.  It also has changed its name of the company from what I've heard from previous employers.
bad,Management decisions are made without knowing what is going on in the field. Dictate field without taking into consideration what make sense to accounts. No management or marketing support.
bad,"Inbound call center for special order items that are not offered online or in catalog."
bad,management is horrible and they only look at you as a number  will never work there again you get in trouble for everything you can not control they don't care they just want perfect numbers
bad,Middle Management is not managed. Need an oversight to help control unprofessional behavior. If you're not in the club you don't go anywhere. Otherwise a decent company to work for.
bad,"Most co-workers were ok. No sense of professionalism in the building. Joking with each other was the most important part of the day. New member of management was hired and this person did not know how to work the computer system. Would not answer phone and help anyone, would just put on hold and transfer to the counter. Attitude was horrible."
bad,Management keeps certain people from advancing.  Plus they are new employees making more $ than you!!  Most of the co- workers are nice.
bad,In the beginning I enjoyed and looked forward to the everyday challenges and learned a tremendous amount of skills. Then after some changes the days expanded and the work life balance went away. I enjoyed working with my counterparts and teaching what I had learned.
bad,"There is no advancement with this company! I have worked with this company fro 5 years... They teach you to be able to flex to and from specified areas in the warehouse, but they will never advance you in the company.."
bad,A typical work day at HD is very fast paced.
bad,"Offered the job as a regular warehouse associate, now they changed my schedule and have me working as a Order Checker. Much more responsability and after 90 days not being offered more money. Definetly looking for something else they have the worst tur over that I 've seen by far.."
bad,i loved working for HD Supply but management had it out for me. My HR lady was going to help me out because somethings that was said to me should have never been said but I would have had to write statements on Big managers and I didn’t want anyone holding grudges against me since they were already picking on me almost everyday. After a while i just became overwhelmed
bad,"Management is unprofessional and unwilling to change."
bad,"I worked her for 3 years & giving my honest answer from what I learned from this branch of HD. "
bad,"Management was awful. Did not care if you were there 11 to 12 hour days -- they always requested more hours from you -- and sometimes just before you were ready to walk out the door after an 11 hour shift. No work/life balance at all. Human Resources would approve the grueling mandatory 70 to 80 hour work weeks.  No protection from HR obviously.  Company was losing a reported 60 percent of the customers because of bad service.  Overloaded hours on employees lead to bad service but management did not agree with that.  In fact, they would literally get face to face with you demanding you do a better job or simply just cuss you out."
bad,"You really get to learn how interdepartmental management works at HDSupply. Its all about who you know and kissing up to management. My supervisor was the laziest, most unprofessional co-worker I have ever witnessed. All in all it was a learning experience and I'm glad to have moved on."
bad,This is a decent Job but not what i would recommend for a Career. Bonus structure is capped not allowing you to take full advantage of commission. You are able to drive your business and portfolio depending on your ability to create and close sales.
bad,"The hours are great, and the employees are naturally good people. What takes away from the employment is the horrible management and the lack of system the store refuses to adhere to."
bad,The employees are great but management is horrible with the exception of maybe 1 or 2 managers. Gossiping and bullying comes from the management team who talk down to  the reps. If you apply shy away from customer service and go to another department with level headed individuals.
bad,"-11 hr. day mandatory"
bad,"A typical work day for me would consist of releasing orders for other employees to pick. From this job, I have learned to multi task, and I have also gained computer skills. Management can be hard to deal with more times than not. The lack of respect plays a big part in that. They also do not appreciate their employees enough or recognize them for their efforts."
bad,"Great pay, ok benefits, minimal raises or advancement. This particular branch was not very cooperative with having a family life or understanding about issues that arise with children/illness. "
bad,"Culture and benifits here are fair.  Minimal training is provided.  If you don't expect much, you will do good."
bad,Been here for 8 years they expect you to go above and beyond without correct compensation. I have great reviews but my raise doesn't match. Definitely not a place you want to try and make a career out of.
bad,"I was the hardest worker in my department for a time and management across the board was too incompetent and the entire department and earnings for the DC suffered. The most mismanaged work environment I have ever seen. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and the job was simple, however management made that job impossible and very demoralizing."
bad,"	Determines customer product needs, conducts price negotiations with both vendors and customers, determines price. Calls vendors for order status and updates,"
bad,"fair place to work. no room for advancement. Sadly, business changed when become public. Lost culture. Employees worked very hard but no recognition f"
bad,"This is a growing company, but the management is poor.  Managers are untrained and do not motivate or inspire.  The work/life balance is poor and upward mobility is limited."
bad,A good experience in learning to operate a forklift.  Good experience taking inentory and placing items in their perspective places.
bad,"Roseville Home improvement solutions smallest division of HD Supply.  CEO and CTO come in only a few days a month.  Company culture is very old school.  As a financial analyst you run reports and pass them along, generally using only a few basic variables sales, margin, quantity, and applicable percents.  Office culture follows status quo."
bad,HD Supply believes they own a bigger portion of the market then they do. When numbers aren't met they place the blame on the employees while allowing management to hold onto positions.
bad,"Work hours are very unpredictable- working hours range anywhere from 8-16 hour work days,. Experience of the job was the  learning and gaining knowledge of processing shipments from picking products from product line, packing, labels, scanning, and giving shipment to the proper carrier, for customer delivery. Management team is more focused on numbers and not so much quality of work, or your safety.  Co-workers are very focused and dedicated in my work group. Job difficulty is trying to make quota when it's not possible to obtain.  Enjoy the overall job- not hard at all, pays well, and good benefits."
bad,it was just a job for me i got it right out of high school its more of a lowes and home depot in one place work days were just unloading trucks and loading them i learned to deal with carriers and certain companys my co workers were all older didnt really know on a personal level
bad,"nothing against the people I worked for or with directly as it is a nation wide company, but they micro managed all of their empoyees."
bad,Coworkers are and were awesome. They are like family. At least the credit  department was. The Management was not aware of the stress that was in the department. that made work unbearable on most days.
bad,Constantly understaffed. Often was told to work outside my department in order to compensate for lack of employees or speed of department. Learned how to drive machinery and to use the system but then was farmed anywhere and everywhere. Felt like it actually became a hindrance to learn more because it made it hard to focus on the things i actually needed to improve for my own role. Hardest part of the job is being on your feet for hours and constant overtime.
bad,It was interesting it could be fun at times and difficult at others. They really worked with you and showed concern on life issues. Also found a way to educate employees.
bad,fast growing mro supplier for healthcare -coworkers were very friendly- managment follows corporate culture
bad,good place to work but i got sick and was unable to go back . have a lot of overtime and i suggest this company for anyone who might need employment. the work is hard and long hours but the pay is good . if your okay with bi weekly
bad,I am a driver at HD Supply and we have two manager is the worst manager I’ve ever seen. One  The manager thinks he know it all and a the other do not know how to talk to his driver . And no driver does not like this  Manager .  Finally If you are ever called in the office for  coaching both manager will tell everyone in the warehouse  .
bad,"I'm not a fan of corporate politicians.  Very infuriating when someone smiles to your face, tells you you're appreciated and they'd like to work with you on your career advancement and doesn't follow through with any of it."
bad,This job is ok but pay is low as is staff morale.  I did my job and went home but there was very high turnover when I was there and management is not one that promotes a positive team culture.
bad,People expect you to do so much in such little time The management & leads are never around to answer any questions I was forced to make a company decision
bad,"I got a chance to learn new things. It was actually a good work environment until new management, then it became hostile. I wish it could have been more growth for me available there."
bad,"great co-workers, poor communication from leadership on direction of company, medical benefits are poor, talk a lot about taking care of employees but no follow through, end of 2015 company decided to move offices to Atlanta with 4 months warning to employees"
bad,"5 Years ago, I would have told anyone, HD was a great place to work."
bad,"I liked Dillard's for the pay. However you couldn't pay me to work for them again. They are slave drivers and defiantly give you a run for their money. They always had unrealistic sales goals and there was very little room for advancement in the company, it was pretty much run on favoritism and backstabbing. The only benefits they had was their healthcare and their merchandise. Even the employee discount was a joke."
bad,"Poor management, racist, HR Department did not keep anything confidential and low wages. Don't waste your time with this company."
bad,Everyone kept to themselves. Very unfriendly environment.
bad,"pack and organize supplies, make and process labels, manifest proper shipping lables, order select merchandise (light bulbs,door knobs,light fixtures, etc...) order select bulk merchandise (refridgerators, washers and dryers, etc...), ship out and work with Fed Ex and other delivers, handle haz-mat materals, handle lead position when needed, handle phone callls from customers, sort out packages to area, load packages on to trailers, fill out closing reports, and make sure everything is done."
bad,"HD Supply is a great, fun, place to work where your coworkers become your family. That however is only because you're there for over 10 hours regularly. Management at my time there was not very open to hearing what lower level employees had griefs about."
bad,"I would've liked to continue to work here, but I had a lot to do to catch up for school, but now I am good.  It has a good pay and the managers are pretty cool."
bad,"Sell, sell, sell. Meet plan. Learn how to be patient. Management wants you to sell flooring and moldings. Cycle count. Stay on top of your inventory. Did I mention sell?"
bad,I use to work HD supply as fabrication and as a back up driver the best and the easy job I ever had I wish I could go back the reason I left cause they gave me two dollars rise and my fourth check took it the two dollars ride back cause HD supply Policy says I don’t get that dollar till 6 months and the other dollar till other 6 months but i still have to cut doors and mirrors and also back up driver
good,"it is a good place to work but too stressful because of the long house.you know when you start but don't know when you leave. you don't until the work is done."
good,After 16 years with this company I feel I was used abused and kicked to the curb to be replaced by someone with no knowledge and a lower salary.
good,"All new management that have taken the voices of employees away.They choose to make decisions that do not work then try to place blame on associates. They  have  developed a very poor relationship between management an associates.They make at least three to four times as much as a lead.They at the branch have no external overview from corporate so they are not held responsible for there actions.They preach one thing and do the other.The drivers are treated As gold the come in early and leave early ,same as there managers.we did have a good team last management team which have all moved on we work 10 to 14 hours a day for a nine hundered dollar check every two weeks.The company make billions each year and choose s to only stock pile the money"
good,"We had a quick meeting at beginning of shift, then off we went to pick and pack boxes for 8 hours."
good,"It was hard working with them in general. no room for advancement either. I would be doing multiple task but would not be recognized for as if I was doing nothing all the time. poor management skills and the co workers were not happy either, a lot of negativity in the air. Not an enviorment I was looking forward to working for everyday."
good,"The day begins at six a.m. with a five minute driver supervisor meeting. After which the drivers would separate the product that si to be delivered for the day. When that task is completed we load our trucks sort through the paper work put it in order and begin making our deliveries. Customer service is an art form that is developed and shaped through the relationships with the customer. I was a driver that is/will be missed by my customers. The management there was a strong mix of strengths and flaws and determination anchored by the drive to serve the customers and get paid. Over my twelve years of employment there, there have been many employee changes and gains. The group of drivers that I last worked with was a close knit bunch of guys from many different back grounds. They were a lot of fun. Adapting to the changing requirements of the company that cared once about the employee but increasingly are leaving the things that made the company a wonderful place to work. I loved working the drivers and warehouse workers when I was there. Never a dull moment and massive amounts of laughter."
good,"Management poor"
good,"can find a better job, you get paid less than a full ti,me and do the same work as a part timer. management sucks you will not move unless they like you or know the managers"
good,"I work remotely.  Because of this the job is far easier to deal with.  Managers tend to micromanage on certain things, and give little to no guidance on other things.  Overall it's a good place to work.  The reason for low grades is for the last few years there has been no stability on top.  Because of this theres been a lot of co workers come and go."
good,Its a ok place to work 4 the time being. Can move up if management likes you. But it's not a guarantee. Overtime mandatory. U never know when ur getting off.
good,"Working here for 8 months and I have no positives. The only thing uplifting about this job is the people whom you work with. The managers are all up-tight and really have no regard or care for their employees. While Working in the pick mod for 8 months 4 people quit and 3 were fired. Not to mention our district manager quit, or hr manager quit and so did another area manager. I feel like this Job is ok. The hours are way to hard especially on a young mother with a 2 year old , which mangers don't care about. The company point system is ridiculous. I feel like any bad manger can take a great staff and make everyone want to quit. If you enjoy working from 10am-10pm under mangers who just sit around and watch you work, then this job is for you"
good,Company runs with minimal help. Low pay. Most stressful job i have ever held. Most hours i have ever worked. Always understaffed.
good,Great place for people who love to get there hands dirty. I personally learned allot about home improvement and other construction based areas of work. You definitely have to have multi tasking skills because work loads can be overwhelming at times.
good,"Stocked and supervised a crew of 6 stockers of products from receiving department. Completed checklist, helped the packing department fill orders"
good,very faced paced and very challeging if you like working 60hours every week you would like HD Supply
good,HD supply is a ok job if its your first job or just really need work bad. The morning sheft manger was not so great. But the people who i work with where cool. we all worked as a team. If you where behind we will come and help each other out. the employer where more helpful than mangers.
good,This company is bad don't work there stay away  they talk a good game but let some time pass by and you'll see they don't appreciate you yoh can't make not one mistake or your on the bad list ready to get fired
good,"It was a job nothing special. Management tried to manipulate you to be their lap dogs. You give 100% but everyone else is barely giving 50%, and everyone is OK with that. We'll it wasn't for me."
good,"Management had very loose goals and little direction but the expectation was high."
good,This was a good job to take on at the time.  People were good and work was steady.  Job location relocated to Texas and was forced to find a local position.
good,"After working here for almost 6 years, they could still treat me as if it where my Second week on the job. Everyday was stressful with no gratitude. The customers that I got to know over the years and the few employees that stuck around made it memorable. I would like to see this company review their values and stick with them. I learned that if I'm too nice people will just take advantage. There is always competition, and one must always cover their end regardless. "
good,Starting three new profitable divisions from the ground floor was great.
good,If your young and enjoy meeting new people this is a great job.
good,Learned many things that I wish to share with other companies to try to make things easier yet more efficient.
good,"Management speaks with both side of the mouth. No unity of command. Promotions should be within to encourage loyalty of employees, most managers employed have no knowledge of the working of the organization.  So much discrimination against some kind of race."
good,"Ever changing leadership at the upper management levels.  Not a bad place to work for those just looking for a large company to work for. Advancement potential is limited, however."
good,"They sure know how to welcome someone new. Pitiful"
good,Inside sales can be rewarding when you are in a good location. There are plenty of locations that are not so great to work at. The culture of this company changes from region of the country you are in.
good,HD Supply can be a great place to work depending on where (location) and who you are working with. The other side is it can be a completely miserable job with the wrong people. They are no longer an employee friendly company now that they are publicly traded.
good,It's an OK place to work. It's an amazing place to work if you're related to someone. This company plays NEPOTISM at its finest.
good,"help hire,. set routes, manage routes fill customer orders, control delivery shipments. counselled driver when needed trained smith safe classes. helped with shipping and LTL loads called couriers when needed."
good,"Great energy, great job culture, made you feel at home. I learned much more then expected including a lot of business managment key functions. Managment was great and really cared about there employees in and outside of work, which is important."
good,I think this company should focus on adding different shifts . They only have one shift which at times was too much for the shift to handle and come in the next day and be as productive then normally.
good,Good work bad management I did inside sales it is always a hastle
good,nothing to say
good,If your supervisor spent less time micro managing your day maybe the company would be a lot happier more profitable company.  They don’t treat you like professionals  rather and I quote “children” they have to babysit. Not good for moral!!!!
good,"The company is a good, that work for for a start there is area to grow in the company but it would take some time there's a lot of people already have a lot of seniority"
good,I personally don’t see anyone growing in that company any time soon management doesn’t get on the floor and the forklifts are never ready at time of use battery dead or just plain old and needs repair OSHA NEEDS TO TAKE A VISIT THE PLACE IS A MESS....
good,"days are fun & happy. I leaned to have tough skin. you have be a man to grow here. Management is not someone i wouldn't look to for help. I love the work culture all my co-workers are helpful and giving. Hardest part of my job is to take belittlement by management. "
good,"Go to warehouse load up do your route come home no set time 5 am until all your stops are done. "
good,HD Supply was not a bad job.  The only reason  I left is because of the female manager. She has some kind of thing against other female employees. She talked about  me to truck drivers that did deliveries to the warehouse.  The driver  told me because  he also delivered to my next job after I left HD.
good,As expected if your voice isn’t really heard in the company and management isn’t all that great. My reason for leaving is due to false promises from my pay rate to the company saying they will pay for school.
good,Moving up within the company was hard. A Lot of favoritism needed in order to prosper within the company. Some  managers needed to learn how to lead vs bossing associates around.
good,"They need other shifts for picking and packing"
good,Company is no  longer part of HD Supply (interior solutions) It was bought out by a larger company.
good,Turnover of employees at high rate hurt morale due to lack of training. Management concerned about numbers versus quality and what the true facts were
good,I've work here for about 2 months and it was a pretty decent job. The work it self is very simple but the leads there suck. when I started they had just hiring.
good,"I worked for this company for 11 years. In the beginning, it was a fun place to work. There were a lot of opportunities to make extra money (cross selling/ ad sales) and other promotional contests."
good,Great atmosphere in each individual warehouse. Above management above DC were completely unaware of the needs of the DC and its associates. Upper Management could learn to be more hands-on and value the associates work to life balance.
good,Heavy work load. Not enough compensation. Always short-handed and not enough management to dismiss those who wouldn't work hard with the team.Great place to meet potential future employers.
good,It was a learning experience  a typical day did not exist their the environment was okay there was no culture  the hardest part if the job was doing multiple task everyday there was no order and nothing was organized
good,"District Manager drove out everyone.  Loved the work, The management became progressively horrible upon the company going public. Critical without offering solution. Clients suffered lack of follow through of company promises. Very Discouraging."
good,This is an excellent place to work with plenty of room for advancement if you know the right people within the company. I enjoyed everything about the company and the work. The biggest disappointment was that it seemed that my work and contributions to the company were going unnoticed due to preferential treatment to certain employees. Other than this it is a great company to work for. 5 stars!
good,"HD Supply Montebello has managers that can't manage or maintain a crew. Great learning experience, you learn the in and outs of the construction world but very difficult to move up. Current Assistant General Manager (2017)  has anger issues, not a leader to the store. Staff is knowledgeable and have a good attitude towards each other"
good,A workday at HD typically would fly by because the co-workers made it a fun day and made it feel like you were not working. The hours were good compared to most other jobs.
good,Place was a joke from owner to management . Nobody knew what or where their job duties were as the changed day to day always messing up consumers orders never listen to employees for the needs of customers.
good,a typical day at hd supply consist of me loading the trucks or me taking boxes from off the line and and putting them on a pallet.
good,"The pay is not where it should be for what the management expects.  Most co-workers do not care about the work they are doing; they go through the motions just to get the minimum done.  Most of the management team talk a good game but have no plan to ""make it happen.""  Safety is discussed in the beginning and then pushed to the side as the 'safety manager' is also a manager over a production department.  The hardest part of the job is the environment (heat/humidity).  The company is growing fast and expanding."
good,"hours are bad, pay is not commensurable to experience or education."
good,"Good co-workers,but the Management sucks.what more can i say."
good,"There have been constant reorganizations and changes in the last 2 years, making employees feel unstable and not knowing what's next."
good,Horrible management team. lousy employer. no advancement
good,"I enjoyed the culture and the variety of projects to work on. But overall, not a great place to work."
good,None air condition warehouse. Expect heat in the summer. The turnover rate is extremely high and management does a poor job of training. Pay isn't terrible but the hours are.
good,It’s a good place to work. Things suck at times. Hard to advance in the company considering the kids from college come in and jump everyone in line but it is what it is. 🤷🏼‍♂️
good,terrible work distribution/management when it comes to Warehouse only care about their* bonuses and work you like dogs same workers at the end of the night picking up everyone else’s slack because they want to send everyone home to cut OT and only care about line count again good hours but will work you like a dog I used to walk to my previous job everyday a 2.5/hr walk and always did my job no matter what tried to work employees for 9 hrs without a 15min break (thought we were supposed to get a second lunch) you do the math
good,There has been too much change and turnover leading to a lack of focus because of new people who don't understand the business or the customers to be able to do their jobs effectively. This leads to a lot of rework and frustration across teams.
good,Managers would think you're not smart and would often joke about employment.  Don't need that type of stress in my life when many other options are out there
good,"you spend more time filling out reports, than actual selling. Constantly out of inventory. High turnover of personnel. Fun job and good potential of a great company if they could get their act together. Currently very volatile."
good,"Work load & expectations are overwhelming and do not allow for work/life balance, lack of adequate on-boarding training, antiquated work tool, convoluted work processes"
good,"Started off as a good company to work for. Over the years, that has diminished. Company still pays well but is a shadow of the company it once was just a few years back."
good,"Easy going place, pretty laid back on the night shift. Management doesn't micro manage as long as you get your work done. Flexible when you want to take your breaks and they have a ping pong table"
good,Long hours in the summer. Not a good life balance. No bonus or good raises. Associates that miss to care for family members managers can careless. Mandatory overtime.
good,"Bad hiring skills, unexperienced management but good employee benefits.smaller warehouse environment than most commercial warehousing so less hectic yet still fast pace."
good,"The people there are hard working and fun, but do not get rewarded as they should.  Management is disengaged and do not recognize people that should be promoted."
good,"This company trys really hard to make it sound like they care about the employees, but their actions are contrary."
good,I enjoy working for the company. There are plenty of projects and initiatives to work on and there is never a dull moment. I have learned so  the company and I am seeking new opportunities to learn and grow in a different environment.
good,Was forced to run a whole warehouse alone after being told that other employees would be hired no one was hired a year later.
good,There was a period of high turnover and relatively high instability in the working environment.  The company was going through some major organizational and management changes.
good,"A typical work day consist of pulling orders and placing the at the correct route, separating UPS and FedEx and getting them ready to be shipped. Management is not where it needs to be which in turn makes the jobs and day a harder and longer then they should, which in turn makes the co-workers frustrated and upset. Very little room for growth."
good,Too many changes to effectively develop and execute a strategic position in the industry.
good,I loved working here until this last year. So much has changed and it was not for the better.
good,"This company has many divisions and hired fronm within company. Alot of good training. Typical day was making 12-15 sales calls a day, field Questions from customers. Communicate to manager for help on problems that needed to go to my direct manager. Suggesting product lines and prepare quotes.Hardest part of job was fielding all the complaints from customers and not being able to get answers from management.Best part of the job was my co workers, bonus checks and training."
good,A typical day at H.D. Supply is never the same as the day before.
good,the boss didnt really care about the worker and everytime someone would steal something he would blame it on someone else
good,"Co workers at a branch level are extremely loyal and hard working.  Company fails badly at training and resources to perform the job duties. Enjoy every aspect of operations with the company, just the balance of work life and personal life is non existent."
good,"This job is fast pace and busy. A normal day on the job is working on the assembly line and moving boxes on electric pallet jack."
good,"Days are very busy and always something to do.  Several things to learn, learn it yourself kind of place. Need help, ask other associates, manager cannot always be depended on."
good,The company was spun off from the Home Depot and is quickly seizing the market in the industrial supply sector. I worked in the Facilities Maintenance division serving the multi-family housing market.
good,"I worked for HD Supply for 5 1/2 years; 4 in corporate and 18 months in a line of business (division). The first 4 years were good, department was like family. Very relaxed and upbeat work environment. I moved for opportunity and went into a position that wasn't what was advertised. Found it to be heavily politically influenced and the corporate culture was not consistent from department to department or division to division. I believe that the drive to be as profitable as possible lead by the venture capital owners resulted in a major change in management personnel, philosophy and employee morale. Not a bad place to work, but would be cautious."
good,Brafasco was a great learning experience through customer service.
good,"Corporate and local branch operate differently. Corporate says it cares about it's employees, but truthfully, employees are just a number. They don't follow their own rules and change goals before given a chance to meet the first ones established."
good,"I work for HD supply for 13 years so it wasn’t all bad.  I liked my co-workers, but the management staff was on the rude side.  All of those managers has since left the company for one reason or another, so it might be a good place to work again."
good,The new management at this company has caused the morale to drop dramatically. We worked 15 - 17 hours a day with no additional pay or comp days. God company but bad management.
good,Work on bids for national and regional production builders.
good,Very little to look forward to due to lack of efficient management. Seems to be an ad hoc environment with a lack of a plan and no direction. Can seem biased and with bad hiring practices.
good,"unrealistic goals, overtime, long hours, in all kinds of weather not enough pay. unbalanced work/life, Hazardous environment, little protection to hazards"
good,I cannot grow in this role. I have reached the highest I can go without moving to the west coast. I have small children and do not want to move at this time.
good,Entreprise ayant peu de sympathie face à ses employés et mal adapté aux différentes cultures régionales
good,The company needs competent Managers that can also relate to customers and have spent time in the sales environment.  There are not enough 'kudos' for work well done and accomplishments.  There are constant assumptions that are negative and rarely positive reinforcement.  The hardest part of the job is related to inventory control.  The inventory is unbalanced throughout the nation making customer satisfaction at a reduced level.  The best part of the job is the friends I have made with inside and outside customers.
good,"fast paste productive place. easy job, poor management team, lack of communication from management to the employee and to many favorites between the management n employee."
good,Poor advancement oppturnity.Like coworkers but very limited chance of promoting up as the company has adopted a look outside the company for managers opinion
good,The management is horrible i worked here almost a year before being terminated.the people who really go beyond gets no appreciation from hr to management its all bad and they stick together to ensure they covered right or wrong.
good,Fun and exciting sales job. Corp can not deliver or maintain inventory stocked to fill orders on a very regular basis. Slow to react to competitive threats and Looses on the national account level often.
good,Good Co-Workers To Work With (If All Workers Come In To Work That Is). Management & Supervisors Are Somewhat Needy & Don't Usually Lend A Hand To Help At Times.
good,its an alright place to work. Management is kind of hit or miss. not very much follow up with any problems or issues you may have. depending on what department you work in hours can vary between 8 and over 10 hours per day.
good,Simple job though physically demanding at times. Co-workers and manager were great.  Summer months were very busy dealing with the heat made it difficult at times.
good,Most people didn't like their job.  Some managers were good while others were high pressure.  Coworkers were nice.  Culture was off a little.  I prob wouldn't recommend.  Maybe things have changed since I left.
good,Nice people and flexible work schedule. Its really just an okay place to work for with a bit of Micromanaged.  Nothing really great about it.
good,Visit 12-15 accounts per day. Pre set accounts from start. Need strong customer service background not just sales to excel.
good,"A typical work day consist of me pulling orders to be delivered in a timely manner using a hand held electronical device as well as a electric pallet jack. What i have learned from this company is how to run an electric pallet jack as well as the high pick machine. Honestly the hardest part of this job is the hours, I don't mind working long hours it is just i don't get home untill late when my kids are already in bed."
good,its a decent place to work if you want to work a lot of hours. Easy work but very fast paced environment
good,"Lots of OT available; good training.  Prepared bids, handled incoming phone inquiries, managed material delivery to job sites."
good,"HD supply is a decent place to work, yet it is not a place with good raises or the best benefits.  I would say that it is a place where you get by and look for a better opportunity."
good,no Much opportunity for advancement. I don't want to go into any more details
good,H.D. Supply was at times a good place to work lots of good people there i learned a lot on my own initiative there was no training available for employees who wished to advance so i did it on my own time.worked for me at the time.
good,Good Job but you work all day until their is no more orders which wasnt an issue to me. You have weekends off. Very fast paced and hard labor.
good,typical warehouse job no balance between work and personal life. Reliable good overtime hours.
good,A typical day I’m trying to pull orders and load my truck while attending customers and it seems like I never leave the yard At a decent time. You’re pretty much on your own.
good,Night shift is work till work is finished which doesn’t provide very good work life balance but the pay is acceptable. Good bonuses during the holidays.
good,Assistant Branch Manager is a micro manager and won't let anyone make a decision for themselves. Warehouse manager is afraid to make a decision without consulting assistant branch manager.  People are afraid of him. No room for advancement.  Also raises are 2 percent which is chump change. Very slow in winter. Have to look busy. On the plus side there are no layoffs.
good,"Large company corporate office located in California overall a good place to work, great benefits, nice office cubicles, clean  restrooms, easy interstate access."
good,It really a cool place to work.  Things change fast.  So be able to adapt real fast.  if you like to work with on team that will keep you laughing throughout the day.  You will love this place.  I have no regrets.  I love it here!
good,"As an inside salesperson, I have experienced awful management and can only describe the job culture as a hostile environment. I like my manager on a personal level, but he does not manage the personnel at the store well. The warehouse personnel are extremely difficult to work with, as they have very poor attitudes in general. With the right management and personnel in place, this could be a much better job."
good,"Horrible Management , Branch Manager and Assisting Manager are more worried about their bonus , than their Employees , Counter guys are rude and have horrible customer service skills ."
good,After reading the other review on here regarding toxic management I had no choice but to write a review as well. That review is beyond accurate. When I worked there and challenged this toxic management they fired me! This Company will only continue to have a high turnover rate because the real problem isn’t being fixed.
good,"the managers ask way too much of their employees at times, they treated them like robots and not actual people."
good,"writing unix scripts, testing, code reviews of peers, more coding."
good,Good manager tried hard but it was not a fit for me. The manager made every attempt to work it out for me but sometimes jobs are not the right match for a person.
good,"A typical day at work is just helping customers in the yard with items they need, writing tickets and making sure our aisles our neatly maintained and making sure we are finishing our tasks that are assigned."
good,"Do not feel security long term."
good,Growing company that is in the process of stabilizing its leadership and direction.   Recent changes have resulted in challenges for the performance of its expectations for its customers and associates.
good,management value outside hires more than internal candidates for promotion. also company low ball the internal candidates  when promotions opportunities arise
good,"They paid me well but it is hard to advance. They definitely show favoritism and I was lucky to be one of them. The new Warehouse manager, was horrible but my department Manger was pretty good."
good,"good place to work for good benefits, very one sided place to work for, there way or the high way. fair for taking vacation days or sick time. stressful place to work for if in a management of lead roll position. work load is very heavy and fast moving always somthing to do."
good,The culture of family was the best part with many of my friendships built from my tenure at HD Supply. The challenge was the micro management with certain managers
good,Average warehouse order selecting environment with a conveyor system. Processed orders to be fulfilled daily. Utilized a Pick to Voice system and WMS to meet quality and productions expectations of the company.
good,"We worked hard as a management staff to turn the culture around at the facility. I would like to think that the same culture exists to day. We defined CULTURE @ HD Supply as: "
good,"This job was very fast-paced and you deal with annoying, perverted customers who try to hit on the girl cashiers. Management wouldn't protect the cashiers and would tell us to deal with it, even though it would make us uncomfortable."
good,The best part of working here is the people.  I made some great relationships that I will keep in contact with for a long time.  There is a lot of competition from other companies.
good,The best part of my job was working daily with a great team and the field location managers.  They made the job a pleasure.  I truly enjoyed what I did and the other teams within the company I got to work with.
good,"HD supply, since going public, has become an entirely different animal.  The culture is one that is on guard and working scared at the local levels within sales."
good,A good job working with contractors and running a forklift.  A small warehouse that did a lot of work.  A good work environment with good sales associates
good,"Not the best , not the worst. Always under statffed but at least we would get free lunch a few times a month. Also lack of appropiate equipment to complete our daily tasks like pallet jacks and forklifts."
good,"Good company, fun to work but bad management. The company provided us with a ping pong table to use during our breaks. The company needs to replace certain managers to help the company grow."
good,"Good place for a first job. Culture is a little tense, not enough incentives for workers to perform at their best. The place overall is ok but it's not a place to be if your thinking permanent."
good,I was a cashier for about a year & I learned basic cashier tasks & skills here. Processed all customer transactions at the register. Learned the responsibilites of opening & closing out a cash register.
good,"fast paced company with great employees but poor management."
good,"Work consisted of a full day of picking orders, packaging orders, and manifesting orders for 8+ hours a day. All workers were scheduled many breaks, but couldn't escape the rewarding fatigue of a long day at work."
good,"Was a FABULOUS place to work for the first year, but after it was purchased by a new parent company there was LOTS of in-fighting between old company and new company."
good,Lots or Reorganizing taking place.  Not sure what direction the QA department in headed.  Several layoffs in QA.  QA is small there are 5 people on the time.  The work is not hard.  Did not learn anything.  1 person in QA does not get alone with anyone and is rude and disrespectful.  I do not recommend this company.  The employees are not happy.
good,They squandered a large deal of people and careers when they made the decision to sale to a billion dollar conglomerant that would rather put thousands out of work for an arrogant business decision.
good,"This is a great place to work for if money is your key objective.  They overpay but expect to overwork you.   If your work life balance is important to you, avoid.  If you're looking to move ahead in the career-ladder you'll find yourself leaving within a year or two as you realize the remnants of the good ol boy club still exists here.  Medical plans are the worst i've seen and management doesn't seem to have a clue, present company exception.  The Atlanta office seems to be where all the better talent lies."
good,"It wasn't the worst, it wasn't the best. Its difficult work depending on your position in the company."
good,"Fast paced.  You must hit the ground running.  "
good,"It was a great place to work. The job was fast paced, making the work day go by fast. My job was Monday - Friday, allowing time for ones self on the weekend."
good,"If you are a woman with small children I would advise working somewhere else unless you have a partner who can be there ALL the time with your children. This company is run by men and they will write you up if you cannot work over time. I was ""forced"" per say to go on maternity leave really early."
good,"No growth opportunities, alot of false promises...okay working environment, quality management..."
good,"It is a constantly evolving environment, working in a contact center. I learned the behind the scenes operations of a contact center, including call routing, relating calls to sales, and calculating non-call related workloads. Our management is very associate focused, recognizing for associates for a job well done. They are strategically- minded finding the newest technology to improve the contact center. My co-workers and I work well together, backing each other when someone is absent. The hardest part of my job is when customers and associates are affected by a system issue that impacts the customers' overall experience. I most enjoy interacting with the associates who work on the phones and writing training on the workforce systems."
good,"HD Supply was good to work for and had a great benefit plan. I initially worked for a family owned company called Forest Products, but HD Supply bought it out."
good,"It's Retail. What more do you need to know? Low pay, horrible benefits.. Just a stop a long the way to something better. Don't make it a career unless you like being broke.. You will probably need a 2nd job or use this as a 2nd job."
good,The only time of the day that is tiring is the time in the morning loading the truck. The immediate supervisor lacked knowledge in transportation and was only hired based on his high rank from the military.
good,They have a history of hiring from within but will hire from other backgrounds to provide different perspectives to assist with growing their business.
good,good work place and enjoyed working with customer service associates. Management team always evolving and movement and transferring.  Fast pace growth potential limited.
good,"No matter the department, no matter your level, management seems to be absolutely horrible. They pride themselves on undercutting their employees and use incentives like bandaids. Having an office potluck does not make up for the lack of empathy and micromanagement. They have promoted some of the worst employees into management. The Marietta facility now has a manager that does not even have interpersonal skills. This woman doesn't even speak to anyone but kisses the behinds of her managers to make it seem like she's the most amazing person ever. How do you report an issue when the issue is your manager and the manager that hired her."
good,"Fast paste working environment, friendly employees, management staff were very helpful and understanding to the employer schedule, daily plenty of over time.."
good,Was good place to work at first but then they started losing business and now we have to move to another location not sure what is going on .and not sure about the future .
good,Good for starters and to get some experience for the future. Also if you want to get some experience using certain machinery for certain departments within the warehouse.
good,"We worked in a high-paced, cubicle farm with a lot of unprofessional behavior. I saw a fight that knocked the partitions down between the desks.   I guy went to lunch with a few of the women and left a 6in blade in the backseat of my car. Scary!"
good,This was a good company to work for. However the company closed and employees had to find other places to work without any notice. They have since reopened but on a smaller scale.
good,"HD Supply was a good place to work for the most part.  They have good benefits.  The work was challenging. "
good,"The Building Is under new management, they truly lack understanding of what it takes to run that DC. Some would listen to the employees ideas but most shrug you off like you don't matter."
good,"none- not willing to discuss this company, they have been good to me. The culture is great and its a good starter career .good luck to those who work there"
good,It was a decent place to work. Politics are on the heavy side ! We were provided with an ample set of delivery tools. Had the oppertunity to gain CI / CD deployment pipeline.
good,"healthcare is not as good as Obamacare - it's a joke. They push you to have annual physicals, and to stay in shape, and in return they offer you healthcare that is crazy expensive and covers virtually nothing."
good,As a salaried employee you work a lot of hours and your immediate management support is none existent. They are there only for what they need and do not mentor you. The upper management executives are very good with support and direction.
good,"No matter the weather, everyday was like ground hog day. Everyone knew their job and generally got along and worked together.  We could all count on being busy."
good,Started as a part time cashier and worked hard to get promoted up to an assistant store manager. I learned alot in the 10 years i worked for hd supply. The management was good. The company is a good company overall really good experience.
good,"Not enough work to keep you busy during the cold months."
good,"Upper management continues to let the staff be understaffed.  Makes days VERY LONG. 10-12 hours at least.  They continue to hire staff that only speaks spanish.  Nothing is wrong with this, except it makes them only able to do half of the work which also makes the days longer.  They don't pay enough to make the no work/life balance worth it although work/life balance is something they preach in their values."
good,Job isn't for me.  You have to pick orders when job is slow.  Winter hours it's difficult to get 40 hours.  Summer time brings long hours and management is weak.
good,This company offers GREAT benefits although the health insurance is kinda high. When I initially started working there is was great but with a change in management things changed. Its seems like management is more reactive then proactive to common sense issues that can be addressed before it bigger(example truck maintenance). They will also double your route load and delivery duties in an attempt to make their day easier.
good,Some positions dont have to work as hard but while I was the I was constantly working and doing the work of 4-5 positions each day and each of the positions I had to work were paid higher than me.
good,was a ok job I was just there under a contract. it was some good supervisors there who wanted to help when they seen isssues that need fixing and with workers
good,"It starts out okay,doing you job is not hard ,its not the workplace its the people.When you voice you opionion that seems to be a problem but they tell you to come to them with any problems that you may have. I found out you have to kiss butt  to get ahead i was never good at that. I do my job and i do it well .You dont have to tell me twice to do anything.They put me in the tough areas that most didnt want to go.I had no problem with that because i look at it like this when God is for you who could be against you."
good,HD Supply was a place you had to move products to locations to be organized. Products were everywhere and you had to make sure you grabbed the right products. If you were not able to the job properly then the work day would be difficult.
good,I am to new to the job to really know what it is like at this point. Once I have worked there longer I will have more information and can post a better review.
good,I like working here but some things need to change there. It's time for me to move on. Too many people call in sick to often.  People are often late. Nothing has been done about this yet.
good,HD is a very fun environment. Most of the employees are very young and energetic. Managers are very flexible with scheduling if you are attending school. But once your schedule is set they will not work with it again.
good,Favoritism and Family first. They didn't really care for their employees safety or well being as long as no one had to go to the clinic. If youre a female they highly stress that a man should do it for you.
good,It was a good company but stores were closed. Employees were relocated. Management seemed to be a little confused. Things were left a little unclear on duties and whom was to perform what.And if you took the  on a task you would be stepping on other peoples toes.
good,"Daily tasks consists of order selecting using various equipment like the pallet rider,  order picker, and forklifts. Many opportunities to learn new skills quick. Workload can be overwhelming at times."
good,"Great non management people to work with"
good,"HD Supply is a large national company. My role was to interface with customers putting together large to medium renovation projects. I work with individual properties and national accounts, covering from Brandon to Naples. My personal management team was amazing and always there to help, guide, and support me. My team of peers was amazing as well - we all work hard to create an environment of teamwork, despite being in different divisions where our sales didn’t benefit both teams."
good,This was a nice company to work for they have great benefits as well as a bonus program that makes it all worth while.  They were flexible with my schedule.
good,This job has opened a lot of doors for me. Experience of leadership. Able to show good leadership. I've learned so much on the computer program called SAP which %70 of warehouse use now. I've learned how to operate at least 6 different machines. Over all it was a great learning experience. But now I'm just looking for a better advancement opportunity.
good,Hot work in the warehouse during the Florida summer. Supplied a lot of contractors with product and got to meet a lot of interesting people  doing construction and repairs
good,"Must complete 10-12 onsite visits per day with Supervisor and or managers"
good,Good place to work. Can persue a career. Great benefits and paid time off. Can possibly move around and work in other areas. Equipment operating is optional
good,Not a bad company just needs a lot of improvement. There are no set hours so cut off time is when work is done. They however have good vacation pay and sick time and decent benefits.
good,"A diverse and inclusive workplace where doing the right thing, giving back, taking care of our people, excellent customer service by helpful and knowledgeable associates, building strong relationships, respect for all people are core value"
good,"Enjoyed contract position for three months. Closed their books and helped collections. People friendly, controller helpful as well. No issues. Location easy to drive to."
good,Worked in shipping and receiving. Worked also as an order picker in the warehouse. Good people. Long hours. I enjoyed ii..............................
good,Big company with many opportunities. Great internal partners. Challenges is making any new changes. Many employees have been there for over 12+ years.
good,Lots of opportunities to advance in the entire network.  Laid back environment and great benefits.  There are several departments within the location to apply.
good,"Working on the HDSupply team, design center for builders was a great position. We had a wonderful team of women that worked together. There was training and seminars weekly to help with new computer programs and design selections with new home buyers. Then they sold that division of the company and the new company laid off people."
good,"HD Supply went through many acquisitions during my 10 year term of employment.  Ultimately, the FM division suffered greatly, getting lost in the shuffle which resulted in my final decision to leave. Also, the IPO of the company coincided with the government national healthcare initiative making the healthcare plan unaffordable and the decision to leave an easy one to make."
good,"I began my day at 0530 hours. "
good,HD Supply Construction & Industrial White Cap is an organization that provided me with the opportunity to successfully implement marketing campaigns and strategies in the industrial and construction sector.
good,I've been there just over 2 year's. I've seen so many people come and go it was ludicrous. People wouldn't even get trained and thrown directly in the fire. Not a good environment.
good,Love my coworkers but health benefits are awful. Provide little pay but requires a large work load. Management varies. I had one manager when I started who did not know anything even after a year being there at the job and moved up in the company. But there are a few great supervisors that can lead very well and care.
good,"This company will spend more time policing people that could advance quickly than they do promoting the ideas of people who could excel very quickly."
good,"Answered all sales calls as required, created solutions for late material on orders, summarized due dates for supplies on a weekly report."
good,I loved the work but they are not as safety oriented as they let on.Sometimes way too many things were slipped under the rug. stand on a pallet to be lifted in the air.
good,"HD Supply has a lot of turnover, especially in the management and higher positions.  This in turn the staff has to readjust to another managers way of running their individual stores."
good,"HD Supply now Anixter Inc is a fast paced, high energy environment. If you like a challenge and can multi Task without missing a beat this is the company for you!"
good,"Benefits unsatisfactory"
good,"decent great co-workers"
good,Reviewed tax rates and issues for multiple municipalities to ensure accuracy for auditing purposes. Overall mostly repetitive work with no growth potential.
good,I learned how to manage a route and open accounts with new customers which later generated more sales in the future for the company.
good,"The company is at par with most small to mid-size company in terms of quality of leadership, quality of work / life balance, compensation, etc."
good,"I wasn't here long enough to give a good rating, but the work culture and seems very decent. The people are nice and they have a nice cafeteria."
good,over the years this place has changed.  if you like to work 10-12 hours a day and work weekends at short notice then this place might be for you.
good,I worked closely with the buyers and vendor to make sure parts were shipped in a timely matter. I worked real close with the vendors on the out of stocks items. My co-workers appreciated everything that I would do for them.
good,"Large corporation based out of Atlanta and Orlando with offices in the West Coast. Large investment in IT. Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company"
good,"I work in the case pick area and compared to other selecting jobs it is much easier to consistently hit your production target. On the flip side of that coin there is no incentive to go above and beyond. While my current manager is constantly showing his appreciation for going above and beyond, no one runs to hear good job. Not a bad place to work, however there is a pretty annoying lack of procedure and follow through from most management. Be ready to pull Toilet bowls weighing up to 60 lbs. from over head and up to 40 ft. up in the air. Lots of politics, to the point of slowing down shifts because of people not liking each other especially management."
good,"I enjoyed working at HD Supply. They are very generous with free coffee, employee appreciation days, sprit and team building. Their benefits are good, except for the medical which sucks. All plans have a yearly $2500 deductible."
good,"The people that work at HD Supply are wonderful.  Management is a bit removed.  I believe that opportunities for advancement are limited and job security isn't provided.  There are no ""perks"" or incentive programs that help with productivity or motivation."
good,"Great location, great atmosphere to work in, lots of products to learn and know, great benefits, really good leadership"
good,Good company.  Work is 50-60 hours per week minimum for Property Improvement Sales people.  Work from home with bi weekly calls and plenty of email communication.
good,"Very relaxed atmosphere to work, could use a little improvement on efficiency. Has some room for advancement if you are willing to relocate."
good,Great place to work. Moving in the right direction. Movement possibilities. Benefits are good and could be better. Vacation weeks should be more.
good,Order picking and freight deliveries to companies that need building material and appliances. Packing product for ups and Fed ex deliveries.
good,HD supply is company a good company with great benefits and it is a fast paced environment that makes the work day fly by. I have learned that the work was not hard but it is a challenge to manage people.
good,its a great job i just wish it was easier to get higher in the company
good,"This is a place where you always have some work to be completed. All department work together to reach a common goal. There is a lot to be learned. "
good,Lots of calls and a busy fast paced day.  The computer systems is dated which makes for a slow process.  Could be much more efficient with a new system
good,Enter orders and bids. Assist manger and outside saleman with inquiries about uncoming jobs.
good,Great management with below average compensation - flexible but with heavy workload
good,"A high volume call center, but the Manager was great, I also had great co wokers, I enjoyed my time with this company"
good,"People are good with strong industry knowledge and contacts - not much thinking outside the box."
good,good people who work there management are the worst i have dealt with
good,"Changes happen constantly just like in everyday society. A constant flow of work that keeps your attention and focus,"
good,friendly & kind company  to work for they are very they understand you situation..
good,"A detailed oriented job with lots of volume, but the hardest part is to get everyone on the same page with what we are doing."
good,Good place to work. Hours were good. People were friendly. Pay was reasonable. Location was close to home. Unfortunately I was layed off October 31  2008 and haven't returned.
good,"A typical work day for me was 5 hours, and a lot of heavy lifting. I learned a wide variety of products for building and remodeling homes. Management was new since the general manager was just as new as I was when I started. Most of m co-workers were new as well because most of them started after me. The hardest part of my job was moving half ton pallets across the warehouse and for the most enjoyable part of my day was assisting the costumers find or figure out what was need for the task they were trying to accomplish."
good,"Full-time position as a shipping/receiving clerk. Day consisted of unloading and loading trucks and picking orders. Co-workers seemed to be a little more held back and kept to themselves. Although co-workers weren't as friendly, my job at hand was not effected. I resigned due to long commute on subway and conflicted with my lifestyle."
good,"Order, check-in and stock products at Home Depot Stores in the Austin area."
good,This job is really stable and can see the years pass by right before your eyes. It's an easy going job that anyone can quickly pick up.
good,Warehouse job that consisted using forklift pallet jacks. lifting pulling loading unloading
good,Close to home and the work was very enjoyable when there was a lot of overtime.
good,"A truly familiar experience working and learning fastners and power tools as my experience in working with power tools at Black & Decker helped.  Fast paced environment with many interactions with internal staff.  Built many new relationships.  Orientation PK101 week was very helpful, interactive and knowledgeable."
good,"HD Supply is working to become a customer focused, national player in the industrial and constuction supply space"
good,"I begin my day by looking at sales from the day before and then preparing for the days appointments.  Also check emails and respond as necessary.  Visit properties and take care of issues and sales.  Record all visits in Sales Force.  Come home and complete quotes and other admin work.  Management allows you to work at your own pace.  No pressure.  Because I work from home I do not intermingle with co workers to often,  However, I do keep in contact with the reps that are in my immediate area.  The hardest part of the job is the excessive emails and keeping them categorized.  Also our goals increase between 15%-20% every year, so there's almost no incentive to have a blow out year because you will be goaled on your new totals.    I feel I will never be in a good place at this company.  It will always be up hill.   Also keeping up with all of the different pricing for all of the different hotel brands can be challenging.The most enjoyable part of the job is the flexible schedule.  I am able to tend to my elderly parents as necessary."
good,"hard physical labor and bureaucracy, but not enough opportunity to advance.  "
good,I didn't work at this company for very long. A typical day consisted of answering phones and filing papers.
good,"Deliver products in specified time-frame, with correct accessories. Customer satisfaction was utmost important."
good,"Pull outbound orders, load and unload trucks, answer will call, reconcile orders to make sure orders are accurate, ship orders via Fed Ex. Drive order picker and forklift. Use Intermec scanner."
good,Working at HD was overall a fun working environment meeting new people daily was interesting. Coworkers were very helpful there was no negativity in workplace motivation in sales is what HD is about. Management was absolutely terrific at helping there employees daily there was more than two managers on duty to help customers and there employees. The best part working at HD supply was helping customers finding what they needed and as myself knowing the products was a benefit to making a sale happen. I learned about newer products everyday I was always in engaged and interested in what our store had to offer. There was never a situation in which the job was difficult or hard I always managed.
good,"Self-taught aggressive, motivated individual. Have entertained all classes offered and then trained a team in all verticals of the company."
good,Solid contractor supplier with much experience on staff. Good working environment and benefits.
good,"Busy. I work with a good team, we are all on the same page as far as getting our work done."
good,H&D was a temp job i had through an agency.They closed and i only worked as a cashier and did their inventory
good,I worked for 10 different management people in 7 years. By the way I was in mid to upper level management.
good,"A typical work day consist of me taking calls from our customer service department, inside and outside sales reps, and customers. It is my job to get a customer what he needs to accomplish his task at hand, if to make sure he understands how to use the product. What I enjoy most about my job is seeing a job from start to finish and knowing I helped that customer get what they needed."
good,too many chiefs and not enough Indians.
good,"A good company to work for, no micro managing and flexible. A relaxed environment."
good,Good atmosphere and the people are great to work with. Wages could be better but management is not the strongest but somehow it seems to work. Could be better with the right people at the top.
good,HD Supply is not the best place to work for families. This is the typical 'management doesn't care about their workers' and are definitley expendable.
good,I was very happy with this position. It was too bad that they acquired too many yards in Columbus and had to downsize.
good,New to NYC market - focused on job safety and forming and shoring - company will provide training in these areas. Sell construction material in NYC area
good,"Hd supply was a pretty good place to work nice, people with good attitudes helpful co workers. The people that interview me were also really good at make sure we felt good about the place and stuff like that."
good,"A typical day at work was nice and quiet. "
good,Started here for a different kind of sales culture.  Since then a new CEO came in and it is not the same.  No longer enjoyable. Too much stress for it to be worth it.
good,As a stocker the work wasn't to complicated. But the hours we were scheduled for made it difficult for stickers to be able to do there job efficiently. For the first 5 hours of our shift we would act as customer service and constantly be interrupted in the middle of whatever we were doing. This cause us to have to work harder after the store close which made the work feel harder and put a larger load on the employees when it came to needing to get things done.
good,HD Supply was a good place to start work and learn different materials from exterior to interior products in peoples everyday lives. Hours were short but the work was consistent.
good,Was a great place to work at one time. The company at one time used to be called Tennessee Valley Electric. Tennessee Valley Electric was sold to Home Depot and then Home Depot sold the company to 3 private equity groups which ruined the company.
good,The pay is not worth it at all the managers there are awesome but for the tool rental department it’s just not worth the pay way to dangerous but overall nothing bad about it
good,Worked there as a start up operation.  company was not ready for the size of the operation or volume of orders and merchandise flowing through the building.  Shifts were long and employees got frustrated.
good,"I worked remotely, so I did not have a normal experience of working as part of a team. I worked for the Waterworks division which has now been sold, so I can only relate to that divisionl"
good,I really thrived in this job. I was a delivery driver for all sorts of items for facilities mantenance compares. I'd load my freight in stop order and left to go on road. I would occasionally have my supervisor ride along so he could evaluate my customer service and efficiency.
good,"Large turnover in middle management. Job description changed with every new manager.  The range in people was as varied as the different companies within the company structure."
good,"A typical day at work"
good,The day goes by fast when there is enough work to do. The morning is lead by an office meeting and stretching for safety. Everyone hits the warehouse to start their work load for the day.
good,"A typical day is fast paced with a lot of calls. Once you sit down, your phone will ring constantly. The workplace environment is great with coworkers."
good,This was a fun and enjoyable working environment with a good culture as a whole. Unfortunately the housing meltdown that began in 2008 led to ongoing rounds of layoffs that eventually led to my position being eliminated a couple of yard later.
good,Good entry level jobs. Not much room to advance. There are many tenured employees that aren't going anywhere. Work/ life balance was not good either. I hope the compensation has improved as well compared to other company's in the same industry.
good,nice people to work with. management of its own words. i enjoyed the time i worked for this company. but i had ti quit cause of a health problem i had back than. other wise i would be still there.
good,"Phone calls, set appointment, hit road 6-8 customer meetings, enter all into salesforce. Rinse and repeat. Lots of time doing reports, metrics, planning, data input, skyping, group calls."
good,"As a delivery driver, the wage for this position was good.  Management was well trained yet little training for drivers.  Control over hours work was limited.  Business security was questionable"
good,I enjoyed my employees but my manager wasn't very helpful when I needed help. The place is a more of who you know and hang out with than what you know.
good,Learned alot at this job but there was to much favoritism when involving the supervisors and certain employees which caused the shift to be divided amongst certain people
good,I was the new guy I was the to go perform routine inspection of vehicles and supplies to ensure safety Delivery to homes and businesses customer service lloaded and unloaded Delivery to apartment sites
good,"Work is very busy on a day by day basis, time fly's. Always helping customers and co-workers as well. everyday when I go in to work i learn something new, whether its about our product or even just simply learning something more about my customers, everyday brings something new, and that makes work all the much better. The most enjoyable part of my day is being able to give my customer exactly what they need when they need it, satisfaction to them is satisfaction to me."
good,"At this location, you can come to work in shorts and flip-flops if you desire. That is a plus on the days you just really are not up for all the glam. I would have to say this place really lacks some stucture several of the employees seem to be confused if they are at work or at the bar. There are a more than a handful that are dedicated to their jobs and appreciate the companies dollar. I have learned a lot, it is fast pace at times & you have to be willing to get your hads dirty if you plan on keeping up."
good,"Management does not treat associates like people, they treat them like toddlers.  You must treat people like people and do not talk down to them on  a daily basis. The associates are great to work with daily."
good,"The Accounts Payable Department is completely unorganized.  They need a Senior Manager that knows how an Accounts Payable Department should function.  Accounts Payable is not just based on how many invoices you can push thru in a month but about relationships with internal and external vendors.  The people in the AP Department are unhappy, overworked and not treated fairly.  It's a shame because it's a great company to work for with a promising future and they care about their employees as a whole.  Just not in the AP Department.  When you see a problem with a persons management style not working and causing conflict with many other workers they should not be managing."
good,"I went through 7 General managers and 8 Assistant general managers and a 90% overall turnover in the span of 5 years working for the company. It wasn't consistent enough to my liking. The store was struggling in making profit. My department went 10 associates understaffed for a whole year to benefit the profit margin, being under budget in payroll.This made my job extremely stressful and did not have adequate coverage for my department. I did not get lunch coverage every Sunday because I was the only manager on duty. So I ate my lunch while I worked. Over all I feel I was taken advantage of. I am a very hard worker and dedicated myself to an unsuccessful business and I am looking for better work opportunities."
good,"The job title says customer service FM but it really turned out to be somewhat of a sales job they call themselves ""peachtree business products"" they are owned by hd supply. The center is small it is difficult to request a day off because they don't want people off the phones at all. You have to upsell with customers and they keep track of your sales everyday, it is a very sales driven company. You will most likely not get a raise until you are there for 2 years. "
good,"The company makes near constant changes to leadership and structure in an effort to salvage their position in the marketplace. Very little training given, and responsibilities expected of their employees are often ambiguous. Higher level, long term employees are often let go without appropriate backup, so competent sources of knowledge of practices and policy are lacking. Great benefits and personal support."
good,"Prior to the acquisition of the company by HD Supply, this company was customer driven, productive, energetic and forward thinking. It was a place to grow and stretch as a professional and you were able to see your impact on the customers (both external and internal) and adjust accordingly for the betterment of the business."
good,Great place to work at management needed improvements. Customers were always fun and great to work with always btought a new challenge to the table. Branch managers focus on the other hand can be improved
good,Worked in a call center and required to meet sales quotas. incoming calls were monitored and associates were routinely coached for growth opportunities.
good,Standard retail environment that is relaxed. Focused on customers so if you have a lit the day go's by fast but on slow days you would find yourself doing busy work or talking with other employees or the few customers that are in the store.
good,"You have a great crew, and management that cares, but the balance between work and home is nonexistent. 12 hours or more most days. Getting off early means only a 9-10 hour day."
good,Sometimes you could come on at 9am and not get off til 2 or 3am. They dont like for you too take breaks. You are expected to keep working til all your work is done and then you get sent to another department to help them until they finish everything. They over work people and dont appreciate their good employees. It's all about favoritism
good,It's a great company to work for. They care about their associates and offer plenty of benefits. It is very fast paced and there are long hours during the second shift.
good,"A high pace job with good energy. No work uniform so you dress comfortably to work in a hot environment  warehouse.  Prepare for long hours throughout the week based on the volume of work they have. In need of better, more organize manager"
good,"Working there as an account manager is unpredictable and is a dog fight between other account managers to hit targets. Very tough to succeed, account managers that have been there longer continue to get bigger while new account managers struggle"
good,"Lots of hard work, but fair pay."
good,"- pick orders and pack them"
good,"Consistent scheduling which equals decent pay checks, but poor management makes you wish you could go home early. You get regular customers that can either make your day enjoyable and others that aren't so enjoyable. You have a clear understanding on what you have to do for the day when. You clock in but that can change throughout the day so be prepared to be flexible."
good,I loved the job when I started but things changed over the years. Some sups are better than others as far as working relationship. some will not support you if you aren't on their friends list. The demands keep going up but the time in which to complete them have not changed. It hasn't been the same since they became publically traded and now it's all about appeasing the shareholders and no real incentive or appreciation given to reps. some of the incentives have been cut to save money and cut spending
good,"Pretty boring and you have a lot of requirements. You come in and punch in, cant really talk to anyone cause of back to back calls every day. People are rude and you have to meet 15 tasks on every call as far as verification and you have to try and push at least 2 promotional sales per call or you fail."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with, you easily get along with everyone. One of the hardest part would be the long hours, the store is so busy sometimes we have to do up to 12 hour shifts to make sure everything is good for the next day."
good,Make deliveries to customer job sites while adhering to all safety procedures. Load inventory on truck and unload at customer site. Perform routine inspections of vehicles and supplies to ensure road safety. Plan route to and from customers' businesses and adjusts for traffic and/or construction. Ensures that manifests are complete and accurate. Prepares and maintains records in accordance with company policies and procedures. Provides assistance to resolve customer issues.
good,"When you work in an IT department, the typical day is not knowing what to expect so you must  be prepared for anything.  In addition to addressing any immediate issues, you then perform your daily routine.  I was the business analyst specializing in EDI so I worked closing with the branch operations, vendors, AP associates, accountants and developers.  I learned a lots about how each of these groups work and how important it is for the there to be accurate interchange of data for all.  Over the years I also learned how to prioritize the project.  As an example, work on your smaller projects while taking a break away from the larger ones.  It not only clears your brain, but gets all the projects completed in a timely fashion.  "
good,"The work environment was great, compensation ok, and good balance of work/family. To much politics, and very little direct interaction with workers and management due to the horizontal management structure. Not a place to plan for a career as there is little or no upward mobility."
good,Most of my co-workers are incredibly cool and respectful and some are not. Management out there are so what hard to get along with because their are always in your face about something. I'm not sure of what the hardest part of my job is but I enjoy interacting with other staff members.
good,"HD Supply was a great place to work.  The management in my office was terrible, but he eventually left after I did.  Your work day consists of working with contractors, and buying and selling water works materials such as hydrants, pipe, and fittings.  Lots of forklifting and paperwork is involved."
good,Company is great place to work at. People are nice and a lot of opportunities around to consider. You can move your way up if you strive enough.
good,I really enjoyed my job and the people but the benefits were so bad I couldn’t afford to work their. I was paying $400+ for my health insurance every month.
good,"HD Supply is an efficient, business first corporation that adequately takes care of its employees. It provides sufficient training and support without offering much in the way of career advancement or extra incentives."
good,"In a typical day at HD supply I would stock lumber yard, help customers with their projects, and maintain a clean yard. The most enjoyable part of the job was down stocking and cleaning at the end of the day."
good,The branch I work at was not properly managed. The local manager was not capable enough to handle the responsibility of the business development end of the business. Some of the employees were old friends of his that were not productive.
good,Good job a lot of hours can be rough when it comes to understanding some people will try to put more on you they rotate you around the warehouse overall alright
good,"I went in as an associate. It's been great, I'm learning as much as possible. So I can move up, if a position comes available. The managers are wonderful."
good,It is a great company to work for. All the staff is very friendly and easy to get along with. It has a positive work atmosphere.
good,Compensation is good but benefits need some reworking.  The hours are great and so are most of my coworkers.  It is a great stepping stone with much to teach.  Toughest job I have ever had though.
good,Been with HD for almost 5 years and looking for a change. Good environment and learned something new everyday I like working with customers
good,"Working for HD Supply was stable, flexible and had a lot of good people to work with. However, the positions were under paid and the hours were long. It was nice that over time was abundant, but it felt horrible that one had to work the over time...ALL THE TIME. There were very, very few steps on the ladder and waiting for someone above you quitting was like waiting for the glaciers to move. There was virtually no advancement within the company."
good,"Hd Supply is a great company to work for, however, I have goals to move up and grow with this company and although I try in every opportunity I can get, management does not seem to try to help me advance."
good,"I started this job and was excited to feel like I was immediately needed. Had lots of overtime without feeling burned out. It was reassuring when I learned that there wasn't an abundance of turnover, i.e. the employees had been with the company for awhile. Sadly, I was fired over having bad judgment and instead of my management fighting for a good employee who was always eager to take on more challenges and a heavier workload than necessary and who had excellent customer reviews, I was canned. My DC manager was a company man. It didn't matter that I was arguably the best driver who always went above and beyond. I messed up, once, and was let go. I was so sad to go. I loved the job and the people I worked with. In the end, my excellent work ethic meant nothing and that stung. Still does."
good,"I loved this place.  I was one of their number one drivers, but let go on a technicality."
good,"My manager was amazing. The team was pretty cool, just a few people who need some talking to. The job itself was easy but it wasn’t for me. It’s hard to get the schedule you want to be honest. You have to go to a different department other than customer service to make real money. I feel customer service needs to make more than what they make. Advancement is limited somewhat. Overall good place to work for people who can do that type of job."
good,manager took care of us like one big family. would still be there but our depot was closed and it was too far to work at the next closest depot.I miss it.
good,"If your manager is good, it will improve your life significantly - I have an excellent manager, which makes it much better."
good,"working for this company taught me many different things. i had worked in almost every different department so i was able to learn many different things from working behind the customer service desk, working in the cash office, working the register, greeting customers at the door and learning all the hardware. every so often i had changed departments so if was interesting to be doing different job descriptions and working in different environment.."
good,"Wonderful Management, Lots of Potlucks, Amazing Benefits, GREAT Staff. Typical Day: The majority of the time is spent on the computer, sitting at a desk. Management is flexible with scheduling."
good,"The start of my day , check emails , quick meeting to cover the days activity's . Check out equipment - forklift , cherry picker , stand up reach truck or electric pallet jack."
good,"Dead end job,but you have benefits, decent first job for people. Great for students as the offer partim and fulltime, too much schooling and experience to move up to real money. Best if you speak spanish or armenian as most of the customer are speaking those languages,"
good,"I have worked there for 14 years.  It is a very strenuous, fast paced, get the job done no matter how long it takes.  Expects one person to do too much."
good,"HD Supply is a great place to work, it could be greater. We are however getting off from work sooner than before, so change is good."
good,"Develop a sales team, organize a profitable sales and marketing team. Provide product at a fair price. Pick, Pack, Ship."
good,"I will say the company was and to me still is a great place for employment, unfortunately it is the sister company you go through to he employeed as a contractor Novitex is trash. As long as your hired on through HD supply and do your job every day you'll be fine otherwise be careful because sometimes rumors and personal issues can cause you problems job wise."
good,"On a typical day th phone never stops ringing , you deal with different types of issues as well as personalitys. It was a fast paced job and it was all way a challange. In which made me better at my job ."
good,The job is not bad Monday through Friday pretty much the job entails load truck up with merchandise then deliver to designated customer all in all I was satisfied with the job not much complaints some route to Hard some really easy plain and simple
good,The turn over rate is extremely high. They do take the time to invest in there employees however they do not invest in your advancement. some of the management staff is not very understanding of anything.
good,"typical day at work started at 2:oo pm, started with our meeting with our boss. got assigned our job tasked. grabbed our gear and went straight to work. our breaks were always the best we had ping pong tournaments got all our employees pumped to work. hardest part of the job is keeping a rate of 120 while picking orders."
good,A company with opportunities of advancement. People are friendly and overtime available during busy season. Trading is always available. Building is clean and lots of parking available.
good,Some good.  Some bad.  No notice I was getting laid off. I was hired for full time and followed all the rules.  A new POD system was implemented and it was decided my position did not have enough to do.  It takes longer than two months to implement that kind of program.
good,"Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea. In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph"
good,The field and the clients are fantastic. Great opportunity. The management group is incredibly toxic and they have implemented a sequence of accountabilities shirking that results in the bottom levels having high churn rates. Until the company realizes this and replaces these individuals this will not change.
good,It was a Great place to work.  Loved the company at first but after going public and buying out a few local companies the culture completely changed.  I wish them nothing but the best in the future
good,"I enjoyed working at HD SUPPLY I Pick items from operator jenifer return to conveyer belt to be boxed and delivered. Move fast, pay attention, follow your checklist."
good,"At beginning and throughout day, pull and ready material for shipment.  Load flatbed truck and secure according to company policy.  Deliver material to customer location, jobsite, or stop along route, and unload with truck mounted forklift as needed."
good,I have worked here since I was an intern. An amazing community with amazing people. Since they went IPO though it seems to be more focused on where they can save money more then how they treat their employees.
good,"ping pong tables at saddle creek, great employee's, but wrong people in management postion. More yelling than training."
good,"On Wednesdays and Fridays we would were T shirts for favorite teams or different colors."
good,"I was only with the company for one year as an inside sales rep. when I was promoted to Operations Manager, But My immediate supervisor lived in another town 2 hours away and only came down here once a month for 2 days on average, so I felt a little like it was a ""sink or swim"" situation. All in all, I did a pretty good job of it with very little direction. The month before I left was the first time in many years that that branch turned enough in profit that a small bonus was earned."
good,"This job was fun for a first time job. There were many different positions to apply to cashier, front desk, door greeter, lumber yard clerk, and stocker."
good,Great growing company that has great benefits. Try to hire within first before looking outside.  Management training is lacking. Will try to work with you if you need time off due to hours of operation.
good,"Decent place to work, their advancement criteria is horrible.  The do not do quarterly and monthly reviews.  Their Training and Development is horrible but they want you to be the best in the world."
good,"This was actually a fun place to work at when I was employed there, lots of friendly employees and and the job was not difficult if you were comfortable loading things into customers cars/trucks with a forklift. Ive since been back as a customer and the vibe is different now."
good,I would come in and have safety meetings then we would go over the orders and pick. Would load up the trucks at the end of the day. My co-workers were very nice and we get along but management was not so good.
good,HD Supply offers a lot of opportunities for junior candidates to excel and attain professional experience.
good,"HD Suppy was a great place to work with everything that you ever wanted out of a job, except enough work. I need to have more stimulation in a job, otherwise I would still be employed there."
good,this job would have been great but for the micromanagement and salary cap
good,Not how I thought it would be. Not a terrible place of employment but not ideal for what i am striving for
good,"Your experience working at HD Supply will be dependent on how much you are willing to commit to your time there. "
good,"I felt that half of the job was fixing the mistakes of others who didn't perform their duties to the fullest but still were compensated either as much or more than I was.  "
good,"We pack orders for various apartment complexes, hotel, motel and nursing home in the area and Oregon. We have to pay close attention to where each order is going and all is packed to be shipped. Keep a clean area and well stocked."
good,"HD Supply is a growing company especially the Healthcare Vertical."
good,If you like making money for sales people who constantly complaining its not enough. This jobs for you. Hard work is rarely rewarded and opinions are never cared about.
good,"Good company to work for if you are on the right team. Lots of room for advancement, if you work for it. Work schedule is monday-friday. No weekends and no major holidays."
good,hd supply is a good job to have. I wouldn't advise anyone looking for a career to try to work from the bottom to the top needs to look else where.
good,Placement at the right warehouse is key. Not all warehouses are managed to the same standards. The company has many positions to chose from.
good,"HD Supply was a good company, however they did not have good leadership on hand. There was no Supervisor in the location and miss communication was always a factor. Not good to have favoritism in the work place."
good,"My Mgr was good; however, her manager and her managers manager were very ineffective. Most of the time, we couldn't find the Sr Director of Finance if we had a question or need clarification. The back office had very little business investment therefore the systems and reporting capabilities were horrendous/non-existent. Very manual process and a lot of time spent running in circles to get things done. Corporate IT wasn't very helpful. LOB IT was."
good,Good Company! Plenty of hours and overtime. Good benefits and vaction packages
good,"Working in merchandising at HD Supply has provided me with a great deal of experience by working on a vast array of projects and functions, in a company that is growing quickly.  The hardest part of the job is quickly switching gears from one in-depth project to another, at a moment's notice.  The most rewarding part of the job is being able to shape outcomes and negotiate key business objectives with internal and external customers. "
good,"Fast-paced environment, must pay attention to details, lots of rules that must be followed. In the past Company was flexible with some rules as long as the customer was being taken care of, today you can lose your job if you don't follow every single rule to the letter. Most co-workers are great people, are helpful, the hardest part of this job is getting on the same page with supervisors and having a great working relationship with them. Their education and personality is limited which makes it difficult for them to initiate a positive working relationship with the people they lead/manage. The most enjoyable part of this job is serving the customers, meeting their needs, and the physical aspect of this job is great. It is a physically demanding job, but very easy job once you get the hang of it."
good,We take care of all order that come and goes and we maintain safety for  all worker. And we have morning shift and night shift and we pick the right and flexible hours for us.
good,I enjoyed woeking for them. Very much Team Players. Easy to go to with questons. Learn products and go sell n meet metrics and you should succeed easily. They would take us once a year for training conferences.  If not always were bringing our Vendors in house for product training. As long as you pay attention and do what is expected of you. Great place to be
good,My time with this company was great and well spent! I can't find many jobs that had my welcomed as they did. My work with others was never a bad time or wasted effort to help in other areas of the job.
good,"My peers I work with were fun to work around. They had issues keeping stock in there stores. The working hours were fair. The outside sales were good for the most part, but I feel the needed to be more thorough when asking the right questions when takin"
good,it was a good experience that provided a lot of experience in the construction supply area.  enjoyed working with the people there to most.  good leadership.
good,"Another day another dollar is the mindset to have. All workers get along. i've learned alot working at this company in different areas, they kind of nickle and dime you with the raises"
good,was very happy working for hd supply i was a driver and managed my own route and deliveries i would recommend to friends its steady paced job and get to interact with many people thru out the day
good,"Good company that can actually be a great company to work for if upper management spent more time addressing the day to day issues instead of paying it lip service. You also have entirely too many “I don’t care” attitudes than “I care” people employed here, thus making it a tougher journey towards success. Micromanagement seems to be the norm around here, but for all the wrong reasons."
good,"store manager was very rude un fair,called names  and much more.  Very poor management treated some people very bad and others great de pends on who and how old you are."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my work with White Cap has been learning the Construction Industry, as this is a new industry for me. I also greatly enjoy my team - everyone works hard to contribute and I enjoy spending my days with them as individuals."
good,"Hardwork and fast-paced, but the benefits are great! Healthcare with dental and vision.  401k is a plus.  Stock options as well. People there are very friendly and willing to help you when you need it. Training is paid. Flexible hours and able to withstand variable temperatures are a must."
good,Inventory control purchasing minute for 25 years got laid off after new company took over just wanna find another job did I can stay until I regionally 6570
good,"It was nice until I started getting stressed out with the lack of sleep. All in all, fun place to work. It's all about teamwork there. The management didn't really take you seriously though."
good,"I answered inbound calls and occasionally made follow up calls.  The job was an e-commerce setting for which we assisted customers in choosing products, product description, comparative pricing, delivery tracking and returns.  The group shift supervisors were very good about helping new people become familiar with SOPs.  This is a catalog order company similar to Home Depot products."
good,"very fast paced, extremely high demand , must have experience with operating heavy machinery such as forklifts , cherry pickers, reach trucks , and electric pallet jacks"
good,"Management can use some serious work here, there seems to be more (managers) than employees. Its the employees that make this place working at, that and the slower laidback environment."
good,This company offers a great benefits package and base pay. Training is extensive and there is loads of knowledge to be gained when working for this company.
good,"Competitive environment, must be willing and able to adapt to frequent changes within the company/ Dept. structures. Company has a history of restructuring and changes in ownership and Upper Managers, that triggers down to all employees."
good,"I learned many aspects of Mozenda, SAP, Excel spreadsheets, time management, and interpersonal skills.  My supervisor was exceptional in allowing me to grow and learn, with a sink or swim mentality.  I was able to explore any direction I wanted to go with little or no hesitation to do so.  The hardest part of the job was being put into a leadership role with no direction or training.  I loved every aspect of my job."
good,HD supply was a very fast paced and productive place to work the managers were helpful and the employees were effective i enjoyed working there. good.
good,Loved my coworkers. Many different cultures. It was very competitive amongst our coworkers on who finished work first so I made it fun. Supervisor was also fun.
good,"Decent culture, long commute, fun job with little opportunity for career advancement.  The most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with finding solutions for customer needs.  The hardest part of the job is the commute.  I am now very versed in construction supplies especially in safety and concrete construction fields."
good,Fast paced work environment but Columbus DC poorly managed.Company as a whole seems to be well organized and stable with room for advancement. Vacation and paid holidays are good but the rest of benefits are sub-par compared to other's in the area.
good,A typical day at work is very hot in the summer and cold in the winter the place has no a/c or heat i learned a lot about sap and receiving  management lie a lot and try to make you feel like you have to work hard in order for you to keep your job the hardest part of the job is when they constantly firing DC managers and then you get someone who know nothing about working in a warehouse and they come in messing up everything
good,Seems some business folks are resistant to certain process improvements or change to system configurations to support streamlined and/or more efficient processes... even when management is looking for improvements.
good,Wonderful company with great supervision and management. Great work atmosphere were employees are much like family and I feel that is set by good leadership. Room for advancement if desired.
good,"NA - Can have a discussion an during interview if employee request.  Will not speak on the company I currently work.  Let's just say that HD Supply as a company had been very good to me and my family."
good,I have met a lot of great people in this company and I gained a lot of great experience. The company is  very resourceful and the customers are fantastic!
good,"Strong team in a secure market, good technology. good work life balance,  good leaders lot of GE management with a lot of the same GE style good management development"
good,"Company was very large and sometimes the salary did not fit the job you were responsible for. There were lots of employees that did not fit what was needed, but the salary we offered was all we could get."
good,"Created work order for installation of carpet ,tile, and wood"
good,"The roof leaks when it rains, the back room of the store is like an oven because the swamp coolers are broken, it took months to get a new pallet jack after one of them broke. Not all associates are recognized equally or given equal opportunities or incentives. Safety practices and procedures are sometimes ignored because general manager wants to satisfy customers. The store is self-serve but stock associates are there to assist with questions customers might have and loading assistance if the item is too heavy for customer or requires two person lift. Customers are very rude and expect stock associates to get a cart from entrance of store and follow them around to load all items in cart and follow them to the registers to pay and then to their car to load all by ourselves."
good,"Working with HD Supply has given me the opportunity to utilize my administrative skills.  On a daily basis 85% of my work is done through my emails. We are currently working on the SAP system, I have now 5 years experience on this system.  I guess you can say I set up the contract for the installers to installs, wood, carpet, vinyl, backsplash, & wall tile in to new homes that have been built.   When I first got here we went through 6 supervisors only to have them leave.  The supervisor I have now is great, he not one to micro manage.  He give you your space and allows you to do your work accordingly."
good,Great place to work!!  Good company and even better people. They look out for the employees and give you all the tools needed to excel.
good,"Long fast passed days.I learned many needs and products multi family facilities use to operate. Management is helpful but lots of chiefs, not always clear who you need to go to for help. Co-workers were fantastic. Very helpful from outside sales along with the fantastic  sales support team. Hardest part of the job is the many departments and wide range product line. Most enjoyable part of the job is the freedom and most of the customers... some customers you will never make happy."
good,"Material Handling mainly with machines"
good,I enjoy working at HD Supply. The managers are great people and easy to get along with. A typical day at work is fairly busy. There is always so much to do and to get done at the end of the time. My job is diverse so a lot of my co-workers speak different languages also my co-workers are always positive and lively . The hardest part of the job is trying to move fast without messing up. The most enjoyable part of the job is when they treat us around the holidays and over the summer.
good,Fair place to work. Most of the management is supportive and is helpful. Minimal amount of paper work. There are a lot of great people that work there. I very much enjoy working with my colleagues and learning from them and getting to know your customers. The friends you make along the journey.
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them. The office started to get crowded as the company grew."
good,"The leadership at this particular warehouse needs some work. Some good and mostly bad, unfortunately.  There was no team what so ever. Its a good place but can be even better. HD Supply is a fantastic company and i would work for them again."
good,"Really fast paced with everything must be multitasked to do 4-5 things at once. "
good,"Overall very positive place to work. 401k match, full benefits, and vacation time. Management is very engaged and listens to new ideas and concerns alike."
good,Days spent loading and unloading trucks while also doing inventory and qc on products. I have learned a lot about the power construction industry. They do provide us with new equipment which is a big plus.
good,"Busy, large National distribution company. Rapid growth, invests in locations, and equipment. Constant focus on improvement and cost containment. Long hours and rapid pace. Advancement opportunities are slim and a fair amount of favoritism and  old boy network is still in place after mergers and acquisitions."
good,"I love interacting with customers and especially when they are nice to you when you're nice to them. What I like about this job is that I've learned many things regarding to construction, like what the merchandise is sometimes used for. I also try to answer every question that the customer asks and if I don't know I ask myself."
good,"Supervise all corporate account orders, including receiving and processing, in assigned regions.  Counsel corporate clients and high net-worth individuals with regard to appropriate product needs."
good,"A typical day always depends on your position "
good,Large company and industry leader but slow to adapt to change. Works hard to be flexible if not nimble.
good,"Management is very helpful, and a very good learning experience."
good,"Typical day at work was to get truck loaded and deliver products to construction sites. I would usually have 3 to 4 runs a day. I would also help in the warehouse at times."
good,"assistant to finance director, varies reports, and collections"
good,Del. To all in baltimore region.  Good co-workers  moved to warehouse assoc.
good,"Typical day hard work and concentration.I learned communication skills, management very helpful good co-workers very helpful the hardest part was dealing with traffic the most enjoyable part of the day the satisfaction to get the job done on time and safe."
good,"in this place you gotta work at least 10 hours per day, so if you want a job that keeps you away from home for a lot of time this is it."
good,I learned a lot from the company and its presenters. They taught me how to operate the proper machinery to which gets the jobs done. Management was your typical management and the coworkers where very helpful and friendly.
good,At HD Supply I produce work order tickets for the warehouse to pull materials for the fabrication shop to use for fabbing fire sprinkler systems for fire sprinkler contractors. I also procure and purchase any backorder materials which we do not have available in our stock. I also enter stocklists from customers into Hydratec to give sprinkler pipe lengths and specifications to our fab shop for them to be able to fab the materials according to the customers blueprints/plans. I enter quotes with costs for 3 different branches to mark up and send to their customers. I've learned how to do all of these functions while being employed there for the past 9+ years.
good,pulling orders ;driving forklifts all day ;load/unload trucks.
good,"Working on a lot of projects, learning experience, fast past!"
good,Really good place to work. I enjoy the people I work with. The benefits are really good and the pay is justifiable depending on the position you are in. I wish there was more advancement opportunity but there isn't. Many people spend their entire careers here which is why there is really no room for growth.
good,It was fun and productive. You have to work at a quick pace but I see this as a good thing.
good,"Hughes Supply is an old reputable, well established company that was accquired by Home Depot to form HD Supply. Large company but everyone in my department and neighboring departments were like family. I learned a lot about what goes into the different aspects of accounts payable from invoicing to researching reasons why our vendors have not received payment for their services to assisting company employees with their travel & entertainment company cards. Management was always pretty fair. The hardest part of the job is picking up where someone else left off. Not everyone works the same and it's sometimes difficult to complete a task without repeating some steps but the job always got done to the best of my abilty. The most enjoyable part of the day was when branch managers would take the time out to not only thank you, but let your superiors know that your efforts, time and attention to their issue did not go unnoticed."
good,"Helping people avoid contractor problems with 55hr.weeks and 6 1/2 hour days. If not on appointments,helping customers in store and generating leads, while training store associates in lead generating, product knowledge, and Home Services projects. Lots of paperwork and computer time but that and good time management makes more dollars."
good,"Great place, co-workers very helpful, management is good for the most part."
good,Good guys to work with and for.Fast paced fun enviroment but a temporary project unfortunatly.
good,"An average work day is usually begun with taking on will call orders to customers at the start of the day. While also unloading shipping containers of product to be placed out in the yard, warehouse.The difficult part of this job was working against the elements of the weather. It being hot, cold, raining, snowing, you had to be outside and prepared for it."
good,"Busy, challenging, fun, can be cold in winter and hot in the summer. There is always something to do there. Lunch is 45min long which is nice. Holiday pay comes in handy. Longevity of employment runs through that place."
good,"Early start 5am-3pm. Monday-friday  Mostly selling construction supplies, hardware, safety and concrete decor. It's a construction workers go to place for most all materials needed for their job sites. Good management and staff that work hard for long hours daily. Most staff and customers are friendly."
good,"Market pressure is making the consistent demands for increased sales  extremely challenging. Senior management is seldom in place long enough to implement the changes that they promote - sometimes this has been a blessing in disguise. Work weeks are long and while technology is a focus for efficiency - it often gets rolled out poorly. Creating more stress for those mandated to use it."
good,It was stressfull working there you had to go back to the warehose after your first route and get more work which they call sameday routes supervisors have pick there favorites and help dem out more.
good,"Overall very good company, pay is fair for the industry and flexibility of field sales and working remotely. A typical days is to visit 8-10 customers in the field. It is usually a busy day meeting with customers and handling orders and issues."
good,"This is a good company to work for if you are true to your abilities you will achieve!"
good,fast paced place hardly had time to eat. you would learn your way around Houston doing this job and meet great people. really good employees drivers and warehouse people
good,Love the company but there are many gaps and opportunities for improvement they are not fast to recognize or address.  They view their competition as the small guy next door but should recognize the large players who will come for their piece of the pie.
good,Management could be better and treat employees fairly. Hours worked are a little to much for summer time that’s why a second shift should be needed. Times unorganized
good,"HD Supply was an extremely fast paced work environment. The hours are hard to manage, as you never knew exactly how long you would be working day to day. The training was good, and the floor supervision was pretty good as well. The is always room for improvements, but it was a good place for a younger man or women to start a career at."
good,HD Supply has many dedicated employees who make it their mission to provide its customers with quality merchandise and outstanding customer service.  The associates are what makes this a great company.
good,"good management. a lot of movement available between department if you want to get your feet wet in a new field of the business. "
good,"Typical days are fast-paced, from start to end.  This is the true meaning of a team orientated environment; accordingly, outstanding leadership is always appreciated.  There are so many key takeaways from my experience with HD Supply, and my favorite saying is: ""Always Take The High Road."""
good,"HD Supply was a standard warehouse job. Hard, tedious, boring work, with sufficient pay. The management was stern without being overbearing, vacation and holiday time was scarce."
good,"Worked there during a time of much consolidation and change, and got caught up in job elimination.  Otherwise, company was a good place to work--they invested in facilities and training."
good,"Easy work,very fair at accommodating employees when they can.They have a decent pay wage for qualified individuals with fair benefits.good at practicing safety."
good,"Advancement for those that really worked at it. Associates were great., just wanted to be treated with respect and rewarded. Had to be careful who to trust. Not everyone who said they supported you actually did. When things get tough they bailed."
good,"With people and the right software in place to schedule out projects and manage day-to-day workflows, HDS was very routine-based. While there were opportunities to contribute on cool, one-off type projects from time-to-time, the majority of work was anticipated and predictable. Career growth was a concern. Management was very status-quo, particularly after the business went public."
good,Very easy environment to work in for the most. I learned how to operate machines. Improved working well with others over the course. Hardest part of the job was earning respect & being treated as an equal. Most enjoyable part of is the awesome personalities. Management overall is was decent can always improve but overall they did teach me a lot that I forever thank them
good,Very Lively with some great people. Basic warehouse functions performed along with customer service relations and Maintenance.
good,Prepare mail to be delivered to rural areas in south weber and west haven. I had to sort and also deliver mail. You get to work your own schedule and when you are done you get to go home.
good,"I was a truck driver delivering water work supplies to customer construction work site."
good,"I would come in ant 8:50 a.m. to start my shift at 9:00 a.m."

good,"Quality Teammates , Good Structure In Company, General Day Was Call Center Setting , 70 To 100 Calls A Day, Certain Aspects Are Graded , Very Great Training Classes."
good,"•Full cycle of wire payments, receiving, posting and reconciling"
good,"Fast pace environment, Job security, Full time Benefits. You will be working anywhere between 8 to 12 hour days. It is a pick and pack fulfillment center. Management is easy to get along with, but the hardest part is getting use to the long hours. This is not for everyone, after awhile you feel like you are not getting enough home time. On the other hand the company is striving. Looking to improve in all aspects of the field."
good,Good place to work. Learned a lot about the construction industry and the distribution of the items needed in order to complete under ground utility production.
good,"I felt very confident and satisfied with my performance at the end of the day. I knew i was good at what i did however the people on the inside never got to witness my dilligence and devotion and unfortunately my fellow peers in the warehouse had no say so. I was laid off due to market conditions at the time, they have not fulfilled my position as of today."
good,"I enjoy this company, however I am seeking a professional career that will allow for rewarding and long-term growth opportunities within the company."
good,"Loading, unloading, order pulling, shipping, returns, forklift & deliveries. Receiving, fill orders, sell supplies. I enjoy inventory management."
good,HD Supply was a wonderful company treated employees equal and fair. Never did i feel out of place or that i couldn’t be myself. I would advise anyone who wants a job with HD Supply
good,"This job is in the town I live in, which makes the commute fairly easy. Very nice and quiet place, which is great for focus. People are fairly friendly and respectful to each other."
good,"I liked working at HD Supply, One of the best companies I’ve work for. I worked a various departments. I started as a stocker then moved to inventory then to sales and finally to tool rental, the only reason I left is because I moved. Definitely would go back to work for HD Supply."
good,I enjoyed working for this company the people in the work place are nice people.. The supervisors are great the location was in a nice area. I recommend this place of business
good,"Better than average income, must be a self motivator, clean driving record, training in areas of safety, as well as federal guidelines. Driving 24 ft box trucks,customer service skills needed.."
good,It’s a job for a person that’s out of work and needs to start for steady pay and need benefits. It’s an alright job; they pay every two weeks. No union.
good,Great Company to work for with room for advancement through out the company. Management has improved through out the time I was with the company. Compensation and benefits are great.
good,Need to work on the branch management position the present one gas no clue how to run a branch or deal with people especially employees and assistant managers
good,HD Supply has a great company culture. However for being such a large company; they have not done very well in utilizing systems and setting up data to be easily used to perform analysis.
good,HD Supply is a great place to look for materials for your home improvement needs. Working there gives you an opportunity to learn the housing and construction industry.
good,Unload freight from truck to the floor and separate in order. Break down product and match to verify order. Be ready to work in any position though out the day. The management plays favoritism in the workplace for advancement. The hardest part of the job is being under staff and working long hours. Your allow to work at a decent control pace.
good,"HD Supply Waterworks (HDSWW) acquired my former employer company, RAMSCO, in April 2011 after I had worked for RAMSCO from March 2005 progressing through various promotional positions.  For the most part the acquisition went well for most employees including myself.  However, in 2014 HDSWW eliminated my position. HDSWW is a very good company with excellent opportunities for individual professional growth."
good,Good work environment. Management was fair. Many chances for advancement. I learned many skills while working at HD Supply. Benefits were not so good.
good,"Its not a bad place to work. It can be frustrating when irate customers are mean. Management is okay, some much better than others. Great educational opportunities after a year with the company. Tuition assistant program. and completely free if attending Ashford University. The best part about the job is that they will have great celebrations during the holiday's, customer service week and other corporate events"
good,"After the portfolio settled with the IPO and divestitures, not a bad place to work.  Lots of good people.  High targets and expectations as with most public companies."
good,"Good place to work. Good environment. Free lunches, most of the time. Co-workers are cool. Mostly good attitudes. Management is very laid back. Compensation was reasonable."
good,Good job to work for plus great benefits.Fast pace environment at times.Mangers are pretty far for the most part and eight hours or less but you can get more if you want.
good,I was a temp so my situation was different from the permanent employees. The company overall was good to work for. All employees received a box lunch from Panera for Thanksgiving.
good,"Great staff low pay good work environment management is very supportive and promotes advancement and encourages it company is growing they have a good benefits package but do not pay well enough for you to take advantage of it, they do not provide enough sick days either."
good,"coworker just like family that's what keep everyone up and going each and everyday, production stop for about n3 to 4 months  then started back up from 35 to 50an hour, however packing can be very challenging meaning ea. tote can needs special care like plaint, liquid, usual spate size item that need special  care are a dertain size box."
good,"Its a good job if you're just starting out in the work force; however, the working conditions aren't the most helpful when it comes to having to be productive. The building, during summer, is extremely hot. Overall, I enjoyed working here."
good,Great environment  really no complaints about the company except the lack of advancement. The company is a good one to work for and gain some valuable experience.
good,"After Maintenance Warehouse was purchased, the company went went through a lot of changes, from a Home Depot owned business to an IPO with its own brand HD Supply. The Information Technology department was an integral part of these changes, and they provided the growth needed to get into the 21st century and remain an industry leader."
good,"All managers are knowledgeable and willing to train employees. Management is flexible, patient, yet goal oriented. Inglewood branch has a great support system. Quarterly meetings are created for branch performance reviews, and include employee incentives(food is provided). ROOM FOR GROWTH! I seen several people move up the latter!! (Self Included) Service desk is demanding yet rewarding. Worked with homeowners to contractors to investors. Gained indispensable knowledge, experience, and connections."
good,"hd supply/whitecap is a great company with decent pay and great benefits. the down side of the company was the manager. poor managing skills, micro managing, and very poor communication skills"
good,"HD Supply is a competitor to Home Depot, therefore many customers will compare prices and such to our competitor stores. Management will always try to work with other competitors prices so for the costumers that means great business. Management tries to be fair with decision making but sometimes it is not shown to the employees. Some employees will get more credit then others (who do put in work) very often and if your a cashier you will often be underestimated in your knowledge and strength. Undeniably, it's a great company to work for when your a student, so having that said I would recommend for it's flexibility and quick hiring process."
good,I was there over 13 years and I loved working there. I think I was under paid because there were people I trained who made more money than me. I think I was there about 5 years before I started making $10 hour.
good,"You won't find any ping pong tables here; this is definitely an only-school, no-nonsense office.  But, with high turnother advancement is readiy available--if you can out-compete your peers.  After a move from California to Georgia, many of the teams are now very young.  Most of the management are former Home Depot, so that mentality is very prevalent thorough the company."
good,"Nice place to work. Good work/life balance. Independence and team attitude. Management is open minded and do not micro manage. Not a lot of room for advancement,"
good,"HD Supply is a great place to work. There are several facets in the organization, allowing for advancement and growth in many directions. The managers at HD Supply have a sense of entitlement and have more of a closed door mentality than open door."
good,"Everybody wants to be the ""lead guy"" and managers play favorites. Outside of that the company is an amazing job. Direction can lack at times but its expected you find appropriate work."
good,We had to give 110% every day and night to make sure our customers were happy we usually worked 10-11 hour shifts because of the amount of work we took on daily I learned a lot about safety and using the forklifts properly from our management I also learned how to communicate with my co workers in a loud environment and work as a team even on those hard days the best part about the job was knowing we did everything we could to get it done on time and also hearing our customers thank us meant a lot.
good,Was a interesting job. Work place has mostly male employees. Small warehouse that provided commerical and residencial contractors material for their jobs. A lot to first learn if you never have done inside sales and sales for the outside sales reps.
good,"the work is hectic at times 90% of the time, requiring attention and product knowledge."
good,"Day at work busy to get products to customers. Hardest part of job is driving through Houston TX."
good,"The work environment is excellent and my coworkers are fun to work with. I enjoy working for this company, brand new trucks. The hardest part of the job is that you have to load your own truck"
good,"The warehouse is my main job function and I really enjoy receiving, inventorying, and storing merchandise in the warehouse."
good,"Workload is significant, but the company encourages associates to learn new skills and new technology.  Change is constant, both in technology and leadership, with the next big thing on the horizon at all times.  The ability for many jobs to work remote for some part of the week is a great perk. Health benefits are not up to par."
good,I have been with this company for over 16 years and have enjoyed coming to work everyday.  I enjoy being able to have worked in various departments and gaining knowledge of the business.
good,Team was intelligent and fun to work with.  Good work life balance. Good senior leadership. I learned a lot while i worked here.
good,"First work on emails,corporate and customer calls,pick orders,cycle counts,credits, faxing,filing,coping,typing,picking,organizing,multitasking."
good,In charge of helping walk in customers with their plumbing needs.  I would help plumbing contractors with bids on their upcoming projects.
good,"typical day at work would be going on register and providing customer service and satfiying the customers with there purchases, also provide a fast check out service."
good,"You do not get any benefits if you work part-time. Only the full timers get paid holidays, sick days, and insurance. You deal with customers 100% of the time. You must provide exceptional customer service."
good,As a greeter I am the first person that customers will greet. I always try to mantain a smile on my face everytime I greet a customer. Mantain my calm when I get a rude customer and simply not answer back.
good,"It was a hard work but with the good traning I got ,I caught on really fast."
good,"Driver,load and onload merchandise,keep my place to work clean and good conditions"
good,What I Learned from this Job. Most of all stay focus which is on all of Job Sites. Being a Cherry Picker Operator/ Operator also stay safe on the Job we all will go home the same way we came in without getting hurt on a piece of Equipment/ Safety Hazards. Everyone will have a blessed & prospective Day working with me.. The hardest part of that job for me was lifting A/C units five times bigger than I. The Most important of that job was finishing the job up getting the work done and spend the rest of my night with my family.
good,"I learned a lot about facilities maintenance and the multi-family industry. A lot changed once company went public, and I don't think for the better."
good,fun with associate and company meetings . learn different jobs and time management

good,My co-workers were the best.  I had several job duties and was able to work independently of everyone.
good,"Company was poorly managed in my opinion, Absentee management. Otherwise great job that paid well."
good,"For the must part I liked working here. My co-workers are good people. Management is so so, must - 90% are not willing to ""rock the boat"" when need be..."
good,You will be puched pushed and pushed more till they can`t get anything else out of you. You never get a good job!
good,"nice place to work, and learn just dont get your hopes up with this place"
good,"Very hard to advance to higher positions.  Its a customer service based company. If you like customer service, this is the job for you. "
good,It's a decent place to start off if your new to the work field.
good,mostly consisted of blueprint takeoffs for contractors for doors and windows while learning the mechanicals also
good,A typical day consisted of completing requests to set up new users in various databases.
good,"Great company and job. All of there promised deliverables to customers after I sold were short of expectation. I was working on a 100% commission job with great potential. Unfortunately the high priced items that I was selling, (roofing, siding) required home improvement loans from potential customers, which in the current housing and business environment are not available. I sat in front of many clients who needed the services but could not qualify for loans."
good,"delivering supplies to diffrent work sites.I enjoy my co-workers and driving,learning diffrent routes and job sites."
good,"My typical day was spent communicating over the phone or in person with contractors, vendors and shipping companies. Following up to make sure materials were shipped correctly and on time was paramount to ensure success was achieved. I learned to work autonomously and efficiently within a team structure to meet goals."
good,"when i first started working there i really liked it, but then thinks started to change when they started bringing in new managers every month."
good,"Nice, relaxed place to work. Management is pretty understanding and the pay is pretty good. I would like to grow in this company but I'm on 3rd shift right now so it's small. I like going to work but I'm hoping I can make it a career!"
good,Data entry of orders
good,I enjoyed working at HD Supply because it was an easy job. I was able to use my skill set and contribute to the company in other ways as well. I would definitely work for HD Supply again.
good,HD Supply is a good company to work for. Pay is fair. Their vacation package is awesome. The management was good for the most part. It’s not a bad job at all. But they take their driving safety very seriously and will let you go in a heartbeat over it. They have cameras in the truck facing you and the road they have sensors on the truck. That was probably the worst thing about the job it was like somebody constantly watching you.
good,"Not a bad company to work for."
good,Good place to work with a great team with vast knowledge. Good and fair management as well. There is plenty to learn but they are fair and patient teachers (most of the time).
good,Trucks was always late delivering product so I had to do 5 to 6000 pounds twice a day sometimes three times a day because I had to do the warehouse workers work and unload the trailers before I started my  route So by the time I got out to route I was tired And frustrated Plus the GPS and computer system they use the tireless didn’t work properly so I was always questioned on why I did this and that but I always compete in my deliveries
good,"Need better pay.  Cost of living is high, benefits and taxes kill your paycheck each week...........................company is  a great place to work."
good,"Has a lot of potential and is growing in the right direction. Feels like upper management really cares and is available. New building is amazing and creates a great physical environment. Growth has a bit of a downside as many elements are trying to come up with the next big idea and they are still working to come up with the best management structures and systems to handle things the best way. Pay scale is on par, but incentive, bonus and vacation time could be improved."
good,Great benefits. Fast and producive pace facility. If you are able to work out in warehouse in hot and cold weather this is the place to be. Very busy warehouse.
good,Great people at HD Supply to work with!  Compensation and benefits needs to be worked on a bit but work life balance is awesome!  All around great place to work!
good,"starting the day with unloading of the supply truck and receive that product, then pick orders and load up the truck for the days deliveries.  Put the remaining stock away."
good,I was sad to leave but unfortunately my position was no longer available. I enjoyed working will all of the staff at the New Braunfels Contact Center.
good,"With everyday dealings with customer's, no 2 days are ever alike.  You build a strong bond with your regular customers. With every job, you have bad days and you have good, it is all about how you react and adjust in changing the bad to good."
good,It's a great place to work and people a fun to work with.  Have to be able to multi task since it's a small location.  They look out for their own.  Good group of people.
good,Great customer base and industries served that make the job rewarding. Most people have customer service as their number one goal in the organization.
good,The culture at the 27610 location is friendly and welcoming. The pay is substandard and there is little room for advancement if any at all. I would still work there if it paid better.
good,I came from another employer when I hired on at HD supply and it was the best thing that ever happened to me. I learned so much about shipping and receiving and working with third party shippers. This job made me push myself to the ultimate goals that I wanted to achieve. Best company ever!
good,"a fun place to work,if you have grown kids,or kids of no school age."
good,Get to meet new people across the U.S great atmosphere. Get to travel different places around the U.S. great learning exp.
good,Responsibilities included loading and unloading truck and delivering merchandise to the customers and return all merchandise that not delivery back to the warehouse.
good,Opportunity to work with 8 great employees managing inventories and working with vendors for best programs and prices to drive profitablility
good,"A warehouse isn't necessarily the best place to work if one is looking for a challenging job. Although, depending on what part of the warehouse you are in, it may be physically challenging. It's not an overly exciting place and the environment is basically work, work, work. But I did enjoy the attitudes of the employees i worked with even though a lot of us were doing different jobs while still interacting with each other. Even though, in a warehouse, the work is fast paced and pretty much non-stop, there was a sort of laid back and relaxed hard working attitude where we, as employees could do work but also communicate in an open environment. The same can't necessarily be said sitting behind a desk."
good,"For the most part i worked by myself but the times I had to work with others, they were good and easy to work with. The management was  well run but the advancement in the job did not offer much. The pay could have also been higher."
good,Conveying Team work by helping other departments finish their work load. Learn something new everyday from computer skills to warehouse duties. Management has a great open door policy. Co-workers can distract you at times but do convey the team work needed by helping each other with any task.Trying to avoid the negative Work politics would be the hardest part of the job. Getting the work completed and feeling accomplished is the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,This job can be fun and rewarding depending on your co-workers.  Each branch is run like an individual business with minimum support from the corporate level. The opportunity to advance can be difficult if you're not willing to relocate. Bonuses are possible if your branch is performing well.
good,"A good place to work if your a manager looking for advancement and good pay. Life/work balance is not the best, but you are compensated for it."
good,"Unload trucks, verify orders, put freight away, pull orders, and load trucks. Learned how to receive freight. Upper management was very helpful. Friendly and helpful. Unloading trucks in bad weather. Freedom to learn new things."
good,"Busy to no so busy days"
good,"After we clock in we stretch as a group to reduce injury. We then get our tools such as our headset, harness and equipment. I learned how to be more effective when picking. How to palletize and be more productive. All of my co-workers are very competitive so its fun to see who comes out on top."
good,At my first years there one of the most exciting time in my sales career ever. Had much success and found the later years when company went public that it would never be that same that it was as when I joined.
good,"Enjoyed assisting customers. Providing info on products, making sales and the variety of tasks. Part of Management was somewhat rude thus resulting in indifferent employees towards their work, lack of motivation,and customers not coming back. I learned more patience and to keep a professional attitude over all. The hardest part of the job was meeting the weekly quota of cabinet sales, but i knew every week was different and I just had to do all thats possible in my part. Challenging myself was a good practice."
good,A typical work day was getting your equpiment whether cherry picker or forklift and just go to work. It was real laid back really no pressure at all you could just prettty much work at your own pace.
good,"Team Oriented"
good,Normal work days are good place to work at. I learn new things when I was working their.Management was okay on some days they didn't look over shoulder when u were doing your job.
good,Coworkers are kind and helpful. Great place to work for. A little unorganized
good,"I have a wonderful five year experience with HD Supply. They are a great company to work for. They encourage and nuture internal growth within the company so advancement is available if your willing to put in the work. They also take pride in all that they do, so if you are a person of excellence, you'll want to work there. They have great benefits and profit sharing."
good,"Growing company with great liquidity but lacking talent management. Constrained with many traditional, middle-level managers. Encourages employees to acquire professional certifications and degrees--will not reimburse certifications but will support educational development. No additional compensation for completion of higher-level education, even when privately funded. Not a forward-thinking, innovative firm. Very traditional and hierarchical with little responsiveness to ideas such as S&OP and a Vendor Management Program. Slow to match business model with strategy and keep up with growth. However, the employees are wonderful."
good,Typical day was plain out hard work fro pulling orders to making deliveries to ruff job sites. Co-workers was the best part of the job they could always make me smile.
good,"The people are solid, company is there for its employees. And while a corporation each branch still feels kinda like a mom and pop place."
good,as been a great place to work where ppl can come in and find what they want to by and tell there stores to employers
good,"Busy, busy. Lots of materials to learn and move"
good,"Productive and fun place to work, great communication with Supervisors and Associates."
good,Ran daily reports to identify critical out of stock items for 10 buyers.
good,Excellent place to work if you want to learn. Fast paced customer oriented. Long hours. great management.
good,"Work your area properly you will be recognized "
good,"Very Busy, fast pace. Management very close to one another. Learned a lot of things by working hard. Lots of training at the beginning but it's all worth it."
good,This place is ok its a full time job since i started here it's been long shifts but more pay can't really complain about it. Management kind of sucks... Since a whole lot of favoritism going on here but that's my opinion
good,"Loved the company, excellent benefits. Great company atmostphere. Branch manager was arrogant and demeaning to everyone including customers.   I left because of him. If not for him I would still be there."
good,It was an good place to work but the general manager was making rules that was not in the hand book. Good coworker  The manage when I was there was great he provided as with water every day an sometime Breakfast b4 we  left out for the day.
good,I did not have the help that was needed I worked a lot of hours the manager was a very good person but I could have used his backing more of the time overall it was a good company to work for.
good,"Based in Altanta GA, HD Supply White Cap is a leading supplier of building materials for medium-to-large contractors with stores throught the US and Canada. Good work life balance."
good,"Great Organization, fast paced with all types of latest technologies.  The organizational culture is geared toward overall wellness and work-life balance.."
good,"I have worked for HD Supply in 2 different divisions and love it here. The most enjoyable part of the job(s) has been the teamwork, and the management. I would recommend working here."
good,"I learnt a lot because I was given the freedom to take a risk, which subsequently paid off as I was able to showcase my innovation side. The environment was very friendly and the Managers proved to be by an average mark emotionally intelligent, and open minded"
good,"Building relationships and helping customers with solutions."
good,The people and management were great. I had an understanding manager who was able to discuss challenges and decisions with the team. I would have stayed if they weren't downsizing.
good,Very active paced business for both associate level and managerial level. Monday through Friday work hours. Shifts starting at 5:30 am to 11:30 am. Work area's are clean to insure a safe work environment.
good,Working at H>D was a great place to work. Being a route driver is like Being your own boss. As Long as you make timely delivery you will have no issue. And we where free to make up own route. As long as we made timely delivery and also avoided traffic
good,"HD Supply is a fast pace workplace, hours were good 9-6, good work environment, great moral, pay was a low (8 yrs ago), but I enjoyed working there..."
good,"The environment requires you to stay on stop of every single item. When customers come in, when the phone rings and when emails are sent. We are required to do more. The work environment is great. Great crew. But need more employees."
good,staff and employee are great. everyday is a new challenge in work and the best part is that it a growing company that will always have advancement.
good,I loved the environment of working here the staff was nice the management was kind and we received breaks and lunch accordingly. The down fall of working here is that you have to deal with rude customers.
good,"This position was an Outside Sales Position, in Seatlle. I traveled all over the state to provide service to several hotes. Travel out of state was included as well. The hardest part of this job was traffic, outside of that it was an enjoyable position."
good,I have enjoyed the past 10 years with this company but feel I have moved into the wrong direction with my career. Other than that the people are easy to work with and benefits are great.
good,"I was treated fairly, unfortunately my job was eliminated."
good,"Schedule your own day, meet with customers and help solve problems through new ways of thinking.  Work with co workers to develop new strategies and how to work opportunities together."
good,"This company gave me the opportunity to learn about warehouse equipment and material handling equipment - something I had never done before.  Worked with a variety of vendors from office supplies, hardware, software, MRO products, safety supplies for both associates and warehouses.  Extremely diverse experience."
good,"There was never a dull day at HD Supply.  You were either working on a project, seeking out a project or traveling to bid on a project.  I learned so much from this company.  This is where I learned how to do procurement and project management.  I managed and supported the whole Southwest region including Las Vegas, and Hawaii.  I think the hardest part was getting all of the sales reps on board on how the process was on bidding a project with me.  I was the main contact.  Once everyone was on the same page we were out there in field bidding and sealing deals all over my territory.  I exceeded plan year over year."
good,A Regular day at HD. well there is no such thing as a regular day. there s always something that pops up. Everyday at h d is alays remembered.
good,"supportive management"
good,"Fun work environment, weekends off and holidays, great benefits,"
good,A typical day would be ensure that all orders are selected and shipped out properly in a fast pace environment. You will definite get your exercise.
good,fun and friendly place to work supervisors are well informed and helpful
good,"good enviroment"
good,"Overall, I had a very good experience working there. It was physically demanding but it was a pretty good work environment."
good,"Fast paced job, constantly on the go."
good,Great place to work and co-workers were very friendly.  The customers I interacted with were also very friendly.  Management was not the best but they tried.
good,"A very easy going place to work, good people just not a lot of room to move up. Very easy to get complacent if you are not motivated. Down side is many co-workers take advantage of the company's lack of supervision like long breaks, 2 hour lunches, general waste of time around the “water cooler”."
good,"In charge of the branch operations of the store, inventory, purchasing and what comes in and ships out of store. I work with some great guy's who strive to be the best."
good,"Good company. Good employees. It can get hectic at times, but the pay is exceptional. Shift times may vary depending on what has to be shipped and the quanity of shipments."
good,The overall work environment is great but management could do a lot better. Promotions are not based on skill but by how they feel about the individual.
good,"There's all kinds of work opportunities at this company. If you do your job each day faithfully and keep a positive attitude, you'll never have to worry about getting fired. HD Supply is Hugh on safety and personal development. The 5-S inspections and cleaning are a little over the top sometimes and can distract from doing your job. You will have the opportunity to learn and cross train but the cross training to me has never been enough to actually have anyone doing any body's job should they get sick and bed ridden. The problem has simply been not enough workers to train to have others cover for them while they train someone else, and the trainee not having someone to cover for him or her while being trained. It's kind of a paradox because of not having enough personal in each department. Now overall the company is a pretty good culture and management is decent. I am no longer employed there anymore but I was employed for 14 years on that job. The only elephant in the room that I feel is a queezy situation with HD is not seeing much of anyone of color in upper management or supervisory positions. Now to be fair, that's only what I've seen at the Marietta facility but, since I've been gone things could have changed. I can't speak for the other facilities in other locations. But overall for 14 years HD Supply has been a very nice place to work at. If you get the job you'll never have to worry about losing the job unless you have a lousy work ethic and a bad attitude. You'll never be asked to lift anything that's heavy that may threaten your safety and health. HD Supply is Hugh"
good,"help to keep healthy with gym room"
good,I really loved the job and management also all the employees that work there. It was a Monday threw Friday job which I loved because it gave me a chance to be with my family. There was always incentives going on there at work from getting samples from vendors or free lunches also.
good,The position was created due to a stiff working environment and personality challenges. The Director was in Florida and need on sight management. If was a good place to work
good,Busy and fast paced. Enjoyed working with many great people. Learned a lot of new skills. Associates are willing to help other associates to make the job easier.
good,"I was just beginning to really get the hang of my position when i was laid off and my job moved.  I liked the management, co-workers and the job I was doing.  I was not able to relocate to Chicago or Georgia so I was laid off."
good,Had to help with other workers a lot because I always get finish fast I kept myself together and helped the team like I was supposed to. It's a great job and career.
good,Your not micro managed.  IF you have any questions or issues.  Everyone on your tell is willing to help you understand.  Hardest part is when processes change.  Some associates don't get the memo.
good,"One must be fluid, willing and adaptable for change.  Must be able and willing to get dirty. There are constant interruptions, one must be able to multitask effectively."
good,"Although this job was fast paced, the environment and relaxed. Everyone worked as a team to get the job done. If natural disasters happened, you were expected to work overtime."
good,"I was excited about working for this company in the beginning because I felt it would give me a place to grow and make a career.  Unfortunately this was not the case.  I have showed up, and no one took notice.  This particular site is about who you know and how close you are.  Everyone in office is comfortable and the outside workers are not in advancement status as far as I have been treated. "
good,"This is a great place to work, however once you hit a certain position, it is difficult to advance in to a higher position. The atmosphere is very relaxed."
good,They have good benefits. They pay everybody different. I came in with experience & was told my pay was do to my experience. I spoke with quiet a few people who were paid more than me with & with out the experience. They are like any other jobs where you have to be close with someone to promote within the company.
good,"Well basically we start at 6:00 am load our truck. usually it take from a hour and a half to two hours to load, depending on if every thing in our loading area is in place. Now sometimes things aren't in place and this could be the hardest part of our job trying to find those items. The guys are usually friendly and great to be around. The management team are close by just in case we need help or assistance. The most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with our customer. They're like family. We get a chance to talk and get to know them as a family members. And meeting new people every now and then is very exciting to me as driver. I love meeting people it's one of my greatest gift. I guess you can say I'm a people person."
good,"Meet new people all the time, mostly inbound and walk ins. Sell sell sell is what it is all about working for them. Not a bad thing because everyone comes to you."
good,A great place to work for for career advacement.  Great opportunities and benefits.  A good work envirnment.  Wish there was more training and understanding.
good,"There’s different departments in a warehouse , I liked my department me because wen we work as a team we got a lot done . I can’t speak for other departments but overall HD Supply was a interesting job"

good,Miss working there everybody was nice and like family was just hard in winters and summers with warehouse had no heat or air in side besides that was a nice place to work
good,HD Supply bought the company (Creative Touch Interiors) just after I started. Went through an SAP implementation. Lots of unknowns. The housing market crashed while I was there.
good,"nhot a bad job very hot place to work fast pace work area,"

good,"Great place to work with great coworkers. Everyday, you will learn something new from your supervisor."
good,"Work throughout the day was pleasant, friendly staff, accommodates needs. Good training service, both in the warehouse and retail store. Many was to expand on growth in the company"
good,I learned a great deal working for HD Supply.  People are best part of working at HD Supply.  can't afford to get sick though as benefits make it impossible to get any affordable health care.
good,"It was a good experience to work at this company.. People are very good, knowledgeable and competent in their work area. They have flexible hours and comparable work ethics."
good,"HD Supply is one of the leaders in the industrial, safety and construction supply segment. A fast paced environment  operating around a core set of values focused on customer service and satisfaction. Providing daily opportunity to learn many valuable aspects of the industry such as customer and vendor relations, the sourcing and pricing of a vast array of products and services. You are part of a work place culture that strives for professionalism and accountability as well as a sense of accomplishment in the ability to provide solutions to an ever changing variety of customer needs."
good,"I enjoy working for this company. Associates are treated fairly.The benefits that are provided are excellent. As with any job, it is what you make of it. Opportunities in my present location are limited."
good,"Great experience always busy great benefits. Good pay. Great 401 k . Very productive. Allot of overtime"
good,My original position was field intern. My daily activities were loading and unloading trucks as well as pull up orders and warehouse cleaning. In only one month I got switch to inside sales and was already helping the branch manager with warehouse arrangements.
good,"Call center environment. Inbound calls from customers with accounts."
good,My manager was great with me and taught me everything she did along with my own work so I could assume her role if it was ever necessary. Would be happy to work there again if the opportunity arose.
good,this company was self centered on the management they were always late or short on the product so when we delivered it we were short which caused us to get yelled at by customer
good,"Lots of drama, but good benefits and lots of overtime available."
good,"the benefits are great and overtime always available, warehouse is not heated or cooled so you have to be able to work in it. Can get very hot and cold"
good,"I enjoyed the purchasing with the company. I enjoyed working with most of the people. However, it lacked communication internally. We ran out of stock, but our system inventory said otherwise. Never could get to the bottom of the problem even letting the branch manager know there was a problem with material being lost."
good,I have not worked here in a long time.  I enjoyed my time as a warehouse worker there wit the positive team.  I transferred to the Corporate office in San Diego.
good,This company is very generous with the balance between work and home life. Typical day is busy and there is a lot to learn about the industry so it is what you make it.
good,"HD is a solid company with people who know what their doing, from upper management to lower level analysts."

good,Good pay good hours flexible schedule. Comfortable environment and good working place. Ability to apply to different departments if available. Good management and food for meetings
good,HD SUPPLY started out as a family owned company that kept true to their values of customer satisfaction and the great treatment of their employees. I would say its the best company I've ever worked for before it was sold.
good,A lot to learn. Good people to work with. Wish pay was better. Rumors being tossed around about being for sale. But really good job security everybody needs water.
good,"Great Family Life Balance, lots of autonomy within the job. This job is for a self-starter because there is not a lot of support from upper management on working through some of the processes."
good,"* Very fast paced. "
good,This company has a lot to offer any individual that is passionate about work and making a difference.  They are in a very competitive industry and always improving on past performance.  The vision of the company is set on long term success.  They are always seeking great individuals and training to always improve productivity.  It is a pleasure to be a part of this organization.
good,Working busy all day is enjoyable for me. I've learned a lot from this company in the field of accounts payable. My supervisor is very supportive. My co-workers were all good working with them as a team.
good,This company was the start of me becoming a sales rep. The manager was someone who gave me the opportunity to become a sales rep to build the relationships between the company and the customer
good,"very good company to work for. good structure and very good work and life balance. it's good for someone who needs work and life balance, but not good for someone who look for career advancement"
good,Enjoyed working with Branch and Middle management to insure that policies and procedures were being followed.  Also enjoyed updating ERP system.
good,"HD Supply is a good company to work for. They are trying to change many things at the present time making the company and culture there challenging and changing, but in the end it will be for the better of the company and their associates, customers, and shareholders."
good,"A typical day at work to me is doing your job right and getting everything done in time ."
good,it is a great place to work. The people here are amazing and the bosses are great. There is a lot of physical work at this location but i love it
good,I really enjoyed working in this company. Coming to work was fun. My coworkers were great team players. I felt like Management had my back by offering all kinds of Health benefits and Stay Healthy incentives.
good,"Air conditioned facility with pool table, basketball hoop, several break rooms with flat screen TV's, computer lab, exercise facility onsite, and many more amenities that make this an ideal company to work for. The downside is the pay, but the amount of paid sick, floating holiday, personal and vacation days make it a little easier to take the average pay wage. Overall it is a stress free work environment with nice management and co-workers. Not much room for advancement because pretty much all the jobs pay the same."
good,"It was a very good experience to work for this company, I learned a lot and met a lot of very nice hardworking people and got a lot of overtime but in the end I just wasen't making enough money."

good,"The HDSupply is fully Process oriented company, they are masters in follow the process."
good,"Transfered from Home Depot to Usa bluebook in receiving department. Process was out dated, management were fair, loved all of my co workers. Company did a lot of cool things and were family oriented. Got fired cuz I had two full time jobs and was late a few times. Overall was the best warehouse job I ever had and would go back if I could."
good,"HD Supply was a great place to learn and grow.  Very fast past work but exciting.  I learned a lot about Excel, Word and Powerpoint."
good,Company is great! I enjoy working here. A great work environment.
good,"Enjoyable place to work, Management is great, and I love working with the customers."
good,"Good company, bad employee! Not only the part but the part numbers.Was lost in the hustle and bustle of making money at work and home.Some were lacking skills others were lacking knowledge which made it hard to get someone to help you.Was when I had to say bye  because of people doing what they wanted too do. Seeing the customer happy because you gave your all to help them."
good,This is fast paced environment that is always changing. There is always someone willing to help you and teach you.
good,"Management is fair and balanced, great group of people to work with."
good,"HD Supply has given me so many opportunities to develop as a creative professional that literally, the first word that came to my mind about this company and my experience working for them was thankful. The culture has remained exactly what i look for in a work environment. Its laid-back, collaborative, and fresh, but most importantly, ambitious. Simply put, I've really enjoyed the five plus years that I've been with HD Supply and if it wasn't for my own yearning to step out of my comfort zone to experience new surroundings and advance my career, I'd have no qualms with continuing my work at HD Supply."
good,"HD Supply was a competitive wild west where each day you had to compete via service and price with multiple suppliers. The company supplied great training and support for its salespeople. The successful hunter/salesman not only maintained relationships with old customers, but daily had to pursue and acquire new ones. Had the market not nose-dived in '08 I would have stayed in that line of work."
good,"Typical day is very early in the morning. Preparing my register making sure i have all the essentials I need. "
good,"This was a demanding & very busy position. I really loved this workplace however when Home Depot bought Williams Bros. as HD Supply, they quickly closed all locations."
good,"Always something to do."
good,HD Supply is filled with management from GE and shares a similar management style.  You are pushed to help grow the company as well as your own career aspirations.
good,"Running a sales route calling on apartment complexes selling over 37,000 maintenance parts."
good,Generally a overall good place to work and grow from. Provided me with opportunites to showcase my knowledge in the Do it yourself genre of business
good,"typical day starts with Phone calls and SLA tickets resolving. "
good,"I worked for HD Supply for more than 14 years and they always treated everyone with respect, high regard for family. HD Supply always looked for better benefits for their employees. Great company. Typical day at work was satisfying, meeting deadlines on time. High moral. I learned how to be a better manager. I came to this company already knowing the product. Learning more about computers would have to be the hardest part. Traveling was the most enjoyable part."
good,"I typically start my day at 5 am. Get in, get my product and start putting it away.  During the day I may have to execute some or all of the activities listed above.  If there is only one thing I could take away from this job it would be how I have become better at time management.  My direct superiors are amazing people and I will hate  leaving them.  I don't want to leave this job, I like the work and I like the company.  My problem is due to the lack of economic growth, the company can't grow, and thus promotions are lacking.  I am forced to wait for a position to open up in a place I would like to move my family to.   I want to grow in this field and unfortunately I feel as though I have stalled here.  "
good,"Everything about the job was great.Good supervisor good hours,what more could you ask for!"
good,"Always busy, and fun."

good,A typical day @ HD Supply was to monitor other electrical companies credit line and release electrical material based on their payment trends. Collection calls to customers to collect past due invoices and fax/email invoices to them if needed. Was also responsible for reviewing D&B Reports of new customers. Processing payments of customer walk ins and providing them with current statements. On very past due customers we'd send them demand letters and would file liens (when needed) then get them filed with their corresponding counties. I learned how to monitor credit and read business credit reports. I also learned to to secure lien rights and file mechanics liens against businesses. The management consisted of only one credit manager and her boss who was out of state. So I would normally only report to one manager. I really enjoyed working with all my co-workers and had a great friendly relationship with everyone. The hardest part of my job was determining long-term customers that were privileged and allowed extended credit even when past due. The most enjoyable was helping customers stay current and getting the material they needed to complete projects.

good,"HD Supply is a wonderful place to work. I really enjoy going to work, the people are great to work with, life/work balance is important. The only negative I have is the room for advancement.

My average day was simple, I got 2 paid breaks and a lunch break, I got to sit down all day, and I had my own personal work station. My manager was great and really accommodating, the work wasn't too difficult and I had help when I needed it, I can't recommend this job more. It's definitely the best job I've ever worked at. The only thing I could complain about was that you aren't able to use any sick, vacation, or paid time off until your 3 month period, though you were accumulating sick time during that month. However, we did get one free day off we could use whenever we wanted, and lots of paid holidays off, including weekends off."

Day begins at 630a until your route is complete which can range from 130p - 5pm depending on your designated routes customers orders for the day. Management incorporates your ideas if you have any. The environment was great between 9 drivers, lead driver & warehouse supervisor. Hardest part of the job is waking up at 5am. The most enjoyable is freedom when you're on the road delivering to your customers."
good,This company means what they say!!  They are constantly having their vendors come in to the facility to train their agents for product knowledge.  This help the agents feel comfortable in answering questions the customers have while either taking orders or while making that sale.

good,This branch is in a highly competitive market with at least 4 other suppliers within 50 miles. The customers appear to have established relationships with most of the other supply houses leaving HD supply with a tough challenge of breaking into the market.
good,"Refreshing exercise before work during start-up, which is great for the working human body to stay loose.Very valuable information and work skills/habits were available and obtained through hands on training after watching safety videos and tests. The workers there are like one big community that works together. I'd have to say the hardest part of working here is keeping in mind why your here because its so easy to get lost in all the work, which really isn't bad if u like your work. So I guess at the end of the day for me the hardest part of the job makes itself the easiest part of the job."
good,"HD Supply is a great place to work. I really enjoyed going into the office and the people are great to work with. Work-life balance is important to me and they truly offer that at HD Supply. "

good,"I loved  working at hd supply as delivery driver and warehouse worker. When i got to work in the morning i would load my truck for deliveries for the day. When i got back from deliveries i would pull orders for the next days deliveries and stock shelves."
good,Associates at HD are very good to work with. I developed training content for the majority of the day and facilitated training classes on other days. I was constantly learning new things because the system is always changing for the better. I believe that the management does need some work. There is too much leniency with the HR policies and they are not always enforced such as the dress code.

HDS has a strong focus on career development with consistent training, commitment to sales growth through Salesforce reporting and driven goal structure.

The successful merger of Hughes Supply with HD Supply was due to caring leaders.

Stretching associates for their day and training them simultaneously on performance management or benefits programs and was a big hit."

good,I love what I'm doing on a daily basis. My coworkers are amazing. Company has a long history of being in business. I have been with HD for less than a year. But I feel that its hard for me to advance. Also I see some favoritizing from management towards some employees.
good,"I did not get very far into the training process, but the parts that I did encounter were very fun. I enjoyed it mostly because of the fact that I was able to solve problems on my own. Right or wrong I was told to figure out what I should do. My trainer and my co-workers were always by my side, so I would always have resources."
good,I liked working here with my former supervisor. but there wasn't room for growth in the field I working.. plus the working condition  was too hot to manage. but the plus was that my manager at the time was fun to work with..

good,"I absolutely loved working here, even when the original company Water Products was bought out by HD Supply. There were some adjustments that we had to go through, which we were ready for. However, the people and the customers made the job not feel like a job. Each day was a joy and yes at times stressful but we worked as a team. I miss having that tremendously. I would still be there if I hadn't had to take extended FMLA long term. It is hope and desire to find again what I had there. An environment and a job that is as fulfilling as my work with this compamy, employees and its customers."

good,I had the opportunity to work at HD Supply from the time of its separation from The Home Depot to it becoming its own publicly traded company.  It was a terrific opportunity.
good,"Aside from the job scope itself, one factor that significantly influences how employees feel about work is the environment. By work environment, I mean everything that forms part of employees’ involvement with the work itself, such as the relationship with co-workers and supervisors, organizational culture, room for personal development, etc."

My supervisor sits in the lab at all times to help us get through each order.

Gave out breakfast at times, had prizes and snacks. Most drivers were great and helpful. Warehouse workers helped and never complained when you ask them for help. This location was I think the 3rd best location. I quit because I had a better opportunity. Here they just were really picky with OT, sometimes too much hustle while on road and loading truck. Besides that it was great"

good,"Company provides a great culture, work life balance, amazing benefits including discounted stock, great team , fast paced, hardest part of the job is learning the product knowledge"
good,"HD Supply deals primarily with contractors, and many of them are regular customers. While it is good for business, some of them come in with a haughty attitude and think they can push around employees. Unlike many other retail situations, at HD we are not encouraged to deal with customer abuse. I felt confident standing up for myself in any situation, and know that my coworkers and managers would quickly shut down a customer who was acting out of line. "

Get on the road and deliver your product in your assigned route. working at HD Supply did give me a lot of insight on the multi-unit complexes, and how they operate as far as upkeep of the apartments. Also learning about HD Supply itself. HD Supply is a good company, The hardest part of the job is in the morning when you are loading your truck. Knowing the customer base, and knowing where and when to re-route. As for the job itself, it was all enjoyable. Being on the road gives you a feeling of owning your own business."
good,Excellent collaboration workforce in a face paced corporate environment.  Its an awesome place to work.   Most enjoyable part was teaching / training Green and Black belt candidates in Lean Six Sigma methodology.
good,"In my one year with HD Supply FM I have learned so much about business and product management. I was very fortunate to have a manager who trained me very well and gave me opportunities that others in my position were not offered. Those who were in positions above are those who I looked up to everyday. Each merchant was so knowledgeable in their product category and had a concrete understanding of the business and their customers. I learned a lot from each and every one of my coworkers by simply listening to them handle their day to day tasks. A typical day at work was managing and growing the category under me, Paint and Sundries. Those tasks would consist of stats, data management, adding new products, and keeping in touch with my suppliers on new products and marketing opportunities. The hardest part of my job was picking up product knowledge, as I had a minimal understanding of the paint industry, and also learning about business overall. I'd say that while it was difficult to learn how our business operated, I was able to successfully pick up that understanding within the first 4-6 months. The most enjoyable part was the passion that those around me had for their jobs and also the camaraderie that the department had. We were all able to get along so well and my coworkers were on of the main reasons I enjoyed coming into work each and every day."
good,"Met alot of new interesting people, Learned new skills in that Industry which I feel helps me further my career with a new company."
good,"There is no typical work day (good thing) -- there are core duties/tasks that need to be completed throughout the week but everyday is dynamic.

good,"Your everyday is somewhat smooth at times you have to be up and down. You meet new people and even build relationships with some customers, managers are nice the other employees are helpful and if you need anything they can help you. The best part was competing to get item of the week because you got to spin the wheel and get cash. The only thing that sucked was at times it was too slow that you had nothing to do."
