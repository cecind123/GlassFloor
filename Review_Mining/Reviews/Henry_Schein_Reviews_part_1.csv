bad,"Use their workers . No advancement for people of color. No interest in keeping you there long.. you will be replaced by white skin, blonde hair, and blue eyes! But if it still sounds like your boat ride it."
bad,"stressful, negative and very fast paced. The DC is clean and safe but management micromanaging and changing job tasks one hour to the next. No daily structure or consistent work loads and positions."
bad,Not aloud to chat to co workers very military run not interested in any ideas you come up with basically treated like robots .H R dept not interested in your well being and will always support management
bad,"It's a terrible company to work for, they work you like a dog, and you get NO appreciation  for it. Upper management are stuck up and look down at you."
bad,"Management team is easily manipulated, because they dont have the background for managing people."
bad,"All I have to say is, don’t do it. This place is draconian, policy out of date, High Level management  has no respect for lower level employees. I wouldn’t suggest working for this company."
bad,"A lot is promised.  Not all that is promised is what is done.  Buyer beware.  Very little chance for promotion.  Micro Management. Decent starting place, but low wages"
bad,"Managment is clueless, dont pay you for your efforts, they make you feel like trash everyday, your always stressed out, management dont take responsibility for anything"
bad,"While the job itself is easy, the management makes it unbearable. Ridiculously unrealistic standards and angry incompetence pretty much sums them up. Terrible people."
bad,the job was not explained well. yelled at everyday for things I was not told. got written up for things that didn't happen. the kitting department was lazy and always stuck you with the hard work so they could do the easy
bad,"Typically one goes into a company expecting to show their employer what their abilities are and in return get some form of compensation over time."
bad,This was a job I had to take to come off of unemployment.  They did not give me responsibilities that met my abilities even though I asked.  They did put me on the server team w/in 3 months but it was still beneath my ability.
bad,"70 customer calls per day, no support from management, not enough staff to cover total workload, not enough time per day to cover workload, demanded more but did not offer compensation for amount of work expected to accomplish"
bad,"Market: city or cluster of cities"
bad,This was a temporary position as a puller/packer. I was not given sick or vacation time. I was not provided with health insurance. The hardest part of the job was moving all products from one building to another. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was face paced and the work days flew by.
bad,Worked for them for 6 years went know where. Went out of my way everyday to go beyond and above my expectations. Was forced to find other employment after the years of service.
bad,"Henry Schein's  has no idea what they're doing. Employees are underpaid, while others are overpaid. They don't seem to care about your education and skills . Racism is a Plus."
bad,"Not a great place to work, a lot of drama and gossiping from workers right up to management. Several cases of bullying when I worked there but nothing was done about it. Nothing is confidential with certain supervisors/team leaders. Avoid like the plague...."
bad,I have to say I did not like working at Henry Schein at all. The training was very poor and the was a lot of bullying amongst certain members of staff.
bad,"This is by far the worst company I have ever worked for.  The managers treat you like dirt.  The compensation plan is designed in a way so you have no clue how much you will be getting or even if its fair.  The more you sell doesn't mean your compensation will be going up.  special order items are un-orderable since the ""specialist"" doesn't have a clue on how you are suppose to fill out the paperwork.  If you are lucky enough to place an order it take several weeks of going back and forth between the doctor and the ""specialist"".  Half the time the doctor gets too irritated at the time it takes and cancels.  System is setup in a way that makes it difficult to search for items.  "
bad,"management was not very nice to work for"
bad,I worked for this organization for a little over two years before I gladly left the company .  I worked as a warehouse operator in Atlanta and Richmond Virginia.  I must say it was my worst experience working for any organization.  The management is  poor and lack concern for their employees.  They work their employees with little gratitude for their efforts.  They are very disrespectful to employees that they do not like.  The company has benefits but one can hardly afford to have them due to the low pay the warehouse associates make.  If you like the good boy policy then maybe one can survive working for the organization.  If one can tolerate the abuse the management presents to its employees then I say have at it.  Good luck to anyone who works for them.
bad,"Management needs work, understaffed, pay is marginal,no work life balance, expectations dont align, no accountability, needs vast overhaul of processees"
bad,"Very stressful environment with no support for internal staff.  This company runs on blame culture and pressure their staff every minute of every day.  There is never enough staff to carry the departments through day to day tasks and management do not care, they only care about figures and squeezing staff to the point of break"
bad,"Very corporate driven, employees are treated as being very expendable. Training for such a large Fortune 500 company was subpar and unorganized. Management skills were minimal and generally with little to no experience."
bad,".Henry Schein Tech support for Dentrix is sweatshop. You do support so many modules, around 18 modules inside Dentrix. In addition that the services that do not work all the time."
bad,I was an order picker. In this position you are required to work non-stop picking the supply orders. You are told to move faster. Management did a lot of standing around. Management was not willing to listen to the pickers suggestions to make their job more efficient. Pickers were billed and harassed about many things.
bad,The pay is very low but in return you must work hard for that low pay.  Your work effort is calculated by a computer......so in a sense....leads and management rely on computers so they don't actually have to supervise....revolving door basically.
bad,"IT is worst place to work. IT directors do not prefer citizens of this country. Most of the IT jobs you see in their job portal are for Green card processing for their employees.  Please do not waste your time applying in their website. "
bad,"Never worked somewhere so appalling in how it treats its staff. Your just a number and unless your friends with a manager expect to be treated like dirt. Team leaders and managers are the biggest problem that place has. Blame everything on the employees while they do nothing all day but sit on facebook. They dont pay overtime properly and you ll end up significantly short for the year. HR should be sacked, backing up bullies and tyrants. Good luck find any decent new staff, most locals know to avoid now."
bad,"Management kept changing,"
bad,This is not an ideal workplace.  You will not find it fair or compensating.  Bad management all around in this distribution center.  No opportunity for growth unless you are a favorite.
bad,"Les gens disparaissent de là ba du jour au lendemain, système de copinage partout, pression. Certains managers papotent perso entre eux mais sont pas là pour régler tes problème de travail. Après y'a des chèque cadeau pour Noël et des repas de fête dans la cafet, mais ça fait pa tout."
bad,"They have trouble moving forward into the future, won't let go of what used to and no longer works. Management is inconsistent. Perpetuate a culture of fear and bullying. The pay is great but you will earn every dollar."
bad,"Stressful, no loyalty to the employees at all they pick and choose , they kept my raise I was exceeding my productivity did more than my job  they also have a point system for attendance 8 Pts.  I had 2 pts so they say it’s up to your supervisor if he want to give it to you He kept my raise and gave people who had 5 and 6 points raises and wasn’t making production  they pick and choose but every time they get in a bind and need people to stay or need something for and order they called me"
bad,Lies and insecurity - from management - long time employees not valued - they only care about millenials and making money - management keep secrets - communication is terrible
bad,"8 hours a day, learned that sales reps are king, local mgmt great but not allowed to make decisions. Operations was good, enjoyed working w/technicians and installers."
bad,If you're not a foreigner you will get no respect. They focus on hiring foreign people that don't no English well or know how to do the job correctly.
bad,"Management treat you very poorly, pay is awful and you never get recognised unless you are really in with the management. This company used to be a great company to work for and management was approachable and truely cared everyone but now you are only a number and good wage and bonus is only given to management who do nothing but criticise it's staff when everyone works so hard. They will loose a lot of staff"
bad,"The benefits are great but the management is very bad.  They do not follow ethics or morals.  It is a negative environment on a daily basis, micromanaged and there are favorites.  I would leave work daily with anxiety and stress and they do not care and they do not change things."
bad,"there is no training, they just throw you into the pit and hope that you stick around. They work off en extremely outdated DOT system. Culture in this place is hostile and aggressive. Company has great benefits and they pay you decent for the area but the lack of good management is making it go down the drain. Has potential to be a thriving business but management un- involved and careless."
bad,The company is more concerned with Shareholders than their Employees.  Only concerned about the Stock Price and will make wrong business decisions to boost the stock.  Very political!
bad,"great working with the hygienist and doctors. management was decent but its a big company and you are just a number, pay was low. lots of politics, all in all i enjoyed it but i was also 18 at the time, couldn't afford to work there now."
bad,"Best believe that if Managers don’t like you you’ll be a target. Biggest threat is talking excessively. So you get caught talking to a co- worker you will always be considered a talker and they will use that as excuse for any advancement in the company. Plus there is a lot of overtime, but it’s all volunteer. If you choose not to go they will hound you and think that your not committed and tend to give you the s#!t end of the stick. Co- workers are the best except a few bad apples watch yourself those that are uncool are haters and will try to ruin your day with anything they can get on you. If your a picker/packer they will cut your hours as much as they can. They’ll hire full time but most weeks you’ll never get your full 40 unless you you get cross trained but believe when I say if they don’t like you they will never give you the opportunity to be cross trained. In my experience managers tend to put there personal feelings about you instead of your work ethics. And if they hire you on as a temp thru Henry Schein good luck average hire on date is a year and if you do get hire on as a full time employee after your year of temping you still got to wait 90days for benefits."
bad,"As a Tech, you are the professional when its convenient for the company. It is all about sales, the sales team will dictate the technical aspects despite the fact that YOU as the technician are the expert there is no project manager to bridge the gap between operations and sales. Benefits are great, however the dispatching system is non existent you are SUPPOSED to be dispatched based on location however this is far from the truth you in fact will pass your fellow technicians as you cover his area and he covers yours. You will be pushed to your limit. You will be dispatched by 3 different entities non of which communicate with each other. It will be the technicians who keep your sanity, it is a great group of guys to work with. You are provided a company vehicle, laptop (32 bit, poorly optimized) as well as company card (ball and chain). You will also go out of town, sometimes quite a bit, at times you will arrive at location ""some times hundreds of miles away"" and the equipment will not be there or not ordered. They try to be a dental services/supply/managed IT services company, in hot markets such as New York, Dallas, it simply does not work."
bad,I think the co-workers was pretty good and easy to work with. The bosses were not the type of people I would've liked to continue working for but I've learned how to humble myself no matter what.
bad,The worst manager that I ever had. It amazes me that having awful interpersonal skills can allow people to become managers. I was also poorly compensated for all of the work that I was responsible for on a Daily basis. I found it very unprofessional that I and other employees were talked down to like children when I was suppose to be working for a fortune 500 company.
bad,"Poor training, awful work/ life balance, uneducated management team, especially in the dental marketing division."
bad,High turnover in field sales. Some of the best employees are terminated
bad,"If it’s a job where you are not looking for mental challenge, constant growth, and you just want to go to work and be a worker bee, this is the place."
bad,"I would not work here, Pay is poor, Befits keep going up every year. Time of is great. No holiday or weekends. Okay all it is poor place to work. Hreat for a first time job or work experience."
bad,This company has no morals.  While I have never worked for them I have first hand knowledge.  They try to take advantage of manufacturers and customers alike. I personally have seen them trade narcotics with customers and bilk manufacturers for money they stick in their back pocket.  Illegal.
bad,"Repetitive work. "
bad,"Lacking in company culture."
bad,i do not wish to review this company.  I do not think that this company is the best company if you want a work life balance.  You will be working 24/7.
bad,"Backstabbing management, favoritisms, long long hours, will give you hard time for doctors appointments (choose your job or doctors appointment),  management doesn’t have a clue as to what’s going on, make up rules as they go, rules different everyday, say one thing and turn around 5 minutes later and say another. Low low pay, below  national average. Stress safety but the place should be investigated by OSHA/Fire Dept. NO chance of advancement. Cut throat place to work. Run away as fast as you can!!!!!!!!"
bad,"If you like to work hard and feel like you are a valued member of the team, this is not the place for you. Long hours, low pay, and a management team that doesn't listen is what you will experience."
bad,"This is a time based environment where tenure is rewarded over accomplishment. Great learning environment, just not the place you will be rewarded."
bad,Management does not value productive and hard working employees.
bad,The company continues to grow and does a lot of charity work. They provide free healthcare screenings to employees
bad,"The average raise rate is thirty cents a year, they expect blood and sweat but in return give nothing but pizza parties. Management is in their own little bubble and Human Resources are their puppets. Their excuse for the terrible pay rates are a “climate controlled warehouse and steady hours”.  Well to pay five dollars an hour under industry standard isn’t worth some A/C and a daily 7:30pm finish time. If you are considering working here, please for your own good, find something else.  I was here for almost three years, w"
bad,"The company have some of the best work force that I have worked with, their efforts are hampered by out of date systems and processes. "
bad,There is very little loyalty at HS.  My team doesnt give you credit for a good job done.  Management will take all the credit and no one sees anything wrong with throwing someone else under the bus.
bad,I loved my job but the politics makes it impossible to do your job.  The Executive Assistant for that division spends her time watching what everyone else is doing.  You must be willing to play the part in order to survive.
bad,"Managers and above hire their friends, family and neighbors. They will be there for 30 years. The company loses money when these people can't do their jobs. The company loses good people when there is no advancement."
bad,"If you weren’t a supervisor or above, you were treated badly, overworked. During company meetings were belittled. Second shift had to do most of the work."
bad,"A blind eye was turned to actions of those in Sales as long as they produced (read unacceptable behavior at events). Shockingly, HR was aware of those personalities and made excuses. I chose to work elsewhere."
bad,"The hardest part of this workplace job is trying to understand exactly what the management staff saying two different things.We were not allowed to ask how a co-worker was feeling after they were ill, only allowed to say Good Morning or see you tomorrow."
bad,"Warehouse positions are the only position that is not climate controlled. The co-workers are pleasant and helpful. The manager is an evil, micromanaging, overbearing b*****. THE worst boss I've ever had."
bad,"At first things seem to have potential of being great place to work but after time passed I began to notice its very unorganized, lots of favoritism, and unwelcoming."
bad,"Leider gibt es sehr wenige Strukturen im Unternehmen, ebenso mangelnde Führung durch die Leitenden Angestellten."
bad,"they are all about ""the process"" if anyone does not follow the process they are wrong no matter what.  Staff appears friendly until another employee tells on you for either doing something they did not like or making up something to get you in trouble.  They do a pretty good job of working with employees when things come up such as needing time off for children or sick immediate family.  The work as I said previously is all about the process.  They want you to do every task a certain way, which makes the job really monotonous. breaks were watched fairly carefully. lots of overtime available as long as you can make it to the sign up sheet early. In my opinion the place felt like it was ran like school.  People telling on one another, others getting disciplined because of what another said. co-work would act nice to every ones face which makes it hard to tell what they really think. The hardest part of the job is what I have listed above.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the paycheck."
bad,"Lots of talk about ""Team Schein"". It's mostly just that....talk. Employees and mid level management are expected to be grateful to work for such a ""fantastic"" company while ignoring the fact that they are under paid. The company is so cheap, most departments have a hard time getting adequate office supplies and the company seems reluctant to give sales people adequate commissions on huge sales dollars. Corporate headquarters are in New York. All the really intelligent people work there. Everyone else is treated as a second class citizen or less intelligent because they don't have the New York mentality."
bad,If you're looking for advancements this isn't the  company management lies very high turnover rate  just not the right fit for me. Thank you very much
bad,This company does not promote from within. They would prefer to hire someone from outside instead of promote those who are familiar with the products and customers. Management will keep you in your current role. New hires brought in to the same position will be making a much higher wage than those who have been there for years. A lot of backward thinking in management.
bad,"The job it's self isn't great but the workers you work with make it better and enjoyable, it is easy work but gets long and boring after a few weeks but is a good job if you enjoy it"
bad,"Its difficult most of the time with so many variables.  There are too many duties asked to do and complete on a day to day basis, week after week.  It needs to be  more consistent and better on the training and have trust in the employees."
bad,"If your primary concern is just earning a check then you will be alright at Schein.  If you desire something more than money, then not so much.  Management will not take your workload into consideration and will push you until you fail.  And once you fail, it is your fault."
bad,"I was very excited to start with this company, but after a year I started to notice, its not about the hard work and sales you land. Its about who's rear end you kiss to get offices given to you instead of earned."
bad,"Typical day at Zahn Dental consists of involvement in numerous projects and the ability to multitask. Problem solving a must have skill. "
bad,"For a multi billion dollar company they do not value there employees who are there 24/7 ensuring the company runs. We are required to work 12 hour shifts and taking off is a no-no, we have to find someone to cover the shift first. IT is top heavy and the ones who do the real work are left at the bottom."
bad,"What happens when a bunch of sales-oriented executives try to force a manufacturing facility to act like a car dealership?"
bad,"Typical Day at work:"
bad,Frustratingly manual.  Lots of things done manually that should be automated in a company that size.  It was surprising they were so profitable considering how much money gets wasted in this manner.  No consensus in different areas of the business on processes so it operates like a million different companies instead of one large one.
bad,"I enjoyed working with my customers and helping them achieve their goals."
bad,Henry Schein would not be so bad if they cleaned house and replaced all current management.  The work is very hard on the body and employees should get more pay per hour than Henry Schein gives.  You have to work fast and your production is monitored.
bad,"*Mainly visit Oral Surgeons and Periodontist offices."
bad,I loved my job but wasn't paid enough for doing all the jobs I did.
bad,"No room for advancement as an administrative professional. Days consist of travel and meeting planning, expense report processing and invoice processing."
bad,At Henry Schein they are top heavy in management and how can someone act as a manager without knowing how or what your job consist of. They bring in to many retail personal to manage technical employees. If you don't negotiate a good salary to start the pay raises are 2% to 3%
bad,"Some of my co-workers were great to work with.  And I had several customers that were also great to work with. I had lots of co-workers, sales rep, & customers that would only spread with me.  I also trained several new employees & helped answer questions when asked."
bad,"Davon abgesehen, dass ich es ein wenig erpresserisch finde, dass man bei Indeed eine Zusammenfassung schreiben muss... erinnert das Ganze doch auch an Henry Schein. Mehr sei dazu nicht gesagt."
bad,The work place environment was minimal to bad at times. The management was terrible and their methods were sloppy. The only good thing about working there was the paid time off.
bad,"Etant une entreprise avec un service de livraison en 24h, toutes les commandes du jour doivent partir ce jour même. D'un point de vue managérial ceci est un défi quotidien ce qui rend ce le management à la fois très intéressant car pas de monotonie dans les journées,et à la fois difficile à gérer sur les semaines à venir pour l'organisation du personnel."
bad,"At first it seemed alright. Started there as a second job to make a little extra money. Honestly, not worth 11 an hr. Management itself was pretty disorganized. They treat there people in the pick like they're completely expendable. In a warehouse setting to pull your numbers your crew should act as a team. Work together to benefit everybody and the company as a whole. No appreciation for their hourly associates. You clock in and grab your cart and start picking and that's it. No goals, manager to associate communication, unless they want you to move faster. If the company itself wonders why they have to consistently use temp agency's to staff their buildings then this would be why. Who wants to work in a place where you're treated like dirt? And then when managers cut you an attitude because you won't leave your 23$ an hr job for them? Psh... yea right."
bad,Management would not step in to resolve issues when needed. Your typical corporate world job where it was all about the bottom line and never about the employees that put them on the map.
bad,"it was friendly , Easy going. Not much advancement. HR tends to take manners in its own hands without you saying a say or can do about the situation. great , clean place to work.  other than all the cons."
bad,"Ik heb een goede werkervaring gehad bij henry schein, maar al de rest hou ik voor mij"
bad,As the Print/Web Production Supervisor for the past 8 years has demonstrated what it takes to be a part of hard-working team that always had the company's best interest come first. Problem solving and communication was key in order to meet the Production Schedule 100% with 0 error.
bad,Good.  Good company to work for on Long Island.  Good for up and coming young students getting their first job.  Excited about hiring new people - do good in the community.
good,"Suggestions are never welcomed. If you keep your mouth shut and never point out errors you will be fine. If you point something out and offer a suggestion ,watch out."
good,Never really had a chance to be successful. I was hit with roadblocks at every turn. Spoke to HR on numerous occasions which was met with a unplanned confrontation between the HR rep and my supervisor who I had gone to HR about. Great place for a very specific type of person.
good,"Not any room to advance in a career people have been in one position for 12 yrs plus and never get to advance"
good,"Henry Schein is run like a Mom & Pop shop.  It truly is who you know vs what you bring to the table.  "
good,"Good place to work for your first year out of college to gain experience ... not good for any long tern growth.  If you are related to upper management, you have a good shot at a promotion."
good,"Stressful, demanding, overworked, criticized daily for not getting all the work done.  Belittled & humiliated in front of others.  HR Dept. not helpful"
good,"Not a long term career goal. Playing favortism. Unless you were the Supervisors favorite, you would have no chance to advance or go to a different dept."
good,The Job use to be a good place to work as time went on they only seem to care about the number and not the people.  I do love the fact that they do give a holiday party and a summer picnic every year.
good,Meaningful Use and EMR software training are always making changes. My days are full of learning and sharing what I learn with my clients.
good,"Henry Schein is a great company to work for and i enjoyed working for 10 years. Company culture was great , they really took caring for the outside communities,"
good,"The struggle with this company is they do not pay well enough to get the right type of employees into the warehouse. In addition, they lack the ability to bring the team together as one to strive towards common goals."
good,"Needs Assistant Management upgrade, head Manager is awesome, Assistant Manager is NOT a people oriented person. If there wasn't the cloud that hangs over us, that the Assistant Manager does EVERYTHING right and WE as the WORKERS do everything wrong and he has been there less than 1 year, myself almost 3, the atmosphere would be so much more positive and productive."
good,Nice easy job clients where really nice enjoyed doing route. Shame about the supervisor was like a dictator and you didn't know from one day to the next how they where going to be.
good,"Job isn't hard but requires a steady pace and and attention to detail."
good,"Great people, but a lot of politics that can sometime tire you out. Promotions aren't always given based on your hard work, they're given based on who you know."
good,Manager in the department is horrible. The good thing is they are flexible with lunch hours so you can go to a doctors appointment and make up time so you do not have to use vacation time. The medical insurance in not very good and they do not pay 100% for their employees. The wages are to low for the area. Wages do not compensate the cost of living. ` locked to your head set at your desk bathroom breaks hurt your score card which affects your pay
good,Very unorganized. Medical personnel and sales reps that called into the office were mostly rude and mean because they worked on rumors instead of facts.
good,Very fast paced competitive environment. Pay is low considering what your selling is high and others who work for them get paid way more if they live in bigger cities.
good,"The web team does not have meetings. So there is a real disconnect in communication."
good,"It's all about the sales people. If you aren't in sales you are dispensable no matter how long you have been with the company. Programs that have not been updated in 70 yrs plus,"
good,Fun operation with the potential to provide great career mobility but lacking in corporate support and funds so action is often delayed.  Organization culture leaves much to be desired but there are a few employees that genuinely want to make a difference and they keep the operation successful.
good,Pay is extremely low for the tech support field. No bonuses and very little room for growth. Management changes and makes the rules as they go along. Dentrix is the worst division of the company.
good,The success of you and your business seriously depends on the market you are in. Took over a position in a negative market share. Grew my total sales significantly compared to the previous three employees in the same territory. Management has some unreal expectations about what can be achieved in the area.
good,Management is backstabbing. They have a crew who get all the perks and a crew who gets scraps.
good,"I enjoy what I do, helping pick & pack animal pharmaceuticals,The work is fast paced as you are expected to hit a certain number of orders per hour based on your zone. We are short staffed and if someone is on vacation or calls in, has a personal day, etc...it’s even tougher. Orders frequently get backed up in certain zones. There is favoritism amongst management. People get promoted who should not be - over people who should be. They do encourage input on improving things."
good,"They need to get rid of management to move into modern times and modern thinking. "
good,"Henry Schein was in a state of flux at my entrance. I went through multiple managers, in a very short amount of time. I did not feel their compensation was fair, or advancement within the company was possible."
good,Very good company with good benefits and good people.  I did feel that the range of employees in IT was not as diversified as it should be for such a large company.
good,I worked for Henry Schein for approx 3 years. There is no way you can make time if you are a few minutes late.  You are micromanaged and if you are not a favorite with management  you won't have the opportunity to advance.  The new attendance policy doesn't allow you to go take too much time off unpaid without getting written up. Never heard of that.
good,"cette entreprise permet de se forger un tempérament et un caractère. Elle permet aussi d'acquérir une bonne expérience professionnelle, de développer son autonomie, sa communication et son rapport aux autres (collaborateurs, clients). J'y ai trouvé des gens investis et disponibles."
good,"Henry Schein is a good company, but has lost one of the greatest assets it ever had - loyalty to its employees. "
good,Met some great people and learned a lot from my experience there.  Most of my co-workers were great to work with and allowed me to learn a lot while I was working there.  Had to leave due to family emergency.
good,The associates run the floor. No support from HR.Does try to make it a fun place to work. Decrease in benefits as premiums rise.
good,"Its a call center but they don't tell you that, you get 30 minutes a day for breaks.  Its all inbound calls and management is very strict about your times because its a call center."
good,Sono andato via perchè non condividevo la loro politica aziendale
good,"1-Many regional & zone managers play favoritism. They pick winners and losers based on personal feelings rather than performance. "
good,The benefits package was great but the pay was very low for the type of work it was.  There was also too much favoritism among. most of the management staff
good,Due to their move to a new and bigger location the management became very unorganized. They started losing employees. Other than that it is an ok place to work.
good,Extremely busy. Days could be very long. Very diverse workforce. I was there at startup. the hours of work (start time) changed 4 times the first year
good,"Henry Schein is a timed per hour environment,required to receive,pick,pack & put away dental products per hour.Fast paced environment,willing to work overtime,weekends.Lots of lifting,up to 50 lbs,helping in other departments."
good,"Good Company to work for and have good benefit."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company.  I got along with all my co-workers and was delegated by supervisors for special projects and duties due to my dependability, efficiency and reliability."
good,"Schein has one of the most wonderful benefits package I've seen among jobs. There is usually a good chance for advancement, or at the very least, a chance to get out of your field and be able to try another."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the customers and the outside field representatives.  I have wonderful memories of them.
good,Henry Schein was a great place to work as they had a great culture and put the team first and treated the people really well. unfortunately in recent years it has changed and has become all about the next quarters numbers and less about the people and the long term success.
good,"Recession-resistant industry, stable company"
good,"Very good learning environment for an incoming sales person. However, it does not make use of any of my technical knowledge since this is more of a hardware oriented sales environment"
good,"Perform service for area dental offices."
good,Management is in place to assist in future growth of the individual and encourages extra studies and certificates to help in growth. Strong team dynamic.
good,"As with any company nowadays, there was deep seeded nepotism that ultimately affected the way you could execute your job. I found Henry Schein to be overall a good company to work for, despite the callous and bush league manner in which I was terminated. I was able to do my work every day with a minimum of oversight and/or interference, which is always desirable. My co- workers were for the most part hard working and always willing to help out when needed. The department team lead could perhaps spend less time trying to bang one of her employees and learning how to actually do her job."
good,"Henry Schein had it's difficulties when it came to advancement of people with color.  They were not really interested in your advancement, but the advancement of their friends was important."
good,"This company, the work, and the environment is not for everyone. The opportunity to come back is available if you are in good standing with the company."
good,"Overall, Henry Schein is a nice place to work. There are many, many challenges and juggling the daily work load is one of them. There is an unfair balance in the division of work assignments that creates quite a bit of unnecessary stress. The folks there are professional."
good,"Henry Schein is a great place to work. The benefits are great. There is a very friendly atmosphere."
good,"Fast paced and ever changing, with lots of different job roles available. Some great personalities to work with. Leader in its field. Steady and reliable."
good,"Is Henry Schein a good place to work, That depends on the type of employee you are. If your looking for a place with a great work life balance, a steady income stream and good benefits, then this is the place for you. If you have aspirations of rising through the corporate ranks, and you don't have an in or hook, not going to say it can't happen buts its extremely unlikely. Employee development is a huge challenge to say the least especially in the groups with management that has been in place for a long time. For every great manager, there are 4 that do not know what it means to be a leader. Like I said, not that development can't happen, you have to be lucky enough to get into the right group. If you become a TSM at a good level you will love your job."
good,Requires constant cold calling and closing of accounts. Must be able to work independently with little/no supervision.
good,"Arrivée a 9h"
good,I worked here for 4 years. This is a good company with great benefits but they are not family oriented
good,"I was hired by a placement agency to assist the Expeditor while he trained for another position.  I found the employees to be very friendly and assisting when needed.  Typical day was to look over the outstanding orders and follow up with suppliers.  Then I had to update that information in the system.  Extremely repetitive.  Unfortunately, I had to leave before the contract end as I was in my early stages of pregnancy and was having some difficulties.  Overall, I did enjoy my short stay there....regardless of how mind-numbingly boring the job was.  LOL  I wish I was given more responsibility but I understand that my position was only suppose to be a temp so...  Who knows?  "
good,Being a commissioned based position there is a lot of opportunity to earn a great living.
good,"There is a great team of outside sales reps and management that help you be successful. You are able to earn a great living if you can stick it out 2-4 years for the hard part. However, besides being able to make more money, there is little opportunity for vertical movement in the company."
good,"Good place to work, Good benefits, Easy access to the cafeteria for lunch., and don't have to leave the building. Feel safe with Security in the building."
good,Henry Schein culture was upbeat and the HR staff was great and empathetic with the work force. Particular management were incompetent and did not train employees to do the job but expected employees to know the system. I was a temp and was fired in two weeks after being disrespected by my supervisor. This particular area was a hostile work environment. I remained pleasant and did not take things personal. It became difficult after being talked at.
good,"Picker/packer isn't hard work. For me personally, the work wasn't the problem. Management seemed picky and hardly ever let me learn to do new things while other people who had around the same efficiency were moved on to packing and other tasks after picking was finished. I ended up being stuck doing sweeping the entire floor or condensing boxes for several months straight."
good,Go for an interview and they don't have the decency to email you back to say you haven't got the job . That say's all you need to know about the company .
good,"It was not a right fit for me. Too much nepotism and the company was not in line with my passions in life. There was not much creativity, although the staff is treated nicely."
good,"I think people should give it a try and continue to be positive because this is really a great job and excellent benefits. They give out all the overtime, which is good for your pocket book."
good,"Typical day as temp included focusing on mainly one project, however, as I was at the company for a longer period of time they would give me more projects to work on."
good,Well it is a good company to work for if you plan to stay working for them for a long time. I have No other comments about Henry Schein since I am no longer employed with them anymore.
good,"Staff and team was nice. Could have used better training on their software. Salary was ok, but benefits were great. Nice work environment with free health services(ex. flu shot and health related exams)."
good,"warehouse was ok. the management was alrighttoo. there was no room for advancement within the company. one you learnt he entire warehouse, you are inter-changeable and they have no time to advance you to management once you do have the experience in the warehouse."
good,"sales here can be rewarding but they like to advance the seasoned reps.  compete with your own company more than the competition. if they promise you anything, get it in writing and read the fine print."
good,"God give me strength for this. 8 and half hours to walk and pick item."
good,Great company culture. Limited (to none) room to move within the organization is the biggest problem. Hours are reasonable and the management team is great.
good,"Typical day to day activities including driving from customer to customer resolving any issues reported by them. Sometimes this entailed driving for 4 or more hours to get to a location, perform needed repairs, and then driving back."
good,"HSAH has a very ""corporate"" atmosphere. They want you to build customer relationships but require you to do 80 outbound calls a day, in addition to incoming calls for orders, quotes, and problems/errors of the day to handle to satisfy the customer. They do have advancement opportunities but my branch was closed before I could be with the company for very long to take advantage. With a nationwide phone network there was always help with an answer just a phone call or chat away, by either a network supervisor or CSR mentor, but varied time zones can you leave you with no contact after ""five o'clock"" in your zone. Better have enough experience to wing it on your own."
good,"I've been able to have many different opportunities at Henry Schein, including Accounts Payable, Marketing and Customer Service.  "
good,Despite my short time there i really appreciate the support i have received from the staff from the first day. No complex of inferiority within the team.
good,"A typical day at work: Come in at 7:30 A.M. and continue whatever work was assigned to me, if any. Finish my tasks, usually regarding Excel, otherwise I had some work dealing with editing inventory order cycles on a program that can only edit one field at a time.."
good,"You have the opportunity to run your own business and territory, which is suitable for varying stages in life and many find this incredibly beneficial for work/life balance."
good,"If you are looking for a large corporate structure company where you work in box, this is the place for you. Good company just very limited with the opportunities for advancement."
good,Working with talented technology teams as well as with dedicated individuals in the Human Resources department.  I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Henry Schein.
good,"Loved the company and the employees, did not see advancement after a couple years of employment so had to part ways and find a new career that would allow growth"
good,"Henry Schein is overall a nice company to work for. The dispatch department however needs tremendous improvement. There is way too much work divided upon a small team of dispatchers. There was no way to keep up with everything."
good,The pay was great but the management wasn't so great they were always trying to find the bad things you did but never acknowledged the good . I learned a lot though
good,"-overview day to day operations for customer service team."
good,"Very easy environment to work in. Go and come as you please. Produce, and you're compensated well. Then the next year you're punished. Unrealistic goals set by upper management with NO sales team input or association. No sales support to assist in growth or sales, total self reliance. Not interested in what works or doesn't work."
good,Typical day at work is very physical. I learned a range of skills. The management are approachable. Workplace culture is diverse. Hardest part of the job is the physical labour. The most enjoyable part is the atmosphere.
good,"Henry Schein, Inc. overall is a great company to work for. However, when they are ready to terminate you, they will find every reason that benefits them to do so."
good,"I enjoyed working at Henry Schein, Inc.  There were many ways to give back to the community through different charity events.  It was a team effort in the various departments and a lot of interaction between departments."
good,I learned a lot in the warehouse industry in the short amount of time i worked there. I learned how to properly import/export material in an efficient and proper manner.
good,Work is very mindless. Order picking required reading a sheet and going into the appropriate isle to pick each item and get it ready for packing.
good,"Overall good place to work.  Technicians are the grunts with little input on opportunity for process improvements re: install and customer service issues.  Management could pay us more but will not due to their  bonuses earned on maintaining profit margins.  No continuing education, few advancement opportunities.  Field co-workers all hard workers and good teams.  Overtime is the only way to earn a decent paycheck."
good,"The job culture is lacking, and the company has lost sight of these values. It is very political."
good,"Working with Henry Schein is wonderful experience and opportunity. I found my strengths in a corporate workplace in the financial operations department as a credit representative. I have mastered the value of customer service with my assigned my accounts, review orders, credit lines, payments,review of statements/invoices and credit reports as well as running DNB and Experian reports. Majority of my coworkers are great I get along with everyone in a work place. I am looking for a company that I can grow in and unfortunately there is no room for growth Henry Schein. I am passionate about what I do and take t very seriously and want to give my customers the best results and help possible on their accounts."
good,I was writing almost 2 million dollars in business with 65 accounts. Unable to call on new business and grown my territory
good,Amazing work place for someone that is single. I learn something new every day. Exposed to a lot of new work that is challenging and interesting. However--work hours aren't the best. Most days I put in anywhere between 10-13 hrs.
good,Good work life.  Culture is great. Money is not to bad. Good job. Good co workers. Nice desk and phone. Commission on sales. Low hourly rate. Great place to work.
good,I worked in the software troubleshooting department. The work environment was very laid back so long as there were not many known issues with the software. The biggest problem was that there was pretty much no chance of getting promoted.
good,"A typical day is making calls trying to get past the gatekeeper and get access to dentist and presenting products. If not, setting appointments and co- traveling with field sales consultants, following up with offices, and preparing for presentations. I learned a lot about myself during training when I was gone for 2 weeks at a time. I can be independent while wanting to be around people. I learned that B2B can knock you off your feet but you just have to stand back up. Hardest part of the job would be being alone all day and going a full day without getting a sale. Most enjoyable part is the flexibility and meeting new people everyday."
good,I was a temp at Henry Schein for a while but it wasn’t the right fit for me. The hours were manageable but the pay wasn’t sufficient. The warehouse I was working at had good management.
good,"Good place to work, just an issue with getting processes together."
good,One manager seemed condescending but that was when I worked in another area I didn't usually work in where I would clean up the storage area. People would sweat from the work pace and were forced to bring their numbers up & up. The real redeeming nature of it is the coworkers and the managers I had.
good,"Very good company not see before"
good,at this time we are stressed with the work. The manager is stressed about what we are doing at all times and is micromanaging. this does not allow us to grow as an individual in our workplace.
good,Not enough hours in the day to do the work and travel the management expects you to do.  Service calls are dispatched from a remote location without coordination from local employees.
good,Good for a student or someone doing something outside of their job. Good balance between work and home but comp sucks. Overtime was unlimited when available.
good,"The people I worked with were nice and job stress is about the same as in most places I have worked.   However, some top management personnel don't seem to understand the culture or practice in the IT profession."
good,"Ik heb 3,5 jaar bij HS gewerkt en heb dat met plezier gedaan op de Customer Service. Een typische dag zag eruit als: de mails beantwoorden van klanten die bijvoorbeeld verkeerde goederen hebben ontvangen, daarbij werden we de hele dag door gebeld en die beantwoorde je uiteraard ook. Ik maakte daarnaast ook de creditnota's voor de klanten. Ik heb veel geleerd vooral over het tandarts vak en hoe  SAP werkt. De directie en collega's waren oké. Het moeilijkste was soms dat klanten ontzettend erg naar je uit konden vallen. Het leukste vond ik toch wel: het klanten contact."
good,It was fun working with Team members for several years. Working with diverse nationalities and cultures helped me to learn other peoples' culture.
good,"Good place to work, annual pay raises do not match raise in cost of living though."
good,I loved working for Henry Schein. It was a company I had hoped to retire with but after almost 4 years I had to leave due to unforeseen family issues. I do miss it very much and would recommend working for this company to anyone
good,"take inbound calls all day. If you test well you can advance into better opportunities, but the questions are poorly written guaranteed you will not pass the first few times. log you calls and help customers figure out issues with the software."
good,"Responsable de service très à l'écoute de leur collaborateur, et bonne ambiance de travail."
good,As a public company HSD is driven by profit for share holders. Upper management will not hesitate to dismiss the entire division if they think it’s not making money.
good,"Henry Schein is an ISO certified, Fortune 500 company.  They distribute medical and dental supplies.  In 2015, they employed over 3oo team members.  ...."
good,"working with assigned customer accounts & making collection calls or assisting customer's needs.  "
good,"I worked in a Henry Schein Inc., Call Center for nearly two decades. I was a Sales Rep and also a part of the Management Team.  "
good,"If you get on, the benefits are great, you definitely want to move up, or around, or find a position that plays into your strengths and capabilities when you get on. The hours weren't exactly what I wanted, but it was workable to things I wanted to do outside of work."
good,"The rate of pay increase is a reflection of the territory location to some degree. Also, your support from manufactures is much less in a rural area than near a large city."
good,"As an intern in the tax department for 6 months, I was able to get a good sense of the corporate environment and both supporting and deteriorating aspects of the sound environment that Henry Schein wishes to maintain.  The company treats employees well and offers generous compensation and benefits packages (no benefits for interns, but salaried employees are taken care of well).  As an intern at a fortune 500 company I did expect to do a lot more than file paperwork and scan tax documents for 6 months.  At the end of my internship I had learned very little about tax and accounting.  Management seems to be overwhelmed and stuck in old ways, and it is clear that what has erupted across the globe as modern and adaptable job functions, has not ever made its landing at HSI.  My daily duties and tasks were never established nor evaluated.  The company promotes fun and stress management at the workplace, and invites all employees to holiday events (even halloween is celebrated throughout the entire office).  Overall, a great company and a lot of opportunity for internal advancement and mobility, however day to day business practices seem inefficient and divided among departments in a manner that prevents transparency without direct and explicit communication."
good,"A very laid back place to work. Smiling faces and fairly clean for being a warehouse. The environment was a very quiet surrounding. Fairly nice, yet strict managers kept people in line, but happy to do so. All around nice place to work."
good,"Very fast paced in the warehouse and very physical.  I loved it, no drama. Really nice and supportive management . Alot of standing wear good shoes. Good place to work"
good,"My experience with this job was really good, I love the job itself but the management was horrible and very unprofessional. Benefits are amazing but the pay and yearly raises could be better"
good,"I worked from home "
good,Good company with excellent benefits. Hardworking team members and dedicated management staff. Henry Schein is a company which was very dedicated to its customers.
good,"I had the opportunity to learn a lot over the summer while interning with Henry Schein. It was a great experience for me because it was my first ""real life experience"" position. All of the management and the reps were very helpful throughout the summer and answered any questions I had. I would recommend this company!"
good,"Company let people go due to budget constraints, not really a great place that I thoroughly enjoyed working to be fair for the time that I was there. It's a great entry level role to get your feet wet within this industry."
good,It can be a great place to work if you're in the right team. Middle management is actually easy to work with.  However top management is not.
good,"You are frequently expected to work overtime during their busy season, 4th quarter, but during the rest of the year management will state that there is no overtime as if you are stealing from the company, regardless of what your workload would require.  The health insurance is way too expensive not weekly but when you actually need to use the benefits and it doesn't cover a lot of services/procedures.  Cigna as of 2018."
good,while the company has good moral and it seems like there are places within the company to make money it seems an impossible climb to get there. After 2 years at the company i feel as tho i ave nowhere to go which would benefit my financial and the advancement opportunities are few and far between. the annual raise is somewhat insulting and does not seem to reward your performance. while the company is stable I want a place where i can grow myself and it feels like I'm stuck in the mud with nowhere to go
good,this was not a company i liked to work for and would never want to work again. poor management and poor worklife. would never recommend working for this company.
good,"Mornings are really chill. The production crew doesn't come in till 9 Am so replenishment can work without obstructions. One week I work on the machine picking up bulk amounts of product to stock the shelves. Another week I work on the floor putting product away in its proper location or I relocate product to more appropriately sized locations for that product. My supervisor is really chill. He lets us work. The only time he talks to us is if we do something wrong, otherwise, we are on our own to work. My lead doesn't listen to anyone below her. If someone goes and asks the supervisor a question she gets upset and does the opposite of what was asked. The most enjoyable part for me is working the machine and making big bulk moves to the product racks. The hardest part of the job is favoritism."
good,For the 5 years I worked there it was great up until the last position I had for 1.5 years.  Just felt like the manager of the department was blocking me from getting promoted because I worked too hard and he could not lose me.  Did not feel like I was going to ever be able to advance so I left.
good,"postes intéressants à découvrir beaucoup de choses à apprendre si on s'intéresse d'un peu plus près au dentaire"
good,"Great company, good community responsibility. Voted best company to work for by Forbes for 12 years in a row.  Orthodontic group and Carriere System are propelling HSO's market standings."
good,Henry Schein Sells Dental Equipment.It Is A Great Work Place.They Have Great People Working For Them & Great Operations.They Have A Lot Of Meeting and They Feed You Well.
good,"Good company management sales driven.  50/50 Good and Bad. They could care more for their employee that work in field than the bottom dollar. Top heavy in management, good Ol boys."
good,"respond to orders via email or telephone. oversea inventory levels"
good,The work is fine but the lack of advancement and compensation for training they want you to get is bad. They want you to train new equipment and put your name on high priced technology but not compensate you for that. The chain of command is lacking. the work is simple and there is enough to keep you busy.
good,It can be a good job. But there are many factors that will keep this job from being great. Its still a job based on purely on the success of the Sales team. And you're day can be ruined by a customer that doesn't like your appearance or personality.
good,Enjoyed working Henry Schien Inc. Was able to further my career in IT support. Had a large area to support that gave the opportunity to travel extensively.
good,"if you have the drive, this is definitely a good career field to be in, and Schein is a good company to be with, there is a good balance between what you put into it and what you get out of it"
good,Overall Henry Schein was a great place to work at because it has a nice relaxed environment and everybody there was nice and was an easy environment to get use to.
good,They have favorites and if you’re a favorite they raise your efficiency higher than other hard workers. Other than that it’s a chill job. Fast pace good for teens
good,Henry Schein was a relaxed place to work great co workers good managment. Hardest part of the job was a there was always changes  the most enjoyable part was the atmosphere.
good,"The company has great benefits but most people there have a negative attitude which constantly continues to bring you down, so the morale is poor even though the company is good"
good,I worked in the replenishment department moving product from one location to another. It was a good job to work fresh out of high school. Management was always helpful and nice to work for.
good,"Typische dag was er eigenlijk niet, veel dynamiek"
good,leuke collega's in bedrijf met informele werksfeer
good,Just keep the trucks loaded and help out when needed take all the hours u can the security team is awesome the people are real friendly very serious about safety
good,"Nothing to say about the job other than it's a good job if you need a direction in life. Travelling can happen, but pay is quite low for the amount of work."
good,"Management was very nice, good pay, great place to work. If i wasn't moving would have stayed in that job."
good,"I enjoy working for my direct supervisors and feel they have their direct reports' best interests in mind."
good,Working for Henry Schein Medical was very rewarding and fast paced which I like.  I have seen a lot of changes in the medical device Distribution industry and the business is changing rapidly.  I have enjoyed managing 9 sales representatives with different levels of skill sets.
good,"Fair and well managed. Tons of support and a good team environment. There was a lot of driving, but met many great people and physicians."
good,The people in Henry Schein are great and I have a fantastic team. The role that I have is restrictive in terms of no commercial involvement and a huge amount of internal compliance.
good,A typical day at Dentrix involved taking inbound phone calls and assisting customers.  I enjoyed my co-workers and the work environment.  I would like to see more initiatives to help employees grow and be more successful with the company.
good,Lots of team spirit. Enjoyable work environment. I have had the opportunity to grow and move within the company and it has helped me create a more defined career path.
good,Company that gives you many avenues to succeed.  Tough building a teritory as many reps are in the area already.  Business is changing and seems to be following the route medical has taken.
good,"The company pays well, but there is only two departments, collector and legal so there is no advancement."
good,A typical day at Henry Schein would be to contact Doctors for the medical equipment that we have in our workshop to give them an estimate on the repairs needed. Also to upgrade to a new unit if the unit is not repairable or too old. At the end of the day I would gather all of the work packets that have been completed for the day and send out the bill to the doctors.
good,"Henry Schein overall is a great company, I've enjoyed working there for the past 15 years.  One of the reasons I've stayed on so long is because of a wonderful manager, he is now retired and its become very Corporate and sterile.  "
good,"Fun company to work at.  The paperwork is a bit much, the systems are out-dated and some of the required work is redundant.  The people are great from bottom to top."
good,"Pick products from locations in order to complete orders for shipping."
good,"Production its ok but they need to rotate people around i here a lot of people say the same thing it gets bothering doing the same thing"
good,"Most days the same, printing off large volumes of emails, processing invoices for authorisation. Once invoices authorised each one coded and processed onto JD Edwards for eventaul payment processing."
good,"A typical workday,;Collect equipment inspections,repair problem.ordered parts,made visual inspection of complete warehouse and repaired problems,check with supervisor about what he knows.I have learned things by repairing things and reading equipment repair and installation manuals. also took a 2 week school about ""Crown All Equipment School in Ohio. I worked with management in every thing I did. I liked all of my co-workers and made sure they liked me. Co-workers are my internal customers. They see things and know real problems and helps prevent downtime. Hardest part to me is having to make time for too much work which makes me prioritise repaires.The enjoyment of this job is seeing how happy people are when they see something that includes their input. I love happy people,friends,which I feel makes managment and supervisors workhappy.I liked to learn and work in all departments. Then I can get firsthand knowledge of really is going on."
good,"no complaints, great benefits, good people"
good,"Customer Service, inbound Outbound calls, Order filling, Retail Sales"
good,"I would recommend this company to young people who have no ""responsibilities"" other than themselves... the department i work for is not a good fit in my opinion for someone with a family."
good,"talk to customer's daily and assist with fixing their issue, certain times you're limited by what you're allowed to assist them with due to liability reasons, at the same time it's not something you're responsible with helping them or outside of our scope of support."
good,"It was ok. People were nice, picking wasn’t the best but it is what it is. The headset system wasn’t the best. Whenever something was said over the intercom, it would get picked up in the headset and you’d have to start you’re order back over"
good,"Fantastic people to work with, many among the best I've ever had the pleasure to collaborate with.  Lack of continuity and lack of consistent vision from executive management created inconsistent resource allocation.  Additionally, a serious lack of budget and business investment available for initiatives to grow the company beyond its limits."
good,Big Company.  I was commuting from NJ an stating at a hotel during the week.  I knew I would not be staying there on a long term basis as it was a  temporary assignment.
good,"It was alright, not much to say about it. I would love to work there again! I really do miss see all the nice employees! Everybody treats you well when you see them."
good,I really enjoyed my time with Henry Shein.   They have a great team.   I did feel like the training and development aspects of my job could have been better.
good,Henry schein was by far the most laid back job I have ever had. As long as you do your job they don't bother you. I was going through a temp agency that was horrible.
good,It's really hard to move up. It was a fast pace job had to meet deadlines which was understandable. Friendly people good training staff members just lack of management.
good,"Diverse mansioni, dall'analisi dati all'ufficio acquisti alla gestione delle spedizioni estere."
good,"Good, stable job. Make sure to keep your head down and work continuously. The management isn't that great. The job itself is pretty easy so you shouldn't have much problem day to day."
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced if you are a picker. Hardest part of the job is getting to learn how to use the ""Jennifer"" headset. You must be comfortable with being on your feet all day and must have good listening skills.The managers are cool and understanding people but you get a limited amount of excused absences."
good,"Henry Schein is a good company to work for. Compensation is a little lower than some other similar companies but benefits are pretty good. Insurance is not as inexpensive as a few years ago due to the changes in national insurance policies, but salary has not increased to account for this additional expense. Company culture is ok, very sales oriented in nature. Operations team is sometimes overlooked as to their importance."
good,Its a nice place to work. The people are great. Many can use more work. But overall it's a nice place to work. It's not very fast pace but enough to keep busy.
good,"Not a bad place to work, most of the people are kind, some of the management is nice to work with, and are willing to help, it was an opportunity for growth"
good,"is a warehouse jod ,where I love to work, but the management need to be more fare with the worker.Most jod there is warehouse as picking order stocking and loading, unloading order.Is hard work, but I enjoy it."
good,Coworkers throw fellow employees under the bus and don't take personal responsibltiy for their actions.
good,Enjoyed working there unfortunately was made redundant
good,This is a simple job. You have to be quick on your toes. Manager are very strict and they want this done in a certain way. But there is room for growth if you last
good,Fun place to work- hard work pays off. Sometimes management micromanaged a bit too much. Over all the culture was good. It was hard to feel comfortable due to lack of training. Self starters and self motivated workers do well.
good,"Very demanding and stressful."
good,"Fast moving and always changing. Complex company in that there is a distribution channel in addition to the technology and software channel.  Navigating all sales channels is challenging, but provides excellent sales opportunities."
good,"Opportunity for upward mobility,education and growth. Good reimbursement plans, excellent benefits. Management positions are demanding, expect over 40 hour work weeks."
good,Both rolls were challenging but I felt successful.  I enjoyed the challenge and particularly enjoyed engaging with customers and patients.  I'm a natural leader who will positively impact any sales team.
good,"I experience daily gratification in the progress and completion of my daily work responsibilities. The team is respectful and highly productive. I enjoy working with the team members throughout the various departments in the company. I have the privilege to experience and learn all aspects of our business due to the necessity of being connected to these functions in order to accomplish my job responsibilities.  Bureaucracy does contribute to delays in the decision making process but overall the autonomy allows me to explore and execute my options when making business decisions. "
good,"Fun, relaxed place to work with good management, it can be busy, but the work isn’t super hard. You do have to deal with unhappy customers often, but there are resources available to help with escalations."
good,Enormous public company...if that is what you are into. The culture and mission is there but they do not make it easy for you to advance. Great opportunities to learn and experience a true conglomerate environment.
good,It is a focused organization that prides itself on growth and full encompassed business management.  The day to day work life balance in inline with today's expectations.
good,"Good company, although the common topic of discussion among the TSMs (Team Schein Members) is a bit lower salary due to the company's philosophy of having good benefits over higher monetary compensation."
good,"This is an excellent opportunity for those that want quick cash with little true computer knowledge needed. A lot of the ""computer knowledge"" will be learned through supporting calls, but if you are looking for a career where you can continuously learn and grow your IT knowledge, search elsewhere."
good,Business model is changing underneath this great company.  The internet has changed things forever.  In the sundry business knowledge and service is becoming more and more a secondary issue to price.
good,Great company with great people. Great benefits and a consistent work day. The only downside is middle management has a tendency to keep productive people in low end positions for their own gain.
good,"The company is awesome at providing opportunities for you to hone your skills and gain new ones.  Helping you to gain an understanding of the front and back end of dental management software.  When i first started, the management team was great, but as the new head of support was hired from Convergys, the support floor became less of a family oriented team and more, individual every man for himself type."
good,"Henry Schein was a first class company to work for.  Very long work hours especially when working on acquisitions. Not much chance for for advancement. Lovely upper management. Very nice people to work with.  Very concerned with helping the community as well as our global neighbors. One example of this is the participation in Habitat for Humanity, of which I was glad to be of help on a number of occasions. Another, is their generous donations of medical and dental supplies to victims of catastrophic disasters, at home and around the world."
good,"Working here for two years I do not hesitate to commend the people inside the company.  They are smart, good and wonderful to work with.  the internal culture is a ""safe"" one. Once hired, it is rare that they fire someone, nor have layoffs.  Henry Schein is a fortune 500 company that has outpaced Berkshire Hathaway in profitable growth for the past 10+ years.  They meet or exceed their WS numbers every quarter."
good,"Henry Schein is a global leader in dental equipment supply. Excellent compensation, training, and benefit package."
good,"Huidige werkzaamheden; tel. contact met klanten en medewerkers, helpdesk voor klanten m.b.t. advies over problemen en gebruik van equipment (behandelunits, autoclaven, röntgenapparatuur en alles wat er nog meer bij de tandarts in de praktijk aanwezig is).

good,The company provided great opportunities for growth while leading out in its industry.
good,I had a great boss here that was more of a mentor than a boss and really fostered my talents.
good,"The job was great  loved the people, benefits were fantastic. U got a lot of time off for family. You wor 4 days a week and had a 3 day weekend. So overall it's a great place to work."
good,"I enjoyed working for Henry Schien. I quiet because of lack of pay and opportunity.  E- sevcies is awesome. DO NOT GO TO DENTRIX department. I repeat... Do not go to DENTRIX.  Dont get me wrong. Henry Schien is a great company, but the customers are STUPID. (Which are dental professionals) I now question my doctors because of this experience..."
good,"Overall a very good Company. "
good,"Management seemed to have a haphazard grip on conducting new comers, was hard on old time workers, and tried to grip those they needed and bend them to fit a role instead of applying people where they actually work well, but that's the name of the game."
good,Every Department has their own system/culture within the building. Overall a good company to work for. They do things throughout the year to keep morale up.
good,"Professional and friendly work environment. However, training was horrible was horrible for the role I was brought in for.  Salary was decent, free health examinations and vaccinations was nice."
good,"My position was local to the area and I was managed by a VP in New York.  All communication was telephonic with annual site visit.  If things were a little different than the telephonic communication, it was reflected in performance reviews."
good,alright job it was too fast paced. learned how to pick and pack in two days you met a lot of great people there. the management is not very understanding
good,"Management can be lazy, leading to lower tier of employees working harder. Very nice and loose environment. Great benefits that make working there enjoyable and easier."
good,Typical Work day is taking customer calls over the phone and chat.  Great coworkers and management.  Great in depth training on the software though they don't fully prepare you for some of the off the wall calls you get. The only drawback is the pay.
good,"Service position serving dental professionals rather demanding as most service positions are, good job satisfaction to provide services to dental professionals."
good,"A great place to work with great, kind and helpful colleagues. During my time there i have learnt alot about the windows 10 platform extending my knowledge with IT"
good,fast paced environment where people know their jobs and preform them well. well laid out structure with free coffee in the break room. understanding managers and weekends free.
good,It was not my choice to work for Henry Schein.  I was brought to HS in the Cardinal Health transition. It is a good company and culture.  They are really good at the 5 to 10 doctor offices.  They struggle to bring on large customers.
good,"They are very considerate when I needed to attend my military duties, and extended missions. Also military leave payment. Great job, fun and friendly environment."
good,"It was not my choice to leave Henry Schein. My job was terminated and I lost my job. I could of learned a different position but was never given the chance."
good,"Set your own schedule."
good,"While it is unfortunate that my position was eliminated after 17 months, I was treated fairly and with great respect and offered another, (lesser), position, which mitigates a lot of the stress that comes with losing a job... namely I still have a paycheck and insurance and retirement savings."
good,"Good place but they keep temps to hire too long on temps ,, they have good benefits for those that works full time or are hire on ."
good,"Responsible for selling supplies, equipment, and technology within designated Central and Northern New Jersey territory.  Focused on increased territory revenue by growing existing accounts while aggressively pursuing net new business. Consultative selling to accounts to offer value added services such as profitability coaching, office efficiency coaching, and compliance training."

good,"Great company to work for, management very supportive. My issue was working sales at the start of our economic crisis of which I was employed at Henry Schein."
good,"Overall this was a great company to work for.  Good benefits and room to grow.  Constant changes in quota and job expectations, as to be expected in software and technology.  Gained great experience here."
good,Great benefits for all.  No mandated overtime.  They have created a good environment for what they call TSM's.  They are very supportive of the workforce but also very forgiving.  Willing to give multiple chances for   employees to break rules.  Management is built on a who you know and not what you know system of advancement.
good,"If you can't or don't like to do the same thing everyday then you won't last long here. You're either in the B's or W's everyday. If you have a problem being on your feet all day then you won't make it either. I like my job and can't say anything bad about the pay or benefits. I like my boss but sometimes the punks get on my nerves I sometimes think I work with kids(punks) b/c the act stupid and don't understand how to be professional and they seem like kids(GROW UP)! All shifts are 8 hrs but you can come on early if they have time open and all overtime is optional. They do a lot each your for the community and I give them kudos for that and they do a lot for employees as well you just gotta come in, do your job and make production. All in all it's a great company to work for if you want to be in warehousing!"
good,"It's god , great mixed  place to work for .good medical and dental benefits they also,  Mach 7% on 401k , good co workers and management as well,the flex your  work schedules as you need  for you kids and families,  the also provide company lunch, picnic and Christmas parties,they also have very generous vocation and time off. Overall it's good place to work"
good,"I worked for the company for almost 20 years on the West Coast.  Like any job, there are plusses and minuses, but Schein was a great career for a long time.  There were always people who'd regret their decision to leave the company and eventually try to come back, realizing after all that the grass, in-fact was NOT greener.  LOL.  For me, I started at Schein in my early 20's, and it was just time for me to move on, the company is great though."
good,"Although I left for salart needs, and not being challenged enough, I did overall enjoy my time at Henry Schein and if things were to change I would consider returning. For the most part its a good place to work and is an extremely secure job, however the advancement opportunities are pretty sparce and do not come with competitive salaries."
good,"I loved working with Henry Schein and it was the job that I would have like to stay at, unfortunately, they closed their doors. I enjoyed my team and and environment. I was able to work at my pace and was challenged to show my strengths. I love working in an office setting and being able to provide customer service and working with the sales teams."

good,"Henry Schein is a very friendly environment with consistent executives, very little turn over.  Work in a team atmosphere and are progressing to new levels in the industry over past few years."
good,"I worked for a small division of Henry Schein that specialized in selling dental practices.  As administrative assistant, I served the director of the division.  I utilized Microsoft Office and performed basic accounting functions.  I also answered the telephone for the division and directed calls.  "
good,"After being unemployed for 4 months, great company to be hired by.  Given opportunity for advancement from inside the office to outside as a service tech.  Drove to each install, not being at the same installation very long.  It was nice being out and about each day.  Difficult part was working through traffic each day in the Washington DC area."
good,great people helping people. They always empowered us as managers to make decisions based on the customers needs. Following the corporate guidelines and the needs of many.
good,La communication à être améliorer et trop de chefs en poste.
good,"Early morning prep for day void fill,case pick truck loading etc.Choose area grab correct equipment and pull orders/load trucks/gave help wherever needed for the day clean areas once finished."
good,"Good overall but not much advancement available"
good,"The dental repairs take a while to grasp but the hands on training is pretty good and you will catch on fairly quickly.  The Dental offices are busy and you will need to be creative to schedule repairs around the schedules they provide but it is possible to get it done,  "
good,"I thought it was a great place, I learned  a lot from there about productivity and accuracy. Made a lot a friends there."
good,"Work starts at 8:30 am and it begins with checking emails and any calendar reminders. Throughout the day I will check orders, answer emails, research accounts, and answer phones. While working at Henry Schein I have learned the importance of thorough research and how to work with customers to resolve any conflicts or issues the customer may have. My co-workers are amazing. They are like family and will help anyone when they can. My co-workers are the most enjoyable part of my job along with building the relationships with my customers."
good,"A typical day at work: "
good,"The job is not very challenging but the job is very secure. There is always work to do in some capacity, it just is not very challenging."
good,A great place to work. Best of any dental supply company. Good local culture. Management cares about its workers.
good,This company provided me with a terrific opportunity for personal growth in my business career. Expectations were high and the work was hard. However I had the chance to meet and work with people at all levels of the organization as part of my day to day responsibiliites. The discipline that I learned here has helped me to succeed in my career and have my own successful business.
good,Love my job and it's just not enough money for me to get my mom and dad care. I just wanted to better my self. I want to better my life and get back to the old way.
good,"They offer very good health and dental insurance. They have activities for their employees around the holidays. The work is about average, they train you until you fully understand the job."
good,Great management and team culture. Amazing company to work for they are always looking out for there employees and finding new ways to improve. Excellent work schedules and pretty good benefits as well. Always looking for better way to serve its community.

good,"Great company, they do a lot of community involvement and care about their employees. I enjoyed working with Henry Schein and would have kept working there if I didn't relocate!"
good,"Over all my workday is VERY stressful, multi-tasked, and continues to progress to a level that a single person can no longer manage without help.  I have learned to never be complacent, because before you know it all changes right under your nose.  I know change is excellent and a person must adapt.  My work and personal Ethics do not permit me to compromise government regulations and corporate policies and it times may have caused friction to another person to obtain their goals and incentive.  "
good,It is a fast-paced work environment. You have great benefits and great people to work with. You will constantly stay on your feet with new things to do.
good,"People are nice, management is nice and executives are nice. Fair place with good culture. Always helping associates and local community. Helpful in many ways"
good,It's an international company so there is a lot of red tape to getting things done but otherwise a great place to work. The department for which I work seems to have a lack of work for my specific job title which is why I am looking elsewhere.
good,Productive place to work. Good work life balance. Sometimes can feel to big. Some of the problems with service team are not fixable under current business model. Amazon is threatening this business.
good,A complete job that kept me busy. Special project had beginnings and endings. I was hire to complete a special project but after project was kept on for new project that expanded my horizons.
good,"With hard work, the commissions and bonuses are lucrative. Strong emphasis on working with specialty reps (lab, equipment, IT, etc) to generate more sales and earn more money."
good,Great and fun company to work for :) lots of team building projects and great times at work & was a very positive place to work and safety was always first
good,"My time at Henry Schein was an adjustment. I had just retired from the Marines and was used to having young Marines jump when I asked them to do something. I learned that I needed to rely on my leadership skills that I learned while I was in the Corps to lead the people that worked with me. I enjoyed working for Henry Schein and wouldn't have left, but a job for the Government became available for the same warehouse experience that I had when I was on active duty. The hardest part of my job at Henry Schein was adjusting to the 15 ladies that I supervised and their personalities.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being their supervisor."
good,"Verify product and location"
good,"Both the jobs entailed a learning curve in all different facets including flexibility, customer service, dealing with co-workers and being consistent."
good,"A typical work day entails meeting with 10-12 orthodontic offices and doctors."
good,Henry Schein was by far one of the best companies I have ever worked for. They treat all employees with the utmost respect. They try and provide a team environment by engaging in monthly activities for everyone to join.
good,"Pretty standard internship. Lots of learning opportunities, but not somewhere to make a career. Location is terrible."
good,"A full day of taking and resolving queries via telephone from incorrect deliveries, faulty goods, account queries and payments by credit card. I have learnt to be polite and listen and keep calm under duress.                                                                                               To manage my daily work load and to be a loyal and useful member of the team."
good,"A typical day at work is taking incoming calls, trouble shooting error messages, and installing our software  by remoting into the computer."
good,"This is a great company and great place to work at. However, culture and standards differ drastically from department to department. It is relatively a laid-back environment and you aren't too challenged. While I am confident in my job security- I do not see much advancement in the horizon. Everyone who works here, stays here forever,"
good,"If you come in as a network/ hardware tech, you better know your tech skills. In our department we do a wide variety of IT tasks such as networking, removing viruses, help customers replace failed hard drives, and many other IT related tasks. The job is great for the experience and small team atmosphere."
good,"Vist my customers to discuss their purchases for the week, show them what is new and what we were promoting for the month. pick up any returns and discuss future business.  I did not work in the office I was on the road a lot. I love my customers and I feel very good when I could help solve their problems. The hardest part of the job is I could visit them and they would not buy anything for that day."
good,"This company has a great balance of being a large corporation, and taking care of its employees. I was given every opportunity to advance in my technical field as long as I kept showing progress. Make no mistake that this is a LARGE corporation that will let you go if you are a slacker, but if you have a decent work ethic and you want to be successful the sky is the limit. I had to relocate and there was no room for me in the area I wanted to move to. The skills and business acumen that I learned at Henry Schein have made me even more successful since leaving the company. If you are considering working for this company JUST DO IT!"
good,my typical day at work is as soon i entrance in the warehouse i make sure that everything is in work order. i always learn something new. there is no harder part in my job. the most enjoyable is when i accomplish all the task that they gave me through the day.
good,"great job"
good,"Great place to work, co-workers are great, like one big happy family. "
good,"Great company to work for. Great benefits, Great opportunity to advance and/or move to other departments."
good,"With an Enterprise Network system, a typical day was not to be expected. Handling large equipment purchases along with setups and installations were common. With a large technical team supporting all platform devices interacting with eachother would be ""typical""."
good,- Manage incoming calls
good,Henry schein was a  fun environment to work in.  the company had Lots of team Theme Days and Morale boosting give aways.  Left to  Pursue a career in the medical field but would return if it didnt work out.
good,"The work environment is very good, everyone there gets along and is very helpful towards each other. The job is very simple and easy. Anyone who likes to work on there own would like this job."
good,"I had great support, my supervisors were very understanding and supportive, were always willing to work with you in any personal matter. Change and advancement is important though.."
good,Productive workplace with a great atmosphere. Everyone cares about one another and management looks out for their workers.  There are opportunities for advancement with plenty of benefits.

good,"Great work life balance.  Management cares about us as individuals. "
good,Typical warehouse work with a positive team culture. Room for advancement if you are willing to show initiative. Large company with a small company feel.
good,"I loved working at Henry Schein.  Working hard and consistently performing at the top level allowed me to have a great work/life balance.  Management and the company culture were both excellent.    However, the compensation plan needs to be adjusted to reward top performers consistently growing their territories year over year.  The company also struggles with back orders."
good,It is a great place to work with good benefits. Various agile methods are practiced there. It's a Fortune 500 company with a good culture and a very good CEO.
good,"There is a lot of benefits to working for this company. It can be a little micromanaged since there is a lot of employees. It being such a large company can sometimes make you feel like your opinion doesn't matter. In turn though, it being a large company comes with the benefits of receiving enjoyable events at the locations."
good,"I am Happy to be a part of the team and it helped me to learn more about the technology."
good,"Enjoyable, relaxing and friendly. This company was organized and and was supportive in any questions that I had. They had good lunches and were supportive of the community."
good,I greatly enjoyed working for this place. The IT department was small but we were very well maintained and could handle any task with little struggle.
good,I really like the environment of where I work. Managers really care about the importance of having a work life AND a personal life.
good,A great company to work for with a very good work/life balance.  The company is very socially responsible with great community outreach programs.  There are a lot of opportunities for growth and promotion.  The culture is outstanding!
good,"Culture is great, excellent paid time off, and great work/life balance. One major con is they do not commonly promote from within but would rather higher outsiders for management positions."
good,Schein is a very family oriented company you can learn alot of skills and rub shoulders with great people. i had major health issue and my VP cared about me as an individual versus as an employee. the only bad this is the Salary and that's not the worse thing I think the major complaint is the fact that New York is ridiculously expensive so i honestly have no complaints about the company .
good,"Working here is great, you get treated like a professional. Downside is the parent company is too involved in the day to day decisions of Henry Schein Practice Solutions (subsidiary)."
good,"I worked for HSH in Australia, it was fair full time hours and good compensation. Working in the call center was very busy and nationwide so you weren't necessarily always taking care of customers in your city. Yet a very good way to gain experience in call center sales and customer service."
good,"Handle upwards of 80 plus inbound calls.  Assist customers with wide range of inquiries and requests.  Balance inquiries, payment requests, order status."
good,"Software based company. Customer service in several departments, received in-bound calls, updated databases, collections, made final financial decisions regarding customer accounts, tech service when requested."
good,"I worked at Henry Schein for 5 Months as a temp. The people are really nice and its really laid back, they will treach you new things (if you wanted to). you would work Monday-Friday and work some Saturdays"
good,"Working in a team of 2 we supply remote support for dental software and equipment to dentists across the country. All the software used is bespoke to the dental industry so much training is involved that has seen me travel to Europe to gain the knowledge required on a number of occassions. The firm in Cardiff includes about 50 team members from warehouse operatives to managers. "
good,"Repair and check Autoclaves"
good,Good stable company and really good work culture. Great benefits.
good,"Tech Central is a good place to work to increase your knowledge in IT. You can deal with anything from simple printer issues to mesh VPN's for Enterprise office's. A typical day is sitting in a cubicle taking tickets all day trying to knock down a queue of tickets. The hardest part about the job is the customers, some will be understanding and helpful and others will just have a nasty attitude. The most enjoyable part of the job is the environment, you are in a  team and everyone is helpful. Management is understanding as well. Overall Henry Schein is a decent company."
good,"At Henry Schein, i grew as an IT professional. I originally started in the warehouse but was given an opportunity to move into the IT Department where I started as an AS400 System Operator on the graveyard shift. Hard work and learning from my coworkers lead me into management where I became the Manager of Computer Services. At that position I was in charge of the data center and the ten employees who maintained it."
good,"Henry Schein ist nicht die am besten strukturierte Organisation, aber das bietet viele Möglichkeiten, an verschiedenen Projekten zu arbeiten und kreativ zu sein. Die Leute bleiben lange hier, da es ein sehr schönes Arbeitsumfeld ist."
good,"We had company pick-nicks, sometime bought us  lunch.. We got incentive checks every month if we hit the required numbers of 110% or higher all month long. We where aloud to work in othr departments if ours where slow and they needed help. All in all was a good palce to work."
good,Great Sales Meetings and Managers with great training for the Sales staff.  New product Launches were awesome through Marketing.  Sales Contests were plentiful.
good,"I would recommend to anyone interested in a job there. The culture is inviting, there is room for advancement, and compensation and benefits are very good."
good,"Great environment to work, coworkers are amazing, Company trains well, and great opportunity for growth pay included."

good,Was wonderful working there. Workplace culture was awesome and managers where so helpful. Willing to work with you if you have a emergency. Training seemed boring and short as well. But once you get on the floor and dive in that was the best way of learning the programs.
good,10 years in and happy with my Benefits. By far easiest commute to work and have learned the logistics of greater Houston. Experience great relationships with vendors and co-workers.
good,Great employee's ambitious to make an impact. I loved it here and was able to grow both personally and professionally. Highly recommend for others interested in improving their careers

good,"Société idéale pour apprendre et évoluer en équipe. Je recommande Schein, malgré un grand nombre dans la société et sans se connaître nous sommes une véritable famille. Les clients sont rois et toujours bien accueillis. C est avec plaisir que j ai géré les réclamations, les clients sont agréables et les solutions rapides."
good,i like to work at this company with good benefits and the environment. the only reason that i quit because i have family issue. i would recommend to work here.
good,"Wonderful place to work, great team work, great customers. This is a job that I look forward to going to each day, the management is great and very accomodating if issues arise."
good,I have had great work experience at Henry Schein.  The company offices are very nice and the company has excellent culture.  Henry Schein is a company you can see yourself staying with for a long time.
good,"It gives you tha ambition to try other job functions. This job also lets you show your work ethic, and also lets you work as a team. Overall you learn lots of new things about drug products."

good,"•	Prepared  spreadsheets and presentations for the business development group and executive board "
good,"Currently holding OPT and expires on May End, 2014, interning in Henry Schein Inc Global Coporate. (NASDAQ code: HSIC)."
good,Fantastic place to work. Very busy and a huge corporate identity.
good,"My job has to have a weekly agenda. Without one it is nearly impossible. I have learned to manage time management skills, people skills, and adaptive skills. The hardest part of my job is maintaining customer satisfaction while obtaining new business. The most enjoyable part of my job is making the customer happy."
good,Very dedicated employees who work hard to provide best products for health/dental clients. Management streamlines expenses to ensure company is profitable and continues to grow.
good,This is a wonderful place to work. Very friendly people who are deicated to assiting others.
good,It was an okay job if you like warehouses and working at a fast pace but most of the time they'll make you stay late till all work is done. The maintenance team is already set pretty much .
good,good until layoff They are now making me write 150 chracters to meet their guidlines for a review so i am just going to write nonsense as I think that I have decribed it adequately
good,Its definitely a good company to work for. The company though is unorganized and most employees do not communicate enough causing future issues to happen. But it is a great chance to learn how to be a service technician and to practice how to manage time during work and how to be independent as an employee.
good,Busy place. Van packed and out on the road. No wasting time. Job done and home. Usually finished by 2p.m. Trusted to do job and left to get on with it.
good,Great company to to work for! The benefits are exceptional. Management have been wonderful. Flexibility has been amazing. Looking for personal growth.
good,"Standard hours (830-5) and job training is important. Learned about the different divisions and culture of the office. Toughest part would be some of the office politics but that's normal corporate. Most enjoyable - probably depends on management but I have enjoyed working with the several teams, collaboration, training opportunities, and building up my skill sets."
good,"For the most part your supervisors will help you succeed and be placed where you want to be.  They encourage development, entrust you to do the work you have been tasked with."
good,"This is a great place to work. One of the best companies I have worked for. I learned a lot from this company. There a a few bad apples in management but overall the people in Dental side are awesome and some of the nicest people to work with. Two of the best supervisors are no longer there, so I am not sure how it is now. The medical side is the best side to be on and the hours are flexible. Training should be longer for all that you have to learn."
good,"A typical day is mostly full of work assignments, although there are  also some slow days. "
good,A typical day of work consists of coming in an picking orders for hospitals. What I learned was having time and patience for others merchandise. The management made me feel comfortable they made sure that they took time out of there day to speak to every employee each and everyday and It made me feel comfortable. My co workers made me strive to be a better picker. The hardest part was avoiding other pickers that came around me. The mose enjoyable part was that i was eager to work it was not a job for me because I felt comfotable each and everyday.
good,My day to day events are new adventures everyday!  I learn something new everyday and most of my co-workers are awesome!  The hardest part of my job is to avoid the rub off the negativity felt in the atmosphere. Love my job and particulars of who I work with!
good,"Good company, lots of work, long hours and good people"
good,Great company to work for.

good,"Management in USA are all good."
good,My job is very stressful dealing with repair techs and management and customers.  The hardest part of the job is scheduling dental offices for repairs needed when the techs are very busy helping other customers.  Everyone wants NOW!
good,Henry Schein is a great company with many great items to sell. The drawback with this company is the fact that they have many people in management that have never carried the bag or sold anything. They have great ideas that are just not real life in the trenches.
good,Great place to work. Loyalty is rewarded. Overall pay is at par with local wages. If you are good enough to work at Henry Schein you have got a job for life.
good,"I was on the road 95% of the time during my tenure, but it was always a pleasant atmosphere at the office whenever I was there  I worked completely un-supervised, therefore I only dealt with management once a year ( budget forecast). Co-workers were very respectful . Most enjoyable part of the job-Making the big sale !"
good,"Great place to work, great company, good ethos and culture."

Every one is friendly to each other and the higher ups are friendly too
good,"•Fast-paced."
good,Good company to work for but lot of rules and micro management. Upper management is better than middle. Middle management is promoted within but no management skills. A lot of long time employees with clicks/favorites. Not good hr.

good,Great environment. A lot of support when needed from co-workers and management team.  Weekly training to stay up to date in the dental and medical world.
good,You need to be able to multi task. High volume phones and emails. I enjoy building relationships with the technicians and offices I dispatch for. I've learned how to be more empathetic to office's needs.

I considered them challenges, and I always met those challenges, which  I thoroughly enjoyed."
good,"Making sure that all changes to the production systems meet both the User and requirements expectations."
good,"There is always something to do. Weather it is an installation, service or troubleshooting of equipment. The company provides training for most of the equipment we work with. Training is usually done by the vendors we work with. Managers are pretty straight forward and approachable. there are many traits within our center, such as IT's, installers and service providers (trouble shooters). The hardest thing at times is having to deal with contractors who are in charge of preparing the site before the installation of new equipment. What is hard about it is that sometimes the traits that work for the contractors are not ready by time we have to be installing albeit the most enjoyable part is that we constantly move from site to site and are not static much."

good,"I spent my time working for the eservices arm of the Dentrix dpt at Henry Schien. I was not restricted by the normal time restraints most companies have for in coming calls. This lifted a large part of the stress off of me as I felt I was allowed the time needed to troubleshoot and solve the problem on the first call by the customer rather than having to give them a band-aid fix and hope they did not have to call back later. Management always supported their staff and were accommodating when I ran life changes outside of the office. The staff were generally laid back and positive as whole.  "

At Henry Schein I learned how to plan, organize and implement effective strategies using all company programs, tools and initiatives to increase market share in Merchandise, Equipment, Technology and Service.I also have maintained professional and consistent communication with my Regional Manager on a weekly basis. He has helped me a great deal in my two years with Henry Schein by showing me what activities to perform with certain customers. The hardest part of the job I would say is trying to discover/win new business. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the leisure of not having a set in stone schedule every day outside of appointments with doctors."
