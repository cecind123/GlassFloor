rating,review
bad,"The workers stand on their phones most of the time and the managers are rude and racist. I was forced to close every night despite having early classes. I had to pick up the slack from my fellow workers, and often got blamed when they didn’t do their job."
bad,"I was scheduled to work one HOUR per WEEK. There were cockroaches in the kitchen, like BIG cockroaches. Management was poor. There was no such thing as gender equality as women were forced to work up front and men worked in the kitchen. I was forced to clean the men's bathroom even though it was triggering for me. I learned that fast food is a terrible job to have. Management yelled at me and did not train me hands-on."
bad,Everything changed not for the good longer hours for not enough money not getting enough time in between shifts ex 6pm to 4am then coming back into work at 10am
bad,"If you would like to work for a company like CGN (McDonald franchise) that lack total disregard for your mental health wellbeing or general health then you have applied for the right job! Oh not forgetting the back stabbing and immature playground acts from what they would like to call ""professional crew."""
bad,They take advantage of the hard work you do and fire you over petty reasons. Hours are not flexible. You will be called in on tour days off. Always short-staffed.
bad,"No company to work for meant for children or people without families they don't pay enough and managment is so disrespectful and literally thieves"
bad,"The good is I have plenty of time for family, the bad is I only get 12 hours a week, and only make 8$ an don't get hours cause they say they don't have the hours but keep hiring, a few of the managers just stand around as the worker does everything alone"
bad,"They hired family members, and gave people over 40 hours and hired new people. When the people who work there didn't have any hours at all. The managers never get their job. No 30-day review no 60 day review no yearly review I made it 24 year. It was very organized so I wanted to pursue my career. And with that I had to resign."
bad,"I've been working for McDonald's for a while and recently got fired simply because I had something of concern I  wanted to bring up with upper management. I've always put in my all hoping maybe things would get better here but they don't. They ridicule you for your work, mistreat you, and will not listen to reason. All I have to say is stay away from this place if you want to just live a decent life."
bad,"All McDonald's are awful places to be an employee. Pay is awful, working conditions are awful, the customers are awful, and if you even get slightly behind you will be hounded to **** and back."
bad,"The managers are lousy.  I'm a crew trainer and turned down the management position  because of the way it is.  People get singled out, the harder you work and the better you are at ur job, the worse your time is there.  They let some people skate by but overwork the crew who aren't lazy."
bad,Great work environment. Opportunities for advancement and further college education with education reimbursement benefits. Opportunities to make a difference in community.
bad,"I recommend you only work here if you plan on staying briefly. There is no point staying. Managers are inept and don't care, everyone talks behind your back, nobody cares from top to bottom, the place is dirty and is rarely cleaned properly. They cut full-time workers hours when university students return so you're not working the amount of time you should be. You're made to stay on almost every shift because it's so badly run they can't get you out on time. Just a terrible, boring, thankless job I wouldn't recommend to anyone (unless you just need a quick temporary job, in which case take in then leave ASAP)."
bad,Tråkig attityd från folket. Stressigt. Man lär sig tåla stress.
bad,I enjoy working but the hours are short I used to work 3-10pm and yet just found out I had my schedule changed and now I work 3-7pm I don't understand why my hours have been cut.
bad,"Was there 3yrs....Had 2 wounderful yrs there,the last yr I was there got new mgrs dat didnt know wut they were doing they always called me to help,so i did even thou i was crew and NOT MGR.."
bad,"I learned alot working for mcdonalds. Customer service, food safety ect. Overall its a good job to have as a teenager since you can work flexible hours."
bad,"i've been promise a promotion many times and they have given it to others who worked less and haven't been there as long as me. Many times i was also promise a ride to a McDonald and a ride home, either they forgot about me or they were never told that so i would have ride home, so i would have to pay for a cab."
