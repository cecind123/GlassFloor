bad,"Terrible upper management leadership, unstable and hostile work environment. Harassment of employees & bullying "
bad,"I worked 90 to 100+ hours/week every single week for six months and although I successfully delivered on requirements of my position, I was quickly burning out. I formally complained internally about oppressive work environment, inaccurate position description, and my direct manager's hostile behavior. MMA terminated me without notice and denied my request for unemployment insurance benefits. My experience with MMA may not be common; however, I know of at least one other employee who experienced similar. Proceed with caution: MMA's business is to provide professional HR consulting services and is an employment law expert. I unfortunately learned that as a salaried employee I had no legal protection. MMA can legally require employees to work 100+ hours per week. Be aware of the differences in the written position requirements versus those communicated verbally. Get everything in writing and remember HR protects the company, not its employees."
bad,Marsh and Mccleannan ok company to work for. It is a friendly relaxed working environment. The company has a workout facility and ping pong area. It is a ok place
bad,No advancement and lack management of people and operations. Over worked and now concepts of how to run a call center. Poor place to work will make you have mental health issues
bad,"Bij dit bedrijf ben ik meer dan blij om weg te gaan, gezien ze heel zwakke bedrijfscultuur hebben die op favorietisme gebasseerd is. Als je er niet Europees uitziet of Afrikaanse roots hebt, bent mag je vergeten dat je daar promotie gaat maken of gelijk wordt behandeld. Zoveel vormen van verdoken racisme en altijd op een subtiele manier. Ben je een trouwe volgeling zonder eigen mening of redeneringsvermogen, ben je daar zeker welkom."
bad,This place is poorly structured and there is too much favoritism and a lack of support.  Some leaders are doing more than others.  We're given more tasks with no increase in pay not to mention we're already underpaid.
bad,This was a great place to work but management has ruined it.  We're micromanaged to the point of infantilization. Pay has not kept up with inflation. Very little opportunity for advancement.
bad,Mercer marketplace is not a work envirionment i would recommend to any one that has a family with children and has to pay for daycare. I was forced to resign from this company because they would not accommodate a shift change that i had asked for due to a babysitting issue with my daughter
bad,"It was a typical  customer service environment. It was fun, and they did fun motivational activities. I just did not like being tied to a phone all day. This was an in between job for"
bad,"If you like to work the job of three people while getting paid for less than one, then this is the place for you. From the poor discernment shown by the management to the lack of career advancement (although they will sell you a pipe dream during the interview that you have “room to grow”) there really isn’t a good reason to work here. The structure is poorly set up and the producers who know NOTHING of insurance are praised as God’s while all the real work is placed on the unfortunate soul that becomes the assigned Account Executive. "
bad,MMA is not run like MMC. The culture is still an all boys club. They second guess your work. Management has a tendency to put you down. Producer are treated as kings.
bad,NO training. NO support. Supervisors are allowed to run wild and do whatever they want. If you report anything you will be fired. Job descriptions are completely false. Nothing enjoyable about the job whatsoever. No one takes personal responsibility for anything.
bad,"good place to start at, not a good place to stay. Employer is not incentivized to promote their employees here. They would rather find someone to fill a position and stay there forever."
bad,"Terrible blame culture, processes that simply don't work and demanding managers who constantly seem stressed.  I don't think I need say any more."
bad,"this was the worst ""sales"" job i have ever had.  they want to pretend they are not selling insurance. horrible leadership.  this is not MARSH it is a smaller insurance broker bought out by the larger parent company."
bad,"Chaotic work environment. Dysfunctional leadership team. Employees are not valued by the company. Employees are expected to work long hours, weekends, and holidays. Employees are viewed as expendable and disposable."
bad,Lots of learning about insurance
bad,Great vacation benefits and Holidays off.  No clear career path.  Job description very different than job.  High turnover at all levels.  Annual review inconsistent and shallow because of turnover in management.
bad,"Dead end job at a place where you will be under appreciated and have very few opportunities to move up.  If you are desperate for a job, this may be the place for you to go, but not a long-term stop."
bad,"Pros"
bad,Nothing more to provide than what has already been said.  I am not interested in reviewing Marsh as they are not a company that deserves any more from me.
bad,"At first glance this seems like a really promising place to work - Fortune 500, ""advancement opportunities"", etc, but that's all false advertising. This place will crush your soul, will power and creativity. People who are stuck here become ""lifers"", fat and unresponsive. They do not pay half as well as they should given the stress of the job, there is a very obvious double standard in the office, and there is no respect for anyone. There are cliques, as if you were back in Middle School, and expect to be called out on your clothes because of a ""dress code"" that is ambiguous. Don't expect a promotion unless you are deeply involved with one of the friend groups with supervisors in it because favoritism is rampant. Frankly I could go on and on with reasons to avoid this company at all costs, but it would seem like I'm ranting. Before committing to work here, ask to speak to some of the employees to get a feel for their day - let that speak for itself."
bad,"They are only about money and how to make them more.. the management doesn't care, you are just a number. If you want to work at a huge company this is your place"
bad,It’s basically data entry cold  and quiet work environment. The CFO of the building doesn’t incorporate culture just agrees with it. The training was absolutely too long and boring. The job is not interested.
bad,management will not listen to you. They will defend the Manager even if they are wrong. They also do not take time for you. You will have to request several meetings before they will find time for you
bad,"Antiquated insurance systems, approach, and mentality. Didn't see myself growing here. Very stressful environment with Account Executives looking over your shoulder or bringing items to your attention - almost grade school like. Very condescending  tones from superiors right on the work floor. Just never felt comfortable there. No real training support structure and my coworker was NOT much of a help. Typical day starts of where you left off on renewal presentation  or exhibits to make sure you are displaying the value that goes on when broker shops plans, etc.. I honed in more on formatting and excel skills which is a must there. My AE was very hardworking individual, with that said very hard to please and nit-picky which I get.  My manager was never around always at another sister office which was closer. The hardest part of the Job is juggling the various RFP responses from all the different carriers and staying on top of these carriers to make sure deadlines are met and finding time to insert or update Benefit Point, which is a very antiquated records/ filing system if I must say.  I cannot honestly think of one thing that was enjoyable."
bad,They allow their managers to treat their assistance however they want.  When you have a problem with a manager you have no one that will listen to you.
bad,"This organization did not run as a meritocracy.  It was all about nepotism.  Advancement was only offered to those who were ""connected"".  They are elitist and do not care about diversity.  Racism was very strongly felt there during my tenure."
bad,This place is a horrible company to work for if you have a family or want anything to do outside of work..they do not work with the employees and demand more then what they pay for!
bad,"Employees were more knowledgable about their jobs than upper management, very political. Micro-management is the management style. Constant lay-offs and turn-overs."
bad,"After almost 6 years of dedicated service to the firm, got laid off my first day back from maternity leave. Heartless management with no appreciation for their employees. During the 6 years only got 1 raise which i'm sure is way behind the industry standard. Would not recommend working here."
bad,"Cut-throat, back-stab culture facilitated by senior management.  Very disappointing that no one owns up to it!  Just depends who you know and who knows you."
bad,They have had so many mergers the pretty country boys from Texas faught internally! Little to no respect given to employees for thinking outside the box! Too many college and church/ synagogue relationships brought into this professional business. Very clickish and unqualified management. You’ll leave there with a full set of steak knives in your back!
bad,"There is little room for advancement, you do not have the supervisor backing, if you go to HR with anything they back the supervisors over all else.  They do have groups you can work with, but if service levels, or your adherence is not on par then you can forget about being a part of them.  They always offer better opportunities to the new hires instead of helping out those that have been there longer."
bad,"Marsh and McLennan Companies is the premier global professional services firm, providing advice and solutions in the areas of risk, strategy and human capital. Through our market leading brands, and approximately 50,000 colleagues in more than 100 countries, Marsh & McLennan Companies helps clients identify, plan for and respond to critical business issues and risks."
bad,"Good place to go for a job to get another job , not worth staying there ."
bad,"MMC one of the best company to work for.  The people were great and I enjoyed my traveling while working for this global international company."
bad,Didn't work with me when it came to the hours as promised so I had to quit.
bad,Love greeting customers in person. Learned a great deal about the Insurance Industry. My coworkers depended on my skills to do their job. Fun place to work and liked everyone I worked with.
bad,Worked there for about 4 years. I recall many times LARGE layoffs was common (even before I arrived). The only way you knew you were getting the ax? You would get a voice mail on your phone Monday morning..... how's that for heartless?
bad,"Nice people except the management.  Didn't receive ANY training.  I started on a Tuesday, and my supervisor went on vacation/meetings for 2 weeks.  Didn't bat an eye when it came time to throw me under the bus for being behind in my work, except for the fact, I had no idea what my work was!  Pay is good but the stress is NOT worth it!"
bad,"A company with great benefits and employees. "
bad,"Several of the upper management had very questionable ethics. I was glad to leave. The company overall was good, but I learned not to trust the management team in Urbandale."
bad,"Management makes you feel like you are a kid in the principals office always lurking and staring at you when you try to have even a tiny bit of a social talk with colleagues. A few cents of a raise annually. No Christmas bonuses or any kind of bonus. No company holiday parties or picnics. Morale can be unbearable there. If you want to advance to an actual better department, you'd have to move you and your whole family. Very inconvenient."
bad,"Great place to work if they shake down the leads attitude towards analyst. They always treat you as slacking. Newbs are treated as you are working there for 10 years. No down time unless it's holiday. the moment you hang the phone, You cannot do anything else but be available for the next caller or chat. Cannot do anything else like finish your ticket after a call, because the leads will be checking up on you once they see you not available for phone or chat even for 5 secs. The leads should be eliminated or at least be trained how to use a brain. This is the reason why they always look for new employees. Analysts come and go. At the moment, Their recruiters are in full swing looking for analysts.  I receive 5 phone calls in a week from recruiters trying to find analysts to work for them. I declined all of them. This job gave me trauma. I was smiling knowing how this job and not surprise why no one wants to work there. Only unsuspecting first timers gets lured to work there. I was that person once. Aside from it all, It a  great paying dead end job."
bad,"good environment to work, very stressful during open enrollment"
bad,Une entreprise où la formation est bonne. Les salaires sont un peu plus bas que sur le marché. Une bonne expérience pour un début dans le monde du travail.
bad,"Soliciting and closing sales... some support but for the wrong reasons... "
bad,"My typical day involved setting up computers, prioritizing and managing service requests, and doing my best to retain a calm and pleasant demeanor. Management is DEFINITELY budget oriented. While working as an IT representative, it quickly became apparent that IT is managed by distinctly non-IT types, focused on their bottom lines versus everything else. If you prefer a corporate environment where you are viewed as merely a number, this is the perfect place for you!"
bad,No respect for work life balance. Management have a very old school culture. Will check swipe reports to see what time senior professionals show up to the office. Lots of CYA and politics.
bad,I liked marsh when Don marsh owened the company but when he sold it we lost benifits.we went thru a lot of managers at the store.But other tyhan that i liked my coworkers in the hole store.
bad,"A typical day was obtaining quotes from carriers, reviewing the coverage lines and completing a proposal for the clients. "
bad,"Major policies not followed by managers, HR not responsive to employees' requests and comments, disconnect between sections, toxic culture in the office."
bad,The managers are not understanding of school. They are also socially awkward and made physical advances towards me.
bad,"When I started working for this company over two years ago it had its problems for sure, very poor training and little to no support for new employees. In the time that I've been there I have never received a raise. They give you certain goals to reach in order to meet a quality payout which I reached almost every month last year. Then they changed it this year to where it's impossible to reach. So not only have I never gotten a raise I can never get a payout either. They give you information to review and then change it during the middle of the game. It does have its pros I get to work from home but if I could find another place to go I would. This employer has really gone downhill. I know of others have been there many years and they can't believe how bad the company has become!"
bad,"After almost 12 years there, all I can say is that colleagues are the only good thing left. Everything else is going down. The culture working there is demoralizing. Employees feel that cannot have an opinion or they might find themselves in unemployment line soon. They expect too much and give so little."
bad,International company that does not particularly show interest in the South African employee. Poor local culture management. HR have little or no interest in the welfare of the employees.
bad,"Company offers great benefits but little in the way of compensation, growth, training, promotion or job transfers. Call center environment can be stressful. Often felt unsupported by mgmt."
bad,"Nothing positive to say about this employer. Probably the most negative experience in my career history. Would not recommend them to my friends. Management was not organised, decisions slow to make"
bad,"This job is great but the leadership will drive you out. Advancement is a joke. Promotions are based on friendship not performance. This job could have been the dream place to work if they booted the leadership and started fresh. "
bad,overtime and outsourcing  you are wearing many hats and the does not match the salary. when management is having trouble with a project it is outsource to India with a 15000 staff ready to do your job.
bad,"Marsh is very much like a private club. I was hired to become the Director of Global Business Development for Marsh Multi-National Client Service. Internal politics prevented that and Was offered a position as a ""producer""."
bad,Poor team morale. Very disjointed. Communication and feedback poor. Zero on-boarding experience. Assumptions were made without asking. Manager lives in different state and uses Lync to babysit.
bad,"Big company and a good place to work if you end up in the right team. Very corporate environment, lots of politics, and bad management for the most part."
bad,"though the work is chalenging and fun, there is not enough support for growth of subodinates from management"
bad,"The interview process took 4+ months before start date."
bad,"I think it all depends on who you support, though I must say the small amount of time I worked there i regret everyday.  The orientation, oh there isn’t any you have to figure all the set up IT access on your own and IT takes forever to respond. Manager was the rudest person I’ve ever worked with, no diversity at all and for the few that are minorities forget about career advancement you will just get the song and dance and then eventually be ignored. I really hope that they clean this place out and start from scratch."
bad,Hard to advance and little in the way of salary increases or bonuses. Heavy workloads and not enough support. Some managers not interested in their people.
bad,"Constantly understaffed. The ""do more with less"" approach is pushed to a point of extreme inefficiency. Quality is constantly disregarded for quantity, so things are rarely done right the first time. Reporting and metrics are manipulated to make it appear that things are better than they actually are."
bad,This is a big company that is only looking for low pay seekers.  They are a stepping stone onto bigger and better.  I did like my job until I found out what other companies were paying for what I was doing as an Account Rep.
bad,"It is was an outstanding employment opportunity."
bad,"this was a horrible job but this department is long gone, not sure what I'm ament to say about it, was over 8 years aho that I worked there.... have nothing to say"
bad,"Very serious, all business place to work"
bad,"The office is downsizing with fewer people in the office, there are fewer group activities.  Most communication is by email.  The company has good benefits which are being taken away slowly."
bad,Too much politics. They do promote and advance people to offer roles in the company
bad,"Co-workers are nice, but management is almost nonexistent. Workday is routine, but easy. It is easy to loose interest."
bad,"Worked 40hrs a week with assisting people with life and health insurance. Learned about different associations that Mercer is the third party administrator for. Supervisors are helpful but you have to go way out of your way to get help when needed, they tend to sit and chat when not in meetings. Work place was fun with fun and knowledgeable co-workers. Hardest part of the job is the stats you have to meet per month. Favorite part of job is making a difference for the members of the associations."
bad,I was just in a job that didn't fit my personality. There didn't seem to be a team culture and everyone just did their own thing and didn't communicate or help each other out.
bad,"Chaotic - Stressful - No Training - No Managerial Feedback - Office fosters a culture of territorial, back biting, and untrustworthy 'colleagues' and managers.  Colleagues and managers are approached for their input on your progress, but appraisals are secretive and therefore are often personally motivated and not professional.   "
bad,Company seems to try really hard at being a great place to work but in my opinion fails miserably. If you are not a part of the inner circle then you pretty much get no where fast. Management does not encourage individual thinking but rewards a follow the leader style employee. As with most companies minorities in a position of leadership are very few if any.
bad,"At the Marsh Austin office, the hard workers eventually get frustrated and go elsewhere. The just-okay employees that stick around long enough will eventually get promoted to supervisors. The terrible ones get away with being terrible for far too long. Compensation is low and those in New York think it is just fine. But sometimes there is a chance to win a $10 gift card! Benefits, like medical and 401(k) and vacation time, are pretty good. Lots of annoying people as co-workers and a mix of great and terrible people in the offices we work with around the company."
bad,"I really enjoyed the contract role I had at Marsh and McLennan.  Lots of work and not micro managed.  My contract was extended for one month. Right before the end of the contract though things with management got sketchy. One employee terminated, one out on short term disability. two veterans quickly up and left, one position eliminated.  There was so much work to do and only about five employees left to cover the load. I do not have a clear understanding as to what is going on with management and the team."
bad,Poorly run IT teams - good workers running around different directions...Not a recommended employer
bad,Supervisors are unprofessional cursing loudly on the call floor and playing favorites. Everything is about stats and has nothing to do with taking care of the actual end user. Skills are limited by you position and opportunities are very limited. Contract companies will sell you this position as a permanent position when they know for a fact that it's not. Was questioned by the employer whether my contract agency had provided answers to the tech test. Others had.
bad,The WL balance is decent in the IT departments but there's not much upward movement. They always hire externally so employees don't really have an advantage.  There's virtually no bonuses and the pay increases are under the annual avaergae.
bad,"Really depends on which group /OpCo you’re in. However, compensation sucks across the board and there is a tremendous amount of turnover. Senior management (MMC level C-Suite) is very capable however their ideas don’t get translated down the ranks into the OpCos."
bad,"Job was great in the beginning but over the years many things change and it became very, very stressful."
bad,"Like with most companies, they ended up with production and profitability issues and ended up with a company that cared more about the bottom line than their employees"
bad,Stressful place to work. Required long hours regularly. Last minute deadlines. No team collaboration. The pay and PTO was poor. The benefits and leave management team was terrible.
bad,"Marsh is not a company that I would personally want to work for again.  The people are nice, middle management at the time I worked there, which was long ago, were pretty clueless."
bad,"The atmosphere is courteous but not fun. "
bad,"Relatively good pay but very poor work culture."
bad,"Could have been much better, but routine stood in the way of large scale advancement."
bad,"I was required o go through my emails every day and prioritise the important ones, after I had established what the urgent priorties already were."
bad,I did many different things at this company that was not told to me on the interviews. The employees were very rude and it wasn't a great place to work.
bad,There are not enough future opportunities in Toronto office including all sister companies of MMC. hard working employees are laid off and employees with no dedication towards their job are given raise. Lot of office politics.
bad,I would not recommend MMC if you cannot handle frequent change. Due to the nature of the business change is often and it is a very fast paced complex company.
bad,"Fielding questions and concerns regarding healthcare plans for numerous companies.   I learned in great detail the nusiances of health care plans, which is very beneficial to my age group.  My co-workers were in their 20's and 30's, looking to move up in the company.   The hardest part of the job was the lack of training and skilled supervisors.   The most enjoyable part was helping customers to utilize the maximum benefits of their plan."
bad,"Once there i was to refill and maintain product while serving customers quickly and friendly. I have learned many ways to care for food products with safety and freshness. Also how to work a large fryer,slicer, oven and proofer. Management was kind of hit and miss, we constantly went though new store managers. Aside from that most managers where pretty friendly and level-headed. The hardest part of the job is definitely being the only baker per day, there is a lot expected to be done by my scheduled time. The most enjoyable part of this job would have to be my co-workers, they are very friendly and helpful.  "
bad,"At first glance this is a great company, Just don't expect to get promoted or a pay increase. After 4 years I have only gotten one raise that equated to .38 cents a day."
bad,"The name of the company was Marsh, Day & Calhoun.  Somehow it is misspelled here.  The company disbanded years ago."
bad,"Very hard to advance, even after years of proven good work. It is a discouraging place to work."
bad,Company can't keep up with other companies regarding pay for same work. Either they can't or they won't. Never sure as not a lot of info is passed down to lower level employees.
bad,"I enjoyed working for TRION the company i answered the phones for however they closed this department so I went to work in the claims area,. I am not one to sit at a desk and process claims I need to be more mobile."
bad,Well respected name.  I do believe if you are not of a certain demographic promotions and access to clients can be difficult.  Generous with vacation time.
bad,"Assist members with all billing needs including understanding of bills and taking                     payments for insurance. Assisted with major medical, life, disability and indemnity plans. Advised members on covered benefits and how to file claims. Assisted to understand EOB's and how to obtain needed information for claims processing."
bad,A good place to work with friendly and caring people having the opurtunity to do the xeroxing of mayor projects for clients make sure mail is delivered
bad,"customer service At Marsh I was responsible for greeting customers, stocking shelves, running cash register. This job taught me to work well with others along with the public and multitasking."
bad,A typical day would involve me bagging groceries and bringing in carts. Learn the value of a dollar. Managment was really strict. Co workers were nice and funny. The hardest part was pushing carts and the most enjoyable was the co workers.
bad,"My experience with MMC was as a contractor. The work itself is great; lots of huge databases, always something to do and they perpetuate a very cooperative work environment. In the initial interview, was told this was contract to hire, and that everyone who made it through the 6mo would be offered a job. Each month, I asked the direct supervisor and her boss for feedback on my performance, and what I could do to improve myself. Each month was told there wasn't enough time to schedule a meeting/you're doing great, keep it up/I'll let you know if I hear anything/etc. Fast forward to 2 weeks before the end of the contract, and I'm called by my recruiter to tell me ""today is your last day."" Needless to say, communication with management was non-existent."
good,"Supportive in continuing education. Work loads do not appear to be equal among all account managers. Most all employees work well together. Some employees are more helpful than others. "
good,A strict work environment. Focused on its clients only. Interesting experience.
good,"* Many insurance practices. Lots of knowledge on the insurance industry."
good,"I think it's fair to say, this is not a company to be trusted. The money is great; but my life, sanity and family is priceless. This company gives great resources for your job but horrible management. The management is fake, unprofessional, and plays favorites."
good,"Anywhere but IT Marsh is a wonderful company, Do not work in the IT department the IT dept. (MGTI). is filled with big heads who compete to be the guy who knows it all. They are like dogs at feeding time. "
good,"International company. Monthly activities which was only implemented last May 2017. Work environment."
good,This orgainization has a great corporate social responsibilty.  The managers are supportive and encouraging.  There is good energy and the very skillful people working for this company. They practice conducting business in a responsible manner.
good,a chance to view artifacts from different cultures and Countries
good,"Al entrar en el trabajo tenia que prepararme en mi puesto para poder empezar a atender a los clientes."
good,Lack of management support. Hectic around every quarter due to renewals.
good,"I cried at my desk all the time. The work isn't bad just the atmosphere, no one talks or cares about anyone else. There really isn't any support for new people like they claim and asking questions seems to be more of a bother than anything."
good,A typical day consists of first reviewing my emails and responding to my clients.  Then I handle inbound calls from my clients abotut their insurance policy.  I process all of the policy changes either thru the carrier website or I will send them an email.  Next I will review policies that are coming up for renewal to see if they need to be remarketed.  Next I quote and issue new business policies for my existing clients.  As needed I would prepare summaries and resolve and problems.
good,Worked remotely
good,Nothing I'd like to review.  I'm no longer there for a reason.  This company does not care about their long term employees. Find some else to review this company
good,"There is not a whole lot to say. Nothing really stands out to really share that is good nor bad. I do seem to think sometimes the company maybe stepping back in time, instead of preparing for the future. Every company is different on how they operate."
good,A typical day at MMC is your stereotype 9-5 sit in a cube all day. I know sitting in my desk what my duties and tasks are for the day. Work load wise some days will be heavier then others.
good,"Unfortunately the position was not what I expected ."
good,I believe management lost their direction.  They do not seem to care much about the employees.  Some of the best and brightest people I have worked with I met at Putnam/MMC and like me they moved on.  It's a shame really.  The people that are still there are always looking for a job just in case.  The only reason they stay is because they have years of service combined from Putnam Investments that transitioned over to MMC.
good,"Typical work day is collaborative and fast paced. "
good,I have been Mitie employee for about three years now and my overall conclusion is that there are no career prospects within this company. It is a great stepping stone if you are coming from non client service based background.
good,Make sure you negotiated upfront. Interview the manager you would report to. Discuss your growth and development from the beginning. Give yourself the time to get familiar with the Marsh Way.
good,Marsh is good place to start a carer but once there it is very difficult to move up the ladder. It is a high pace environment which allow to learn very fast but once you reach the top on your position it is very difficult to move across so you can advance.
good,"this was a call center, so it was very overwhelming to meet all the time requirements that was expected to meet.  "
good,work on about 5-7 different clients at a time which each client about about 1000 people. was a temp employee and felt just like that. didn't feel welcomed..
good,"Worked for a while, grew and learned a lot here, but it is now time to move on as I no longer feel like its the right fit for me."
good,"Not a bad place if you end up in the right Operating Company/team. However, Management is not great, and the environment is pretty cut-throat. Too much politics and red tape."
good,The team is great and supportive. It is challenging to recommend improvements to some managers.
good,"Good company, great history and reputation. Very good place to learn a lot and make a difference. Great people and understanding work environment."
good,The job turned out not as described during the interview.  The account manager was a very nice person but didn't have a clue on how to train for this position.  The account manager went on vacation 2 wks after I started.
good,"Very fast paced, some floors had a ping pong table."
good,It was a hard job being hired and told that your job is not required to cross sale and that would eventually play a big role in your job. It was amazing helping families during difficult times.
good,"Company keeps you busy and working in different sections.  It does help you build your personality, work ethic, and character.  Some jobs just do not allow you have small children, this is one of them."
good,"Nice colleagues and nice office, good location. Given opportunity to involved in transition or migration of finance jobs from Asean and Pacific countries."
good,a lot of favoritism and very unorganized. Not willing to adapt to new changes and ideas. The pay is low but there is job security.
good,"Integrations of multiple technologies"
good,In actuarial group very disorganized poor leadership and insight into where career can go.
good,"We've accepted your return request. Once we receive the item, we'll issue your refund."
good,"Good for benefits, the people I work with are helpful.  They usually hire people from the outside when it comes to management. I've been there over 10 years and looking to advance."
good,"Very large company with lots of perks. Travel opportunities galore. Competitive compensation package. All the autonomy one might want as long as job is done. Not many internal advancement opportunities but still a great place to build up the resume with new skills and refining old ones. TA and Reimbursement plans are offered for continuing education up to a Masters (relating to your position).   "
good,"The job provided an opportunity to work with intelligent and caring individuals.  However, a very large company where upper-level management sees employees as a number rather than a human being.  Increasingly there are diminishing returns in the form of compensation and benefits paid to early to mid-career employees."
good,Work is being transitioned to India. No new clients are being brought in. Pension plans are dying out and so is job at company. Very independent work. Do not know co-workers
good,"fast pace and large work load"
good,"Internship lasted for 6 months. Learned the basics of helpdesk and desktop support. Management was very relaxed and supportive, which led to me having a great internship experience."
good,"Workplace culture changes from dept to dept. In finance long hours are not only typical but required. Finance systems don't seem to be adequate, a lot of manual/excel work. "
good,"Marsh is a great company to work for. I was laid off and have nothing negative to say about the company. Working there was very fast past ,which I loved it kept me busy - since I love being busy , it was great ."
good,"My direct supervisor shows favoritism to certain employees and when this was brought to the manager, it was brushed aside and nothing has been done.  Moral is very low in our department and makes it very difficult to want to go to work.  With our previous supervisors, things were much better, but since the change, it has not been the same.  Previous supervisors were willing to work with the employees to help them advance their careers, while current supervisors are only concerned with what work is being done and tracking every second of our day."
good,"very fast paced environment, learned a lot. management wasn't the best but overall it was an okay place to work. you work one hour more then a typical 8 hour job."
good,"The communication within the company as a whole, not good.  Your job security, not good. The pay was ok. The benefits were ok. The people in my department were great to work with."
good,Many times the ones who work the hardest were given extra work while others played.Some were given the option to work from home while others had to come in office only because they did not find the time to get approval for other staff.
good,Many employees appear to be overworked with a heavy schedule of travel. Internal culture varies drastically by office between laid back and formal. Compensation stagnates after initial hire with extremely regimented advancement schedule. Firm viewpoint to be turnover resilient so that each person who leaves can be easily replaced creates atmosphere of low individual value.
good,"I would arrive earlier than my shift, and begin sorting mail, and I would sort items that needed to be scanned and assign them to the appropriate person. I also answered inbound calls, and produced large print/bind requests. I learned a lot more about different software and how to utilize them. The most challenging aspect of working for Marsh McLennan was that there was not much value assigned to employees. The most rewarding thing was the commaraderie amongst  the employees."
good,Typical day consists of troubleshooting desktop application issues.  Well planned projects.  Most enjoyable part of my day is when someone is genuinely happy and thankful for the service received.  Hardest part is when users are impatient.
good,There is not a lot of growth opporuntunity or interanl movement.Your experience is really shaped by your team and manager - though I don't know many people that are happy working at this company. It really needs a cultural over haul.
good,no job safety but a fun place to work at i had a great boss and there is a lot of positions to choose from however there is no full time opportunities
good,This is a typical producer job divided into middle market and national market type accounts.  Could use some help with on boarding new producers and sales training.
good,"A typical day would usually include greeting the office staff and any present managers, and signing in for duty. Once at my assigned register the wait for a customer begins! Unless it happens to be a busier day. I walk to the front of the lane to make sure any nearby customers are ready for checkout/or need assistance. During a transaction, I and my bagger/service clerk ask questions to ensure the customer is happy with the end result of the shopping trip, while also maintaining a steady RPM (ring per minute). In between customers I converse appropriately with my coworker. I smile all day, but almost every work day without fail, my customers and their children/grandchildren make me smile and feel appreciated, which of course makes any bad day better."
good,"Valoran la cantidad de trabajo o llamadas atendidas pero no la calidad de la mismas."
good,"A typical day would be for me to go in and slice deli meat, clean the fryer, and windows as well as cook chicken and clean slicers. I would go in on nights and make the donuts. "
good,"Beaucoup de grands comptes a gerer mais peu de moyen."
good,"Typical large company atmosphere . Not many advancement opportunities if not willing to do a sales/client facing based function. Sad truth is upper management would rather keep someone incompetent employed who will suck up, and let good workers go/walk out. Poor stance from Sr. Leadership lets personal achievements for the greater good of the company go overlooked based on your personal appearance."
good,"Only point person in the NY office on the 3rd shift. Worked alone. Rest of the team was in Franklin, MA."
good,Smart people are few and far in between. Work life balance is good so if you are retiring in the next 5 years this is the place for you.
good,"not a good place to work, I wouldn't recommend it anymore  its not what it use to be"
good,"As a contractor, I was isolated with no room for advancement and received very little feedback.  Coworkers were friendly and the commute was as easy as can be."
good,While many are very friendly and work as a team... there should be more work/life balance with scheduling.  I also feel the compensation should be reviewed and adjusted accordingly.
good,"The work was mostly repetitive, and not hardly challenging. There wasn't much to do but run programmes. Some of the time, there is simply no work available."
good,"It was my first job out of college and was a great place to get my feet wet and learn what the corporate world is like. There are a lot of small things you learn, like office manners and how to make coffee"
good,The company overall is great but your experience is uniquely based upon your manager and her own management. There have been several things promised to us that never came to fruition. For example I'm in a business development position. We never got our commission package worked out. I've been stuck making a base salary for almost two years. No commission/bonus = low conversion and low team morale.
good,Mercer is a great place to work with wonderful management with flexibility for family events and the ability to work from home. No micro management as long as work is completed in a timely matter.
good,"Generally a good company to work for.  Staff is great, middle management too emphasize on cost cutting and performance, not care too much about their well beings."
good,"It was a great place for advancement within the company. They provide excellent training to their employees. However, they need to allow their employees to work remotely and study the current work load."
good,"Overall my experience was good.  I had the opportunity to be challenged and learned a lot."
good,There are a lot of wastes in talent and duplicate work that is going on between teams.  Process can be streamlined that will make things run better between one group to the next.
good,"On the average, in comparison with other corporate companies, this is a decent place to work,  The work culture does it's best to promote a form of unity within the organization."
good,"Good people, just not the cleanest place.  There are things that could be done that aren't"
good,"Service clients for all aspects of employee benefits including:"
good,"A typical day at work was working for a manager, very nice man, who  was most of the time abroad. So I had to deal with all his email and projects."
good,Had several jobs with varies responsibilities making work challenging at times. The bigger the challenge the better the reward. 
good,"Each month there is an All Colleague Meeting, a Birthday celebration and a charity to donate to."
good,"I enjoy the people I work with, but there is little room for advancement in the Austin office. If you are not willing to move to New York or Chicago, your chances of promotion are limited. "
good,As this was a short term contract it is difficult to write a true and accurate review but for the period I was there the team I was seconded into was very helpful in all aspects of the portfolio considering I had had very limited exposure to Trade Credit Insurance in the past
good,"Es super increible trabajar ahí muchísimos incentivos buen ambiente laboral,siempre estas aprendiendo de la gente de ahi"
good,"A typical day involes overseeing around 650 employees through information technology support in ways of software, hardware and wireless device problems."
good,Marsh is a great company with generous comp and benefits - I worked for CS STARS / ClearSight division which was not prioritized with senior Mgmt or supported. Ultimately divested.
good,"Empresa com um bom clima organizacional, flexivel e boa interação entre gestores e operação."
good,"Culture was good, management ok. My area was a great part of the business but the pay was really below average for what you had to do. I would recommend if they had their pay in line with the job title  in the market."
good,"I worked directly with a Sales Executive.  It was just the 2 of us and we relied heavily on each other for communication and comraderie."
good,"Marsh & McLennan is a great place to work, fast pace, room for advancement, continuous education, volunteer opportunities with great benefits at a perfect location."
good,"MMC offers excellent benefits, good work life balance, and the opportunity to work remotely if your position allows; but the company is constantly in flux, with layoffs every fall."
good,Charge de travail moyenne et management plutôt rigoureux.
good,When I was there - I have to caveat this that things may have changed since then - the culture was not as collaborative as other places I have worked before and since.
good,absorbed into the larger corporation years ago . this was a highly experimental group that became other things over the years.  not bad for what they were trying to do
good,"It is more of a production environment, without providing adequate compensation or rewards.  The people were great to work with.  There is initial training provided before being placed out on the floor."
good,Great company to work for. Great group i worked in. Really liked the corporate culture and the opportunity for growth. Some very smart people at this company.
good,"Good job but lacks opportunity."
good,"MMC has incredibly competitive pay and benefit structure but the environment was stressful and very ""dog eat dog"". At times it felt like you were in the Big Brother House of corporate America."
good,"Marsh and McLennan had a lot of employee incentives"
good,"Was there so many years ago, I'm sure things have changed, but I enjoyed the time I was at Marsh.  Mostly administrative work, but was great.  Worked there too far back to give a fair review."
good,"Managers are fair and driven toward success.  Allow flexibility and a great company to work for if one has a family so home and work life balance is great!  What I would have liked is more perks from the company perhaps a bonus, a raise at least for living expenses increase, and some health care coverage."
good,I only worked here as an intern for one summer. I thought highly of them for giving me an opportunity to learn the agency side of the insurance industry. They helped me find a great job to start my career.
good,No job security. My position was eliminated in Louisville & moved to another office. My supervisor learned about the move the same day as I did.  My supervisor was super but some of the actions the upper management took were difficult to understand.
good,"Company no longer in Omaha.  They have sold off their business and moved it to other cities.  Was a good place to work, small office but no longer in Omaha"
good,Very poor training before being thrown into a full client load during an extremely busy and fast passed time of year.  High employee turnover.  After 8 months 4 remain from a starting class of 8.
good,its a ok place to work I was not their long enough to give a full opinion the people are nice and Mangement is good and easy to talk to workplace culture is a good
good,It is a productive and innovative company which nurtures talent and promote growth. Management is easily accessible and easy to communicate with. Remuneration structure can be improved.
good,"Great place to work but could be very stressful and overwhelming.  Some supervisors are micro managers and some are not very helpful.  Cultural environment is very mixed, which is a benefit."
good,"I learned a lot at this company and am very grateful for that, however, more and more responsibilities are being placed on an already short handed staff with no additional compensation and colleagues requests for help and support are going unheard.  Moral is low in the department."
good,Growing evolving culture that was going through a bit of transition when I was there.  Great account management and support people.  Extremely knowledgeable.
good,"A typical day at work consists of answering client interactions, marketing to various carriers, issuing certificates of insurance, or meeting with the Marketing Coordinator and/or producers to develop a strategic plan to maintain client retention.  Management is available to their employees.  This is a corporate workplace culture.  The retention goals are higher than at other agencies.  The hardest part of the job is juggling all of the high priority functions.  At the end of the day, it is rewarding to know that I've helped clients."
good,"Productive and learning experience.Good management. "
good,"While I had an excellent IT manager at the Local and Regional levels, at higher levels of IT management there was a lack of focus on projects that I had to manage and at times wouldn't heed my suggestions for halting a faulty project, for instance. At one point in time Marsh was a great company to work for; however, they got into financial trouble and laid off thousands of people, including myself back in 2008."
good,MMC is very busy and strives to be the best that it can be.  I work at a Shared Services Center where all departments work together for the good of the company.
good,"The internship at Marsh and McLennan was quite an enjoyable experience. I was very fortunate to have someone take the time to mentor me and help me learn about the world of insurance brokerage and the duties of the compliance department. My duties and responsibilities at Marsh included: amending regional policies in the company professional standards book, assisted with the creation of standard 'know your client' forms for regional clients, attended weekly meetings and assisted with mandatory training for lower admin staff, updated and maintained data incident and gifts & entertainment logs for the regional office."
good,"I personally felt as if management was purposely holding me back from advancement because the department was brand new. They wanted to become established and prove their worth even if it meant holding someone back. Also, The department that I worked in was made up of entirely of kids straight out of college - first job EVER!  Because of that, we were ALL treated like children and micromanaged. It was difficult to work with people who didn't know what professionalism really means. I've paid my dues in the corporate world and have a lot of industry experience. My skills can be put to better use."
good,"I think there are great people at MMA.  There are just too many chiefs and they all have conflicting ideas except that they all are way too over-consumed with the bottom line.  I have to say, they promote employee education in a big way, that's a plus."
good,"During the early hours of the first day of the week you will find me organizing my schedules around the client’s priorities"
good,"Can be a great place to work, depends on your supervisor. It is political and jobs are given to favorites as opposed to those who have earned."
good,"Great for insurance professionals who specialize in ""nich"" markets"
good,Uma equipa produtiva onde pude conhecer um pouco mais sobre a area
good,Not very good after an on the job injury in working with you to get back.
good,Good starting place for career. Currently going through lots of structural changes which can make professional development difficult.
good,"•Providing world-class resources with local touch"
good,"Worked long hours.  Under appreciated, no recognition/praise.  "
good,Positive work environment with a focus upon client service.
good,Productive workplace and expected to learn quickly.  The company handles complex insurance prograrms but you learn a lot in the course of employment.
good,"Austin Texas office is horrible. Managers do not know what they are doing on a day to day basis. Bullying is common, and if you speak up for yourself they are ready to write you up. What a shame. The manager over the certificate department in Austin is surely a mess!!"
good,"A typical day at the office is wonderful the people, atmosphere and culture are one of a kind.  The hardest part of the job is not being able to advance in your career even though the company considers employee movement a main foundation of the business."
good,"Enjoyed working for the company, customers were great and management was very friendly."
good,The management expect workers to sacrifice their livelihood and put in crazy hours.
good,"Providing finance support to acquiring company for five years, as Head of FP&A: managing the contracting; project costing; project profitability analysis; sales pipeline management and reporting in Mercer‘s Global Leadership Development business, "
good,"Mornings start early and often hectic. Our main role is to support all practices across EMEA and often I am dealing with multiple timezones and deadlines. The day is often filled with having to jump from one deadline straight on to the next one. The management is good, they understand our role within the business and look to help us develop the role to offer the best product to the business we can."
good,I learned accounting skills and this was very refreshing and a new challenge for me. I really enjoyed it
good,"Handles federal, international and state tax issues. Work on M& deals, corporate tax and HR issues. Large projects include FATCA, Legal entity elimination, numerous M&A transactions."
good,"Management does not have the staff's best interest at heart but they do pay well and have good benefits. Overall, I enjoyed the people I worked with day to day."
good,"Very professionally run organization at the top, but at the grass roots of the workforce, it felt robotic after a while. The property, cafeteria, and common areas were great during break period."
good,Marsh and McLennan at the time I was working for them was a typical conservative insurance brokerage.  I was give the opportunity to learn a lot of different roles but probably wasn't compensated accordingly.
good,"Direct manager was professional and helpful. Upper management did not care for the pawns. They did not value the employees, only money. In the end, laid everyone off and outsourced our responsibilities."
good,Nice place to work with friendly people.  People are always there to assist you with whatever you needed.  Somebody always willing to lend a helping hand.
good,MMC jobs can be worlds different based on the opco and department. Some areas have people with 20+ year satisfying careers and great work-life balance.  Other areas have very high stress and turnover. Look to the tenure of people around a role before considering as it may well reflect the culture of that department.
good,"Marsh & McLennan Companies are all about the bottom line.  Revenue is the only thought on a daily basis. Management was not sensitive to the amount of work each person was trying to handle.  Extra help from other offices or departments was scarce.  "
good,"Company has great benefits, and a good working environment."
good,"Great atmosphere and people, but the work load that you are expected to keep up with is unrealistic.  Would have to work 70 hour weeks in order to stay caught up."
good,"there was a lot of reorg when i was there... they are too big and sometimes there is no place for the those that perform extremely well. a lot of old timers there from the golden days and its tough to get promoted unless you have spent your time there (despite your qualifications)... all in all not a bad place to work, but definitely not for a go getter either"
good,"This job required lots of processing of proposals, reports and binders of coverage. This job was tough but this  was were I developed my thick skin.  "
good,Company asking more and more of its employees.  Stressful job and workload.  No pay raises last several years.
good,"A typical day at MMA consisted of reviewing my progress from the previous day and following up on plans made to further my contacts and pursue new business. Co-workers were pleasant and disciplined, which I appreciated because we shared the same work ethics. The hardest part of my job was staying positive at times when the desired results were not achieved, because I am a perfectionist to some degree.However, the most enjoyable part was the satisfaction I received when my efforts were rewarded with success. This was not what I would call a learning experience, rather it was a reinforcement of the values I believe in. It's important to balance disappointments at work and life in general with your successes and to keep everything in perspective and never give up."
good,"Excellent oppourtunity to learn more about the insurance world from the side of a broker. Clients can be extremely demanding at times which causes you to work a large amount of overtime, but management will support you and stand behind your decisions."
good,"I Have worked at Marsh & McLennan Companies full-time for more than 5 years."
good,The call centers are a great entry level position.  Take a year and learn the business.  The management team I have worked with are nice and any feedback is constructive.
good,"There is no formal promotion policy in place.  It is completely subjective and offered rarely.  Monthly One-on-One meetings with your manager yield very little in assisting you to grow in your position.  When asked what you can do to grow, the answers are often vague and misleading.  "
good,"When I started working at Marsh it was a great, fun company to grow. Once I started having children it became very stressful and difficult to manage work and home."
good,Aprendizado constante. Empresas com forte cultura de aquisição para crescimento inorgânico. Foco em geração de caixa e valor para o acionista.
good,It's fine if you're okay with cultures resistant to change. The promotions process is straight forward so it's easy to get promoted as long as you put your head down and get your work done.
good,"Taking 80 - 100 call daily."
good,The work environment is flexible and dynamic. The most interesting and sometimes the most challenging part of my work was meeting client's different demands.
good,Management is definitely the best part of this company. Not a fast paced company to work for. I didn't get much room for advancement and there are many veterans there that don't make a whole lot of room to move up as a young person.
good,"- Outdated technology"
good,Mercer is ever evolving and their are many opportunities to advance and learn.  The biggest downfall is work life balance and improvement is needed in this area.  Mercer at least attempts to get it right and they continually work to improve their environment and that is a commendable trait.
good,Although Marsh is a hard company to work for when balancing family and sick time for children it is a good company if you want to advance within.
good,"A typical day involves coordinating with Brokers, colleagues and clients the overview of legal documents, cataloguing, invoicing according to compliance standards and supervising others in my role.  I like my Manger very much.  He's very straight forward and down to earth.  The majority of my colleagues are great as well, but of course there are those who are more challenging to work with and require a bit more patience and understanding when communicating with them.  The hardest part of the job is covering for higher level colleagues when they are out of the office.  It forces you to be more proactive in learning on the fly and operating seamlessly while communicating with clients you may not often deal with directly.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people and the schedule.  When I originally moved into this field, I thought financially the move made sense and that I could continue to explore my creative endeavors outside of my 9-5 job.  That was partially correct, but I miss the day to day activities of my prior career in film and television and I'm willing to make the necessary adjustments to move forward in the industry of my preference."
good,great company to work for - work life balance is good and its diverse
good,"I worked at Marsh for three years in a temporary contract position. I was never given the chance at a direct hire. Although they kept telling me how great a job I was doing, and how appreciated I was, I was only appreciated as a temp, and despite applying for direct hire positions twice, I was never given a fair chance to even interview for those positions."
good,"This was a office job that I processed medical claims.  There were lots of goals, and deadlines.  Ended up staying there 5 years, in that time they ended up outsourcing most of my coworkers jobs to India.  So sad."
good,"I started off as a temporary employee. They liked my work and hired me fulltime permanent. Great benefits. Fast paced. Room for advancement. I was able to learn different software, meaning - systems that were used specifically for the industry."
good,I had my hours reduced from 38 to 25......Marsh then hired part-time enployees.
good,Very profesional and good experience. Audit payroll process and taxes on weekly and semi employees. Audit all garnishments. Maintained state laws update.
good,"Highly motivated Designer/ Engineer with over seven years experience in preparing drawings  and topographical and relief maps used in civil engineering projects, such as highways, bridges, pipelines, flood control projects, and water and sewerage control systems. Always team and deadline oriented. Good at that getting approved and permit from city and county. I can review and check drawing of civil engineering."
good,It was a contract role with a definite expiration date.  The job was easy to learn and I did enjoy it.  I like working with American Airline families processing pension benefit claims.
good,Empresa com muitas coisas para melhorar referente a processos mais ágeis.
good,"- Obtive grande aprendizado em gestão, pois estava ligada diretamente a grandes clientes com equipe coordenada por mim com entregas mensais bastante importantes como acompanhamento das metas operacionais através de mensuração de SLA para execução de tarefas e controle de faturamentos do cliente."
good,"Administrative Arbeit bleibt leider erhalten."
good,"aprendí los procesos internos de una administración de un broker de seguros desde el ingreso del nuevo contrato hasta su expiracion o siniestro."
good,"Not a bad place to work.  However going to an all open unassigned desk environment.  Not a plus, will make getting things done very difficult ."
good,"Wonderful company to work for, I had great team leaders that expanded my knowledge of the industry"
good,It's okay most of ther time. Some of the time was good. I would definitely suggest trying to work there. I think the people that work there make its great place.
good,Too bad the good folks have left the company.  They need to focus on working with diverse communities and get rid of the stodge at the top like most companies.
good,I would definitely re join if I ever get a chance to work with Marsh in future. It is a great place to work. I wish great success to Marsh worldwide keeping their   Name in the market being the world leader in insurance brokers.
good,They were very focused on keeping the customer services representatives motivated and engaged. Customer Service Week was very important push for open enrollment.
good,"Great global firm with opportunity to rotate and potentially advance.                                 "
good,"C'est une entreprise très active sur le marché des assurances, ce qui permet de gérer des clients importants."
good,"MMA showed favoritism quite a bit."
good,"I loved working at Marsh! I left because I wanted to move to NYC to be closer to family and was told there were no raises or relo's. Plus, my boss was one of the OG's from J&H and had just been left there, making a ton of money and leaving me to do ALL of the work."
good,"As a fire prevention specialist, I had the responsability to evaluate property insurance risk for the insurance brokers. We had to test all fire protection systems: sprinklers, fire pumps, hydrants...."
good,"great place for people who want to start their careers, good training and learning opportunities. Very busy schedule, long hours, demanding job. Smart people"
good,"Great work environment with many opportunities for growth. Job stability with the company expansion in the health and wellness sector. Time management and ownership is key to succeed. Communication barriers throughout department may be challenging, until you establish relationships. Overall great place to work but compensation for promotions could be better."
good,"The people make Marsh & McLennan Agency a GREAT place to work. Due to workload, the Commercial team really jumps into assist teammates during stressful or busy times."
good,No Training at all for salesmen so as a producer you somewhat get thrown to the wolves and only the strong survive.  Fantastic resources/support to help you sell.
good,well suited for anyone starting out in the industry for training and acclamation to the Insurance industry. That said still having growing pains acquiring and transitioning independent agencies into the MMA system.
good,My co-workers were the most enjoyable part of my job.  I think overall the company lacked in being the best and most competitive with new technologies.
good,"Enjoyed the work atmosphere, I worked with different type of insurance policies. Everything from a Group Term, to AD&D, Dental, Vision and even Medical Supplements"
good,"A great company to work for that strives for excellence.  I help colleagues, manage risk by complying  with insurance laws & regulation."
good,"Good workplace with supportive management. High importance placed on attention to detail and thorough, methodical process when approaching problems. Difficult to grow beyond the assigned role, but due to the size of the company, this is to be expected."
good,"Overall, this company was more than what I expected at first. People there were friendly and willing to help you learn. The boss was excellent, helped you and let you fly on your own and the colleagues were teaching me and trusting me since the very beginning."
good,"Low growth opportunity.  Overall, MMC is a good place to work.  They offer great benefits and compensation. One of a few companies that still offer a pension plan."
good,good experience.  opportunity to learn and grow. Employees are hard working and dedicated. Opportunity was always challenging and busy fast paced environment.  Always new projects coming in.
good,"Being part of the strategic sourcing team was the perfect introduction to work experience. A great balance of learning, opportunity to contribute with my analytical skills, and fun with an amazing team"
good,Learned everything I know about Oracle EBS.  Was a pretty decent place to work before the Finance Transformation project
good,"Marsh is an industry leader in the broker space, the company has a wide scope of expertise and a global reach. The company is beginning to adopt an analytical approach which is a large differentiator in the business."
good,"Changing of experience every day"
good,Enjoyable coworkers and constant change in finance organization.
good,"Working for Marsh/Mercer has been a great learning experience. The company is the world's largest insurance broker, and offers many different areas to learn about insurance and how multiple carriers opperate. The only downfall, is that we operate as a third party administrator, and our clients that we service end and/or renew their contracts with us. This has resulted in department closings for multiple clients, including a department I previously worked for."
good,"Off load the produce from the trucks and disperse merchandise to the sales floor or back of house."
good,Coworkers are very nice and friendly. I learned how to use sql and R.
good,"I've had a wonderful experience working here as a contractor for the Forensic Accountant and Claims Services Department (FACS).  I was trained both externally (out on the field), and internally.  Through my stay at Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., I've improved my various skillsets as an Analyst, and as an Accountant, while learning how to become a proper Claims Consultant."
good,"Sendo uma empresa multinacional, existe uma diversidade enorme, o que me permitiu até ao momento desenvolver bastante tanto a nível profissional como pessoal."
good,Marsh is an industry leading company.  The MMC family and its companies are well known and established.  Marsh's benefits are great as is the vacation and company holiday policy.
good,Benefit Administrator require to be knowlodgeble in benefits and relay accurate benefit information.
good,"Loved the team structure, the clients and assignees.  Relationship building is a must at MMC."
good,This is a company that has a well organized structure to keep business moving.  Co workers are all young and fun to work with. Leaders are knowledgeable.
good,"Warm, fun experienced colleagues. My day would mainly revolve around administration, reporting and solving outstanding queries, be it employee or training provider and making sure that everything is on board when it comes to training. Our Management team are knowladge and experts when it comes to their jobs and divisions. I enjoyed learning new things and assissting my colleagues with whatever ""technological"" problems they might have. The wow factor would be a satisfied customer whose job is made easier as they attended training."
good,Good exposure to working in an enterprise environment consisting of hundreds of offices and thousands of employees.
good,A real estate investment company that owned and managed Shopping Malls all over the country. Head office is in New York. A fun place to work
good,"A great collaborative environment to work. Many different types of people all working together toward the same goal. Co-workers were smart, fun and caring individuals that supported one another."
good,Opportunities are given to those who work hard.
good,"Challenging & rewarding career opportunity  "
good,I do not wish to provide a review at this time as it has been some time since working there. My time there was enjoyable and the employees are fantastic.
good,"Old stable company, good reputation, diversity throughout the company. This is an old company trying to be in tune with the times. Great in some aspects not so good in others"
good,"MMC is a professional services firm with more in line with legal and accounting firms than the technology companies that are dominant in SF now. The colleagues are very friendly and there are quite a few long-term colleagues (20+ years). "
good,"I enjoyed working with the majority of the team members. Everyone was there to do their best job. There are some difficult producers every now & then, but that's at any brokerage job."
good,"When was there agile ops was not something to expect. Good company if you enjoy that traditional heavily siloed and bureaucratic organization. Great benefits and my manager was awesome, but I got the feeling I was luckier than most in that regard."
good,Management could have been better. I found myself having to handle tough calls on my own without the assistance of a manager. Getting hired on indefinitely post contract is tough as well.
good,The job itself is very stressful. You have to meet high metrics and goals set by revenue expectations. You are micromanaged in a call center environment. I like the overall job but would not recommend it unless you are ready to be on the phones all day with little break time.
good,"MMC is a good place to work but it could be great, if managers would not let their personal biases hinder the growth of some employees. There is definitely a glass ceiling for some people."
good,Marsh ensures they comply with all regulations and laws.  Large company with various companies in group.  Very involved in charities and upliftment.  Great company to work for.  Once you have been trained and attended in house courses you are able to stand tall in the market place.
good,The company has been growing and growing with many divisions over the years. The company strives to have a culture of diversity and inclusive to all. An intensive work environment with many periods of grueling hours.  Immediate colleagues tend to form strong bond in an effort to support one another.
good,This is a good company with potential to great. As old ways of leadership catch up to the requests of a younger work force this company could really take off and be a great place to work. The benefits are great and they are really trying to create a fun work culture but the older ways of management must be updated.
good,No sure why I have to write a review on this company.  I had a very specific role there and was unlike most jobs for this employer so what I say won't be for most.
good,Marsh & McLennan is a great place to work with fair pay and great employee benefits. If you enjoy a fast paced work environment Marsh is the place for you.
good,"Its just the usual IT company with a little bit of extra care by the managers/leads - only when you do good work."
good,"Marsh & McLennan Companies was a very family oriented work environment,  The company offered life after work.  It knew how to keep its employees loving it.  The parties, picnics, and outings gave the employees a reason to stay."
good,Employees are great. Office location not great unless you live up north. Business casual dress with jeans on Fridays. Job feels very secure.
good,Potentially could be a great company to work for.  But there's a lot of politics going on.  Management should focus more on rewarding people (those in the middle of the pyramid - that is those who actually perform the job).
good,"The compensation and benefits are very attractive, but only if you get into a management role."
good,"El dia transcurre muy fácil aunque siempre el volumen de trabajo es mucho"
good,Major presence in the market. Maintaining a steady and positive relationship with our clients is a key challenge. Thrive in it and always up for the task. Work closely with the marine insurance market which is vital on the mid to larger accounts that we work on.
good,stressful environment due to the time to upgrade all users laptop and migrate all the data from old laptop.
good,"Decent benefits, low base salary, slow progression opportunities"
good,"I moved up very quickly in this organization. I learned more about the insurance world that I never could imagine and enjoyed the aspects that helped me advance in my career."
good,Overall my experience at Marsh has been a productive one to say the least. I'm currently on internship here at the company working in the I.T. department and i have gain a ton of knowleadge like how to wipe a hard driv and provide support to end users.
good,"Nice company, but not very organized. The office is extremely divided. Contracting companies that work with MMC do not follow the MMC culture or guidelines as they should."
good,"- normally do announcements, promote events during lunch time, and conversing with admin, teachers, and students as often as I could"
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is the co-workers. The management understood you a lot. I learned how to open the store in the morning. There isn't any hard part about my job.
good,- Late nights
good,"A empresa é muito boa de trabalhar, mas infelizmente não tem uma remuneração satisfatória."
good,"Management is friendly but hard to move up. They have an open culture but stagnant with moving forward on things like work from home and benefits are good but very expensive. Nearly unaffordable on a 40,000 salary."
good,"Good seasonal contract with good pay and training, Flexible hours"
good,Customers are first.  I enjoyed working with them. The company is always there for you. We did dress casual everyday keeping in mind the attire you are wearing is customer friendly
good,"A empresa é uma multinacional, seus benefícios e cuidado com o colaborador são muito bons."
good,"Nice culture, manager, and team.  The areas of responsibility that have been outsourced is not always the best. On any given day, a colleague can get 3-different answers to 1-question."
good,A typical day at work involved work on several different initiatives related to improving company operations. The most enjoyable part of the job was streamlining operations. The hardest part of the job was identifying/coordinating disparate departments across the globe.
good,"great work life balance, Stressful culture, corporate politics fairly significant as with any large company. Depth of intellectual capital in the risk advisory space is exceptional."
good,"Good Place work"
good,"... but in the meantime you have to grow at a relatively slow pace. If you are open for International assignments the pace and opportunities pick up. Bureaucratic at times, which impairs innovation"
good,"The working environment was good. everyone was allowed to just go on and concentrate on their own jobs. The environment at Marsh allowed employees to plan their days the way they see fit. Mostly, management focused on their jobs and only got involved with employees when projects required it."
good,"On a typical day we have enough work to keep us busy, but not so busy that you can't find time to talk to your co-workers. Through the years I've learned a lot from the company and the people I reported to. It has a good workplace culture, most employees report liking the company and the values they portray. Long hours during close times are the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable is the atmosphere created by the company and it's ability to acknowledge that it's employees are the most important part of the company and inform us of the changes they are making to improve how we are treated and the opportunities they provide to enhance your opinion of the company."
good,"Management is spotty, there were several good managers there, there were also several bad managers. Unfortunately I worked for a bad manager at the end of my time there. Boss was lazy, back stabbing, and had no business being a manager, she didn't know what 1/2 the department did and what she did know she pawned off on underlings and took the credit for others work. She spent her days shopping on line, coming in late, taking long lunches and leaving early. She played favorite and if you were one of her ""friends"" you could do what ever you wanted no questions asked."
good,"The staff there are professional, courteous and excellent at what their do. The days consist of arranging lots of meetings for swiftly working through agreements and proposals. It’s a fast past environment and sometimes you can feel really overwhelmed but the team will support you on whatever you need. Just remember their is a hierarchy of command."
good,Exciting global environment with lots of technology.  Strong personal ownership and accountability.  Constantly innovating and evolving technology services.
good,"Great work environment with many opportunities for growth. Job stability with the company expansion in the health and wellness sector.  Time management and ownership is key to succeed. Communication barriers throughout department may be challenging, until you establish relationships. Overall great place to work but compensation for promotions could be better."
good,"The environment is cool because of  co workers. Management says you will be receiving a bonus but it is not as easy as it seems, and takes months to receive."
good,Incredible company with solid position in the industry. Great experience. Highly recommended for unseasoned personnel looking to get into the industry.
good,Gran empresa en vías de desarrollar una carrera a largo plazo
good,"Marsh is an established, international company with offices world wide.  Great place to launch or further a career in many areas, not just insurance-related fields."
good,"Typical agency faire (new business, renewals, etc.).  Great sales team!  I learned a lot about client relationships because I was allowed to be more engaged one-on-one.  Senior Leadership makes concerted effort to provide a positive working environment.  Unfortunately, there is a lot of cattiness amongst lower management and their teams, making it difficult not to get involved and focus on your primary responsibilities."
good,"empresa dinâmica,agradável,oferece oportunidade de aprendizado,mas não de crescimento profissional."
good,"MMC are a great company to work for, they have a good employee package, great benefits and salary's. "
good,"Great working  environment,   great support of employees, excellent benefits. Diversity oriented,  Long term employees, team environment."
good,Decentralized structure with a culture that is challenging to navigate. Strong senior management but lower ranks are often not in the loop on decisions and impact to day to day impact.
good,Mercer is a hard working organization that is making headway in the benefit consulting industry. Like many companies there are pros and cons working there.
good,"There is new culture at the agency, it is a corporate culture.  I am not sure I fit in the new culture.  That is why I am looking to see if there is a new opportunity for me elsewhere."
good,"Collaborateurs agréables,"
good,Great place to work! I have learned how to communicate better and balance my work and personal life.  This is a great place to work.
good,"Not a very pleasant place to work.  Demands are very high.  Never quite good enough, constant increases in work requirements which results in a very stressful workplace.  Has very high turnover in compliance center in Austin, TX"
good,"Empresa de grande porte, que possibilita aos seus colaboradores ter crescimento e visibilidade a longo prazo. A carga de trabalho é bastante pesada, consequentemente o aprendizado é dinâmico e exige do indivíduo um bom controle emocional. Os colegas de trabalho são como uma família, o que aliás parece estar enraizado na cultura da empresa. Posso considerar a companhia deles a parte mais agradável do trabalho."
good,"Cansativo porém maravilhoso trabalho. Trabalhar com sinistro ou seja muita responsabilidade, direção e gerencia ok, colegas de trabalho abençoados, trabalhar aos feriados, satisfazer o cliente."
good,"This is a big company, unfortunately the regular employees get lost in the shuffle."
good,"This is a good company to work for, many opportunities for advancement. Management can be a little frustrating but overall it's a great company to work for."
good,"Exec leaders in Talent Acquisition last < 3 yrs. A new leader trying to prove themselves and change things but doesn't inspire us.  Then, they leave after 3 years."
good,Worked with mostly fortune 1000 companies developing C-Suite relationships to drive commercial brokerage opportunities within the Marsh & McLennan Companies.  Culture was very professional and colleagues were there to work and not socialize.  The management hierarchy has several layers and its difficult for decisions to made in a swift fashion.
good,Really enjoyed doing the job there and the people were fantastic.  Most of the management were great to work for.  The most difficult part was the workspace was too small for the amount of people.  The network was outstanding and the folks managing and designing it.  It was really cool to traverse the globe across the network and be able to carry out job functions.  Found all of my peers to be best in class people professionally and on many other levels as well.  Enjoyed my time there and would recommend working there to others.  My take away and what I learned was to be a better communicator and all differences can be worked out if you are willing to do so.
good,Team oriented with exposure to new processes and controls. Multinational company with offices everywhere in the world. Always something new to learn and new technology.
good,"Great culture and work environment. They SAY they promote within, but in my 4 years' experience, 90% of the time - they have not. Still there are some very fun, caring people who work here and I would recommend it."
good,I was learning alot from my from work experience at Accenture since I was working at different of Projects and different types of client contracts.  Projects sometimes have very tight deadline.
good,"Very lean teams, but it means a lot more learning opportunities. Downside is the salary is very low - known to be low amongst the industry. Great for the shareholders. Not so great for employees or even management in the long run as there is high staff turnover."
good,Learned a lot from this company and was able to move on within the industry. The most enjoyable part of working for this company was the amount i learned and the people i was able to network with.
good,"My biggest issue with the company was, at least from my perspective that a lot of the technology ""stacks"" were not working well together.  I remember having difficulties getting their storage teams to help us out on several occasions.  Not to say that their storage team was bad, it seemed they knew what they were doing, but they weren't always really helpful.  I had similar issues with other technology groups, we in the Windows team would have issues we'd need to troubleshoot, try and bring in another group to assist and a common reaction was ""Not our problem""  We were always able to overcome these roadblocks, but it was aggravating at times to deal with.  "
good,"I like the flex hours and benefits, I receive 4 weeks vacation per year a long with 10 paid holidays.   However; they tend to have special treatment for certain non productive employees that are very distracting."
good,"A typical work day starts at 8:30 and ends around 4:30."
good,Everyone i work beside has been very friendly an helpful throughout my time at Marsh. Variation in jobs is good and learning new skills as I go. 9-5 is good and an hours lunch so plenty time to unwind and re-energize. Enjoyable work place.
good,As i have just started my jobs are some what limited at the moment. I am enjoying it so far and keen to learn more about all my different jobs within the office.
good,The people make this place.  Relaxed environment with a focus on employee wellness.  Great pay and bonus. Management tries to keep employees aware of changes and future plans.  Upper management is hardly visible.
good,Overall my experience in Mercer is good. Its my Job here and I learned a lot. The work culture here is very good. I really enjoy working here.
good,Marsh is a great company to work for. They have lots of resources available for use. Their global footprint is incredible.
good,Different areas of business to learn makes me a more flexible and experienced accountant.
good,"Local de trabalho calmo, fácil relacionamento com os colegas"
good,Marsh is a zenith company which has its principals which it sticks to.
good,Great place to kick off your career here. There are opportunities for bright individuals for leadership roles.
good,At times it was difficult to access to managers when you needed one.  The frequency and volume of meetings is too high.  Overall this is good company to work for with a strong culture and commendable work ethics.
good,"i learnt a lot of things in terms of skills, knowledge and professional growth.i have a breath of software experience so i marsh i have a lot of data management ,data mining experience and excel vba, MS Access and outlook. Marsh have environment friendly atmosphere and good career growth."
good,"Good company to work for. Good benefits, vacation and great people to work with. "
good,Very relaxed and fun place to work. Advancement opportunities were available with hard work and dedication. Management very willing to provide learning opportunities.
good,"During my time in Marsh Chicago, we were able to complete the normal financial duties but also build relationships and mentor one another. Almost everyone that I worked with went on to have successful careers at Marsh or outside of Marsh."
good,Marsh and McLennan is a great place to work. You have the opportunity to work on large complex account. The only downside is the compensation. Management does a wonderful job to support career goals and ambitions.
good,"This company wouldn't be successful with long-term employees if it didn't encourage collaboration and partnership."
good,"Well compensated, Good learning opportunities , Good work life balance"
good,"I enjoyed my time there.  The culture is diverse and the management seems to truly care.  Compensations is good, though not great.  The pay people off the street more than they pay for promotions which is why I left."
good,"Multi-national company with an open workplace culture with room for growth for those willing to work hard, network and be patient. Great place to start a career."
good,MMC offers great packages to employees and have a good culture. The teams that make the information technology structure are well versed in the industry.
good,Many job cultures are set by upper management and trickle down. The team I am part of has a great work/life balance. The work always gets done at an above-par level so we work hard and play hard.
good,The thing I loved most was the people I worked with. Very engaged within the community and a socially responsible corporation. They really stressed diversity and working as a team.
good,I enjoyed my time at Marsh & McLennan - I only left to stay at home with a new baby.  work/life balance was well respected.  Pay was quite nice for the time
good,This was a great company however lacked in opportunity for growth and development. I enjoyed the environment as well as getting to work with a great team. I find that the support was always provided but the pay system was not competitive enough.
good,"Empezábamos la jornada a las 9 :00 am y salíamos a las 18:00 pm , me gusto mucho este horario ya que me daba tiempo de sobra para poder realizar cualquier tipo de actividad,una vez terminada mi jornada de trabajo"
good,"Things are very different depending where you work: at MMC Corporate or in the Operating Companies. Each Operating Company has a different culture and its own pros and cons. I've worked both at Mercer (one of the OpCos) and at MMC. I learned a ton, I had great managers all along. But life was definitely easier at MMC Corporate (more balance, fun and a higher pay) than it was at Mercer (long work hours and a lot of stress for a lower pay). Learning was fantastic as I said, both at Mercer and MMC. Plenty of intellectual stimulation. I've had so many opportunities to change businesses and geographies, I'm still amazed by it. Met great people."
good,"Empresa com boa gestão, com boas perspectivas de crescimento."
good,"You get the feeling that every person means something also when decisions are made. "
good,"MMC is big, but not difficult.  I always felt comfortable there.  good professional team with ample room for growth and advancement.  I would consider going back."
good,Mercer is overall a good place to work. They value work/life balance and understand not all colleagues would like to work a traditional M-F 9-5. I love working on events and wish to continue to do that in some capacity throughout my career.
good,The best thing about the company is the people there.  I have made life-long friends there.  They have worked with me and accommodated a remote office due to the nature of my job.
good,"- 100% positive business teams"

good,Worked with a lot of great people and learned a lot. Great work life balance. Everyone worked as a team. Sr members are always willing to help you. Great team

good,"Reviewing policies, writing cover letter to the client with a summary of their policy. The workplace culture was awful, because we worked in tiny little cubes and practically sat on top of eachother. The hardest part of the job was trying to remember all the things that had to be done every time you learned the rules and regulations they changed. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with."
good,"Lower management (Supervisor) treats you like an adult."
good,"Lots of integrity here - if you are passionate about Employee Benefits (the department I worked in), this is the place for you."

The Auto ID department was responsible for the issuance of thousands of insurance documents every day, but even at its busiest, it was a great and productive environment. I learned a lot about workflow at this job, keeping things moving and getting as much done every day as efficiently as possible. The only reason I ended up leaving that job was that, in the Auto ID department at least, there were extremely few opportunities for advancement."
good,Multi national company and a fortune 500 firm. Great work life balance is fostered.
good,"Gosto de trabalhar nesta empresa. Aprendi a lidar com pessoas, meus superiores mantem contato com os funcionarios, meu colegas sao profissionais e a parte ""dificil"" é quando um cliente entra em contato alterado, onde precisamos manter a calma do mesmo e resolver o problema.

good,"Very good company with a great culture and work/life balance.  However, the compensation could be better and is directly needed to establish loyalty.  There will always be a revolving door since some colleagues have no allegiance to the company based solely on low wages.  Other than that, it’s a great company with good people.  Colleagues have the opportunity to take advantage of great benefits, to include educational assistance and a scholarship program."

good,"I enjoyed every bit of working with these great companies."
good,"MMC is made up of four operating companies, each OpCo has it's own culture. The groups within each OpCo also have their own culture.

The benefits and culture are unmatched however they can lose you by ignoring issues management. A team that has excessive turn over with employees should be reviewed at the manager level. When asked about the turn over I didn’t expect them to be completely transparent however what I got was far worse than I expected. The relationship with the supervisor threatened to taint my work experience as a whole but I fought to keep those two separate even though should be considered packaged assessment.

good,"A typical day at work consisted of resolving issues related to computers, printers, and other electronic devices that the help desk technicians couldn't resolve. Most of the time, I would contact the colleague with the issue and attempt to resolve it over the phone using remote desktop software, which would usually resolve the issue. If the problem was still persistent, I would physically go to the colleague's workstation and troubleshoot until the issue is resolved."

good,"It was a great company to work for. I was part of the Innovation Centre, Dublin Office and the culture was awesome (start up like). "
good,"I enjoyed my experience at MMC. The only thing was, they told me and my recruiter that I was going to be hired as a ""temp to perm.""  I started there in good faith but after my temp period ended they said they had a bad quarter and couldn't afford to keep me as a full timer. Too bad, I really enjoyed my experiences there."
good,"I have worked for MMC for the last 12 years and must say that they pride themselves in being the employer of choice.  Each week i had a 1 to 1 with my manager to ensure that I was on the correct lines to meet the goals set for me in my performance planning for that year.

good,I truly enjoyed working for Marsh. The office was vibrant. The people were nice. Personally I worked on a contract to test the waters of commuting into the city. For me the contract worked mainly because I was able to see if it was something I wanted to do long term. I did not like the commute and did not want to continue but that was honestly my only complaint which had nothing to do with the company. My manager was very personable and friendly. She was a true leader and always made everyone feel like there job was a part of the over all accomplishment of the department. Everyone was a team player and I really enjoyed my time there.
good,A typical workday with Marsh & McLennan was self paced. Co-workers were helpful to teach & train. Management was professional. The workplace culture was very pleasant.
good,Loved working there.  Great management and staff.   It was only a temporary job while there was open enrollment during Medicare open enrollment.  Worked there a few times during this transaction.
good,"I was laid off, my job relocated to India. Working there was by far the best job I've ever had because management understood people have lives outside of work and while they expected the best from us while we were there, they went out of their way to care about our lives and help us with anything involving our work while being overly encouraging. I'll probably never have a better job."

During the first few months my supervisor had the confidence in me to assign another profit center to my work schedule and the opportunity to work with the surplus lines taxes. I learned a great deal about premium taxes and enjoyed working with the surplus lines manager who always was very helpful and supportive. The hardest part of my job was to research and resolve some of the surplus lines issues which at times became very difficult. I always liked the fact that I had a busy schedule but the most enjoyable part was that I worked with some very terrific co-workers.

The most enjoyable part of the job is working with and talking with the clients and the insurance companies representatives, and Helping People."
good,"A typical day at work is mostly fast paced dealing with numerous phone calls from colleagues and executives. I learned how to make efficient edits in excel and our ticketing system. Communication is imperative when it comes to our clients. We have a system for our VIP's to help them immediately and our process has to be discussed with management. There is always a challenge but I don't look at it being hard because I like to get through the day with a positive mind. I love my team because we help each other when there is an escalation of work flow. Everyone is very polite, informative, business wise and personally."

good,I have been with MMC in one form or another for 14 years and love it.
good,"Great environment. Fun place to work, advancement opportunity. Great work/life balance."
good,"In facilities management each day brings it own agenda. I began each day with a list of ""To Do's"" that were a minimum requirement for the day but always left room for the unknown. When managing a zone of 20 offices, something is bound to require immediate attention requiring flexibility on my end. The colleagues and management at Marsh made this a non issue as everybody is working towards the ""Common Good"" of the company and its reputation. The hardest part of the job was meeting tight deadlines within real estate transitions which we always met. This also became the most rewarding part of the job when we could sit back at the close of a project, see and feel our success. Marsh is truly a great place to work and do business with!"
good,Busy call center.

It was a very enjoyable experience where i got to meet new people and ask personal questions where i got answers to questions i otherwise wouldn't have been able to get.
good,Marsh & McLennan is a thorough corporate place to work at. Everyone treats everyone with professionalism but it there was a different level of fun to work there. Having a Scrum call with 3 countries every morning and then knowing what's coming up there in their companies and discussing work at the same time is something that I admire the most. It made my day start with a different level of energy. Then there wasn't any work pressure at all. The company was GREAT enough to allow me to take a leave as I needed it. All they needed from me was to finish my work within the timelines which was never a problem. Then be it if I do the entire work from my house..
good,"One of the best companies I have ever worked for, very relaxed, fun place, and loved the traveling!"
good,"A typical day included office work such as filing, phone calls, scheduling, and any other task my boss required. I learned how to work in an office environment with others, be efficient, and how to do basic administrative tasks."

good,"My experience at MMA is everything I have dreamed about. With no corporate office experience behind me, I learned so much just within the first month.

Management knew what they were doing, not like some other companies I've worked for. The hardest thing that hit us was losing over 300 colleagues in the 9/11 attacks, but it brought us closer together like family. Then the company went under personal attack and ended up cutting back by laying off literally thousands of people. I was always treated with respect, and management respected and utilized my abilities."
