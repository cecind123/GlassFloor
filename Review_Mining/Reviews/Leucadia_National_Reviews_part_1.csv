rating,review
bad,"Terrible culture, aggressive employees, thankless management, 24/7 work"
bad,"I have no idea how they are still in business.  This place was an absolute joke.  Take about the 1%!  Management, colleagues, and everyone in general just didn't care about each other at all."
bad,I have 12+ years experience across almost every product type in the vanilla rates space. From futures to bermudan swaptions I have either traded or managed a book of half a dozen or so products at anyone time.
bad,"Manager did not have the business acumen to support his position. He found a Procurement Summit pamphlet on subway rubbed on his chest and was a self-declared Head of Global Procurement.  Concocted industry terminology such as a “Light RFP”  -- Third Party Consultants were treated poorly, verbally abused in meetings and emails."
bad,Jefferies has a poor work life balance. I enjoyed the bankers in which I supported but the Executive Assistant staff were unfriendly and inconsistent. It wasn't the proper culture fit or work environment I was looking for.
bad,"I wish that I worked in a dept that valued women. Poor culture. Unprofessional. If you worked at GS, DB, or CS, I do not recommend working here."
bad,"Jefferies was a good company to work for. The daily work was always challenging. I enjoyed working with the people at Jefferies."
bad,The environment was volatile and unstable. Outsourcing is becoming very prevalent there. It used to feel like belonging to a family. Senior management seemed to have lost sight of the people that helped elevate the firm
bad,"faced paced busy environment, days go fast. plenty to do on a daily basis. group heads are often so busy that you must independently manage their time and calendar, with minimal feedback"
bad,"Overall Jefferies used to be a good place to work. Not anymore. Management is squeezing the employees. There is little to no room to advance. They have frozen pay which they say ""flat year on year is good"". They tie their senior managers with employment contracts that should you leave the firm you are required to pay back 4 years of bonus money. Not a positive culture."
bad,too corporate and if top management worked anywhere else they would have been fired by now.  Bought commodities business for $420mm and gave it away for free 4 years later
bad,Jefferies does not provide adequate training or supoprt for those who are new to investment banking or finance. My experience with management and HR was very poor.
bad,Very standard investment banking experience with no frills. Expect long hours (80+ hours are the norm) without protected Saturdays or Sundays (approximately 1 day off / month).
bad,Not very good in the futures Business.Hard to open accounts. to many people running the same department. My co-workers I enjoyed working with.
bad,"The company as a whole spends a good deal of time focusing on outsourcing jobs and not as much time developing careers or calling upon skills internally. The culture was lackluster and minimal.  "
bad,I worked in Product Control for Fixed Assets in an environment that catered to the whim of its traders regardless of how outlandish. The employees on the desk were allowed to foster hostile work environments and were demeaning and disrespectful to their support staff.  The Product Control management team was callous and uninterested in work life balance or basic parental accommodations such as allowing an employee to take their allotted paternity leave.
bad,Worked a lot of overtime due to the fact that I lived 10 minutes away. Hard to keep employees. Very high turn over rate. The manager did not have good management skills in the fact he scolded employees in front of customers
good,"Hire and Fire culture"
good,"Was a good form to work for once, now, not so much. Too many selfish mangers who are sneaky and self-centered. No true direction and compensation gets worse year over year. As long as you stay under the radar you will be left alone..."
good,"Typical work day: catch up on news, press releases, events or industry happenings impacting coverage universe and communicate with the traders as applicable / review SEC filings and update operating models as relevant / research new themes to write large thematic reports on, write quick update notes on relevant news items / preparing for earnings reports"
good,High transaction volume in some groups. Good work experience for younger bankers. Average compensation and benefits. Review the bonus claw back and garden leave carefully before signing.
good,"Jefferies offers very little in incentives for employees.  There have been no raises, no bonuses for a number of years.  The focus is on keeping the workforce static and outsourcing where possible.  Benefits are minimal and time off is difficult to come by and do not stand up to the industry standard."
good,Front office oriented management. Communication with employees was not as strong as I would have liked.
good,Have worked at Jefferies for 1.5 years and have had an amazing experience. Have had the opportunity to work on a lot of deals and have exposure to senior bankers and management team.

good,The top management is very serious about supporting new hires and is keen to meet with new hires. The work is good and its very important to build connections with middle management to progress within the firm.

good,"Work was steady and they gave the opportunity to frow and learn new things. People were great and teamwork was encouraged. Management was great to work for, firm but fair."
good,Workplace culture can be challenging. Level at which you enter the company is key to advancement. Not a warm and fuzzy atmosphere. Not much direction. Good for a self motivated person.
good,"It's Investment Banking.  Work long hours, weekends, holidays and hope to get promoted before you burn out or suffer a nervous breakdown from 100+ hour weeks."

good,"Investment company, corporate based out of New Orleans, downtown location, great bosses, loved the job. I provided clerical support for the Sr. VP, VP, and a Director and his two associates. My work ethic, performance and professionalism was valued. The office was fairly new and I was the last AA hired to join the Executive department. Unfortunately, the HR manager was incompetent so the office atmosphere and culture became flawed. All was well until the owner, boss from New Orleans chose the new girl to be his assistant when he visited, which made me a target. My work environment amongst the other AA's was brutal, cruel and intentionally sabotaging. The incident was reported to corporate, investigated and concluded in my favor with apologies rendered and others reprimanded. Despite my position with the company upheld, I no longer felt comfortable working with my co-workers. I resigned with positive support and letters of reference from each one of my bosses."
good,This is boutique investment firm. Please be aware of the industry. You will have longer than normal hours. Was able to learn the ins and out of working with multiple companies at the same time.

good,"Jefferies was a great company to work for. The financial compensation was on the high side of the scale. I learned more about the business and technical side than I had at my previous employers. The team I worked with was second to none as we were all friends and worked very well together as one cohesive unit. The hardest part of the job was the extremely high stress environment due to each clients financial risk and the need to mitigate that financial risk in a time sensitive manner. The most enjoyable part was the office environment and the great comradery shared between my team, my management and I."
good,"A great company that embraces young energy and puts younger professionals in charge. Part of it is their big culture with incoming interns that get a head start with a very sound bridge program and good compensation. There seems to be a good sense of pride and loyalty. Also a great place to learn more and wear multiple hats considering it is a smaller organization, where the typical role is often stretched out into multiple roles. Very enriching if you plan for a pit stop to get experience or grow within the company."

good,Jefferies is a very prestige company with great benefits and work ethic.

Enjoying the atmosphere and culture at Jefferies are two key drivers to my work/life balance.
good,"For many years, Jefferies was a fun place to work. Your opinion was heard and respected.

The work had to be done expediently but correctly with no or limited interruption to the business since continuity in the bank was of most importance."
