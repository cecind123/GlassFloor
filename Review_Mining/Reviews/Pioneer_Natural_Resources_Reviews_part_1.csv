bad,"Will say whatever it takes to get rid of you."
bad,they are disorganized they foremans who don't know how to pump much less be in charge they will lie to you to  get you to do jobs where they need people they told a lot of men if they went to horizontal to pump they would raise their pay then they didn't they will stab you in the back if they need to  worst job I've ever had only go there if you have no place else to you won't be happy there i'm depressed all the time no enjoyable part to the job I currently work here trying hard to find somewhere to go
bad,They clearly didn't care much about their employees. Most vehicles were unsafe and it was on the employee to operate it or get reprimanded. Very bad job culture.
bad,Decent pay but a very kiss butt environment hard to move up they are always pushing friends and family before any other employees rude management all they are worried about is the top dollar not there employees
bad,"Horrible management, and Supervisor, Making up rules and policies as they go a long, there is no constructive company policies. Supervisor only training the one that they like, there is a lot of racism.  Treating people unfair.  No matter how hard you work with your dedication, its don't mean nothing."
bad,"Excellent pay, but the stress and poor management and rampant under qualified employees make pioneer a hard and unsafe place to work. Upper management is detached from lower employees as well as reality. Work structure and planning are poorly done and terribly executed. Planning falls short from all goals set by company. General quality of most employees is very low to the point of being criminally negligent."
bad,"Internal service company to an oil company, no competition, no desire to improve. I am not used to working in this manor, I strive for continuous improvement, beating out the competition, etc. Within Pioneer this culture did not exist."
bad,Management over the plant I worked for were awesome.  Cooperate management was shady.  We all know what Pioneer is doing to its work force now.  We were the first to go
bad,Had an awesome manager but when he resigned and I moved into his position as manager it quickly became as to some of the reasons he resigned; upper management in the corporate office was difficult to deal with.
bad,"See above.  Very poor management, drilling practices, HSE culture and leadership culture.  Poor advancement opportunities and process.  Cut Throat culture that rewards yes men over competence."
bad,"I work 14 straight days between 12-16 hours a day with no set breaks (Then go off for 7 days unpaid). We are forced to turn in our cell phones keeping us completely out of touch with our families (rules say we will be given a chance to access our phones but that does not happen). Our two weeks start on a Tuesday and end on a Monday as a way of getting out of paying one day of overtime. If we take a sick or vacation day we only get paid 8 hours of straight time (base pay, does not count towards overtime) which means taking a sick or vacation day costs an employee a minimum of $200"
bad,"this job use to be the best in the world , but no accountability not following its own practices and massive lack of communication or consisty drug it down."
bad,Management changes made the job stressful.  Good benefits and 401K match.  Free lunches everyday.  Recently took away all training classes.  Most employees fearful of telling the truth about management.
bad,"I worked at the Voca quarry at Pioneer Sands, it was a good place to work. I always stayed busy and the benefits were great even though I got laid off I got a nice severance package!"
bad,"I never felt like part of a team at pioneer. It always seemed everyone was only looking out for themselves. While I enjoyed many of the perks the company offered, it was often hard to find the motivation to go to the office and see the people there on a daily basis."
bad,"Company was very good, management had some issues, not above board and will stab you in the back without prior notice. Would probably pass on working there since the market is not good for the industry and depending on the department the management will disappoint."
bad,"They have the wrong people in upper management positions. Pay and benefits are excellent but other than that if your not a kiss butt or part of the group good luck advancing in your career. Preparing the Company now to SELL even though they will deny it, that’s what they are doing currently."
good,"It was a temporary job detassling, it's only available for a couple months.  It paid okay money, but was sometimes very labor intensive. I learned that being very hardworking, and always showing up was for the best."
good,"brilliant staff could be utilized better.  too many politically charged decisions lead to stagnation and low morale. kingdom building is a problem, leading to overstaffing of teams"
good,Like working at a day care for adults. Good for a single person but the influence of bad characters in this industry is not good  especially for the labor pool. Management is very superficial.
good,I worked at pioneer for 3 years and never got a chance for any sort of promotion. I worked 2 weeks on and 1 week off which was nice but the fact I would apply internally and only got 1 interview says a lot. Human resources seemed to run the company in a way where they handcuffed supervisor was afraid to address any problems. It was very frustrating.
good,Mechanical repairs and maintenance on field and plant equipment.
good,"Overall a good job but lacking in beneficial experience. My boss seemed like he wanted to work all day and never quit, but we had a sort of under boss who was very nice and respectful."
good,Good place to work if you're an engineer. Pretty good culture. They have free lunches which is nice. Your kids can work there over the summer. Gained a lot of good experience.
good,"Company was ideal for a season; like most positions in this industry, you work a lot of hours which isn’t bad unless you have a family. Overall, environment for me was decent and worked for the season I was in."
good,"Pioneer paid very well, but they were very strict with safety and had a culture where employees were encouraged to snitch on other employees instead of just addressing issues one on one."
good,Was a good company before the shuffling of management and entire divisions being done away with. Lost a lot of good people when the reshuffling happened.
good,I was only there a short time but the atmosphere was tense because the pumping service was being sold and nobody knew what was going to happen to them or their jobs.
good,"Pioneer seems to be a nice place to work, you can get Friday afternoons off, but sometimes there’s so much work, you wind up working the afternoon anyway."
good,"More you worked, the work conditions were poor in the fields. Barely any breaks at all. KIds were screamed at to get back in the fields, less than a 5 minute break."
good,Pioneer is a good place to work but the management needs to change ASAP but the benefits and 401K are awesome. I would work for this company corporate office in Dallas but the pumping service Midland location needs a change in management.
good,"it was a good place to work, until the oil price dropped. then they laid a lot of people off, I enjoyed working there, the people there were good co workers"
good,"Pioneer is an excellent company to work for when oil prices are good. As soon as the prices dropped, the pay dropped for anyone that wasn't salary. I just hate when it comes to pay cuts, the first to have their wages cut are the ones out in the field making the money for the company. Lead from the front. The bonus the men on top get is more than the bonus than all the employees in the field combined. Boost Morale by replacing a benefit you take from your employees with something more cost effective."
good,"Good place to enter the industry.  Willing to train non-cdl employees, and provide cross-training for career advancement. Great work environment."
good,"*Processed fast turn around invoices from SharePoint program into iSeries/MS400 for check process"
good,It was a good job to get the experience you need.  I had fun there
good,Great company but advancement is very hard to get. The management mean well but they are trying to expand to quickly without the proper experience in place.
good,"Not diversified and focusing on one area. No direction on what the company will be in the next five years.  Good benefits, vacation, 401k, and etc.  ----"
good,"They are very unsettled right now.  Layoffs, then hiring, then layoffs. you just have no idea what they are thinking anymore.  It's very sad because it used to be the best company ever."
good,"This is a great company to build a career at. But, like any other oil and gas company, the business cycle always put people on edge and job security is not always guarantee"
good,Varied tasks while working in Reservoir Technical support role.
good,Some in management are not good.  They are in cliques that are not helpful to employees. The Culture is mixed.  Sometime is can be a little too political.
good,"Flex schedule, four 9-hour shifts and 4-hour shift on Fridays. Learned a lot about the industry, the company is very willing to invest in their employees to strengthen them. Management is fair, and instills trust the work will be done right, very little direct supervision. Co-workers are great. Company has a very relaxed atmosphere and most employees are all very friendly and welcoming."
good,Pioneer is a great company to work for when oil prices are up. They have a great benefit package better than any other company I've workedfor
good,"Good company..I had a good experience and was treated fairly overall,and I gave them a hard days work everyday.. I recommend that anyone apply and they will feel rewarded by working there..."
good,"The company was great at the beginning when it really felt like a family, towards the end it became to corporate and cut throat. I liked it better when it felt more like a family."
good,"Pioneer Natural Resources is a tremendous Permian Basin growth story.  PNR at one time had substantial deep water and South Texas production - deep water was sold, and South Texas is being sold - those proceeds will be invested in the Permian Basin."
good,Pioneer thought me a lot of what I know and the men that work there. It just to big to fast and they poured a lot on really fast. That's not hard to get used to but the cutthroat life style was. It is not in me to be that way.
good,a typical day would start out with getting my todo assignments from upper lever management and complete my tasks in a timely manner and then make sure everything completed was professionally presented
good,"Overall a god place to work, but it has it's ups and downs just like any other company. Excellent compensation and benefits, makes some of the bad things pretty tolerable."
good,"Working short period of time for this company as a temporary contractor, I recognized that the co-workers are very friendly."
good,growing to fast changing all the wrong things changing for the worse not the better
good,"Loved working for PXD!  Great benefits, competitive salaries, brand new facility, co-workers were family!"
good,"Pioneer truly is a great compnay to work for with second to none benefits. "
good,Worked independently most of the time. There was a learning curve offered to most. Management was knowledgeable for their department. Overall a excellent company to work for.
good,"Good company and great benefits.  Learned how to process checkrun on my own daily. Good supervisor,  learn to be more focused and enjoyed completing the check process successfully.  Hard part when machine would not function properly."
good,"The benefits are amazing and you get paid well, however the job dominates your life.  The job life balance is out of balance in favor of the job."
good,"Long shift work, learned how to operate different types of equipment."
good,"Support the landmen with weekly reports, land obligations, and review all incoming instruments."
good,"Made career change on promises made at time of hiring only to be laid off 4 months later due to poor company management. great field management, poor office management."
good,Pioneer has grown very rapidly in the last few years and has dine a great job with keeping up with salaries and benefits of its peers.  Lots of changes and sometimes too much and too fast to be implemented like they would like.
good,"A days work would be getting the floor plan or blueprint to see what we have to do maybe loading pipes on a pipe trailer or hooking up our F350 trucks up to pumps or hooking up to a trailer with hearvy equipment on it going to the work site locations then rigging up putting everything together ready for a fracing or pumping job.Sometime the maybe a little hard be end up being a successful day.The enjoyment about the is the coworkers,we learn alot from each other and i have learn alot in my 6 years in the oilfield"
good,"Outstanding mid level management and people in the field are very laid back."
good,Good company in the oilfield industry but the stability is uncertain.  The benefits are excellent. Communication between management and employees needs improvement.
good,"Great benefits, but long work week of 11 days on and 3 days off"
good,When I joined Pioneer it was a great place to work. Management valued you as an employee and told you when you were doing a good job.  They were open to new ideas and changes to make things better.  As time went on and the company grew a lot of the culture and the team work was cast aside.  We went from being in the top 3 places to work down to near 50. It wasn't the same place when I left. It was void of the CORE values and the culture was replaced by more millenniums calling the shots and the people who had helped to bring this company to greatness ignored or cast aside.
good,"Local field office is a much better place to work, however, big corporate has no idea what it is like in the ""real world"". They are detached from the field. They desperately need to get ""in touch"" with the field and let go of all the control."
good,I would still be there if it didn’t sale and like people who I work with and how much time off we hade 14 on and 7 off was nice thanks for your help and prayers for company I hope all people there still all luck and Hppy
good,"do not care to disclose. department sold and am relocating to another part of the country/ Overall a great company with excellent benefits. I am sad they sold our division, but thankful for the opportunity."
good,Nice working environment and tremendous about of growth opportunity  for the willing body. Casual workplace and great benefits and excellent compensation. Heavy management layer
good,Management was appreciative of work done and general population was included in informative meetings. I enjoyed going to work at Pioneer - which I think is important.  I never knew what I would be working on day to day - there were always new requests.  I worked for all aspects of the asset team.
good,The benefits are excellent. For the most part you are allowed to grow at your own pace. Behind the curve technologically. Short sided on engineering staffing.
good,"compensation misleading.  stock options that are ""yearly"" but only vest 1/3 each year - always leaving money you were promised on the table.  Big changes since I have been here.  Layoffs."
good,"Worked in field, was not in town at all during my 2 weeks on. Was managed mostly from the office in town.  Had a large amount of paper work and computer work."
good,"One of the things that I really liked about the company was the flexible work hours.  For the most part Fridays were just half days, leaving around noon.  Provided that there no pressing issues.  The work environment was great.  Friendly co-workers."
good,There is lots of hands on things to learn from . I felt like there were lots of classes and training that seemed to be more import then the actual job of pumping . But the benefits and insurance with really good pay .
good,I was not ready to retire but personal circumstances had to be considered in my decision to retire. Pioneer was a good company to work for and I enjoyed my 11 years with them.
good,"very relaxed atmosphere, management was always there to explain jobs, hardest part of job was not knowing when they were going to lay employees off. All staff at PNR was great including front office and other departments"
good,great place to work haven't laid anyone off in the down swing in oil price. Co workers are more like family every one takes care of each other. safety is a huge part in day to day operations.
good,It's 12 hour work day sometimes.  Day by day I learn about the business of oil and gas.  The atmosphere is fun and my coworkers are easy going.
good,"A typical day at work included interaction with co-workers, management and Land Owners.  The hardest part of the job was making a win-win situation for all including the land owner when consulting on a new site and right of way."
good,"overall a good company to work for. Great benefits, stock options and a place to grow in your career."
good,GREAT!! Experience working for Pioneer. The benefit of my experience of the work experience that I achieved while working there. I will cherish the opportunity to work for Pioneer Natural Resources
good,Working there taught me what my strengths & weaknesses are. Being in real jobs situations everyday for that time period helped me to understand what I have to look forward to in my life after college.
good,"Overall good company. Good benefits , including 401k stock options and up to 10% matching on 401k. 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 yr. Oportunity for advancement."

good,work 12 hours  i lean more  tings of the diesel mechanic  and the hydrolic  system  good place to work  the beter par of the job is  the co workers the we  cover one to the otrer
good,"Great place to work, it is well worth the time and effort to obtain employment at Pioneer Natural Resources.  The  company is committed to supporting their employees and their families while demonstrating a strong dedication to responsible production of oil and gas."
good,"Jobs seem very focused, and not much room to expand on new tasks. Routine days, occasionally will have special projects. Overall a good company to work for."
good,"Great company - they look after their employees - it is a shame that I am a contractor. "
good,"Good team work with corporate employees, enjoyed trips to corporate office to meet those with whom I had phone conversations when there was a need for more indepth research to assist employees at local offices.  Company offered excellent benefits ."
good,It was a good place to work for.  The work schedule was balanced.  It was not to far from my home city so I was still able to spend time with family.  The pay and benefits were good
good,it was a temp to hire position so I got in there and worked hard to only find out they used me to get caught up. Overall it is a great company just wish I would not have been mislead
good,nice friendly environment great leadership.  They had a difficult time letting people come to the main office located in Las Colinas even though there were available positions but over all I loved it
good,"PNR was a company that was not affraid to try new things, and if they failed they would keep trying different things until they found the best process."
good,Typical work day was busy.  Management treated all employees with respect. The culture at work was fast paced at times and other employees would help when asked or needed.
good,"Clock in, eat and update logs/paperwork."
good,"Pioneer is a great place to work. They competitively pay, have incredible benefits and are always willing to work with you in order to keep your personal life in order. There is a usual advancement early on, but once you get to a certain level it is hard to move up. If you only want to be a supervisor of a small group, then this is the place for you."
good,"Pioneer has a great culture, with excellent benefits, great work-life balance, and generous PTO.  The company is not afraid to move people around to find the roles that are the best fit both for employees and for the company."
good,Easy form if work. Team work and puntualuty was a main character that everyone should have in order to work there. Good bonus rewarding good driving. Assesibles location

good,"Pioneer it self has great benefits, the 401 is crazy awesome, they pay for your health, dental and vision, of course subject to change, all depends on the market. "
good,"They run lean, use a lot of contractors to prevent layoffs. Best benefits, 401K, PTO, free lunches, I’ve ever experienced. Just built a brand new building."
good,Pioneer Natural Resources is a great company to work for if you are looking for good pay and great benefits. but its not all a walk in the park. supervisors and higher ups do not seem to care about conflict within the company. when co workers are having issues with eachother all they do is laugh it off and dont solve anything. there is a clique thing going on there that can shutout anyone who doesnt conform to there style of talking or living. the company doesnt do anything about it. but other than that they give great hours. you can be home every night to see your family and there is a set schedule. for an oil field company it is one of the best to work for but like all companies have stuff to work on
good,"Best job I've had, and company was awesome all the way around. From compensation to benefits. My co workers were great and supervisors too. To bad they sold out to ProPetro."
good,I couldn't have been any luckier to begin my career with Pioneer Natural Resources. I was able to develop the skills needed to exceed in this industry. I will not leave pioneer unless it is to advance my career in the direction I wish to go.
good,"As a pump operator I was responsible for pumping fluids down hole. I also kept track of where the fluid was located down hole. I would get to location, put on equipment, rig up the iron to the well head, and pressure test everything before starting the job (pumping fluids down hole.) may run anywhere from two days to three four weeks. I would train many crew members on how to run the pump, as I trained to be an upcoming supervisor. Kept up with DOT logs, Lead  safety meetings explaining our procedures and the schedule of how we plan to go about the job. Identified potential hazards and made sure everyone had communication (headsets)  Finish the job, rig down, and back to the yard to perform maintenance. 16-18 hour shifts."
good,"I had a really great experience here too bad it had to end it is a business after all, I hope it thrives again and when it does if given a  chance I'd be back in a heartbeat"
good,This is one of the best run oil and gas companies in US. They are a great corporate citizen. Has a tremendous work environment and employee culture. They have great benefits and compensation.
good,"-2019 down size"
good,The best place I have ever worked for. Good leaders and great benefits and atmosphere to work in. If you have an opportunity to get one with Pioneer I would suggest jumping at the chance
good,It's a great place to work at you get to meet a lot of different people from different cultures.the pay is very competitive compared to other companies in the Permian basin.the only thing it lacks is leadership from management.

good,Even though I was part of the lay off Pioneer is a fantastic company to work for. I look forward to having an opportunity to work for them again in the future.
good,"I had th oppurtunity to work at Pioneer Resources as soon as I transitioned from the military. From the management to the resources, it was nothing but exceptional."
good,"Very fast paced, highly competitive pay and benefits. Working nights and days is kind of a drag but the pays and benefits make it worth while. Management is somewhat lacking in professionalism"
good,"Pioneer has always been such a great company. The department I worked for, however, was new and in development. The validation department was in its beginning stages in development. Our work load was a lot, but the model and formula was different from everyone. There was no set guidelines that co-workers had on validating truck hours. Our job was to validate driver tickets on work hours to save the company money. The manager of the department allowed everyone to validate on their own preferences. As a new employee, I had my work graded by other fellow employees who validated in their own way. It wasn't fair and wasn't unified."
good,"Pioneer is a great company from the top down.  Management has an open door policy and listens to suggestions, complaints, etc.."
good,"Each work day was different in HR but enjoyed working with new hire and Enjoyed doing payroll every other week. Enjoyed working with employee and helping with benefits."
good,"positive and productive when all employees worked as a team effort. People act as a family, respect given, myself to charge of on site parts Inventory, fleet organizing"
good,I work in a team environment. It is fast paced with lots of opportunity for growth. Employees have lots of feedback from management about performance so that they can excel and do their jobs effectively.

good,"Everyone at Pioneer is very friendly and willing to help with any issues you might have. The company is known for its job security, especially since the oil and gas industry is known for being volatile."
good,Pioneer natural resource is the best company to work for in this area. This company has competitive benefits and wages for hourly employees.  There is a safety culture here that most companies need to emulate. Pioneer cares about it's employees by making them priority and focusing on diversity within the work place and receiving feedback from all employees to help improve how they handle their business.
good,"They compensate very well and have an excellent benefits package.  The only downfall is top heavy management of managers who started small and as the company grew did not evolve quickly enough.  Still, a very good place to work and I would do it again."
good,"Pioneer is a great place to work because of the combination of professional courtesy, expertise, strong work ethic, and entrepreneurship within the company."
good,"Great Place to work."

good,Work Starts at 7:30 am and ends at 4:30. Learn how oil and gas production works. The company puts safety first all the time. The office that i had worked at seemed lke a family
good,"Management generally cared for its employees."
good,"The culture is great and it is a great place to work, just not very tech oriented since it is an oil company."
good,Working for Pioneer Natural Resources has been an amazing opportunity that has allowed me to grow professionally in a field that is sometimes male dominated and fast paced. I have found management to be patient and helpful and overall the company creates avenues for support to perform ones job duties with ease and confidence. I would highly recommend working for Pioneer!

good,"Pioneer Natural Resources was the best place I had ever been employed by. The people I worked with daily were extra friendly and always greeted you with a warm hello or goodbye. When corporate would come down, they treated you the same as well. Great company to work for that offered great pay as well as benefits."
good,I worked at Pioneer Natural Resources for 14 years and enjoyed working for the company. They were very good to me and treated me very well.
good,"The best job I ever had. Best pay, best insurance. Cared about employees. Management was typical for the most part, but did care about it's employee base. Unfortunately had to leave this job to care for a terminally ill family member, and I would severely regret leaving if it was not for that fact. Loved all my co-workers and enjoyed and miss my time there."
good,Excellent company to be employed with great benefits! The problem with working for Pioneer is that it is located in Midland texas.
good,You could always find breakfast on one for the floors in the morning to get you started.
good,"Pioneer offered a good work enviroment, but more importantly also had a great home life balance.They had competitive benefits and salary. Pioneer also created a strong culture for work and positive attitudes at the work place."
good,Working for pioneer was easily the best position ive ever had i enjoyed working there but my supervisor and i didnt see eye to eye so unfortunately i let that dictate my decision to leave
good,Great Place to work. Great pay and benefits. Great environment. Great people. I wouldn't change anything about this company. It stinks that they sold their assets in the hugoton base
good,Good Company to work for. I have nothing bad to say about them . I really enjoyed working at Pioneer but all the lay off came and could not become Perm with them .

good,I was allowed to grow and make contributions to the company.  The culture was very diverse.  Everyone worked well together.  Loved my job.  I worked hand in hand with my boss and I was a lead EA in the company.
good,It was the only job that i have had that would shut down a multi million dollar job for days to fix safety concerns of one person. The hourly pay rate was great as well.
good,for me i would say this was a great company to work at before they shutdown i really enjoyed everyone there i learned a lot and if you ask me if i had to do it again i would.

good,"Great place to work, the company makes you feel valued.  The work home life balance is very good. We worked 9 hour days and 4 hours on Friday. To me this was a great perk."
