bad,You feel like a dam robot. And they don‚Äôt appreciate new employees they will just throw you out there to fend for yourself. They are not compassionate or understanding. You are or will become a robot. And management is a dam joke. You better get your  nose ready to be brown if you get on full time and speaking Spanish or African is a plus. I purposely wrote dam
bad,"Bad experience. Managers lacked patience to train, did not provide enough working days on my schedule. It was a seasonal job but they didn‚Äôt give enough days. They need to improve a lot of things in this store"
bad,Manager was racist and environment was horrible. They pay minimum wage but want you to do way too much. Management is unprofessional and tries to only hires her friends.
bad,"the management is very unprofessional and disrespectful. my coworkers were wonderful, and I enjoyed working for the company for 6 months. However my store manager lacked any sort of managerial skills when it comes to her employees, and made the working environment miserable. üëçüèº"
bad,"All but one of the managers were atrocious. They were very clicky and gossiped behind all the associates backs. They also had very unrealistic expectations. Using my situation as an example; they would only shedual me 3 hours a week (they promised me at least 10 a week during my interview) and then would become upset with me if I didnt remember things like promotionals, sales, and the store layout(that they would change EVERY WEEK). They also didn't train me, insisting that I would ""figure it out"" but then would become angry with me if I couldn't. The costumers would treat me like absolute trash and the managers (except one) would not care and just watch it happen. The store also gets stolen from almost everyday. It's too much stress for a job that will give you only 60 dollars a pay check. Do yourself a favor and find a better place to work."
bad,"Honestly, working for the company was great for the first year and a half, but something changed. The requirements of the job ended up being too much. You had to have near perfect everything, and if you didn‚Äôt you are not doing good enough. They also do not care if you have priorities outside of them. They expect you to put them first and that‚Äôs not right. People have familial issues to attend to, school, and more, but they do not care about work/life balance despite advertising it. They will rather have you there than for you to pursue your own successes. The amount of work and responsibilities is not worth the money. My job had me function as a store/general manager and I was not paid much compensation. As a sales manager, I was not in charge of hiring or interviewing people, but I had to do it despite this being out of my pay grade. Management, especially higher up, don‚Äôt care about you. You are a number on a list and they will gladly get rid of you if you do not conform. Policy is more important that one‚Äôs safety. Overall, this company ended up being highly disrespectful and I would not recommend working here."
bad,"-This company expects workers to work so much, from process clothes to cashiering to helping customers for so little pay.  "
bad,A lot to due didnt have good management at the time due to people leaving finding better job didnakit on my own to step up and get stuff done at the store
bad,Absolute worst job I‚Äôve ever had. Worst management worst coworkers worst hours worst everything!! Avoid at all costs. Didn‚Äôt even get trained properly and everyone except the costumers are extremely rude and disrespectful
bad,"Favoritism, unprofessional me supervisors and leads that prey on new employees from temp services.. female supervisor will make you work like a dog if male supervisors they like show you too much attention.."
bad,"Working in a area as a packer/picker or a area like shipping/receiving is extremely physically demanding. Lots of injuries and they will always blame you for the injures. They use to keep you in a area where you start out at but now that the TURNOVER rates is so bad the management throw you all over the place to make up for their BRUTAL goal to please their seniority. For full time or people that they think need the job, they will be verbally abusive to you if you ever have to meet with them on poor performance on LMs that only 30% of the building workforce is on. Stay away."
bad,Hated the place since the first day. Everyone is so miserable and that environment takes a toll on you. The only good thing about it  was the sample sale events every few months.
bad,"Carter's is the absolute worst place I have ever worked. The manager I had was a lair,racist, flirt, underhanded, thrived on getting someone in trouble from innocents. He is a womanizer, and if you are female, could get away with just about anything. Chose who he wanted to write up and chose what he wanted to sweep under the rug. If you were from the same geographical area you could do as you pleased... Stay away from the William Carter Company in Braselton, Ga."
bad,"When i first got the job I was so incredibly happy but that happiness died quickly  there is a ton of favoritism. hours go to those who management likes. there were months where i literally got no hours, while some people got ridiculous amounts of hours. Since i wasn't working on a regular basis I wasn't familiar with company policies and I always felt like a new employee."
bad,"Kesinlikle pi≈ümanlƒ±k ya≈üadƒ±m. M√ºd√ºrlerinizi g√∂zden ge√ßirmeniz gerekiyor , i≈üe severek ba≈üladƒ±m ancak beni i≈üyerinden resmen soƒüuttu . Sonrasƒ±nda etraftaki maƒüazalarƒ±n personel ve m√ºd√ºrleri ile g√∂r√º≈ü√ºp i≈ü kariyerimi engelledi i≈üe giremedim . Kendisi ile kapƒ±da saatlerce oturup √ßay kahve muhabbeti yapmadƒ±ƒüƒ±m , dedikodulara ortak olmadƒ±ƒüƒ±m i√ßin i≈üine gelmediƒüini d√º≈ü√ºn√ºyorum ."
bad,"Plum awful they won't let you know if your assignment ended you com to work and your badge is cut off, they never have your check correct and the supervisos sucks"
bad,"All the regional/district managers are a bunch of bitter, middle aged, racist, caucasian women. One of them needs to use vagisil. If you're a young caucasian woman, they will love you."
bad,"Management do not be honest with there employees only looks out for there self "
bad,"I was really excited to work for Carter‚Äôs Oshkosh until I started. The manager is very unorganized and not always professional. Also,  you get little to no hours a week. The typical work day isn‚Äôt hard. Unfortunately,  I had to quit due to the lack of hour and poor management."
bad,They actually do not deserve hard working people. Because they will take you as granted. People always leave. Short staff all. No help from management
bad,All they care about is self image. The guards they hire are stupid. They waste money in useless stuff. They have you working more than one job in your area alone and when you ask for help they tell you no.. what kind of place is this? Then the person who is in my area doesn't do a dang thing !
bad,"Working at Carters I thought that it was going to be fun and excited but is not. Doesn't give you a lot of hours, and when they do is because one of the managers is not going to be there or because of its holiday. They really don't care about you because the managers want you to do all the cleaning and not do other things, for example, each manager teach you different things and some people knows how to catch up really quick but they don't let you do it.  For example one time they just give me one day of the week to work for 4 hours and it was a Friday and they knew I was available."
bad,"Company had no solutions for their own problems. DM micro manged and tons of pressure from everyone above. Heavy workload. Shipment was intense everyday almost 300 boxes, little to no stock room space. Company overall incredibly cheap."
bad,"It was stressful working at Carters, the manager and assistant manager were not friendly to employees, they were highly unprofessional. And they never treated employees fairly. I only worked 3hour shifts for 2 to a day a week. It was not enough to live off of taking care of my son. I was getting paid minimum wage."
bad,Everyone at carters is friendly and good tonwork woth. The hours are not enough for someome to live off of expecially having 2 children. More for a younger person in school .
bad,By far the worst management ever. I would never want to work here again. Manager sets her own schedule and comes and goes as she pleases. Not a very friendly atmosphere.
bad,"Not a good company to work for.  DM plays favoritism and promotes the ones that she likes.  You can bust your behind for hours and they'll just overlook you to praise the ones that they like.  "
bad,messy and sloppy. management team was very unprofessional and picks favorites. hopefully it changed but I left because management. co workers were nice
bad,Its retail so it's not a great place to work. It is fine as a temporary job but I wouldnt do it as a normal job full time or anything. If you like retail then this is for you
bad,"idk it was a long time ago but no hours. slow, you have to know how to run register and handle money. Not a lot of traffic coming through. Hardest part of the job was finding something to do when everything was clean."
bad,"No diverse culture and lots of discrimination. Poor management. The hardest part of the job is the fakeness of the management."
bad,"Pay rate was low, benefits were non existent. Unless you are management/supervisor, hours were a joke- those roles always had 40 hours/week. Definitely not for those looking for a career."
bad,"The manager made work so uncomfortable and more stressful than it should have been. All the managers/ supervisors were not on the same page so you'd end up having to fold clothes a different time each time you work. The requirements were not doable because so much was asked for in such a short period of time. I think that if Carters were to get a new manager, it'd be a fun and great place to work at."
bad,working conditions are bad . the hours are too long. ver fast paced and stressful. we got yelled at when our numbers werent high . they are very unprofessional
bad,No hours to give but they are hiring more people... then they call you 15 mins before your shift to tell you not to come in today. The new manager does not know what she's doing and is very rude and disgusting .
bad,"Management is horrible at running the store, they are so rude and inappropriately caddy with the workers. Some of the management was even hostile and rude towards employees and customers. Also has a bad turn around. "
bad,"This was one of the worst places I have ever worked.  I was assaulted by the manager and nothing was done about it.  she has such ahigh turnover at this carters because she is a horrible manager and a horrible, hateful person."
bad,"I hav years of retail, caahier, and customer service experience  amd they told me I sont meet the qualifications????? It just doesn'tmake any sense to me."
bad,This was just a job you get excited to get because it's your first job and you think it's great because you're gonna be making your own money. But then you start and it's like 6 hours a week you work so you basically get paid nothing.
bad,One of the wost company to work for. Distric manager was so unprofessional and rude. if you are not bi language its almost imposible to get a job there.
bad,I was hired on as a sales associate and I enjoyed it at first but the store manager has every unpredictable moods swings. She would create an environment where I felt like I had to walk on egg shells and that would make me have anixety about coming to work. Her rude comments to me and others and overall unfair treatment made me resign and many others like me. I wouldn't recommend working at the Arundal mills location in Maryland. It has scared my entire perspection of the organization.
bad,Honestly when I started it was worth going to work everyday now over the few years it's gotten worse they don't care for employees. It's pretty sad how they treats us
bad,Management issues and inconsistent schedules. Repeat problems with last minute schedule changes and no notice. Inconsistent directions for floor plans.
bad,It is a fun place to work because you get to organize clothes and engage with people . But when i work there i did not get enough hours at all and that was a huge disappointment
bad,"Great  and starting job if you do not need many hours and also do not need any benefits. The store manager was the worst person I have ever met.  She would refuse to help you if the store was busy.  Her priority was staying in the back office.  She would make you feel terrible about yourself anytime you were around her.  Nothing could ever be about you.. It had to be about her ""10 ct diamond ring"" or her ""breast implants""."
bad,Conducted supervior job . Work enviorment was aweful and unethical. Hours were taken constiantly without advance notice. Would never work for this company again.
bad,No raises regardless how long you've worked with the company. No support or resources for management team. Completely overworked with the amount of product delivery pumped into the store. Demands are high from head office. Only focused on higher sales and opening new stores while the employees are over worked without any appreciation. Head office human resources is a complete utter joke with no support or accountability for decipline for associates that are not performing. No such thing as work life balance with this company. Disappointing seeing how it's a children's store. Huge turnover as employees get completely burned out.
bad,"Very sad to say I did not enjoy my seasonal part time position at carter's the management was rude and would call customers ghetto and talk about them when they left, they are so inconsiderate when it comes to sickness, so unorganized with work scheduling. 4 hours a week if you're lucky maybe 8 the only ones who get hours are the management, they're all rude and unprofessional. I just can't believe how horrible it was to work here, especially cause I was so excited about it."
bad,This is a bad place to work the only nice thing I have to say is that the facility is nice. I was hired through a veteran's program and told I had the job went for second interview and they left me hanging but finally got the job secured. You are under constant scrutiny and the managers are always playing tricks on you like being under a constant test to see what kinds of decisions you will make in current situations. Managers were hard to find when you needed them and they were very disorganized I had 3 different bosses and my co workers were very cut throat I had to watch !y back constantly the work ethic of my co workers was very lazy and were there only for the paycheck if you didn't hunt dear or raise show pigs you were not in the club also they didn't take very kindly to me being ex military. The upper management and human resources personally were completely lost when it came to getting !y background check and done I had to do it myself because the girl in the he Dept. had no idea how to do it. If you are the type of person who likes to be beat down at work and constantly threatens with your job then it's the place for you. The security guards will go through your personal items and give you a hard time. The turnover rate is very high and most people I made cont act with were very disgruntled and only other for a check they also worked  more temporary employees  than regular full time I guess to keep from having to pay benefits. The bosses would ride around in a golf cart all day and sit and watch you work while talking badly about you to other employees. I felt I did
bad,"Do not work at the cary, nc location you will hardly get any hours you will get 5-15 but they may still cutt you even more. When it was around christmas/thanksgiving the store manager hired like 6 more new seasonal girl but the thing about that was how are you still hiring when the girls you have ain't getting hours so when she hired the new girl everyone that was a sales associate was getting like 4 or 5 hours a week so imagine 13 girls getting like 4 or 5 hours a week. So all the seasonal quit within 2 or less days. Plus there is a lot of not making the store goals a day so if you don't make goals you can't give hours. They call you at the last minute to tell you that you don't need to come to work. Ect. Plus the manager talk and gossip to much and give hours to the ones they like most."
bad,my coworkers were great and very nice. I had a friend from school who worked with me as well. there were a lot of workers and everyone had their own tasks to do.
bad,"First off the management team seems great & nice at first but after being there for a while you start to realize the immature, fake, miserable lives they truly lead. There is SO much bad talking about other employees ESPECIALLY by management and also of customers. They racially profile all shoplifters regardless of they say they do or not. The she use is inconvenient & they have especially their on call shift that you will receive about 2-3 times a week. I've worked for other retailers and they are by far the most unprofessional and unorganized. One employee is expected to do the work of ten. And don't get me started on the attitudes. I wouldn't go back if my salary was doubled."
bad,not guaranteed working hours which makes it hard to provide for a family. The pay can be better since full time employers are not guaranteed full time hours.
bad,It was the worse job I ever had. I worked very hard for a very low pay which was not fair to me and my other co workers. Unacceptable
bad,"- minimum wage , no benefits and lots of expectations ..."
bad,"docker worker"
bad,"a lot of partiality, very unorganized,never knowing where you are going  to work at or how long you were going to work"
bad,"I hated most of my coworkers. They were a bunch of petty women and all they did was talk behind one another's backs. They were often condescending towards the staff members they didn't like for no particular reason. The store was always a mess. We wouldn't get paid for working overtime, which is illegal but the managers still thought it was ok to make us stay later than we were supposed to without pay. They are lucky no one reported them to the labour board for this. The hours were scarce, yet they always seemed to be hiring new people."
bad,Horrible management they only hire family never gives hours plus the pay is horrible don't work for them the  company is great but the store in rockville is terrible.need to hire new management.with experience
bad,"Their was no training at all. Sink or swim kind of thing. They expected to much out of you during extremely busy days. If you just rang people up back to back with no break for anything else you would get written up or have to clock out and stay after your shift to get the clothing done that they assigned to you. Even on your break sometimes you would have to go up to the floor to help. Over staffed, each person had 8-12 hours a week but they would split those hours throughout the week. You would get a write of if you called in. I had a family emergency with my niece in the hospital and called off and I got fired (for not doing my hour and a half day)"
bad,"temporary sales associate, hardest part of the job was making my school schedule fit with my work life kept being put on shifts when i had to attend class, management treated me like i was not an employee the co-workers were ok not really helpful"
bad,having to go door to door inquiring about internet and working outside  trying to recruit new customers .
bad,Training Temp service employees just for them to quit and train another set of mass hires.
bad,"Horribly negative work environment, management treated the employees like children. Also the managers constantly complained about even being there. No upward mobility besides assistant management. Also worked there for over a year and there was no salary increase. And throughout my year there were only 3 coworkers out of the 40 that they employ that were there when i started."
bad,"i didn't really enjoy carters as a company , they really dint treat there employees that great"
bad,i didnt like this job. i left because i recieved another job that paid better and had better hours. this has to be the worse job ive ever had
bad,"I have been here and watched the place self-destruct over the last few years.  Crown cherry pickers, order pickers will be assigned to the Overstock department, even if you start in another department you will be sucked into the downward swirling black hole of overstock. "
bad,"Bad management "
bad,Management was so poor and did not communicate with each other . Hiring manager was nice but store manager had an attitude and was demeaning to others .
bad,"Was told by a fellow employee that if I felt like I was being pushed out, it was because I was.  Extremely unprofessional store management. Borderline hostile environment."
bad,Had high expectations going in and it quickly when down. My supervisor and coordinators are great but upper management has no idea what to do day in day out
bad,Little to no room for advancement. Poor wages. Poor raises.  Very clicky environment. Like being back in high school. Very hot working environments. Little incentives for extra work done. Expects alot from employees with little appreciation.
bad,"Consistently cutting hours, low pay. Store manager was amazing but working there was draining to every employee and during the entire time I worked there everyone was looking for a new job."
bad,"Carter's is one of those companies where the more people you know the better your career with them will be. Favoritism, sexism, and nepotism go hand in hand in this company."
bad,"As a mom, I thought I would enjoy working at Carter's. Unfortunately maybe this location wasn't the right one. The store manager was a sweetheart, but some of the other managers were rude. Something I hated was that they would force you to basically interrogate customers, when I myself hate being approached by employees."
bad,Worst place I've ever worked in my life. Their training is horrible they put you out on the floor with very minimum training your calls are graded they expect you to get 92 or above on all phone calls. They say they're a family-orientated company but yet you don't get any holidays off so you can't spend any time with your family
bad,"Worst place to work, try working for a company that actually cares about you and all the work you put in the company. Management does not know about the hassles in store, and most store managers don‚Äôt know how to do their job. There is always drama with co workers and  the store managers for no reason. DO NOT WORK HERE!"
bad,"What is the point of putting in a review when you cannot tell the truth,what happened to freedom of speech...I loved every second I spent working for Carters,it was  one of my best jobs"
bad,"there wasnt any work/life balance. poor management. Lack of training and support with in store concerns. workloads were extremely heavy with no payroll to support , leaving a lot of work on the shoulders of the very few staff that was there."
bad,Management was so awful I don't even know where to begin. I was miserable even outside of work. No where to really move up. Horrible hours they only give hours for what best suits them. Lazy as ever but get mad if you forget to do one little thing. Leaves to go shopping while on the clock. Bullies employees and picks favorites. District doesn't care about complaints.
bad,"Terrible company to work for. "
bad,"Carter's Babies & Kids, started off as a great place to work however as my time went on with the company i learned how awful they treated their workers. i got barely any training or support and i could never do anything correctly and they would ask me to pull clothes from the back but never told me from what section and what type. it gave me nothing but anxiety and even my co-workers would be rude to me including bossing me around as if they were my boss and told me what i was doing wrong when i later found out i was doing the right thing but i listened to them and then later my manager told me i had to start over because it was wrong. i felt like i wasnt even apart of a team there."
bad,i was promised and guaranteed plenty of lies. very disrespectful management team. Nothing is confidential and they tend to harass people about working on their off days
bad,"This is very honestly the worst job I've ever had. I worked there about a day before learning the staff was new because most of the last staff quit before black Friday. Turnover is so high because they don't give longer than 4 hour shifts so employees can't take breaks, then they harp on people. Went to cash my check and the girl at the bank proceeded to tell me she quit because of the management. Which I can see, she definitely has this vibe like she's trying to make everyone afraid of her. Problem is she doesn't want to take the time to properly train anyone, then she wonders they're all ""useless"". Well if your staff isn't trained and motivated it's a sign of poor management. Half of the equipment they give us is glitchy it takes forever to do anything. Half of the job it's redundant or busy work, or just unnecessary it's ridiculous. It's not even really a customer service or sales job, unless of course you like selling their brand credit card. Just a bad job."
bad,They don‚Äôt really train you they expect you to just know what you‚Äôre supposed to do. The associates aren‚Äôt too friendly they have their favorites. When closing they don‚Äôt announce they are closed you have to tell customers in person. Barely any hours are giving with low pay honestly it‚Äôs not worth it. You get paid every two weeks you can‚Äôt possibly survive there.
bad,"Bad experience for me, poor schedule and bad team work. Management keeps all the available hours, new hires are treated like disposable help. They offer a lot of benefits but you will most likely never even make half of a living on the schedule and pay they offer."
bad,I work part time and they started to deny me days off and schedule me when I wasn't available then make it my problem to find someone to cover for me.
bad,"While the main supervisor was nice, they were all in over their heads.  Many employees worked through their breaks for added coverage, which is illegal.  I quit because they kept trying to make me do it."
bad,"This is a great place to work if you love being well overworked, underpaid and unappreciated ! Most staff are great, management not as great. Decent discount but not too many other benefits."
bad,Hours and pay are not good. Management is terrible. Complained constantly.Very frustrating experience. Otherwise I enjoyed the customers and sales associates.
bad,"They try to tell you they have a good training program, they DO NOT. Huge work load and you no hours to schedule people to get it done. Pay is very low. Not consistent with policy and brand standards. Everyone from upper management wants things done differently."
bad,There is close to no advancement in the Flushing location. Management expected you to run around fixing things while assisting customers all on your own while they just walk around. There was alot of testing of competency where everything was times and high stress was placed on you for not working fast enough. Not all around worth it for the low wage. The manager is generally mean and sarcastic.
bad,"The upper management is disorganized and back stabbing.  VP's talk about each other behind their backs.  They act like a cult and don't believe in work life balance.  The systems in place are poor or nonexistent.  Directors have a ""know it all"" mentality and are not open to better ways of doing things.  People are just mean and not friendly."
bad,"I was promised a work life balance because it's family"" oriented company. I've been there a year and have 108 hour of banked PTO that I have not been able to use. Plus the countles weeks I've worked 43 hours +"
bad,"Greet customer in a friendly manner. Restock & replenish, place clothing in designated places and specified order. Help customers search for merchandise. Assist with the ordering of supplies and merchandise for retail."
bad,"Complete nightmare, for me. I found the culture to be racist, ignorant and clique base. I was working with a staff whose family were members of the kkk."
bad,"The job itself was very fun, and I got a lot of good experience that will be beneficial to me in the future, but the owner of Carters Ice Cream was very mean, and often times hard to work for. She was rude to the customers, and we often missed out on sales because of that."
bad,"I started working at Carter's back in October 2016 and the pay was bad. Hours were always changing last minute. The schedule never stayed the same. On your off days, they called you in. You never receive good training. It was like if you're new, you're on your own.It was supposed to been Temp to Perm but instead of letting me know if it was going to be permanent beforehand. They waited until the last second to tell me that they cannot give me a permanent position."
bad,Good job if you only want the discount or high school student wanting a little of spending money because you will only work 3 hours a week.To get more hours you would have to be a favorite of the managers. Feels just like high school all over again. Favorites get the best and everyone else has to work hard to survive.
bad,"Co-Shift Lead"
bad,"It felt like I was back in high school with all the cliques. There was tons of gossip, the newbies did all the work while management and people there longer just stood around and talked."
bad,If you can kiss your higher ups butt all day your good but as soon as you make anyone personally upset they cut your hours with no explanation and no chance of redemption or want to keep the job. Major favoritism.
bad,"Working at Carter‚Äôs is amazing in the beginning, until you get to actually know the managers. Only one assistant manager and the part time supervisor were kind and actually helpful in situations. The store manager and the second assistant manager were not. Neither cared about the feelings or rights of the employee. They go against policy and do nothing when a problem is brought to them. They talk bad about employees and the assistant manager makes rude and racial comments on a daily basis with no consequences. They start you out with great hours just to drop you to 0-4 hours a WEEK. And take shifts without permission. Overall I liked the company but the management will make it so I never return."
bad,The management (meaning the store manager and Assistant manager) are looking for reasons to get rid of you.  The scheduling always changed.  DO NOT WORK HERE.  The store manager never lead by example due to the fact if she was on the phone it was ok but not for others.  She has the it's not me attitude.  Good luck working with this location.
bad,"The store manager and district manager were always looking out for themselves, and would lie and manipulate to do so. The store manager kept a book of all of the ways she felt her employees wronged her and would leave it for employees to come across. Gossip and playing employees against each other was common."
bad,"This place is a joke for temps. They play favorites and jerk you around into other deparments. I was a certified lift operator and didnt see much time doing it. I was jerked around into other deparments. I was paid forklift pay reguardless, but they took me out of the deparment i was asigned to telling me they didnt have the money to spend on me and put me in an area where a monkey on red bull could do the job."
bad,In all my years working retail I've never seen anything like this. Little to no training and then your left on your own so your manager can take vacations. When you mess up in their absence your termination is the only result. They conviently keep you for 89 days so they don't have to pay out benefits and then let you go with no written warnings for making a mistake.
bad,"They would call me with little notice about working and would never return my phone calls. I ""worked"" there for over a month and I only ever worked two two hour shifts. The management was horrible and no one ever seemed to know what I was supposed to be doing. I ended up quitting because it was a horrible waste of time."
bad,"No room for advancement, no full-time positions except for general manager, very slow business, maximum of 13 hours per week, will not work with other schedules, etc. 4-5 hour maximum shift. Supervisors could only work a maximum of 18 hours a week. If you get sick, plan to still show up to work or lose your job"
bad,The people in the corp office are mean and backstabbing. They have a high turnover because there is no work life balance. You will work crazy hours and get no reward for it. If your are not part of their click then you will never get  promoted.  You are promised upward mobility in a top heavy management  environment.  If you want to feel like you are working for a place where your bosses disrespect you in meetings and give you unrealistic goals with no ability to obtain them then work for this place. Don't be fooled by the fact that they sale baby clothing.  All the VP's are rude and hate each other.
bad,I would not work here again. Just about everything was poor.
bad,"High stress levels everyday, never leave when scheduled, Did a lot of work by your self, very high volume location but no help to run it"
bad,"It's hard to get into the plant during peek season cops are rude. Its like you have to walk a half mile just to get inside the plant  to walk another half mile once you get inside the plant to clock in. They need to spend 50,000 dollars and put the brake room in the middle of the plant also security and bathrooms."
bad,I think the manager jewels was unproductive and rude she drove all her good employees away. There was no like good feedback she only was constantly worried about herself and not able to accommodate to others schedules
bad,"Poor management/leadership.  No work/life balance.  Only concerned about numbers, not about employees satisfaction (like they claim).  I would not refer anyone I know."
bad,"no hours, terrible management I would not reccomend working for them pay sucks too and they expect you to be super happy to go to work for them . don't do it"
bad,"The work is easy and rewarding, customers are friendly.  The store manager needs additional training when dealing with employees. Favoritism is see between store manager and certain employees."
bad,"I got hired as a temporary associate. I was happy at first. The store manager was good but assistant manager not so much. In the interview i was asked if I spoke spanish I replied no. First job day with store manager was good but when stuck with the asm next day we had to practice with customers and cash register. The asm was getting on me about speaking spanish when clearly I declared in interview I'm not bilingual. Nor were the other girls but she kept picking on me solely and on all badges they write se habla espanol which i was told means you speak it. They keep track of your sales and how many customers you sign up for the rewards. And at the end of the day before you leave they talk to you about your sales for the day. Whoever has low count rewards sign ups and or low sales they make you clean up the restrooms. They would go against rules as well. For instance the store didn't hit a money mark they wanted for that day so they left the store opened after hours till they hit the money mark they wanted. Dress code wasn't inforced unless the market manager or regional manager was coming for a store check up then they would inforce dress code that day and wear whatever after. We were schedule 2, 3 and 4 hour shifts but sometimes didn't complete our shifts and were sent home early."
bad,"The company is discriminatory and racist."
bad,"Was hired under false pretenses, but learned to love my job because of my team"
bad,Horrible work environment with dm who was very unprofessional.  Hr did not help either! Some mgrs are left to get away with EVERYTHING and break policy ect and others are held accountable to every little thing! Unfair work environment.  Woule NEVER recommend anyone I know to work for this company
bad,"The manager seemed nice but I could tell she was a witch a heart. She claimed that she treated her employees like family but then she‚Äôd fire you without reason. If you are looking to get a second job and make extra cash, this isn‚Äôt the place for you. You‚Äôd be lucky to work ONE day out of the week. There was too much favoritism from management."
bad,"a good place to work, but pay could be way better"
bad,"I was a transfer from a California Oshkosh store which I absolutely loved working in. From the minute I stepped in the building I was treated poorly, gossip happened more than work, accomplishment was not recognized and definitely not praised. I was expected to do as much as my assistant store manager with NO TRAINING. When I would ask questions I would either be told they didn't have time to teach me or they would very exasperatingly tell me the answer. I ended up moving onto a new job after two months and was very sad because I loved the company, I loved the brand I was excited to grow with Carters and that didn't happen. Oh and by the way every attempt to reach out to my district manager to talk about my concerns of treatment that were bordering on abuse were ignored. Even after employment I have continued to reach out with my concerns because I want the best for the store and those attempts have also been ignored. Don't work here unless you enjoy work time being filled with gossip and degrading comments on other employees, and trust me when your not around you are the subject of their slander."
bad,Management made the working atmosphere very tense. It was not enjoyable to go to work when the manager was there and many customers complained because of the management. Nice to work around kids though.
bad,"Senior management is terrible. DM treats employees like scum. It doesn't matter how many KPIs you and your team are hitting or if your store is highly ranked on the scorecard, the DM will berate you and bad mouth your top performing team members. The pay is terrible."
bad,Filling the floor. Opening shipment or back stocking. Fixing the store. Helping customers find what they need or what they are looking for. Cleaning if no one is in the store.
bad,"I had a pretty bad experience with Carter's, it had weird inner drama disguised as friendly conversation that ended up making me lose hours. I was not properly trained but figured out what to do quickly, the tasks are relatively simple. My particular store was also extremely strict and rather than training or tell me how to better my folding or customer greeting and service, the shift manager just scheduled me less. I did have a very kind store manager and district manager as well as other kind coworkers, but these particular instances made it difficult for me to get money for my bills etc. When it came time for a raise, it was only by 3 cents. They didn't give me compensation for covering shifts at different stores either. Overall I'd say I met very kind people but the company isnt for me."
bad,"I promise if your part time you WILL NOT hardly get any hours and the pay is awful ! Being  in retail the schedule changes every week and if your just a sales associate , you may get 8 hours a week"
bad,This is one of the worst unprofessional jobs I have worked with (even the managers). I lasted 3 days. The girls where so catty and talking negative about everybody that work there plus the customers. I never worked in retail clothing stores and the only knowledge I walked away with was how to be a wh**e and get away with it and more gossip.
bad,I loved working with the staff at Carters Kids Clothes but the hours I was scheduled were not the hours talked about in my interview and I could not make them work for my schedule.
bad,"Hardly ANY hours, always being cut off hours. Promised a pay of $9.00 the hour but in reality it‚Äôs $8.50, poor management and understaffed. Not a lot of sales either."
bad,you have to be here a certain time to be permanent years wise there is a lot of favoritism and if you didnt speak spanish they as in managers and some workers sat around talking about everybody
bad,"I did a 8 hour shift, covering for someone else as a favor and when I was done they told me that they would only pay me the 4 hours I did in the morning and not the other 4 hours. They gave me no information about dress code so when I showed up they yelled at me.  First day they put me in the floor with no idea what to do. Horrible management. No help what so whatever. I left after my first day. Isn‚Äôt worth your time."
bad,"Typical day consisted of greeting each and every customer coming into the store, meaning you would have to run from one side of the store to the other or managers would get on you for not greeting someone. Folding clothes and cleaning duties (windows, floors, bathrooms, etc.). Employees were always very friendly and helpful.  Very poor management, they can schedule you a 6.5-7 hour shift and wont give you a lunch only a 15 minute break. The managers are very young and they overwork you. $10.50 is not enough for the amount of work they make you do."
bad,"If you like working with immature, irresponsible, back stabbing people... work here. The pay is iffy, the hours are few, and the management is a JOKE! This store has a high turn over rate, so even if you are hired, you wont be there long."
bad,"i worked at carters for 6 months never had enough hours and paychecks were slim to nothing when i said that i would have to find another job due to the lack of hours the manager told me that carters was my # 1 priority, after i did find a full time job elswere she bumped me up from 7 hrs. a week to 40hrs and told another employee ""lests see if she can handel it"". i quit."
bad,"Everyday is a fun day fo me because of my character . "
bad,"I received a job here as a sales associate and no one seemed to be available when I called for my hours.  I called a few times a week and they would always say that another person would get back to me. Finally, one person called me back and left a voicemail saying that I wasn't able to get the position anymore because the part of the online training (that needed to be done in the store and they hadn't had me go in yet) wasn't finished. They told the employees there that I had ignored their calls which I have evidence on my phone to prove that wasn't true and how it was clearly the opposite.  I have plenty of experience working at a Carter's store in another state. Probably more experience than the majority of their current employees.  I would have been a wonderful addition to their team.  Then when I tried to forget about their pettiness and apply a few months later, they sent me an email back saying along the lines that I wasn't qualified for the position. I called back to ask why with my many years of customer service experience let alone with that company.  They gave me the same answer that she would ask another manager and get back to me.  It's been a month later and they still have NOT. Very unprofessional and childish.  Save yourself the time and work at a store who values their employees."
bad,"Le travail comme tel est relativement simple, mais ce n'est pas bien organis√© et tr√®s mal sain comme ambiance. Le salaire n'est pas repr√©sentatif aux t√¢ches auxquelles nous sommes dans l'obligation de faire."
bad,"I started a month after they first began and many of the people that started with me have either found another job, quit, or looking for another job."
bad,This is a super fast paced environment and extremely stressful and they allow bathroom breaks but they are frowned upon and you can get written up for taking too many bathroom breaks
bad,"Great sales and discounts on children clothing. Offers benefits for part time employees, however very inconsistent with how many hours you are scheduled to work, any where from 3 to 20 a week."
bad,The company overall is good. The store managers and leaders make it unpleasant to work for them. The store manager is not consistent and lack great leadership skills.
bad,Carter's was a stressful place to work. They did not follow labor practices in relation to breaks and lunches. They did not have adequate payroll to staff the stores.
bad,Retail is long hours with little pay. They want you to live at the store always be available for them and give you as little pay possible with no Benefits
bad,"Too much to do, ended up spreading yourself thin too often while receiving constant negative feedback"
bad,You are replaceable. Period. Management will lie to cover their butt. Selective accountability. Some employees are allowed to goof off and stand around while others are written up for bathroom breaks.
bad,"Store manager would tell employees how horrible i was. I was the assistant manager. I had a very sudden death in the family and the company did not respect it. The funeral was a day i had to work explained i was not coming in due to the funeral being so close and personal i would not be in, because of this the district manager would not let me come back to work because they didnt care that it was a funeral  would have gladly went back"
bad,"The manager there is horrible she talks about her employees, starts rumors just terrible...if they would actually listen to their employees and pay a better living wage and pick better managers it wouldn't be a bad place to work"
bad,I was located at the carters at danforth and victoria park. The management was always changing and they were never professional. The workplace culture was on and off sometimes it was goood or bad its was all over the place.
bad,Not interested I would not recommend no lunch area and the back room stays freezing due to a breakage in the ac at front and back of store not a horrible job for beginners
bad,It was not so bad working their just Management thinking they can talk to you in any domineer that they want too. They make promises that they do not keep. Want you to go above and beyond for them but then show favor to employees!
bad,"They do not invest in people, they have POOR Management and Leadership skills. They also force overtime on the employee. They break there own policy that is in place for disipline."
bad,"It was a seasonal position. They hired more people than they needed and forced those people to be on call. I had a schedule, and they would call the days I was supposed to work and say we don't need you today. Was a terrible experience."
bad,I enjoyed the brand and company of carters. The particular store i worked in lacked the ability for internal growth. I think that if the store had a less caddy store manager this would be an excellent company to grow with.
bad,"I do not want too bash this company,  but I will be clear about how My experience working there was. I would start by saying if you are not buddy's with the store manager or district manager you will not survive.  This company lacks in hours,  professionalism and overall respect.  You are not valued for your hard work.  There's a lot that you can learn from this company,  but that comes with a lot of headaches.  Best part of the job where the kids!  I enjoyed all the smart and beautiful kids that would walk in the store and put a smile on my face."
bad,"Do not work at carters. They literally give you a day of working 4hrs shift and the rest you're ""on call"" most of the times that you're on call you they don't need you so you're only getting 4hrs for the entire week. "
bad,I would never recommend anybody to work for this company. They really not good with example on how to do certain. NO NO NO NO
bad,"Cash out customers, rearrange the store with new merchandise, keep the store clean and organized."
bad,Over all working for Carter's was great but for any advancement in company you couldn't get any where unless your manager liked you
bad,"Pros are the benefits are okay. Too many cons- little pay for hard work, DM turns a blind eye to a lot no matter how high the retention rate is. Only cares about store managers and no other employees."
bad,So much work but no support from upper management. Dont give opportunity to grow. Dont give a chance for career advancement. Dont give appreciation to the hardwork of their people. Dont give good compensation.
bad,Most of the managers are lazy - they wanted all the work to get done but would rather stare at a computer screen than help - district manager had favorites
bad,"This is only a good fit if you just want to supplement your income on a temporary basis.  This company only keeps on very few permanent employees.  If you are very fast at your job you get to stay on for a long time as a seasonal employee.  However, if you have a job related injury you still get pointed if you leave early.  To this company you are just a means to an end.  If you request to work in another area because you are in pain from the repetition of some positions you might as well be talking to a wall."
bad,"I use to work at Carters for seasonal position, so I worked their for less then an month. The people I worked with was really friendly and relaxing. But I was not working there anymore because I was seasonal but they did not call me or tell me that I did not work their anymore. I figured out that I did not work their anymore because when I logged into the schedule app it wouldn't let me and maybe the app messes up. So I been checking for 5 days and still not letting me log in to know my next schedule to work. So I called and asked them that it won't let me log in and they said you been out of a job for about a week and we forgot to tell you. So that means if I would of not called then they still wouldn't contact me to at least let me know about it."
bad,The people I work with and that are in building that keeps the company in business are some awesome people but the company itself is going down upper leadership are just worried about themselves
bad,"I worked at a newly opened store and one week i had worked 30+ hours only to drop to 10 hours and then 5. They claimed other employees needed the hours more than me without asking me. Took days from me, and then claimed I ""didnt want to work"" there because I left sick with the flu one day. Managers are inexperienced and messy. Communication is extremely poor. Customers were wonderful which is saying something in retail."
bad,"I started out as a sales associate and became a part-time supervisor within a few months, but the pay raise is not worth all the complications of being a supervisor. My manager tends to  be one of the few that people want to train under and she makes the schedule according to her needs and what she wants, such as weekends/evenings off. I've only ever called in sick 3 times in the 2 years I work there and got yelled at so bad for it, which I thought unprofessional. They do not hire other people so you get relief. I worked almost every evening, got called in on days I had off or asked for off. As part-time, I expected at least 20 hours at the most and sometimes I would have just as many hours as the full-time because she would screw up the schedule and book people in that are on vacation so I would have to cover the shifts. Not a great place to work and if you want a life outside of work, especially if you have kids and want to see them. Don't ever get sick here,"
bad,They say they are expecting a lot of work but nothing ever comes in. Some days you could work your full 10 hour shift but most days its less than 8 maybe only an hour. Management sucks. I haven't had a full 40 hour week or a full 80 hour paycheck since beginning of December 2017 and im writing this August 2018.
bad,"I worked at a busy store and the shrinkage was HORRIBLE. This was my second job. The management was terrible. The schedule was rarely put out when it should have been. Nothing about this job was worth any of the time I spent there. Maybe the discount, but it wasn't enough to stick around."
bad,"Location was fast paced, many theft issues from customers, store was too small for the amount of customers we had for 1 day. The new associates made more than I did after working there for over a year. I was a supervisor but ended up doing manager work. Store manager refused to work on Sundays so I always ended up working on Sundays and have to miss church. Associates did not care about their job, therefore, they did not work consistently, they walked around doing nothing most of the time, management did not care. Whenever we were busy and I was unable to take a break, management would change my hours to say I did take a break, do I lost money on that."
bad,"A day at work here is simple, help customers & keep the store clean and neat. The employees work harder than the managers. Pay is low,great coworkers."
bad,"It starts out fine ,until you are required to work 35 hours a week, when you are suppose to be part time. hourly wage is not enough for the amount of work that has to be done. If you have a family, this is not the job for you, because you will hardly see them."
bad,Mean management talks trash behind workers back is not honest about hours when hiring can work anywhere between 4-25 hours
bad,"Most of the day I am restocking clothes on racks or shelves, and cleaning the store. The con working here was not getting enough hours and the training was was poor."
bad,"lots of work , not enough appreciation"
bad,On a regular day you'll receive shipment and spend time playing it in the stock room or replenishing the floor. I learned to multitask in this job. Management expected too much from one employee in a four hour shift. Managers were not flexible with hours.
bad,"i learned a lot here. I would answer phones, do go-backs, mark down sale items and also greet and help out the customers. It was overall a good experience."
bad,Trying to sell the merchandise as much as we can. I've learned to always make the customers happy. Management is horrible. My coworkers we're cool. The hardest part of the job was trying to understand the different languages spoken from the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is putting a smile on the customers face!
bad,"D.M. and Managers are very close friends, they share there every day life personal experiences. If you are not willing to put your personal business out  for them to judge and gossip then you don't belong in their circle . They company allows District Managers to treat people like garbage and does nothing. It's almost like if they had no H.R. Department. The company also changes their coupon policy every 6 months making it impossible for you to give the customer or bulk buyer a direct answer  when it comes to discounts and rewards. Manager turnover is very high nobody likes to work for wishy washy District managers and a company that can't seem to make decisions and stick to them."
bad,the company is just awful work for period. the corporate office does nothing for its employees the whatever the manager s and has no interest in the other employees
bad,"Fired on the spot for venting feelings the day after threatened by thieves.  Was reprimanded by loss prevention,  and district manager for asking security to stay outside in front of store In  truck as we were being ripped off.  Told it was a liability.  Vented frustrations about it.  Was told to turn in keys.  Then they lied about whole situation and  twisted it around so I couldn't collect unemployment.  Manager was no help either.  Not to mention manager never shuts up"
bad,"Although the associates and colleagues were amazing to work with, and it is rewarding to manage/coach, the corporate side of carters/oshkosh is a mess. Often times it seems that the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing and vice versa. You will be told to do something one way and then get scolded for doing it as they asked. There is little to no support from most of corporate and often corporate store visits end up being a waste of time and money. Not a good place to work I'd you want to move up the ladder as they tend to hire outside the company for higher job titles."
bad,"My manager was a horrible women. I had to go on leave after losing my son, and she was very unsympathetic and uncooperative when I asked for my record of employment so that I could apply for maternity leave. I ended up quitting because of her."
bad,Store manager just sits in the office all day and complains about employees. They train very poorly then reflect it back on you to make it your fault. They don't schedule properly
bad,"Not bashing the store I use to work at because I was/ am greatful that I at lease had some type of job BUT the pay wasn‚Äôt great and it was my first time working in retail so I had NO EXPERIENCE in that and I felt like it was kinda hard figuring out the company‚Äôs system. Also, maybe just the store I use to work at, but my former manager was always talking about cutting hours and this and that when the store was ALWAYS busy soo..."
bad,"I worked at Carter's as a Sales Associate and i was given low hours.  Some weeks 5 hours, others 8 hours. This is not a job if you want to make any money or even pay your bills.  The work environment  is fun and i enjoyed helping our customers find what they were looking for. You will not make any money because they rarely schedule you. Don't waste your time and best not to work there."
bad,"no growth if you weren‚Äôt favored by DM, playing associate, manager, security daily and no compensation to make up for it & lack of growth opportunities"
bad,"your experience will depend upon your team or your level upon which you enter the company. "
bad,"The owner of this company is currently in jail. During my time there, the place was poorly managed and the job stressful. Every day had a sense of insecurity and I often wasn't paid on time. Terrible management."
bad,"When I first started I enjoyed the company. I worked very hard to get hired on but during that time I was being bullied by a Carter's employee and the management did nothing about it. It was very  upsetting and I was supposed to be hired on then all of a sudden they kept saying it would be next week, than the next and it kept going like that until I decided to quit. I never stopped doing my job but I was treated very unfairly."
bad,"You are hired and trained to work in one department but are required to help out other departments when no work is available in home department."
bad,"Although it is a great environment to work in for a first job, working at this particular location was one of the worst experiences I've ever had. The store itself doesn't do well due to its location and the managers are pushy with trying to sell as much as they can which puts pressure on employees. Unless there is a big sale coming up (like black friday big) expect, 1 or 2, 4 hour shifts a week. the managers also like to chat in the back A LOT rather than help you out so you'll be on the floor by yourself most of the time. They seem like friendly people at first but they gossip and talk badly about all their employees. They also train the more naive first time employees how to track ASP and Conversion when that is a managers job so that the managers don't have to do it."
bad,"I had been hired for 20 hours minimum. Only to be told 8 hours with the option for 20 max. I would get a call an hour before they needed me. I didn't mind and figured maybe once they fired the one girl they planned on, there would be more. They had shady ideals on the reward program. After training specifically states on how to do it they forced you to sign people up. You had to keep a % daily. Their was close to no training even though paperwork states different. They also weren't understanding after my grandmother passed away. I feel theirs a disconnect between corporate and stores."
bad,"I did enjoy the team I worked with, I did my job according to its description and more. The managers do not follow rules, making the experience there horrible."
bad,Co-workers were GREAT! Working their you have a lot of job titles. It was a small shop it. It was a good working experience. 
bad,I worked for the company before it was sold to Carter's. This is a money focused business. Sure successful businesses must be but should never come at the cost of your staff. Appropriately staffing the store is next to impossible with the hours provided and there are very little incentives for success.
bad,"Great place to build your resume. "
bad,"It was honestly a great place at the start.  Fun culture, nice people, etc.  Then HR changed our entire salary structure and ruined a large portion of our benefits package.  This happened over time which made it worse."
bad,"Horrible experience. So first when I came in for the interview, I wasn't met with smiles or hellos. the lady seen me and waved me into the back and just had the rudest face ever. She asked me questions and seemed annoyed when I took time to think. After getting hired and starting my first day, they showed me how to do everything on the register ONE time and then left me at the front on the register by myself and looked annoyed whenever I called someone for help, I mean its my first day and I was only trained for a lil bit how can you possibly be upset at that. The management was sarcastic and rude and made slick comments. When the sent me on the floor to fold clothes I didn't know how to do it because the way stores fold is different then how I fold at home so I asked for help and was met with slick comments about how I should know this already. Everything bout my time there was horrible and mean and I hated it."
bad,"i worked there for about three years always trying to move up to management but when it came down to it i was ""promised"" a manager position and was given away, and lack of communication falsely claimed they had my number to call for a cancel shift i drove an hour and half just to be told to go home. Unprofessional"
bad,"There isn't really much negative to say about OnCue as a whole. Of course working in a retail environment you encounter your occasional difficult customer and the hours/shifts can sometimes lack flexibility for managers, but that is why you get paid more and compensated with various bonuses and benefits."
bad,Not enough hours  but overall it was not that stressful it‚Äôs pretty decent if you enjoy slow paced jobs however if you need money than i don‚Äôt recommend.
bad,"Good for students & mothers looking to return to work part time. The hours are great, however, they are not evenly distributed and favored associates are given preferential treatment of a available hours and times."
bad,fun people to work with. boss was tough but flexible. hours and pay were not.minimum wage for moving sometimes hundreds of boxes. this was an outlet store so inventory was more than usual store. great hires at assistant manager position.
bad,"Carter's lawn service was a family-owned business. However, the time I was there was brutal, fast pace some days we did not receive breaks but I was deeply grateful because it was my first job."
bad,"the staff was okay but not amazing, they tend to spread drama and cause a hassle at the work place. It was good beginner job to gain basic knowledge and skills for retail"
bad,"The upper management is awful to say the least.  The customers are typically very nice though.  The other carter's are nice places to work just not the one I worked at, the store manager is entirely unprofessional."
bad,it was an alright job. they did not let me request off for thanksgiving break to go home. they do not give enough hours per week making workers have to work 2-3 jobs.
bad,Poor manager poor supervisor supervisor not fair that need better manger  everything is base of production manager have there pick who should get it everyone who r a employee should b treated fair
bad,You come in and greet your customers and help them pick out things if they need help. You try to get them to sign up for rewarding moments and ring them out.
bad,"Too much is being done for too little pay. The work that is being done on a regular involves a lot of active activities . From lifting , to restocking, to cleaning, register.."
bad,love working at carters. Everyone is so sweet and the customers are generally kind and want to talk. The work load is very manageable and the hours are flexible
bad,management was horrible in my opinion. they were always complaining about something no matter how hard you tried to work. i loved my employees but they gave you little to no hours.
bad,Good company to work for. A lot of responsibility and workload and not enough coverage.Great management but not a friendly DM Its a fast paced store. New things to learn everyday
bad,It was a big company no room to grow or even get enough hours. Did not enjoy this job. Management wasnt that great. Overall i left because it was overnight and i didnt enjoy working late
bad,"I enjoyed the people I worked with at Carters, except for the manager. She was not accommodating when it came to school, ( Why I had to leave), and she plays favourites a lot of the time."
bad,"the manager and coworkers really good"
bad,"I enjoy working at Carters. I enjoy being a manager and love my staff. The kids are also a joy to be around. A typical day at carters is receiving shipment processing boxes. replenishment of the sales floor daily, customer service and cash wrap etc."
bad,Okay company for entry level work.  You will gained experience and knowledge with different software that they use.  Co-workers are all nice.
bad,"its a good to work , you learn a lot about clothing wise , knowing by looking at a kid you will know what their sizes are. they always have sales"
bad,"Poor Managment , lack of hours & respect . doesnt pay right. And Assistant Manager If Is very racist . I Wouldnt Recommend that job to any i quit after a month due to disrespect."
bad,"This job was not my favorite due to the busy environment. Many of the customers and staff members were very rude and would tend to be watching you at all hours of the day. I would adjust the sizes so they were in order, help customers find the right sizes as well as help them locate things around the store, ring out the customers orders and clean the store. For being a children store, I thought this would be more of a laid back job but it was actually not that at all. I felt really disrespected some of the times due to the management not always treating the staff correctly. There were many people that had left due to this reason as well. I enjoyed dealing with the children but unfortunately some parents were not. "
bad,While I was working at Oshkosh Carters we had great group of very talented people but unfortunately we didn't have matching management. The directions given was very unclear & inconsistent.
bad,I was not pleased with this job but I was truly only there to work. Management did not seem to care about employees it was strictly about getting to work out.
bad,"La g√©rante de l'√©poque √©tait ignoble avec les clients et les employ√©s, cet emploi aurait pu √™tre tr√®s bien √† part √ßa."
bad,"Overall, the manager that was there the most showed me everything I needed to know. She was great and loved questions. She made it easy to get fairly comfortable."
bad,Decent money. Terrible management. Terrible benefits. You are a robot. No thinking required. No maternity leave amd it is a baby clothing company. They only pay 20% for healthcare.
bad,"The company in general is good. But depending on what store you apply too is the problem. "
bad,"Working for Carters/Osh Kosh be prepared for very slow business days throughout the weekdays and more busier days during the weekends. No room for advancement other than promoting people to lead positions which give them a little higher pay. I got paid $9.00 an hour and they paid weekly which was nice but you generally didn't get more than 15-20 hours a week there wasn't much overtime unless it was during the holidays and 15% discount isn't even a discount because they don't allow coupons to be mixed with the employee discount so you're basically paying the same price as the customers unless your shopping in the clearance aisle. A typical day would be re-folding, re-locating, and replenishing areas but it does get repetitive and boring after awhile and they constantly want you to greet the customers offering them shopping bags which tends to annoy the customers."
bad,"Horrible, management is horrible, GM is horrible, if you've been there years upon years I guess it's okay but they like to pick and choose who they want to schedule and will take sides when there is a conflict."
bad,"This place is the worst place to work. You'll get 10 hours a week with a $150 check every 2 weeks. Management doesnt teach really anything they basically threw instruction and words at me automatically assuming I knew the meaning. The manager under the assistant is rude, gives attitude all the time and talks about customers behind their backs"
bad,I've been working at Carters for about 1 month now. I can say that it has not been the most pleasant experience I've had. I feel like I work for a restaurant business in pertains to the time I leave. They are constantly trying to make you pay past hours and fail to properly train newcomers.
bad,"Its okay, only if your in high school to work short hours.. Carters is a typical retail job good for a place to be your first job. Management defintetly needs to be trained a little more."
bad,"A typical day at work is approving expense reports, speaking to people on the phone and e-mail. Setting up direct deposit for all traverlers. My co-workers have taught me alot about being a team player and accounting skills. Monthly I balance our general ledger. The hardest part of the job is when employees who are not following company policy could be hostile. The most enjoyable part of my day is working with all types of people."
bad,Management do not know how to communicate with each other. They make empty promises of rising in the company. They continuously offer management positions but with no followup and then hire management outside of the company. Sales associates in the company for 2+ years are getting less pay than recent new hires. I would not recommend this company at all.
bad,You start off at 9.25 regardless of experience. If you‚Äôre a sales associate you get less than 10 hours a week. You‚Äôre lucky if you even get 6 hours. NO HOURS. Small paychecks. Expect to get less than 200$. Store manager and Assiatant both get 40 hrs while everyone else gets the scraps. Don‚Äôt work unless you have another job. Your shifts are 3 hrs long and even if you‚Äôre available all day everyday you still get no hours. Expect your hours to be cut too. If you‚Äôre a sales associate your hours are the first thing cut. Due to lack of sales they start cutting hours on Wednesday. There‚Äôs no traffic in store. It‚Äôs a job for ppl who need lunch money and gas.
bad,"I was a college student looking for my first job. It was an okay place to start, but after being there for three and half years and no offers of advancement while watching sales supervisors come and go and management never offering it to me even though I had shown I was committed and one of their better workers. There was clear favoritism. Contently cut hours and barely able to pay bills. You had to push customers to give you their phone number or email for promotional coupons otherwise management would come down on you despite the customers being uncomfortable with giving their information. Hopefully things have changed since I left."
bad,"I am a long time employee with Carters Osh Kosh and Bonnie Togs. It was good for several years. Currently they have a DM in place in charge of Ontario Horseshoe. I am actually beside myself with how dishonest, manipulating narcissistic  and has no integrity whatsoever, this DM is, WOW!! I have seen her violate polices and Code of ethics. It almost seems like she runs the company, creates her own policies and picks and chooses who she likes. If you kiss her fat butt  you‚Äôll go places!! The most difficult thing for me is to see how head office staff are either blind or Intimidated by her. It‚Äôs unbelievable. Her leadership is completely based on dishonesty. She never gives praise and only recognizes the negative. Store level is good  if you have a manager that sticks up for your team. We are lucky to have a great team and manager. If it wasn‚Äôt for that, I‚Äôd leave. Although she gives managers a tough time too."
bad,"Management at this location was very poor. The manager chose to pick favourites and only train that employee for advancement. Would never work with that manager again, or for that company"
bad,Une aussi belle compagnie qui fonctionne tres bien et aim√© par les client. Parcontre la gestion du personnel et l equilibre professionnel n est pas au point. On comprendra que cette compagnie est nouvellement introduite dans notre pays depuis moin de 5 ans. Par contre il ouvre les magasins sachant que d autre non pas gerant affecter ou d assitant et ne donne pas non plus la formation necessaire pour atteindre le travail attendu. Le personelle est formidable et l environnement de travail aussi mes la gestion du personnel est la base de lentreprise si il ny a personne pour ouvrire le magasin il y a un probleme.
bad,Have to be chummy with upper management.  Company appreciates and respects work life balance.  Training can be good or bad depends on who you have and your direct supervisor.
bad,"If you aren't good at working at a fast pace job and not getting to sit down for 8 hours, be my guest and apply. I work at the location in the Outlet Shoppes of Atlanta. The managers are always on their phones and always getting mad at you, unless you were one of their favorites of course. I worked very hard and was very good at my job but nothing I did could ever please them. Also, they were not helpful with scheduling either. They would constantly schedule me for when I had class and would not release the schedule for the following week until the night before (which is against  the policy)"
bad,I love working with people but the staff was very weird on team work.
bad,"Relatively flexible schedules. But when I would specifically say I was not available to work (with time and appropriate reason), I was scheduled anyway. Management was hard to contact at some times but not totally horrible. Most co-workers were very nice although some were more interested in talking bad about others than actually working. Breaks were reasonable but not well managed. You take a break when they tell you you can and sometimes they would forget. Break is only 30 minutes and you usually use it to go to the bathroom though 9 times out of 10 either the bathroom was locked and no one had the key, or the bathroom was filled with equipment and posters and there was no room to even move, much less relive yourself. The hardest part of my job was probably the fogginess in terms of when shifts ended. You would be scheduled to work until 11 but 90% of the time, you'd leave anywhere from 12-3 am.  Some co-workers were the best and some customers (especially kids) really brightened up the day."
bad,I just need a job that I can be flexible and work well with and Carter‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt it for me . Took a lot of mu time and energy . It was good money but a lot of work
bad,it's a good company to start with but sometimes they get comfortable with your position and you cant grow with them. The volume of work is not steady so I'm constantly worrying if I will get my hours each week.
bad,If you‚Äôre a sales associate it‚Äôs guaranteed that you‚Äôre not gonna be given more than 15 hrs to work per week. That‚Äôs just how it is. Not worth working at Carter‚Äôs. The only good thing about it is you get discounts.
bad,"I enjoyed my time at Carters, it was a great starter job when I was managing high school and other extracurricular activities. A lot of my coworkers were moms or had other jobs. I wouldn't recommend it as a full time job unless you were applying for a manager position of some sort. I went almost a whole year without any type of raise and I know a lot of others. of all ages and experience, that had the same experience."
bad,Worked with a great team when I was there. Could have had a better district Manager who was not on PTO all of the time. Any problems that accrued never got resolved.
bad,I worked at carters in Levittown for the holiday Sesaonal and they kept me through out the holiday season. Everyone of the employees were so sweet and kind. The supervisors and manger were horrible. They never wanted to do anything! But sit downstairs in the break room and eat and talk about everyone. Worse job ever!!!!! The pay was nothing for all the work you do and you get around 8 hours a week if not less.
bad,Fun and friendly staff in a fast paced work environment. Learned new things from management everyday. Enjoyed interacting with families!
bad,The company requires a lot of work from their employees but they don't pay them enough. There are is no salary raise no matter how long you have worked for the company.
bad,When I first started working at the location in Sawgrass Mills Mall it was rather hectic due to the fact that this mall is an international mall. As the months progressed the schedules where never out on time which lead me to losing my job! I had AWESOME co-works who I would kill to have at another work place!
bad,"Worked at Carters for about 8 months. Loved it at first but then I started to realize how poor of management I had. They couldn‚Äôt keep any of their workers and would just hire anyone because they were so desperate. I would get stuck picking up extra shifts and getting called into work every week because someone would call off and they had no one to fill the shift. All of this happened on top of my weekly 4 day schedule. "
bad,Carters OshKosh was a hard place to work if you were not a member of management.    The management team changed so often that once you got used to doing things one managers way the new manager would come in and change things.  I learned how to be for a better lack of words a chameleon where you did what the manager asked of you and how they wanted it done.   I believe a store should always be clean and organized on a daily basis and I could never understand that why when there was a corporate visit employees from other stores would have to come and clean and organize the store.  I have never seen that in any other place I worked.The hardest part of the job was adjusting to the 2 stores combining and becoming one.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the associates and the friends I made while working there.
bad,a typical day at work with carters has always been stressful because they always about their numbers. The company doesn't really care about the health of their workers long as they get their numbers. I had a situation where i made my numbers every day exceeded way past the actual requirement and i never got any recognition from the supervisor. Then there were a set of girls that got numbers but no where near mines and they also were bullies they got recognition and was getting hired on just because the supervisor and coordinator showed favoritism with the girls. This company also do not like to be held accountable for accidents that occur on the job. Then when they do have rewards they reward the people that been on the job longer but not the actual people that perform good every day.
bad,Working at Carters a typical day is watching managers who barely do anything get paid more than you. Work force constantly yells at you to get on the phones and they dont appreciate your efforts to answer every call possible. Managers make it extremely stressful when they fail to help you with a question. The hardest part of the job is when managers wont help you. The best part of the job is the food that they bring in from time to time.
bad,A typical work day was getting yourself mentally prepared to go work in a sweltering heat filled (at the time) warehouse with no air condition only fan that only blew out hot air.. This was an experience management did the best they could with what they had to work with.
bad,"not trustworthy, they say they want employees that will grow with the company and you get told that you have the job then get a call at 10 at night that your assignment has ended. Very shady."
bad,I worked as the stock an warehouse manager. This store is located in one of the busiest malls in South Florida. The company always sent triple the amount of product that we actually needed to maintain a full store. At one point we had 7 Storage rooms 6 of which were full with over 250 boxes each. Our shipments would spill out onto the sales floor due the large capacity of incoming product and lack of back room storage space. The customers were almost always rude an almost never spoke English.
bad,"I got what I needed done everyday, Got to meet and help a variety of new faces. The hardest part of my job was dealing with those who had very bad attitude coming into the store making it unclear of what they wanted!"
bad,I loved working here because of my coworkers. The management team sucked big time!!!! The store manager has a major attitude problem & can never get your schedule right. None of the managers are nice to the employees. They do nothing but delegate the work & then when the DM comes they act like the did it & all of a sudden know how to speak nice to you & treat you with respect.
bad,"was decent place to work, until they started doing too much. treat you and talk to you horrible. miscommunication throughout management. yes it pays well but its not really dependable. when slow there is literally no work. Wont call and let you know not to come in , will let you get there and turn you around."
bad,Even though the supervisor I worked for was great most of the supervisors there weren't. They don't believe in holidays. You work more than what you get paid for and don't have that long of breaks. Not allowed to sit down even when you need to on certain jobs you have to do. The only real great thing I seen was the benefits.
bad,"Meeting and Setting Goals .Developing productive Sulution . Developing strong relationship with customers, Advancing programs to promote the institution."
bad,Carter's can offer an overall good work life balance. Overall a good place to work.
bad,honestly it was so un -organized they don't even give you any hours. They do not communicate with you. they only give hours to the people who have worked there for a long time.
bad,Not worth wasting your time applying they only call you in for about 6 hours a WEEK and hardly ever schedule you in when you ask for over time. Waste of time apply somewhere else
bad,A normal day working at Carter's is very slow and cold haha. But you do get to see very cute babies and meet great awesome families along the way. Pretty great for a first job.
bad,"you only receive benefits from the company if you are management or full time 40 hrs.  Most of the manager and assistant managers I worked with, were new to the company, not promotions."
bad,"This was my first job. Working At Oshkosh i learned how to pitch a sale to customers and ask questions. My typical day included attending to the customers, replenishing stock and making sure the work area is clean"
bad,"Carter's is nice work place. We just having been getting any hours & the pay rate is to low for the work we do. You do good production , for 25 cent raise.  No bonus, Christmas parties or no appreciation for great work."
bad,"So slow that you actually want to find something to do. And if there are customers the usual would be like 2. the minimum of hours one can work is 3, which is the lowest I have ever heard of. The hour shifts are usually only 4 hours which sucks if you want more hours."
bad,the job was amazing and if i had a chance i would love to go right back i love the environment. the work was easy to learn i was helping other people learn. I've learned how t become team oriented i learn how to manage time wisely so i wouldn't be over flowed with work i could have a balance.
bad,"Managers are all about what they want for their own personnel lives. Not working weekends and evenings. Taking long breaks, clocking in for each other"
bad,"During the holiday seasons I had normal hours and as soon as black Friday passed, I was only working 4 hours a week"
bad,needs better pay and more hours to associates. Not much happens at carters. Small store and not busy in the area I worked in. 
bad,"Always surrounded by positive people, but poor hours given to employees. Usually younger people are hired since they don't normally complain about such little hours that are given."
bad,"Learned a lot, positive co workers, help others, fun times, multi tasking , nice events, decent work life balance , no complaints overall . Decent company to work for."
bad,I only work one day a week for about 3 or 4 hours or not at all throughout the week. Sometimes I feel like I don‚Äôt even have a job. I enjoy working there when I do get the chance though.
bad,"went from a bagger to assistant dairy/frozen manager in a short period,learned alot."
bad,I would not work there again. I started out as a sales rep and after a few months was promoted to a key holder. there is room for advancement within this company. But the benefits were not great and the only gave fulltime hours to management.
bad,"Assistant Manager, I managed a team of retail employees every day.  Ensured the store was presentable, properly priced, customer experience was held to a high standard, etc."
bad,I enjoyed picketing baby clothing for customers. Also enjoyed scanning price tags and changing pricing on clothing. Some people were great to work with.
bad,The work environment was busy depending on the department you are in. Company supervisor was very rude and unhelpful. The lunch room id state of the art. The breaks are very short because you have to walk so far to get back to your work area.
bad,Apply. There's never a dull moment YTou love to be busy with. Inconsistent work loads and an overflow of shipment and adult children. I hope you have patience. You'll need it.
good,Carters enabled additional learning skills to catalyst to next position.  The  Allied Universal Handbook for all guidelines for security professionals was asked to be put away.  The Post Orders was last updated in 2014 and never referred to as a viable resource.
good,"At the Carters I specifically worked for, the management was horrible. Not understanding at all and had favorites. They also claimed to never have hours to give, but then hire someone new! The reason I ended up leaving was that I was only scheduled for four hours in a week span."
good,It was a fun work place but the hours were not good. I hardly got to work more than 4days a week. There was no Security if anything was to happen. Employees did not get a good salary. My staff was amazing but the big boss in charge of all the companies just didn't give us enough hours or over time . We didn't get paid fairly.
good,Although greatful for employment. my time there was somewhat productive and although a family based company unwilling to work with single moms
good,"Ridiculous amounts of things to get done before your short shift is over. You have solicit rewards program credit card, do online sales and it's basically stalking and harassing people to buy buy buy things they don't want or need. All so the company can make money. Look elsewhere if you're not comfortable doing sales or harassing customers."
good,"I wouldn't recommend anyone to work here the policy sucks, people they hire for management sucks and as a part-timer you don't get as much hours. If you have kids this job isn't for you!"
good,Huge turnover of employees due largely to late night hours for marketing setups.Understaffed because of payroll allowance. Good discount for employees.
good,Treated like a robot. Must get orders out the door. Employee happiness or satisfaction never a priority. Never see management unless you screw up. No one encouraging
good,Hours constantly cut. Staff changed constantly. Compensation was not worth the job. Education did not matter. Your qualifications are not considered for the position.
good,"I worked there for a year, never got a raised. I had to find me another job because i went from 25hrs a week to 5hrs or even 0hrs a week. The assistant manager i worked with would just leave us for her to go to the office and be in her phone always. The company is great and discount as well but not the pay."
good,"Overall the experience at Carters was okay, interacting with customers and assisting them with their purchases was rewarding. The store was clean and organized.  Head management needs to be adequately trained on managing staff in a better manner."
good,Maturing IT organization.  Lots of opportunity for growth and development.  Committed hard working team.  Innovative leadership striving for cutting edge technology solutions to gain competitive advantage in specialty retail space.
good,"Typical work day is going in at 6am in the morning, unloading trucks and palletizing products. After palletizing they are taken to either be stored, or to different departments. "
good,"A typical day at work is helping customers find clothing for children. Sometimes, we must push sales, promotions, and other deals. Other menial tasks include cleaning, folding clothing, and replenishing merchandise to the sales floor."
good,"Atypical day at work consisted of me pushing a cart around distributing clothes into boxes neatly, to be shipped to retail stores. I learn to work with and around people in order to get what i needed done by the end of the night. The hardest part about the job is next having enough work each week to work therefore the pay checks are nott so great. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people are great, very friendly."
good,the people were fairly good and were the main reason for staying. lots of hours and little respect for personal lives. little to no recognition of accomplishments.
good,the job itself is pretty easy. it is management that is the problem. you can be scheduled to work a 4 hour shift but if the store is not making money you can get cut or forced to take a 30 min break that you have to pay for. It is ridiculous to have to pay for a break when you are only working 4 hours 3 times a week if your lucky.
good,"manager was not capable of working around my (at the time) high school life, kept working me too many hours. a typical day at work would be ringing customers all day and cleaning up the store when time is provided."
good,"Forklifts are horrible! The company does not maintain forklifts. Lifts are not tagged out if issues arise. The wire guides in aisles are some the worst I have encountered in a DC. The wire guides will cut off on lift when guides do not catch. Therefore, you hit racks. The lifts are sensitive! SO BEWARE! It will lock you out if something is hit on account of bad lifts. The company is not organized. I understand production but not knowing if you will get 20 or 50 hours is a pain. The job is easy but tedious. Its your basic warehouse lift driving job. Count boxes, move boxes, put boxes back, scan LPNs with RF scanner. The company is great in the aspect that it does a lot in the community as far raising money for Light the Night for cancer patients. But it is one of those places that do not care about employees, especially temp/contact employees."
good,"Normal retail experience, atmosphere was very upbeat since it is a baby's store. Management was poor normal fend for your self with no direction type of management."
good,"Clean rooms, greeting the guest as they came and went. Restocking the rooms and cleaning the bathrooms. Doing laundry and stocking the closet. Management was on stand by but not very helpful at times. There really isn't much to say about this place was only there on the weekends and didn't get enough hours."
good,"I have never seen a workplace that operates with such poor if any communication. There is a continuous flow of new temporary employees placed new off the street in critical areas without any { not a shread} of training. I asked a manager why and his response still baffles me. He stated that the new employees were not deemed ""worthy"" of training."
good,"we walked around all day picking clothes that were ordered either online or from the department stores. If you don't like walking, then this job is not for you. The walking didn't bother me, however, the managers feel like they can talk to you any kind of way and treat you very bad on the daily. Then whenever you stand up for yourself, they let you go for an ""attitude issue"" . It's nothing like they tell you in orientation, which was disappointing. The other employees are loving and fun to be around."
good,"I like this job except for the management and I didn‚Äôt like that 1 store manager cover 2 stores, leaving one of them unattended. "
good,"This is a company that does not really care about its workers. It is focused entirely on making money with minimal staff but expecting top notch customer service. No full time, little hours and no benefits. Working with great customers and adorable children is the only thing worthwhile."
good,At first I loved it but after a couple weeks I saw the employees as who they were and they weren‚Äôt the best and always made me do literally everything while they were in the back.
good,It was a drag to work here. Sometimes i would get out at 2:00 am folding baby clothes. The store was always packed and you where looked at as just another number. It was basically impossible to move up in position.
good,"Low pay for demanding job outcome. They expect you to super-sell, but offer zero commision, zero incentives, zero benefits, extremely changing scheduled, zero guaranteed hours per week. However, they demand you work every single holiday (even if it's your only shift in the week or even 2 weeks). "
good,"When you are hired on they make you read all the policies and procedures; however, they really enjoy pleasing the customer, so they allow you to 'bend' policy under circumstances. Not for someone who is a stickler for rules and them being followed."
good,Working with most of the associates was great however management wasn't as accepting of requesting time of for medical appointments or responsibilities as they could have
good,They pay was great and I worked with great managers associates.The overall experience was temporary and offered no room for anything long term.They offered great discounts all the time.They we're always doing things to motivate us to do better and become better.
good,"As difficult as retail is, Carter's is somewhat okay to work for.  If you are fine with having no hours for the first half of the year, that is.  Unless you are management or a supervisor, you will have barely any hours after the Christmas rush, up until Memorial Day or their late summer sales when every other store is doing their back to school sales.  They do have employee discounts, although it was not any higher than 15% last time I worked for them.  It is still retail though, so the hours and pay are much less desirable unless you are in a higher position than a sales associate."
good,"It was a very fast paced and challenging work place,good employees.The equipment is very worn and upper management is not capable of running the business appropriately."
good,I was hired as a part-time supervisor for a store before it opened. I was the only member of management the store had for the first 2 months of being open. I worked 38 hour weeks regularly. Turn over was high as a we had a different visiting manager every week running our store. I never even met our district manager.
good,"I honestly felt like i was under surveillance ever shift. I feel the management felt i was stealing when i was helping customers.  never got any hours due to ""hour shortage"" but she was constantly hiring new employees. I was a closing associate and i felt as though management put everything on me to handle while they were usually were on their phones claiming to be finishing up. I constantly had to deal with bad attitudes and stress that felt always directed at me when id try to mind my own business."
good,"Not a very nice place to work. Management was nice, but the over all environment was a bit stressful. A little bit unorganized, childish actions were at place"
good,my typical day started at 5 in the morning. I learned how to use a data entry gun and other computer skills and paper work. The hardest part od my job was lifting the heavy boxes.
good,Need normal hours. Temp people are not treated with respect. Always talked down to. Many people walk out during shifts.
good,"the day started out being busy, but as the day went on it begin to slow down.  some of the co-workers were friendly, some were not"
good,at carters everyone is very happy and energetic. they are happy to help and will help you find what you need. the store is kept clean and crisp whenever someone is available
good,"I am only seasonal I work a few days out of the week. I like my job, it part time and flexible."
good,"Love the work environment, but the hours they give could only pay for your gas to even get there."
good,"Working at Carter's is cool. The company is okay. The only thing that I don't like about them is that you have to go through 2 temp services in order to become a permanent Carter's employee, plus you have to work about a year with each service before becoming Carter's. So basically you will be making 8.65 or 9.00 before you get to be permanent and make only .75 to 1.00 more...smh."
good,"Carter's being an entry level job was perfect for my first job. I gained experience I needed to succeed from seasonal to regular. Super fast paced, which I liked."
good,The staff is great. The only negative feedback I have is actually on the customers and how they expect employers to look at a picture or listen to a description then be able to tell what size the child wears.
good,"Poor management, felt under valued, small team (needed new hires a long time ago) customers are rude. There is no work life balance. There‚Äôs never any time to get anything done. The company provides way too many tasks but gives no hours to do so in such a busy store."
good,"I worked for Carter‚Äôs three months shy of four years and still did not hit $10 hourly pay rate.  I left because of the work environment and my hours being cut lower and lower.  Some weeks I would be lucky to get 6-9 hours.  While others were scheduled 26 hours.  And I could no longer deal with supervisor that was rude to myself and more importantly customers.  "
good,You may become friends with other workers but you will not be able to talk to them during work hours even if no customers are in the store. The managers can be really bmean and if your new they will force you to take more hours and day do NOT give in all the time they will take advantage of you later in in the future when they need someone to cover
good,"If you ask the manager for a certain shift, she ignores you no matter how ahead of time you ask. She had total disregard for anyone‚Äôs personal life. Pay rate was better than minimum wage but still not enough to live in nashville."
good,"I had been working here for 6 months when I asked for more hours, they explained that they basically could not afford to give out more hours. Yet, they hired more girls just one month later. They paid me 10 cents below minimum wage while I was driving 30+ minutes just to get there. My whole check went straight towards gas just to get back & forth from work. For me, it was not worth it at all. Although, all the staff and managers were very nice and were always able to work with my schedule."
good,"Working at Carter's was okay. I felt that the only way to move up in rank and receive more hours per week, was if you already knew the manager. I also did not like the ""on-call' shifts. You would have your regularly scheduled shifts and then you would have a couple of ""on-call"" shifts, which meant you could only call an hour before the ""on-call"" shift to see if they needed you to come in. So if the schedule said ""On-call 12pm-4pm"" you could only call as early as 11 am, if you didn't call or show up then it would count as a no call/ no show. This made child care difficult as it held up my day as well as possible sitters if my manager ended up not needing me to come in."
good,"√âquipe de travail non productif "
good,"The job was easy dont get me wrong, but the pace they set you at the first day on the job is unbearable and very stressful. With being temp you work just as hard, if not harder than regular full time employees. To each is own but i woudn't recommend it to anyone unless you were in dire need of a job asap."
good,Manager was change 3 times while I was working there. I feel like the managers try to get rid of other managers to advance. there is constant change because no one stays there for long.
good,"Carters was a great company to work for as a whole, but the company lacked growth opportunities and proper management on a store level. I have found that most of those in the corporate and Human Resources department were very difficulty to connect with in times of need. There is a lack of respect and compassion for working parents single and married."
good,"Working at carters on a daily basis is that you always have to be on top of your tasks. You need to find out what customers are looking for, always help out if you see they need help looking for something. Always be aware of who comes into the store. Make the customers feel comfortable. Working at carters has shown me a lot. For example I've learned not to be shy like I used to be. Always feel comfortable with what I'm doing. The hardest part of working at carters is when I have to keep rewarding moments at a certain percentage. Rewarding moments is when you get an amount of customers that are registered. If their not tell them the benefit of being registered."
good,I loved working here but the business closes due to not being in a great location. Alot of great customers and loves what I was doing on a daily basis.
good,"First at the location I worked at, I wasn't trained so that was helpful... not. Second, the place has 0 consistency; one minute someone works there the other minute they don't. Place is very discriminatory, customers a little harsh but do able. There is no such thing in team because everyone talks and doesn't trust one another. Overall just an inconsistent place with no room for learning in the retail business."
good,I packed and shipped kids clothes out. I also answered phones and took orders.
good,"When I come in for my shift, after clocking in and putting my purse in my locker, we go to the register area and have a ""chat in"", numbers, goals, assign register, and start on my accessories and/or whatever the managers assign for me to do. Greet customers as they come in as I ring customers and sale merchandise. The hardest part of my job is the cleaning while customers are shopping. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping the customers with their shopping needs and wants."
good,"This place would have been awesome had it not been for the poor management. Our Manager was amazing, though she was wrapped up in her wedding plans leaving the majority of tasks to be dropped to the assistant manager who did little to nothing, leaving it to the employees to cover her slack."
good,"Typical day was putting out merchandise and checking people out."
good,I normally come in around 2ish. I would relieve the manager on duty for lunch and continue with sales and any other tasks that needed to be finished. I close the store count the safe and the registers. Make the deposit for the next day. and close the store. 
good,"Carter‚Äôs the company it‚Äôs self isn‚Äôt a bad company. However, the managers I had durning my time working there were.  Despite being grown women, they gossip and have favoritism. They will gossip about you and think you won‚Äôt notice. Then they will ask you to come in on your day off because they need help. I ended up just not returning. Management was the primary reason."
good,This is a good place to work if you‚Äôre available when they need you to be available. They work with your schedule as much as they can and try to schedule you accordingly. You get a discount so that‚Äôs a good perk working here.
good,"Decent place to work. Some departments have HORRIFIC work/life balance, but mine is satisfactory. Carters DESPERATELY needs a way for employees to review managers!  CEO is a very good man, but there's a LOT of middle management that bogs down both productivity and fairness in general. For example, some departments promote their employees annually, and others almost never promote anyone. LOTS of imbalances like that at Carters."
good,amazing place to work if you love children. you get to dress them and pick out outfits!!!! I learned that I am a people person and can upsell the heck out of children's clothing.
good,i would walk into work and get chatted in then i would go to wherever they sent me and go about my day. Mos of the time i would be in the front or on register. Some days the store would be extremely slow and we would have nothing to do.
good,The district managers are mostly hired from the outside and do not know the challenges that each location faces.  High volume stores have very few payroll hours to execute all levels of work. Pay is low and advancement is not based on fair internal reviews but brought in with new upper management.
good,"Great place "
good,They give you a lot of work and don‚Äôt pay you enough for the work you do. They make people expercts but don‚Äôt give them a pay raise for the extra work. It‚Äôs a friendly environment but just stressful.
good,Good Company but bad management. As a entry level manager I felt like I was being taken advantage by the other managers of the store. Also the District Manager was not very friendly.
good,"poor management, poor training, easy job, Carters was the only contract i had with prologistix. Prologistix was very helpful but the management for carter are very unprofessional."
good,"OSB was my first job and this is were I discovered my love for customer service. The store was flexible with my school schedule, they gave me decent hours but sometimes I would show up to my shift expecting to work 5 hours then after 2 hours I would be told to go home because we weren't making or sales. I did work only seasonal two years but after the hours situation I stopped saying ""yes"" to their offers."
good,"In the location I was in it wasn't all that great due to the management. Of course, there were great managers there but a few had their moments there that should not have been managers. Hours are favorited in the location I was in. The staff that is now there are lazy, and you can get away with so much if you're part of the favorited people. I've worked at other locations and have seen nothing like this, it made so many employees including myself miserable to go in. "
good,Was an alright summer student job. Management seemed to play favorites. People were fun to work with. Pay was not very good for the work done. Things may have changed significantly since leaving the company.
good,"The stores head manager was awful to work for. Never nice to anyone who wasn‚Äôt her immediate favorite. Very rude the first time i had ever met her. Unbelievably rude in a professional setting. Rude to customers, staff. Only sucked up to higher ups that came to observe store operations."
good,This is a great starter job for someone who is right out of school or someone looking for something to do. They do need to regroup the managements staff and salary.
good,its very stressful and its demands all employee to have customer service. there is always something to do in the sale floors or stockroom. benefits are not that great for part time employee
good,Customers were always horrible and entitled but coworkers were always supportive and helpful. Store was always hectic and they were way too lenient on returns. Also we always had to push the rewards and would get hours cut if we didn't
good,great company to work for. customers are always happy. corporate management needs to be more realistic and supportive of stores especially with huge workloads.
good,"Nice size store to work with, but not a good job for career advancement. Can get bored there. The store manager play favoritism. Not really a fair job for some people."
good,"They are serious about numbers. Everything runs off of numbers. They are strict about it and you can't meet their goal, you'll most likely get let go."
good,"way to many expectations with no tools to work with, sometimes you are the only one in the building for hours with no one but you on the sales floor which makes it very difficult to accomplishment the real focus of the customer"
good,"If you kiss up to management & your dm, you'll get the right training and promotions. Otherwise you are stuck in your position not moving up and doing everyone else's job. Hours sucked. SM & DM would bad mouth every manager or associate they didn't like."
good,"I really enjoy the other employees and some aspects of the job, however they promote a work/life balance that I have yet to witness; they also say that they promote from within but in the 3 years that I have been there, I've only seen 1 person from store level be promoted.  All other positions have been filled externally or with someone from head office."
good,Great staff. I enjoy the people I work with it is the reason why I've been there 3 years. It is fun to learn about the company and see new store openings.
good,"lots to learn but management not able to train fully "
good,"Expectations include Inspecting for product quality, use of measurement equipment and verifying specifications. Also preparing merchandise for shipping, which includes proofing documents for aspects of production processes, equipment and machinery to include database entry. Participate in all aspects of production processes, equipment and machinery to include but not limited to setting un equipment, making adjustments, using measurement equipment, insuring product meets specifications, competency in addressing day to day process issues, troubleshooting/ problem solving. Operating equipment and giving some work direction. Actively participate on High Performance Teams to address day-to-day business activities, safety, quality, and training needs. JSO/ FDA/ GMP compliance."
good,Able to learn and work under actual servers in fine dining while expanding my knowledge.
good,"A typical work day would involve opening the registers, ordering supplies, printing email, filling out the daily planner with our sales goal and to do lists. Delivering customer service and being outwardly friendly. Instruction associates what to do, time frames and personal goals. "
good,"The work varies, i learned a lot about measurements and what gets accounted for and what doesn't, my supervisor is a great guy to work for along with all my co-workers. The hardesst part of the job is probably hauling heavy objects up and down a ladder, the enjoyable parts are the work itself and the people i work with"
good,"greeting customers "
good,"I enjoyed working here overall. I loved merchandising the clothes and helping customers. I received minimum wage, however, despite my experience. One of the part-time managers treated everyone like she owned the company and made work a nightmare. The store managers treated this as though it was a conflict between her and other employees and not a problem with a single employee. This and the  low pay led me to quit."
good,"Working at this particular location was easy and enjoyable, but being a mature adult surrounded by young and young-minded coworkers, made for a tense and irresponsible environment at times."
good,"it was a temporary joba typical day at work"
good,"No room for advancement, You have to know somebody that know somebody"
good,not good management skills but everyone worked together. It was like a family
good,A typical day at Carters was picking and packing customer orders to be sent out right away. It required a lot of physical work which is something I enjoy.
good,"No raises, poor management, no advancement, guaranteed zero hours. Turnover rate is poor, and they wonder why they cannot keep employees. Your hours change every week and there is no job security."
good,I worked for Carter's as a first job. It was a good place to learn basic P.O.S. skills along with facing and restocking the store. As well as learning how to correctly help customers and inform them about current promotions and policies within the store for purchases and returns.
good,"Working at Carters was a lot of fun. Helping new moms, grandmas, etc pick the perfect outfit for the coming home outfit, pictures, presents was so much fun. During peak times (Holiday/season change) was crazy! Many of the fixtures would move, product was always changing and keeping us busy. Some stores are understaffed so employees may work more than anticipated or work on the floor solo."
good,"I worked there for 3.5years. I loved everything about it but my manager and district manager. My manager was a very spiteful person. Do things just to my work and personal life h***.You had to be her little puppet. Constantly threw you under the bus.Neither the manager or district manager had your back.i left for personal reasons, but ended up applying for a position at another location, to which I was told I had the position from the district manager, but after using my old manager as my reference when I asked her not to,and took it upon her self to use my given references plus my old managers reference, I no longer had the position because my old manager bad mouthed me so I cant gain a position with that company what so ever."
good,You experience at Carter's will really depend on where you're placed and who your supervisor/manager is. I've gone through periods where I loved it and some where I hated it. Ultimately left because I got tired of it and felt my work wasn't acknowledged/appreciated (despite me working consistently above standard...) Its is an easy job if you can handle the hours.
good,Management was never effective or efficient in how they spoke to people below them. Never got more than 10 hours a week which made it difficult to life off of. Many coworkers made the experience enjoyable and most customers were very kind and grateful.
good,Carter's warehouses is nice people and some good management is ok but when it comes down to it the are to meany rules that don't make since like not being able to sit when there is no work.
good,"greeting customers"
good,"It was ok, just put a lot of stress on your back and feet you had no family time! The pay could be better ! It was fast work and the jobs were easy! Just wish it paired more"
good,Manager was very rude and inconsiderate. Alienated the newer employees and was very rude to customers as well. Scheduling was  a nightmare and not too considerate of outside schedules.
good,"Just a tem job. A fast pace job. Long standing hours. Friendly, proffessinal work. I woulda love to stay more time working for this warehouse. Overall great place to work"
good,"It's a good start up job, takes a while to become permanent. Pay could be better, that's one of the ways to make your employees happy and stay at carters."
good,Carter's use to be better as Bonnie Togs. Employed by both Carter's treats you as another number and not as a person they expect so much of your time and effort without being knowledge. The training is there if you go after it.
good,"Work load is a lot "
good,"My managers are sweet and I‚Äôve gone from working 4 days a week to being scheduled only two (combined less than 20 hours). It‚Äôs unfair they keep hiring new people and acting like they desperately need it when we already have an abundance of people. At when I was hired I asked if I could make roughly the same amount of money that I did my old job ($10ph fulltime) and the manager lied to me and said I could. I‚Äôm a temporary hire for a store in a huge tourist spot, I can‚Äôt see why this is okay without telling me."
good,"I was hired on and praised as a very good worker with great potential, however they kept hiring people when there wasn't enough hours to go around so they started to cut all employee hours. I needed more hours so I left, and glad I did."
good,"I probably worked about 4 hours or less when I would go in for work. And worked, if I was lucky, 2 days a week. There‚Äôs very few hours available. And it‚Äôs not even because there‚Äôs too many workers, there‚Äôs only a few. But it‚Äôs so slow that mostly the managers work on their own. And if you go in for a 4 hour shift, it‚Äôs a 80% chance you‚Äôre getting sent home early because only 4 people (barely) come in the store every hour. The only benefits are the 15 minute breaks and the 25% off discount. Besides that, would not recommend working there. Managers are all opposites too so you have to put on a different face everytime you work with one. No one really talks, if you get caught talking to each other, you get yelled at by the manager. Even if everything is done and no ones in the store. Pay is low too ($9.70) so you‚Äôre barely making anything a week. Maybe enough to buy some gas and that‚Äôs it."
good,Only get a 2 day notice if you work past your work days and it is mandatory overtime. No equality in this workplace at all. Treated unfairly when your a new associate.
good,"Unfortunately the management between stores is horrible. A few of the ASMs are understanding and make working there worth it. However, for the amount of pay and the mistreatment the associates take, working here just isn't worth it unless you REALLY need the money."
good,"store manager was not professional, everyone hated working in mico-management. people quit like it was going out of style. the manager should not be store manager."
good,"On a daily basis I report to my coordinator or supervisor, from there I go to another department based on need for my skill. After I complete whatever task is needed when I first come in, I'm usually on-call for whomever in the warehouse needs me. The most that this job has taught me would be flexibility and working with all types of people from all walks of life. The job isn't physically demanding."
good,could be a fun fast paced environment with proper training from upper management. Some of their expectations are unrealistic especially with payroll..
good,Great job for teens but not for an adult with responsibilities. Every store isn't the same. My experience might differ for you.
good,"All I will say is that it was extremely difficult to come in to a store as a new manager to the company, try to implement policies and procedures, all the while one member of management was very detrimental to business and  undermining authority."
good,my time was interesting. I enjoyed my team and my work days. The company is still experimenting with policies and practices
good,"greet customers, find out what their looking for, inform them about sales going on in the stores, revisit them to make sure they're finding everything, and encourage them to come back again!"
good,"Upward mobility is very difficult within this company.  Being paid such a low salary with few hours, makes it difficult to make ends meet."
good,"Charters is very fast paced in the summer/fall and you get good hours. In the winter it is very slow & part time associates get around 10 hours a week. I built great relationships with other associates, but not management."
good,A typical day involved cashing out customers at the register and putting clothes back as well as restocking them. I learned team work.
good,"Fun workplace, supportive management. Enjoy the environment within the workplace, and colleagues. Difficult working around schedules for other commitments such as work, school and kids, likely due to amount of employees in and out in short amounts of time. Enjoy working with stock, and arranging displays throughout the store. Hardest part of the job would personally be the touch and go hours, finding care for child with the changing hours"
good,"new management and district managers are bringing a non carters business ethic to the table and changing carters as a whole, what once was great is now just any other retail company."
good,"Fun work place if not for the new management."
good,"I liked worjing at Carter's however what I don't like about Carter's is the pay. I was by far the best the best employee ay the store and i was only making 8 per hour. I love working customer service so the customers didn't bother me. Yes, some customers are rude but if you don't take it personal then it wont bother you. Carters make too much money not to invest into their employees. And.. my store was the second earning store out of all the carters."
good,"It's a great place to work, as long as the atmosphere is fun, happy and not gloomy.  It's great to help parents, grandparents and new families find the right items for the child/children. The hardest part is leaving work behind. Always trying to make sure you have everything or most of it completed before you leave each day can be hard and sometimes you bring your work home with you in the back of you mind with ""what ifs""."
good,"I had to buy a gps for this one, different addresses everyday, try to keep track of the time, frozen food and hard turns can be tricky."
good,"The interview process was great, but the actual job is not what you are told in the interview."
good,Carter's as a whole are completely devoted to the customers' needs.  They are also quite considerate of their employees.
good,"Overall, Carter's/OshKosh is a decent place to work. They demand more than the 40 hours of work a week. I even had to work every Sunday from 4-9pm, which was not in what was originally communicated to me with the job. No flex time, if you arrive at 5am or 6am, you will be passively judged and pretty much ""unofficially told"" you can't leave until 4:30pm. (keeping that traffic alive)"
good,the store was ran smoothly an n order. I like working n environments that have order an thing in line that provide a safe an clean work environment such as carters do
good,I was constantly on the go with working either upstairs preparing things for the next day or for the weekend shift.
good,"In the beginning it was fun to work here. The staff is friendly and we felt like a team. After about a year due to our location the theft has become unbearable. Some of the thieves make threats on us. It is because of this I am looking for a job elsewhere. Keep in mind what I am saying may not apply to all locations, possibly just mine."
good,Nice place to work at as a first job. October 19' will make 2 years I've been working for Carter's and it's ok. The atmosphere is not bad. Managers can get very annoying at times but that's typical. There is room to grow if you're manager is willing to allow you. I started off as a temporary and ended up becoming a regular SA.
good,The whole time I worked there they constantly had interviews and we're hiring new people while workers already there got fewer and fewer hours. Eventually I quit because I was barely getting scheduled.
good,Fun to give great customer service and play with babies all...but reality is way too much work and not given enough hours to do it...and they keep cutting more!
good,While I was working there the first two managers were amazing and fun to work with. The third manager I worked with was very mean and would talk to family and friends on the company phone while on the floor and on the clock. She would always talk bad about people behind their backs. She was just a very nast person. I really did enjoy working there but she was the deciding factor in me leaving.
good,"Working at Carter's Oshkosh has been a fun learning experience, one of the bonuses is getting to know your customer base and learning about their families. "
good,management is strict with people they dislike and loose with people they like; their attitude towards employees differs significantly on their mood; you work every second of your shift
good,"Job wasn't whaT I expected as far as hours, wasn't trained well enough  had to learn when I made a mistake, to much backbiting and favoritism ...mistreated staff"
good,"i had a passion for my job and a dedication to service. but the i is seasonal, because i dont work any more there, so carters is warehouse has more department i was working in ecom picking"
good,"No consideration given to work/life balance.  Work when they say work, stay home when they say stay home, 60 hours or 20 hours, either way you better be there.  Favoritism abounds, never has it been more obvious that it‚Äôs not what you know but who you know, not what you do but who you do.  The worst, most frustrating place I‚Äôve ever had the misfortune to work.  Wouldn‚Äôt send my worst enemy to work there."
good,A wonderful place to work if you have the right Management team. Sometimes it is chaotic and disorganized. No communication between employees and management. Very enjoyable if you work with good people.
good,I've been working there for a year now and I did like working there at first but I got very bored of it and started to look elsewhere because I need to find a job that suits me and my age.
good,Its fast pace and hard work but fun. People love coming in when im there cause im fun and kind the customers come in and I'll take care of them by getting there and their breakfast helping them with their cigarettes I even helped him take that beer out to their car it's overall a good job but the employees there like you lay out all the time and then that makes it harder on everybody else cuz then you don't get a day off
good,The work environment was very mellow and relaxing. I love kids so I would always love to see the kids come in shopping with their parents. Management became very poor due to them firing a manager and another manager quitting.
good,"Store has a friendly environment, it's a good place to work, but company offers only minimum wage and few days off on weekend and few opportunities to grown."
good,"As a manager in training, I only made $0.25/hour more than sales associates, even though I had many more responsibilities and duties. I also found that the company didn't work to grow people, but preferred to hire new employees rather than promoting from within."
good,"supervisor is not engaged, most do not notice when management is out of the office, workplace culture is arbitrary and old fashioned with inflexible rules that apply only to some employees.  high field nurse turnover, hardest part of the job is knowing which policy will be enforced on any given day.  employees are expendable and not viewed as an asset."
good,Working there as a high school senior I was mostly there at night. Cleaning was easy and the management was decent. Store location dictates how busy or slow each day would be. Overall not a bad place to work.
good,"This may had just not been the most perfect part-time job for me, but there is room to grow within the company, I started at my store and within the first six months I was offered the sales supervisor position and declined to focus on school and my second job. I was offered that job twice after that as well. The compensation for this job is not equivalent to what workload is required."
good,A typical day was a normal retail environment. Helping customers and tidying. The hardest part of the job was getting people to sign up for the loyalty program. The management where I worked was very pushy and they hovered over you and were not very honest. Everyone feared the manager.
good,"A typical day would include opening shipments, getting stock onto the sales floor, helping customers with their purchases, and ringing customers in at the cash. As a manager I have to take hourly reads to check if we are meeting our sales targets. I also open and close the tills."
good,"collaboration :"
good,"Merchandising and maintaining visual standards is enjoyable. Great teams at store-level but unfortunately, head office doesn't seem to care about you unless you work in corporate. No opportunity for pay raise, very little opportunity for job advancement."
good,"If you have kids nice job, good discount, sister store to Osh kosh and the only thing is that it is retail so you work all the time with hardly any time off the family, I was a manager so I was mostly in the store by my self and one or two associates."
good,Great opportunity to learn and propose solutions for improvement.
good,"Management acted like they cared. They always stressed family and acting with integrity, but they didn't care if you spent time with your family or not. As long as it was in the best interest of the company, they didn't mind breaking off one in an employee. Supervisors on facebook and other social media sites all day but you better not have your phone on the floor!!!! Thankful I had a job at the time, but never went home ready to go back the next day!!!! During my first week,  we were given a tour and then heard a speech that included the words"" if you are here in six months then we know you will be a good Carter's employee""."
good,It was hard work only if you don't like to stand for long hours. Easy job that can give you long hours.
good,"a typical day at work was long and stressful. I learned to breath and be patient when dealing with the public. Management didn't pick up their slack in the workplace they were more worried about being on their cell phones, I enjoyed working with my co-workers as a team they were like my family. I didn't find anything hard about my job i was able to take on any task that was given and get it done. The most enjoyable part was the customers and making them have a memorable and enjoyable shopping experience."
good,"When I open the store, I run the previous day's reports, calculate payroll, create the daily sales planner, count the drawers, and open the registers. I make return phone calls for loss prevention reasons. My manager is a great leader and coach, and has instilled those qualities in me. The entire management team works together, and accomplishes all tasks, easy and hard. The hardest part of my job is trying to balance work and my home life. When I'm off, I will call the store to make sure everyone is doing customer service, or to make sure how our sales are doing for the day. The most enjoyable part of my job, is the employees and customers! I am a ""people"" person. I enjoy interacting with customers, helping them find, ""just the right"" baby gift. My associates, I enjoy coaching them; teaching them new/ different ways to do our job."
good,The supervisors mostly pick favourites. And always want to have something negative to say though you‚Äôre doing an amazing job. Friendly co-workers for the most part.
good,"The benefits are not great. The working culture is fun and easy. Minimal customer complaints. Lots of inventory to push out. And if you get a good team that works well together, its a dream. But there is no job security. I worked there for 10 years and lost my job along with several others due to downsizing. And they are reopening those positions after we leave. Sigh*"
good,"There are so many unnecessary, time consuming outdated policies and procedures,  even the complicated visual sets are overwhelming for the time allowed due to payroll hours."
good,"My experience with this company was neither good nor bad, however, there could have been better communication, demonstrations of respect and overall work environment during my time there."
good,To be so real i applied at carter‚Äôs and moved to osh kosh bc there the same company the management is so freaking rude! favoritism af! save your time!
good,"I was a stay home mom, Carters was very flexible with my schedule. The pay never increased unless minimum wage would. It is easy work, busy at times. :)"
good,Training was not equal as other associates we‚Äôre just started and was at Carters longer.  Seemed was out cased.   Did not feel needed could go elsewhere that could use my employment.
good,"I loved working at Carter's because as a young woman I want to be prepared for motherhood when that time comes, but management was not fair in the workload that was given to the closing crew in comparison to the morning crew. Management also lacked professionalism. Getting to see beautiful families come in trying to prepare for new stages in their life made it worth it."
good,There were not enough hours to put away stock when receiving orders. A typical day at work was very busy with backroom stock and not being able to attend to customers.
good,Carters is an okay place to work if your in college. Low pay and not enough hours that are given. Some managers are okay where as others pick and chose who they want to deal with. Discounts are okay. The staff that was their is cool to work with. You do way too much in the store for the amount of money they pay you. They need to think about changing the pay.
good,Started of great was getting the hours and was filling in sometimes  others shifts when there was call outs always came in with positive attitude but felt like I got ask a lot to do this or can you go to this store to cover while the store had a meeting but always sounded like when they ask it‚Äôs ok if you don‚Äôt want to you can say no but I felt like they never wanted me to work with them always and got told we love you and you are good employee but the hours never showed it and if I was off I got a called can you come in and I always did to be a team player but I started to realize that didn‚Äôt matter I was up beat when customers would come in others employees and I mean the young ones had no personality but I guess they loved those ones I guess I was the only color one at this location but felt outside the box all the time when I come into work I spoke to this certain assistant manager all the time but she never seem like she like me that must she will speak back but after I. Spoke first but anyways I had to move on not slot of color in that area to work but in the back of my mind I wonder why
good,Carter‚Äôs is okay it‚Äôs just like any retail place nothing fantastic to rave about but as long as you get your work done should be fine. Hours are flexible if you find a manager that wants to work with you and your schedule. Hours are sometimes  scarce.
good,I found it very difficult to manage working and attending school full-time. Promises to schedule me around school hours went unfulfilled and I ultimately left because my education was a priority.
good,The target market is parents and grandparents which are generally good customers to work with. The stores have a nice feel and look but depending on management team the work load can become overwhelming.
good,Don‚Äôt expect to every have a work/home life balance. They preach about investing in their people and almost always hire externally and pass on internal candidates. Constantly introducing new SOPs and programs with little to no training. The workload is very overwhelming with little to no extra hours given.
good,"I enjoyed working at this company. When my manager who hired me left us and a new one came to work with us, she did not like me at all, I could tell. Working there was nice overall."
good,"It was understaffed, management was not good and it was impossible to rise in such environment. The employees were friendly and made work a little less hard."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was helping young moms and seeing all the cute babies. I learned manegment and customer service skills along with how to maintain a stock room.
good,"Unfortunately, there' an inadequate way of communication within the corporation, whether its in regards to lack of training, benefits, or compensation"
good,"A typical day at work for me was greeting customers when entering the store , giving advice on items and sizes , giving a positive attitude , sort clothes according to sizes ."
good,"Great place to work.  Some of the policies are a bit cumbersome, but semi-applicable so easy enough to work with. Good environment and stable job.  Must like kids though... lots of ""accidents"" to deal with."
good,Very nice staff and wonderful manager just didn‚Äôt get paid as much as I‚Äôd like. So manny people come in and out of the store. There is very bad stealing in the corners of the stores.
good,My overall experience working there was good. It was a learning experience and I enjoyed my time there. My coworkers were friendly. Carter's carries a lot of cute baby clothes!
good,"I only worked at Carter's for two days inclluding black friday which was hectic. Overall it was a decent environment. However, I felt a little unprepared and feel like the training was not very helpful."
good,"Mostly all the time just folding clothes, assisting customers, assorting the back area, assorting our donations, mainly just assorting. Not too bad, and not too hard"
good,"I can say I've had more good experiences with this company than bad. No major problems or issues that would make me want to not come to work. District managers seem very nice, helpful, and encouraging. Basic company to work for. Discounts are nice. Easy and relaxed job (most of the time). Annoying customers here and there but that will be everywhere in retail. Communication between store manager and other employees can lack at various times. I sometimes feel as if I have to walk on eggshells when working with my store manager because she can be moody and rude at times. Not always the most encouraging as you would expect a store manger to be."
good,"It's an okay place to work. The hours aren't to bad, and it's a decent company to work for, if you like to do shift work.. "
good,The Carters/ OshKosh Bgosh is a very traditional company. Pay is not competitive and it's difficult to move up in the company. There aren't many opportunities to advance. In my year working there I found many people come and go and eventually I did too. I have a negative memory of this retail job in particular because my manager was very unkind to the team and took advantage of the company and when I reported her to the District team they ultimately did nothing. If that doesn't say a lot about the company I don't know what does.
good,Not what they promised on interview. Very disappointed with this company. THeir kids clothes are cute but very overpriced. The employee discount isn't great compared to other company discounts.
good,It is a nice place to work if you are okay with difficult customers and dealing with tourists. The management however makes the job worse. No one communicates and it's like a job for someone in high school. I did learn how to communicate with customers better and on a more personal level. Dealing with money and the registers all day gave me the training with technology that I didn't have before.
good,"A typical day at work is going in for your shift, as a manager I would open and be on the floor by myself for up to four hours. I learned to be patient with team work. The hardest part of the job is knowing when to task and when to help customer, because it is very hard to do both."
good,Fairly fast pace job that taught me to hone in on my speed. The management was pretty laid-back and allowed us to complete our job with minimal interference. The culture was and still is a solid foundation to build a company on that doesn't focus too heavily on the pursuit of money. The hardest part of the job was unloading tractor trailers alone but i enjoyed the water breaks.
good,"As a kid's clothing store, the store ambiance is familial and friendly."
good,"The temporary Christmas Job I held at Carters was not what I first anticipated I would do, however I found it to be an okay experience and I picked up great managerial tips/skills."
good,"we work 6 days in a week"
good,"I enjoyed working for Carters, it was a fun, busy job.  I enjoyed the customers and the kids that came in the store on a regular basis. I enjoyed the fast pace the store kept you at."
good,"Busy, fast paced environment. Business is run with minimal staff to maintain the store. Product is updated frequently. Retail hour, including adjusted holiday hours."
good,"Working here is a good experience. Although, the organization and scheduling is confusing. Everyone that works there is wonderful and friendly! Good place to work!"
good,it's a good place to work at for a first time job. They're flexible with your schedule. The people you work with are kind and nice it's like having family
good,"Carters is a good company to work for. Can get stressful during the holiday season. "
good,"Carters is a great place to shop. The prices are unbeatable depending on the clothing. In terms of Working there, its a nice, clean place with excellent employees. Although the manager at the time did not work with my availibility which led to conflict between my life and job."
good,Carter's is a job where it could be a second job or if you are a college student. It is not a job where you can grow with. They can give 4 hours one week and the next you could have 15 hours. The pay is low. No benefits for part-timers. Some Managers are too serious and some are fun.
good,"One of the hardest things I had to learn was being able to communicate effectively with customers. Learning how to properly approach each situation given to me was a challenge but a very good challenge. I now understand what the customer wants, direct them to possible options, and not sell them something they don't want."
good,"Wonderful co-workers, "
good,I enjoyed the time I spent there. The people I worked with made this job awesome. I had great management while I was there. There was a sense of teamwork which I really appreciated and enjoyed.
good,The work is not hard at all but the systems may be down or a promotion is not working the site is not working right that is what makes the job tiring at times. I learned how to defuse a situation in a short period of time. My co workers are amazing that is one thing that I adored about the job such a family feeling with the coworkers. Management needs major improving that is a area that they lack on getting things taken care of in a reasonable amount of time the policies that they have for the warehouse and the call center are the same and that doesn't make sense since we do different work. I enjoyed helping customers and really turning their day around in certain cases.
good,"creating tutoring programs throughout California for low income families,  Working on ELA and math skills using muliple learning strategies"
good,"A typical  day, would be to check the clip board and review our sales goal, and what it was last year. Check if anything needs to be put on the walls. Make sure there are not any loose items on the floor: if so pick them up and place them where they belong. Greet any customer that comes into the store and help them find anything they need."
good,"Carter's is my first job in retail and I've learned a lot, from learning how to use the register and being a cashier to helping customers find what they're looking for has been a great and has continuously been a great and adventurous experience."
good,"A typical day is a lot of tasking. Whether its emptying racks to fill the floor or emptying bins, Having tons of tourists shop in the store shopping from a list of items they specifically want. I have learned many things but most of all not to even trust the people you work with. The management and my co-workers have to work a lot on communication. I say this because they always seem to be bickering about something. Either the management doesn't let the employees know that schedules have been changed or employees always calling out from their shifts and not giving sufficient time to have someone else cover their shift. Its a lot of back and forth. In all honesty i don't think that the hard workers (as in the people who always come in when called, always either staying longer or coming in earlier, do the many jobs that they do) are not appreciated as much and are not being paid what they are deserved. There is too kuch promising and not enough doing. The hardest part of the job i say is that there are only mostly women working and dealing with shipment alone is not healthy on a women. Especially when most of us are small and petite and not everyone can lift up 60-70 pounds of boxes. The enjoyable part of the job is meeting the new people that come through the door everyday. I find that all the tourists are amazing whether rude or not."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of helping customers find merchandise, cashiering, recovering the sales floor, and restocking clothing."
good,"Awesome management-love the people I work with"
good,"Great experience, Great products, Fun job."
good,"My typical day at Carter's for me was to perform excellent customer service, complete daily sale transactions, and to complete my daily task. I have advanced in multi-tasking; I have a better insight on what it takes to be a great worker and a great help to the customers. I had a wonderful store manager that was kind, generous, understanding, and strong minded. I have co-workers that are like family to me; I have much respect for them. The hardest part of my job was to endure disrespect from customers when they were in a bad mood. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I put a 100% into providing the customers with excellent customer service and respect. I also enjoy being around my co-workers, who I call my Carter's family."
good,Carter's is growing quickly and will continue to enhance their opportunities to remain number one in their field.
good,Pros of this company are the customers. They are awesome. No one comes into a baby store unhappy. I like that Carter's puts their customer and the quality of the clothing at the top of their priority list. This company has also seen substantial growth since it began opening retail locations.
good,Working for Carters Oshkosh was a very rewarding experience.  I was able to move up quite quickly through hard work and good interpersonal skills.  I really enjoy helping people in retail and always loved working around big holidays such as Christmas.
good,the people you work with here are the real reason for working at a carters. the pay is not ideal however the team youre with makes up for it. the environment is very faced paced and can be stressful which is why you need a good support team behind you.
good,I had a nice time and was treated okay. They treated some of ya unfairly. My manager was okay and he kept us in the loop. My manager was a butte hole.
good,"Up until just a week ago I really enjoyed working at Carters, it is a really great company to work for, I just do not agree with what they are doing to the full time employees. This why I am currently look fo another job, I have a very loyal employee for the past 5 years"
good,"At carter's there is a constant change in the store, whether it be moving the sales floor around, changing schedules, or change in people that come in and out of the store."
good,"It was okay working there but the managers sucked and rude and would always try to frame you for something that you didn‚Äôt do it just get you into trouble, I love the store and clothes but the managers were rude"
good,"I got promoted to a Sales Manger, only doing 25hrs a week (since all sales managers are part time) but I almost always closed. They use the Sales manager to close while the Store managers and ASM either open or do mids. Sometimes when I would come in The Store manager or ASM would leave home 2-3 hours early. I never got to leaver early. Overall I did learn a lot, but I felt extremely unappreciated."
good,I started at Christmas time so it was crazy busy. I didn't get trained well. It is a faced paced environment and it is crucial to keep tidying up constantly as customers throw stuff all over.
good,I gave this place an overall review of three stars because of the management at that location. I was very unhappy there but not because of the company.
good,Es una buen empleo solo que los horarios no son rotativos por igual entre los empleados
good,"Its basic warehouse work. You pick, pack, ship, sort, and many other jobs. You have to wear jeans and t shirt. I learned how to work different areas of the warehouse"
good,I learned a lot of helpful tips throughout my service with this company. I've had the joy of watching my littlest customers grow up in our clothes which has been the most rewarding part of my journey with Carter's.
good,we don‚Äôt get paid enough for all the work we do. we have the new carters credit card and we get pushed to sell and sometimes you could feel like you‚Äôre getting put down.
good,I feel like in truly do not get paid enough and there is no wiggle room to talk about pay. Big changes are made by the company and poor training on them
good,It was okay. Very hot and I honestly got along with my coworkers and employers but they did tend to be harsh at times and I think it could use better pay
good,I wasn't working at Carter's long enough to know everything about it. It wasn't a terrible place to work but it wasn't the best either. There isn't much else I say.
good,"Nothing to say about Carter's. I worked there almost four years ago so I do not really remember it all that well. So, I cannot be of any help when discussing Carters."
good,The work environment was not a good one for me. I didn't want to work at a temporary position then get a call not to come in because i was through a temp- service.
good,"Long hours, if your only a temp associate you will be let go after peak season. They make overtime mandatory and also on a point system. Night shift is hard you sleep all day work all night you feel like you miss out on life."
good,"If you like working with babies you will love working here. Have to love babies, always be prepared to answer questions and know your product to ensure great customer service."
good,"A nice place to work."
good,Strong company growth. You know you are replaceable. Not always a positive environment. Internal promotion opportunity if you are interested in growing with the company.
good,Enjoyed working with the customers that came in. Most of the customers were absolutely a delight to help. A lot of work to do there with floor plans. Trying to get on the same page with management was sometimes difficult
good,Customers were nice to work with.  There were constant sales to get set up.  Lots of work to get done during your shift.  You need to work almost every weekend.
good,The job overall is a good company to work for.  They give you a company discount on clothes which comes in handy.  They have flexible hours and competitive pay.
good,"I never got hours, I have only worked once in the last month. There were good people, but one thing worth complaining about was the lack of hours. I‚Äôm not sure if they are over staffed or what."
good,Carters was an enjoyable place to work as soon as I was hired. I enjoyed helping all types of customers wheater it be first time parents trying to figure out shoe sizes or friends picking up a gift for co workers. Carters was a high volume store so I was always busy. The hardest part about the job was processing shipment and counting inventory. The best part was being able to work with a genuinley great  group of people who helped me grow as a manager and as a person.
good,"My manager and assistant manager are amazing! I love the family environment that carters provides. Unfortunately it seems that that nothing that we do is ever good enough or deserving of praise from the higher ups. Even when we make huge sales with barely any man hours allotted to us by management they will always ind something negative to focus on (e.g., ""why is one table in the store a mess"", even though I just made a 1000 dollar sale (with no recognition from the higher ups) and we only have 2 employees working."
good,"When I worked there for the most part it was an easy job, but some of the management was terrible.. and lacked a lot of hours.. once winter season hit I was getting 5 hours every other week.."
good,"Helping customers, looking over hourly numbers, changing things around the store."
good,Productive but gets harder day after day.  Different cultures.  Seeing progress at the end of day. Enjoy working with staff. Don't really kno what is so difficult individually.
good,"I'm a seasonal part time Packer. I work 9am-2pm Monday- Thursday. So I can only give my opinion based of my part time position. I have been in 3 different departments. Some departments are more relaxed than others, and some mamagers are nicer than others. I get paid every Thursday direct deposit. The parking lot is extremely large be prepared to walk a mile a morning to get in the building. They are open every day except Christmas, so if you are a parent that is something to think about! Some coworkers are friendlier than others. I don't have any major complaints. Ive had worser jobs before thats for sure!"
good,"People need to pay more attention to sizing"
good,"On a typical day I am required to either open or close the store and manage at least one associate. During a shift I am required to keep track of and push sales, achieve various tasks and provide a positive customer service experience to all guests. Store management is good, but district and regional management is poor. It is a positive work environment overall. The best part of my job is being able the still work and enteract with customers, the hardest part is unrealistic expectations and deadlines for the store."
good,"Company overall provides lots of opportunity for growth , great environment to work in when you have the right people in store. The discount is great and the benefits are good"
good,"I worked at the sher. plaza in natick ma location. Staff are respectful and work is decent. The company overall is IMO  good company. Management not much. Short staff caused overwhelming work loads, very poor management. Dont expect proper training. I would have continued my position there had, Management been willing to dedicate more time in proper training. The company overall I believe is a great company, I enjoyed the customers and selling honest to goodness great quality clothing. I believe if management improved the store can truly strive !"
good,Go in there ready to work with a smile cause everyone is friendly and ready to work along with you and if you need help do not be shame to ask because they will help
good,"I‚Äôve really enjoyed working at Carters, I‚Äôve made some great friends and it‚Äôs been a good experience. However I am not getting the hours I would like. One or two 3 hours shifts a week is not enough. My paychecks have been 20 dollars... and it‚Äôs not just me we have too many sales associates so all of us are getting one shift a week. While I do throughly enjoy my job, it‚Äôs not going to advance me to where I want to be. I need a job where I‚Äôm actually making money."
good,"I managed a factory outlet store. The days were always different, The children were great .the parents could be a challenge. I found that with the companies expansion efforts and placing a store so close to an existing store, sales figures were hard to maintain. The work remained the same but hours were cut due to drops in sales. The internet plays a larger part in todays quotas. Returns brought into any store reflects negatively against your daily sales quotas. The staff and seasonable employees were a joy to work with. I found my 10 plus years rewarding with regards to the product customers and employees I bonded with over the years"
good,Carters Inc was a nice little job because the hours were very flexible yet they were too short of shifts. It was just a teen job i was seventeen years old so it was good for a teen but if spmeone slightly older wanted to work there i would not recommenes it teens ahould get grocery store job for first job great skill learning and culture in that industry. However the managers there were bad and made the job depressing.
good,"Safely operated various types of forklifts to receive packages and ship materials for worldwide distribution. Followed all safety guidelines to ensure a safe, healthy and clean work environment.  Also used hand held scanner device to accurately pick special orders for customers for distribution worldwide. Standardized a proficient storage system to easier access and account for numerous items which improved and reduced time loss, manpower and increased productivity"
good,This is a better retail job and an overall good company. I had some bad days but mainly because of the people not the company. Learned a lot working with the company as far as another side of retail business not just cleaning and ringing.
good,the thing I liked most about working here were the discounts and the hours. I never worked past 9 pm or earlier that 10 am. Management wasn't really the best. not very organized.
good,"The place was good. Great friendly people for the most part to work with. Down fall is a lack of consistency."
good,"Tous les employ√©s s'entendaient bien entre eux autres, ce qui faisait que la production et le service √† la client√®le √©taient tr√®s bons."
good,"If you're a sales associate, it can be hard to get hours unless you're in a store that is struggling with getting additional staff. If you're a PTS, the pay is super low for the responsibilities you're given and the company has been less about work/life balance in the past couple of years. As well, your DM and management will make/break your experience working there. "
good,I was a temp employee.  Worked 40 to 50 hours per week.  The amount of work that was required did not equal the pay.  I'm sure if I had the opportunity to become a full time employee my experience may be different.
good,"They mostly hire part timers. So if you have serious bills to pay this probably isn't where you should work unless you are a manager. They do not even give supervisors or customer service leads enough hours. company is stingy with hours."
good,"picking and packing, set up for the line packaging, packing on a fast moving line, using pallet jacks to move freight. unpack pack and repack a variety of equipment"
good,"It is a multi channel distribution.  I have learned and managed multiple area's, the culture is great, managing an all male area, when the goals are met and everyone if proud of a job well done."
good,"Working at Carter's made me gain knowledge and experience with costumer service and retail. I enjoyed working there, I just believe I was not getting paid enough and not getting enough hours."
good,"I enjoyed my time here, the team worked well together and worked hard to get the job done. Management was helpful and made working fun. Passionate employees and management."
good,I enjoy the job as the employees are amazing!  I do really enjoy the faced pace workplace. Working with the public is so rewarding especially when they leave your store Happy.
good,"Mainly cycle counting, running reports lost case report, variences report, cubing report and helping other departments with product that has to be shipped."
good,"great customer, customer service, had to maintain a presentable work station, make sure all merchandise was organized, had flexible working hours for school."
good,Carter‚Äôs was a great job to work at. Very interesting and kept you busy. Carter‚Äôs working environment was very busy and it kept workers on their toes.
good,"There was a day that we were short on staff and the work load was heavy, only three employees showed up to work. Together we created a system to organize a plan to get all jobs out in a timely fashion. Team work is what we had and calmness, to where everyone supported each other and assisted each other in everyway. We pull this day off with smiles!"
good,"As a Sales Associate at Carters, the job was fun, productive and entertaining, however, the lack of management was a big issue at the workplace. On an average workday, I enjoyed assisting customers with finding the perfect clothing for their little ones."
good,"I loved working in the original store that I was hired for. Unfortunately, that store closed and I was moved to a much busier store with a general manager that thought I was going to work over time for free. The store did not have enough payroll to support the amount of associates needed. It was quite the mess. I got out as quickly as I could. I found out the store manager is no longer with Carters so that is a definite plus for the company."
good,"It all depends on the store, and what the manager's like. I still work on a temp basis...called every now and then. I like the people I work with, and the manager is usually easy to work with. I like helping customers. I like the Moore store of all in Oklahoma."
good,I guess the only way I can explain my experience at carters is 'it was very by the book'. that's all I really think other people looking to work there should make sure they know...
good,pretty good place to work you can enjoy it nut its more of a part time type of job worked well when i was pregnant and once i gave birth had alotof good deals and discounts
good,"Carter's is a great place to work if you're looking for your first job! A typical day at work would be coming in and getting a chat in of what our manager's plan for the day was. As the day went on we would do shipment, bins, recover, and sometimes volume pulls. There was always something to do when the store had customers. on slow days, after all of our tasks were completed (we usually got done around 2)  we would just walk around the store trying to find stuff to recover. "
good,Overall it's a great work environment with the right type of management who wants their employees to succeed. Management now can be a little better...
good,"A workplace to meet new peers. Working in a warehouse is a good job. The best thing about working inside of a warehouse is that they have more peers than you will ever believe, but first the job comes first. Getting the job done will make the day go by."
good,"I've worked at 3 different locations within this company. Staff is always pleasant. Great to work with. Management at store level is great. Always accommadting and understanding of personal situations and schedules. "
good,I really enjoy working here. I've been working here for a year now. I enjoy the other employees I work with as well as management. They're are flexible.
good,"Not a bad place to work. Find myself with little to no social life. When I am off...always exhausted. However, good people are here. It is what you make for the most part."
good,"Working there, there is always something to do. Hours were good unless there was a sale change then late hours. If you like retail you'd love it. management was hectic, so got a lot of hours."
good,great job learned a lot about customers service. I learned how to become more patient and happy for the work experience. It was a friendly environment
good,"Working at Carter's was nothing too memorable - I didn't learn much, only applied skills I already had. The management wasn't too spectacular, but nothing to really complain about."
good,"Typical retail environment except the clothing doesn't fit you. Good work environment where the whole team works together and has fun."
good,"Got a lot of stocks everyday which make the stockroom overflown."
good,"Never come to work with many co-workers, shifts are usually one sales associate and one manager."
good,People were very nice and full of cheer. Very good with training you one on one and they answer any question that you may have or any concern. I liked it
good,"It all depends on your management structure. The company claims to ""invest in people"" as one of their defining values, yet most ""employees"" are actually contractors to keep the company from having to invest in employees."
good,"This is an easy job that does not consume your life at all. The only issue i had was not getting enough hours from the company and my paychecks were very small. The hourly wage is minimum wage so if you are planning on working here be aware you will not be making much money. If you are someone that needs a little bit of money and it is your first job or you are still in school then yes go work here, but if you are trying to make ends meet and support yourself this is not the place for you. I would recommend working here though 5/10"
good,I was able to learn quite a bit at Carters considering it was my first job. It took me awhile to move up in the ranks. It doesn't seem like they really like to promote from within unless you are willing to relocate. But overall  would say I had a pleasant time working there.
good,Carters is a good company to work for. However your experience all depends on the team you work with. Good managers lead a great team and a fun work enviorment. Once the management team changed work just seemed drama filled and the days seemed like forever. It is a retail store so the hours are constamtly changing  but he pay rate was manageable.
good,"not easy going, fast paced. hardest part of the job is cleaning up the mess all the customers left behind. also many shop lifters"
good,"typical day for a seasonal employee:"
good,It would be a laid back day until people will get off work. the hardest part was when customers would just come back to back & I'll have to move fast.
good,"I liked working at Carters for a few reasons, Discounts on everything at a very cute store and also it was a very simple job that kept you busy."
good,"fast paced, learned to multitask in different types of job titles, leads were straight forward of duties, melting pot of peoples from the world, enjoyed the work"
good,"Every day is different but the same. Process freight, set floor sets. Work with minimal staff and minimal hours while expected to do it all."
good,they cater to the staff very much. however I had to leave because the store I was working with closed down. I would go back if I had the chance to
good,"Most enjoyable is to help customers find what they are looking for "
good,"fun environment, great coworkers and understanding managers. Overall a great environment to work in with some scope for advancement."
good,"Carters warehouse was a fun place to work all of the employees were nice I had no conflict with anyone, and well managed. The hours were not fexible and would lay off frequently."
good,Everyday with the warehouse was a very typical normal day. I go in do my job whatever task that I am on and finish my work. I communicated with everyone. I am a very sociable person but all about business. My manager was somewhat sociable but not a much. She was all about getting the job done so the shipments can be sent out.
good,Working at this store was like being in high school again. The management never addressed the problems nor did they attempt to build better relationships with their workers.
good,For the time that I worked there Carters/Osh kosh bigosh for the most part was a great place to work at. The staff I worked with was always friendly and supportive of each other.
good,"The job overall was a good job me and all the associates got along very well and as long as the customers were happy so were we. My  issues with this job are as followed management was lazy stayed on breaks long hours always trying to get out of hands on projects and assignments procrastinators always saying whats wrong but more telling what to do than showing what to do so it can be done right and did right the first time cutting hours to get more hours themselves but, not doing the work that needed to be done and want us workers to do it in the little hours we were schedule to work."
good,"A typical day at work usually consist of greeting the customers, cleaning the store and selling the clothes. Mandatory customer service is very important. I get along with my co-workers absolutely well and don't have any issues with anyone.  Management is always very efficient and on top of things. I have learned how to have patience when dealing with the customers and their children. Another hard part is constantly keeping the store neat. The hardest part of my job is being bored when there aren't any tasks to do. The most enjoyable part is watching the smart adorable children that come into the store.  Also the most enjoyable part in my opinion is multitasking. I love to have a lot of work to do while helping the customers."
good,Carters is a good place to work if you are a  mom who wants to get out of the house and for  college student for extra cash and experience.
good,Enjoyed working with my co-workers and supervisor. The work was relatively easy and fun to do. The most enjoyable part of the day was breaks and lunch time.
good,In working with children's clothes it is always enjoyable to talk with customers as they make  a purpose for the young ones.At Carters I learned about leadership and multitasking. Also developed my networking abilities.
good,Good environment with room for advancement. Great benefits health and 401k plan. Management preach open door policy. monthly town hall meetings to inform company changes distribution goals met etc .
good,"The job was very routine. But, each employee had the opportunity to learn a new position of their desire. Especially when they felt as if they couldn't handle the requirements for one position."
good,It was fun working in a kids clothing store but as a part time job i couldnt afford to drive there anymore with not enough hours or pay.
good,working there was always busy management always had us fixing everything making us stay late to fix all the clothes and there was so much clothes
good,"Pick/Pack"
good,Great place to start and gain experience. For the most part upper management was relatively pleasant to deal with. Salary far to low for job requirements. Good work life balance.
good,"not enough pay for the work and hours you have to do is the only thing I dislike, other than that its a good job."
good,Production.I learned how to multi-task.The hardest part of the job was keeping up the fast pace.
good,"I was seasonal here and it was fun working and meeting people. But at the same time, some coworkers, including managers, weren't so nice. Felt kinda degraded at times. Not many hours but you were kept very busy. I love kids, so I thought this would be a great retail to work at. You dont get applaud for hard work, but talked to for few mistakes that you do. Aside from all the negative, there were possitives like some what ok pay, and some coworkers were nice."
good,The management needs more structure. Great employees and flexible work schedule.
good,Management stood around a lot. Co-workers were sometimes unable to get along with easily.
good,"The job itself here is easy. I caught on pretty fast. The management there was okay they had their favorites of course. My co-workers we very nice and were willing to work with you. The hardest part of the job was walking all the isle up and down for 8 hours because they were long isle with a lot of items to pick, but I'm always determined and willing to get the job done whatever it takes."
good,"A typical day at Carter's would include helping customers, running register, cleaning, and making sure all the displays look nice and neat. Because this was my first job I learned how to run a cash register. Management played favorites when scheduling. Co-workers were always a pleasure to work with. The job was a relatively easy one so there wasn't really a hard part to this job. I always enjoyed helping customers to the best of my ability."
good,"Typical Day: Starts at 9 am And ends at 3pm"
good,"hardly ever had to come into work, because there was never any work for us to do. pay was not good enough."
good,Stable small CPA firm.  Great opportunities and benefits.  Great work/life balance.
good,"Growing Distribution with potential opportunities for those in he warehouse industry. Clean environment, lots of people with different strength to learn from"
good,Was hired as a seasonal employee. Worked during a busy holiday season and had fun with the customers. Most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and the hardest part of the job was not being scheduled as often as I would like and getting ahold of the managers.
good,I quickly stepped into a management position and was able to utilize many of my strengths and improve on my weaknesses.
good,the hardest part of the job was leaving it because i was overlooked for a position.
good,Carry a lot of heavy windshields in all types of weather conditions. Very physically demanding and it is a grind to get your job done on time. May have to run to get orders out on time. No time to really talk to co-workers except on lunch. Your busy loading your trucks or putting shields up in racks. Hardest part of job is carrying 100 plus lb windshields up and down 20 foot step ladders.
good,"Supervising employees , training , Greeting Customers, Providing outstanding customer service"
good,Making children clothes and the speed. There was times the work load was low. Being in the environment was enjoyment.
good,Store life very stressfull.  Hard to balance corporate demands wile trying to maintain quality customers service.
good,Most people there are generally unhappy people.  Company is really not that bad.  Management doesn't always seem to be knowledgeable but that's typical of a company this big.
good,Love working in a fast pasted enviroment i have gained knowledge of multiple customers and requirements for routing and shipping.
good,"A typical day includes a store full of customers who have high demands and do not speak english, highly energized and vocal children who like to touch everything, managers who are easily stressed out and associates who like to do as little work as possible to just get their shift over with. In this company I learned how to build greater patience for people. A small room you have to keep clean, crowded with babies and moody adults... You just have to have PATIENCE. The management was the most unprofessional bunch I had ever met. They were disrespectful and dishonest to the associates. Most internal issues were aroused by personal opinion and feelings and never dealt with professionally. My co-workers had awesome personalities, but were not team workers. They were not all dedicated to their work. The hardest part of my job was trying to get everyone to work as a team so that we could do our jobe more effectively and efficiently. The most enjoyable part of my job was creating customer relationships. On a daily basis I would have customers say they had not received excellent customer service until they met me."
good,"Fun environment, great products.  Growing company with lots of opportunities from associate to manager. Opening several more stores before years end. "
good,"I'm always doing something at work such as go-backs. It's always busy. My co-workers are always friendly and cheerful. Dealing with customers and telling them about the store promotion was always our number one task and getting them to sign up with us was always easy. I enjoyed working, but the only thing that upset me was not getting enough hours."
good,Once you reach management level their are alot of perks and incentives. 
good,I learned a lot about retail and it was fun interacting with pregnant people and helping them pick stuff out for their unborn kids.
good,"Seasonal is somewhat slow at this store. Stocking most of the time, Management is laid-back. Co-workers get job done. "
good,Carter is a great place to get started in real estate for the Atlanta market. It is a well known name and is well respected in the community.
good,the organization of the building was way out of proportion. 
good,Very busy industry due do women always having babies. Get to see mothers and grandmothers all day either look for new items for a baby on the way or you get to see them come in and pick clothes out for their kids as they grow. Stable management team and good sales associates.
good,Fun place to work but hours are hard to come by. It is a good environment and the people are very friendly.
good,Your day could be going from discussing markdowns to choosing marketing shots for a in-home mailer.
good,I learned how to use the registers. All my co-workers are friendly and out going and would assist me with anything I needed help with. The hardest thing about this job was dealing with rude customers. The most enjoyable thing about this job is how comfortable you feel around all your co-workers.
good,"Great summer job. I love kids so being around 7 year old twins was tiring sometimes, but always a laugh and a joy."
good,Payroll is a pain had a lot of issues with my account and pay personally. Hard to get enough hours but made great friends working there and it was fun.
good,"Carter's was a good starter job. Unfortunately the management was often immature and spiteful but overall was a good job. Upon giving my notice for 2 weeks, the rest of my schedule was taken away after requesting a slight adjustment on one day."
good,"The work isn‚Äôt difficult, but it can get tedious at times as it often doesn‚Äôt change and you feel as if you‚Äôre repeating shifts. The amount of hours you get also greatly varies, so don‚Äôt go into this job expecting a constant, set income."
good,"Management was good, environment was laid back most of the time and the discount was good at all Carters and OshKosh stores. The people were friendly and it was just a good experience. The only thing I'd say is that the pay could have been better."
good,"what i learned working at carters is being social its a small town and everyone knows everyone"
good,I enjoyed working here for a short time. I liked the staff and management. Got along with everyone and I liked the store atmosphere. The only thing that was bad was the hours.
good,Carter was a fun place to work. Not all the time as a n Asst. Manager were we recognize for the work that we did it would go to the Store Managers instead.
good,The managers are pretty chilled just make sure your doing your job. it‚Äôs really nice interactiving with customers helping them find clothes for their babies or family/friend babies.
good,"the employees and managers were great, worked well with one another and flexible for others schedules. the store is small and a bit cramped due to sharing it with osh kosh but not over whelming. atmosphere was welcoming and calming"
good,It‚Äôs a run work place lots of stuff to do. Continuous work no sittig down but you are always busy so it‚Äôs okay. You never know what job you are doing until you walk in so you get to experience other departments and it‚Äôs interesting
good,"Management was horrible because my manager never could take her transferred calls which always got customer complaining/ upset with me which cause a delay in my work. They also need to find a way to process a customer's problems quicker and their computer systems. Co-workers were nice, option to take an hour lunch break, and option to work over-time."
good,"Enjoyed working there. Co-workers were easy to get along. You also got the option to take an hour lunch by combining your 30min breaks with your 30min lunch break. However, the issue I did have with the company was the management and work procedures. My manager was always unavailable to take her transferred calls which always got customers complaining and upset at me which delayed my work. To process a customer's issue or system handling needs to be quicker."
good,"Started off as a sales associate then quickly became a part of management within 6 months. Being that I was a freshman in college when I started, the minimum wage was enough for me to spoil myself with food and pay little fees for school. "
good,"Great company values, however, they do not hold leadership to the values. They state that they are focused on training leaders, but their program is not in depth and favoritism is massive."
good,I assisted customers with finding the correct product they needed for their children. I made sure the store was opened and ready for the customers. I learned a lot about children's clothes.
good,"While Carter's is fine for a first job, or for temporary part time work, there's not a lot of career advancement so not a forever job. It's a nice atmosphere."
good,The walking around go to lunch to go break the hardest about the plant its like football field long. Cant leave have to stay on the premises all the. time very long hours.
good,"I worked with Carter's for about 2 years. It was my first job out of College and I learned a lot. I took the cash register, handled inventory, organized shipment and got familiar with the fashions and the product of the store. The manager was good, very communicative, relaxed and outgoing. She always made sure we were all right and handled difficult situations with the clients. The thing I enjoyed most was dealing wth the clients. Talking to people and listening to what they needed. We didn't have many benefits as part-timers, and I'm so glad they ended the call in schedules, as they prevented us from getting other jobs as part times. In the end I had to leave the job as I wasn't getting practically any substantial hours (sometimes I had 6 a week) so I look for opportunities elsewhere."
good,It was fun to interact with the children that came in with their parents. The other employees were fun to work with by making it laid back and joking around.
good,Lot of marketing and merchandising skills can be developed due to the amount of price/promo changes done in store. Opportunity for brand growth with walk through locations.
good,"There are lots of benefits for education, but pay increases and bonuses are practically non-existent.  Only Directors and higher have opportunity to earn performance based pay increase and bonuses."
good,"Most days there is always something to be done. Stock, customers, markdowns. General maintenance of the store. "
good,"Working at Carters was a good experience for me, it was my first retail so I learned a lot; management were not that nice, schedules would get messed up, I would get YELLED at for making a minor mistake."
good,"Working in this company was a change of pace. Getting to see the different items for people expecting a child or who have children, was amazing"
good,"Co-workers are helpful, so we are a team. But when managers are present environment become unbearable."
good,"A typical day at work for me, was going in sign in and start working as soon as I could, I wanted to get as much stuff done as possible before my shift ended. I would check our schedule and the list of things to do and start them. My manager had assigned us ( MITs) to certain parts in the store, where we would clean up, redo the walls, put new programs out, and also train the new employees in those sections and show them what needed to be done and how to do it correctly. I would also work on shipment and do the paperwork that came along with it; When my manager and assistant manager was not in, that would put me in charge of the girls and the store, so i would assign them to certain spots, and make a list of the thing's that needed to be done for that day. On sundays that i worked I would also do the morning paperwork that had to be sent to our regional manager. I would open and close the store, and if it was possible for me I would go in and cover the other girls shifts if needed. There wasn't really a hard part of the job, I really enjoyed the girls i worked with, they became like family to me, we were all like sisters to each other, that was the hardest part of leaving that job and moving."
good,I enjoyed working for carter's. They were a great company to work for. They were friendly and workable with my available at the time. I would love to go back to work for them. But the pay was not good enough for me to working for them.
good,Friendly co workers. nice environment. many foreigners come and go so it does get difficult at times with the language barrier and all that.
good,"Very competitive company. Daily activities include opening the store, printing up sales for previous day. Auditing timecards and imputing previous days sales in schedule and comparing sales to labor. "
good,"As a MIT your job is the same as the Manager and ASM if they are not in the store. "
good,"There r little to no hours at all, the pay is terrible but the work isn't all that bad, the workers some are very lazy and will watch you and carry news to be in the managers good graces, you can't anythingbabout christ because it apparently offends some peop le considering who they carter for. Some of the managers are rude and arragant expecially if you do not agree and thunk they way they do.therw is no room to do anything independly cause your akways paired in a team which isn't so bad but some times the team profarmance is very bad.when ever your finish working you cannot leave because you have to be waiting on the team to finish so they can all leave but you don't get payed for staying and not doing anything.i would say its a alright start for the first few months but its not a okacw which promotes growth nor promotion."
good,ok job...kept me on the move the co workers were nice...fast pace job..cleaning up was the hardest part..management was alright...i learned how to work a cash register and greet customers properly
good,"The management staff at this company is what makes the job enjoyable. Everyone is hard working and team players. I've learned a lot about shipping and recieving, merchendising and coaching and development from my store manager. I've also gained a strong understanding of the business. I enjoy developing my employees and proving customer service. Osh Kosh is a difficult company to work for. The store is always changing. The company is constantly increasing the work load. A-players only."
good,"This job didn't require too much heavy lifting so that was great but the work hours was extremely tiring at times. This job requires a lot of standing so comfortable shoes is a good idea, also using proper bending techniques is a must due to the fact its aloott of bending and lifting on a daily basses. The manager was a sweet guy and team members were very supportive !"
good,"office work"
good,Strong management with good direction. Positive and inclusive culture. Hours were a bit too long for my taste and pay wasn't commensurate with work expectations.
good,"It's a great company some of the management is out for themselves, but "
good,"Fast paced company, minimum hours weekly good for retirement or high school students. Not your typical 9-5 retail job for living purposes. Great benefits and professional dress code."
good,It's a ok job but very bad management and no opportunity to move forward with the company they show no appreciation to the workers but it's a job and it's not the worst
good,"I really didn‚Äôt get to work there that long because my first day on the job was when the Hail hit the Colorado Mills Mall. After construction I helped set up the store before Black Friday and that was full hours, after the reopening, the store manager failed to give me decent hours and the other people that worked there were spreading some harsh words that were under my name."
good,Not a lot of hours provided. Don't get back to you often but staff is friendly. You should fit in well. Have very high standards and must learn very quickly!
good,"I have enjoyed working for this company the last 2 years. However, I have been there for 2 years and still am treated like I am new without much advancement. I know more about the product and company in general than the majority of people working within my store, however the district continues to hire people in positions higher than mine, sometimes even people younger than me. I feel as though I am not treated as I should be after the dedication, commitment, and loyalty that I have shown this company. I still am working for Carters/OKB, but am looking to find new employment elsewhere where my traits will go appreciated."
good,"I worked there as a temp, i never really got a lot of hours. The people that i worked with made the work fun and there was great training. I had worked there for about a month or so."
good,Carter's will provide you with gaining experience in customer service. Their work ethics will allow you to become a good employee. This is a great first time job.
good,"As with any retailer you can expect your work hours to vary. No set schedule on a week to week basis. Management doesn't just delegate, you must be present and active on the floor as well as the stock room. The store needs to meet goals and make money in return you gain/lose your hours. The hardest part was not having the hours to complete floor sets or moves in time. The most enjoyable part was interacting with the children and parents that come in. Some can be overwhelmed and knowing your product can be such a relief for them!"
good,Carters is a good company that is growing each year. Carters does offer high quality merchandise at affordable prices and values the customer's experience.
good,"For only working at this job for 5 months, I have grown to love the company and the fellow co workers that I worked with. I came to this job to help with money. This being my second job and manage college it was hard sometimes but it was all worth it in the end. I got to improve more of my hospitality skills and I enjoyed doing it. This was a great second job for the period of time I was there."
good,"A very nice place to work, as long as you get the hours."
good,"Good place to work at , depends on which department you go into . I worked in receiving and I would say it was tons of hard labor but fun. I would knock out at least 3 or 4 trucks a day . Friendly environment but the hours vary on the production you'd be lucky to at least get a week worth of 40 hours . Fun environment but lack of communication from the employees to the high ups and I suggest if you go to school, I repeat they DO NOT work with your school hours . I found out I was pointed 14 points even though I had legal documentation from my school including transcripts and schedules and they started off telling me they do work with school hours before I started working there. Active for 9 months without hire and that was when the 90 days came into effect . Always keep a look out on where your points is there's no surprise that you won't come back the next day . No room for advancement and everything is like high school all over again."
good,"I've worked here my whole college experience and it was a good way  to learn how to interact with both customers, employees and management. All the workers are very friendly and there are good benefits with being a sales associate."
good,"-Hours are not great"
good,"It was an okay work environment, just long hours which was fine. Management was very rude but it was not too bad. Pay checks were always accurate."
good,"I enjoyed working with the people on staff. I also liked how when we did inventory, it was still fun even though we were working hard."
good,"Manged a team from 8-15 people , Worked on the sales floor with my team Selling Baby items."
good,"Work was easy, nothing too stressful."
good,I enjoy working with the district leaders that are developers of talent. The job is high energy and very demanding but there is never a dull moment as I‚Äôm introduced challenging situations in markets different from mine all the time. 
good,I was not able to take time off when needed but I was always willing to go the extra mile. I loved the kids and the customers and the clothing. We had great sales and people knew our brands. 
good,"The dress code is kind of strict, but the staff is full of energetic people. Personally not a job I would recommend to anybody who is still a teenager or early 20's."
good,"everything was good, up until you have to work graveyard shift out of no where, your district manager was never happy always finding something wrong with the store.. i loved the customers and over all we had a good staff of employees.. manager was wack she always had issues and never was at the store. management pretty much did what ever they wanted."
good,Your day is cleaning stocking and customers it really does go by fast when your busy and if your not there is always something to do. The culture is divers and friendly.
good,"It's a very great workplace, just hard to manage the long hours , it's a very fast past work environment!! I don't know if they work around scheduling of people who have a very busy life! But great thing about it is the weekends are free to you! EVERY WEEKEND"
good,"Carter's was a production based company, so it was imperative that each employee work hard to keep up with daily expectations. It was a weekend job, Friday through Sunday from 6am to 6pm. Though physically taxing, it was an excellent schedule for me at the time, and there was a bonus included each week for perfect work attendance. This provided incentive for employees to be at work on time each day. The environment was, overall, not unpleasant; my only complaint would be the temperature fluctuation within the warehouse. If given the opportunity to return, I would most certainly be interested."
good,This company is well organized and is very productive in work and customer service on a day to day basis. The company is very good with handling shipments and adjusting to new store changes.
good,"This was a nice company, however my pay was not enough to care for my family. I liked the hours and management was decent. The hours were what I needed because of my part time job as a football coach. The hardest part of the job was making the money stretch over my bills."
good,"Empresa por ser de terceiriza√ß√£o ao banco, me proporcionou um leque de aprendizado na √°rea administrativa, processos , lidar com pessoas.. e dividir meus dias com colegas competentes, que facilitaram no trabalho do dia a dia  e sem esquecer da gerencia que s√£o verdadeiros lideres sempre nos ajudando e ensinando nas atividades."
good,"Working as a store manager is like any other retail store, you hire, train, do stock & visual merchandising, customer service and follow KPI metrics and work hard to make your targets."
good,"I enjoyed working for Carters, loved all the customers and team members! The discounts are great, the pay is great if you are a manager."
good,"The most flexible job I had. Gave me the opportunity to balance my work and personal life. "
good,Customer service is our top priority. Insuring that customers are satisfied with not only our product but with the employees who are working and servicing them. Creating an experience that customers will not forget and will encourage them to re-visit our location. Everyone on the team is hospitable and hard working.
good,"Scan, Sort, Organize and Pack Baby Clothes. I had great Attendance, Worked well with others and nothing was hard about the job."
good,"Carters, Inc prides themselves on providing a great Work/Life Balance. There is some complacency with management and very little room for advancement."
good,"A typical day at work was always competitive. I've learned how to pick. The management was okay there. There wasn't anything hard about this job. The most enjoyable part bout this job was the breaks,"
good,"Carter's is a very fast paced work environment where teamwork is necessary to keep sales up and meet target goals at the same time keeping up store appearance and representing the brand. It's not one of those companies where things are organized according to hierarchy, so this is good if your personality does not fit in well with this type of micromanagement organization. ALL employees including the manager must work together to keep up the appearance of the store."
good,It is a very good job just very high expectations and over worked.  Often many roles are expected but not compensated for.  For example I di at least the job of three people.
good,I love the store.  Good management and working conditions. Fun atmosphere and clean store. Always busy and could use more help but we can't get the hours from cooperate. Need a bigger store . We are a bit crowded.
good,"Great company to work for, but no work life balance. Extreme work load with minimal payroll to complete. Great district manager and store management team."
good,"Working there seasonal. Only busy when the season for clothes. Had a few overtime, other than that it's a nice to place to work at. Hard to get hired on. Overall management was good and works with employees."
good,"Great work environment. Unorganized management. Schedules were always uncertain, and you never knew the schedule until midway in the shift. overall good temporary job. Not a promising career."
good,Nice place to work.  Love the environment.  25% discount is a plus.  Barely get work hours.  Great place to work if your seeking a little pocket change.
good,Compensated well. Lots to do. Great product... not the best processes in place to fully execute all the merchandise. Shipment can be very heavy without the proper allocations.
good,"Working here is very fun, the management team is very nice. Treat employees very good. A typical day at work would involve cleaning up the store (if you opened or closed), Working the cash register, assisting customers in finding what they need and are looking for. Providing a friendly and welcoming environment for the customers as soon as they walk in the store."
good,"A very fun place to work, just not enough hours. The management and environment was lovely and the customer's weren't that bad at all. I'd recommend this as a part time job"
good,"Free coffee, hot chocolate, and tea all day long. awesome break room, managers help as best they can but are busy, too, so they can be strict. Very lenient with their customers and definitely do their best to please the customer."
good,Pull things a pick them in boxes and also put tags on clothes. And swept when it was nothing to do. But peek season u will get the hours. The money as well
good,"Carter's was a very dynamic work setting. Sales associates were often on the same level as the managers, having to adapt and perform many of the same functions.  This allowed for us to learn a lot very quickly.  Because I worked with Carter's when that location was opening, I was able to pick up many things throughout my time there.  Most importantly, my job as a sales associate revolved a whole lot on keeping the customers happy and performing excellent customer service."
good,I often feel even when I'm doing what I've been asked correctly that it isn't enough for my store manager. Everyone else is so welcoming and encouraging. Unfourtunately I have moved an hour away and 10 an hour for so little barely covers my gasoline bill driving from home to work and back.
good,this is a typical part-time retail job. no fixed hours. friendly staff. reasonable hours and pay. shoplifting occured very often however. carters needs to work on security.
good,"It was a great place to work at, fun environment and fun coworkers. But the pay was average, however you do get a review every year with a raise. The manager was closer to the older sales associates, and i feel the manager catered to their needs more. "
good,There were a lot a challenges to overcome at my time in the store. The work environment  could be better if we all push in the same direction. There are some much to do and so little time. Its a great place to get or develop new skills. Its a fast pace so you need to be able to quick when problems arrive.
good,"A typical day is assisting parents all day purchase clothes for their children. The job is pretty easy. Not a complicated place to work at all. Its pretty laidback and management is cool. The ONLY thing I hate about this job is they hire to many people and they already don't have the hours to give to the people who need hours to see a reasonable paycheck. I would only recommend this job for teenagers who ONLY has a cellphone bill to pay or an adult who is looking for extra gas money. You definitely can't live off this check alone unless you are management who works full-time. "
good,"A  typical day at work is customer service all day and everyday. Making it a priority to manage and measure work if its a high task day. Just learning everyone you work with and knowing what's their aspect of the business. "
good,"Great Managment Staff, diversified staff, the implemented rolling shelves in the stockroom take some adjusting to but completely worth taking the time to understand."
good,"Working at Carter's has been a different experience for me. We get a lot of foreigners and tourists in our store, and though communicating with them at times was a bit difficult at first, I have gotten a lot better with it. Our goal is to also get customers to sign up for our coupon program, and I have been able to get a lot more of the tourists to sign up. Working at Carter's can get quite hectic and I find myself having to multi-task for a majority of the day. I would say that is the hardest part at times, especially if there is a long line at the registers. The most enjoyable part of working at Carter's is probably the fact that I get along really well with my co-workers and managers."
good,"The Carter's that I was hired at only hired people due to policy not because they needed employees. The woman that was in charge of the schedule only scheduled herself and her friends full time or more, but scheduled everyone else the minimum hours required."
good,"Worst Management I've ever worked with. They set their own schedules, come and go when they feel like it...they are the reason there is so much turn over at this store. When i left they had already had over 100 people working for them, and the store has only been open 3 years."
good,"The whole company of Carters is great, the management is hit or miss, in my case it was a miss. We had a new manager come on board and she has ruined the way that everyone is treated. She has a goal to fire all of the staff from old management. I am currently the only one left and am looking for a new job."
good,"Although I absolutely adored the staff members at Carter's/Oshkosh, the available hours were very minimal and inconsistent. Being a cashier and sales associate, I was able to interact with the public daily. I was responsible for completing sales transactions, merchandising and occasional bank deposits. The most enjoyable parts about working at Carter's/Oshkosh would have been the enthusiastic team and great customers."
good,they really is no relax time you have to rush to lunch only a few clocks for so any employees during lunch breaks they really need a better way for the workers t relax and prepare for another long stressful part of and employees shift to run smoother so work can be more efficient and productive
good,"I'm not happy with my department as a whole, but I have some good team mates. They are stingy with raises, so make sure you get a good starting salary."
good,Carter's is an extremely customer focused business. I appreciate their commitment to putting the customers first and providing a pleasant shopping experience.
good,"Supervisors were friendly and easy to get along with. Enjoyed helping  customers who were expecting a baby and needed help getting what they needed for their baby. My co-workers were all very friendly, and we all worked well together. I would have liked to remain on after the holiday season."
good,My co workers are what made me want to go to work. they were a great team to be a part of.
good,I usually worked the cash register. I didnt like the hours. It was a store in the mall
good,"If you're looking for casual work, then I would recommend this job. A lot of staff quit due to management stress and depression, unfortunately. But overall, if you're looking to make some friends or just some extra money, then it's worth it."
good,Carter's as a company was not bad but i had managers and supervisors who weren't the greatest. the highlight of my days were seeing all the cute babies come in.
good,"The employees are wonderful to work with but management, no. If you want to move up in the company they'll work with you, boost your head up like you're really going to get the position then turn around and make up excuses and hire someone else and will leave you high and dry."
good,"I worked here twice. First time, the store had just opened and I was one of the many associates to put the store together. After the 1 week it took us to put everything together for the Grand Opening, associates were only getting a few days a week. I had asked for part time, but I was getting less than part time.. I was getting maybe 1-2 days a week. I quit because I had started school and the manager could not accommodate my schedule. A few months later, I reapplied because my schedule had changed and I was desperate for work. I worked there for a month on 4-5 days a week..after that I worked 2-3 weeks with just 1-2 days a week and a low pay per hour rate. I wasn't getting very far with this company like I had hoped. I eventually wanted to become manager, but that ship sailed when I was hired again and put back to 1-2 days a week at 3-4 hours each."
good,"There was a lots of favoritisme but overall good experience, learn a lot of new things but should I have some training because they put you on the floor with knowing where is everything, yes, the did show the section but that wasn‚Äôt enough training!!!"
good,Great kids clothing store with many sales and discounts. Lots to choose from. Always nice and neat organization. Clothes is very nice and always new styles.
good,"mangers are un-organized, leave stuff pile up and stress everyone out not enough hours and its unfair that mangers get full time and sales associates get part time"
good,It ms a great part time job for high school or college students. The pay it okay can‚Äôt make a living on it unless your a manager. This location is great place.
good,"Overall, Carter's was a great place to work. They had a wonderful understanding of work and home-life balance. They are always understanding of issues concerning children and childcare, though they never miss a chance to make you feel bad about it. The salary is not reflective of the amount of work you will put in here, though it is reflective of the retail industry of today. I always had a nice time going in to work, and seeing my coworkers. We really were a team, even with the ups and downs."
good,"Open the store, bank deposit."
good,Store manager needs to focus more on building her employees and maybe her store would be productive. All Other employees and management were all great people.
good,The problem with this place is they can't offer many hours to the full time or part time employees. my manager at the time was great but the new management and upper management didn't seem to do their job properly.
good,"I really enjoy the position at the store. I love helping the customers. Pretty much everyone is happy and a pleasure to work with. We specialized in selling baby clothes and young children s clothes and pajamas. Our toughest customers are crying babies, but there so cute. The store and staff are great!!"
good,I feel there should be more growth opportunities for all employees. Some managers are not allowed to go to work at the corporate office is a big con.
good,Carter‚Äôs has provided a great work experience with an excellent training package (Tots Training). I‚Äôve enjoyed working here for the last ten years. I would recommend it to anyone.
good,This was a great place to work and gain warehouse DC experience when given the chance.Company values gave all employees real purpose for doing the job. Equity in giving individuals chance was more not present than present. Company values were not always followed by upper management and office personnel especially. Once off of the warehouse floor the company values were very much lacking. This was the case with even some supervisors and Operations managers from shift to shift. I purposefully worked all shifts over time to be sure I was not wrong.
good,"While working at Carter's I helped a lot of pregnant mothers get ready for their expecting baby, or I would help out friends and family members who know someone who is expecting a child.  I learned a lot about what it is like being a parent at Carter's and how stressful parenthood can be.  In this time of need I would provide my excellent customer service and assist them all the way up until it was time to check out and pay."
good,"Good first job experience, friendly coworkers, recovery takes a long time. The customers are usually friendly, gets very busy, stressful at times, good environment."
good,Carters/Oshkosh is my first experience in retail. I worked mainly in fast food and I feel this is a good starting job for anyone. It is easy to pick up on things and it is also mainly a fast paced environment.
good,"I had to fold clothes, ick up after customers, organize the clothes and greet customers, also had check customers out when they purchases.This wasnt a good place to work the mangaes werent nothelpful and also they very rude."
good,"Even though the overall experience for this job was good , scheduling was an issue when it came to this job. I had kept talking to the manager about my availability and it was not working well."
good,"I just worked there for the summer, but it was a excellent and enjoying experience. I love to suggestive sell to everybody. The hardest part of the job was trying to make sure all the customers was ok."
good,I learned a lot of things working in this company. I would have loved to work here longer but their policy is too strict. I don't like that with any missed absence that is connected to a sick child or you being sick you can't bring in a doctors note because they don't accept them. This job is more for people with no kids or people that have older kids.
good,"Carters is a great company to work for, but because everyone loves it so much, not that many people are leaving. This is causing an odd situation in that no one can advance really above a supervisor/manager as the VP's or Senior Managers are not leaving."
good,"servir les clients, changement de prix, caisses, ouverture, fermeture, d√©p√¥t, m√©nage, mettre en ordre le magasin, informer les promotions."
good,Carter's is a place to work if you don't have a life because they expect you to come to work not worried about nothing else but getting out their merchandise.
good,i had the opportunity to learn how to multitask in this type of job you have to be fast and efficient
good,"I sold baby clothes. I stocked, resupplied, and restocked the backroom and main floor."
good,"I was hired as a part time customer service lead and have a very open availability. I told my manager anytime, any shift and 20-25 hours a week. Im being given 11 hours a week which is not enough to live on, at all! Im extremely frustrated and am looking for a new job at this time. Sad to  go after all the training I've completed!"
good,The job overall was okay. There weren't many hours for the employees that were all ready their but it they were always hiring taking the little bit of hours from current employees. The pay could have been better for as much work that was required.
good,Very good beginners retail job. Allows you to participate in all manners of retail. From working the till to facing the store. You will always have someone there to work with you.
good,"In my circumstance, it was pretty easy to advance to management, the effectiveness of the store really depends on the management, and the willingness to work together."
good,"No matter your day it's your choice to decide how you take it. Management was great, and the hardest part of the job was getting yelled at because we don't have items wanted in stock, or our coupons don't work on clearance items. Other than that it's normally pretty easy."
good,Its an okay job but at times would would significantly slow down and they would have you file unemployment by being laid off until work picks back up again.
good,Beau linge et belle √©quipe de travail. Nous faisons beaucoup de travail d'√©quipe et c'est tr√®s agr√©able.
good,I was a sales associate mainly during the summer during high school.  It was a good job for me at this time in my life.  The hours very flexible and worked well around my school and sport schedule.  Overall I had a positive experience.
good,"More hours and a raise would be more beneficial for me. I have said more than once about needing more hours, and nothing has changed. It is a fun place to work."
good,"Hours were terrible and the schedule constantly changed from what they gave you. Management sucked if there was an issue it got brushed off or if something needed done they didn‚Äôt train the right way, they expected you to teach yourself."
good,"It's the perfect job for someone looking for something part time. But, there is a lack of communication between associates and mangers. There are no benefits and paid days off."
good,"Communicated with customers, employees and other individuals to answer questions and explain information. Increased sales during projected to be high volume months. Had successful ability to adapt to co-workers. Worked on both the floor and as a cashier."
good,I only work at Carter to fill in the the Christmas time. I enjoy the job and being around the baby cloths. I would work there again to help out over Christmas time.
good,This is a company that is ecommerce driven with that being said you are worked hard during certain times of the year. As well when they are slow they ask that you go on unemployment for a period of time and or cut back your hours.
good,I worked here part time after having my daughter and I enjoyed it. I was able to have a flexible schedule that helped balance work and home. It was a good place to work retail.
good,Lots of theives steal but no protection for the employees.   No security available and not all stores have cameras.  Freight cannot always be processed within time constraints.
good,"Working with this company can be very great. I've had some amazing experiences with management but have also had some not so good moments as well. The job is physically needy which is not always a bad thing. The most enjoyable part of the job, though, is the friendships made with coworkers. Team work is truly emphasized in this company."
good,My work experience was new since that was my first job ever. I learned alot there. I got to work a little of everything from working the register to helping close for the night.
good,"Stressful at times but great as well. Customers are incredible, too many policy changes and inconsistency with how to manage certain things."
good,Enjoyed working with my co-workers and supervisor. The work was relatively easy and fun to do. The most enjoyable part of the day was breaks and lunch time.
good,"A typical day would consist of opening, counting out cash and inventory. Greet new customers and help them find product as well has help them match products. Receive and unpack new merchandise, reset floor plan. Management had it's issues, learned to be careful who you talk to. Had to lift heavy boxes and climb stairs often."
good,overall everyone got along..job was ok. the pay just didnt add up with the work we did. we ofter got took advantage of..but i loved the job just because it got me out the house during the week
good,"When I worked at Carters I was mainly a cashier and delivered customer service while maintaining the stores appearance. I also sometimes did the opening/closing financials and  inventory. "
good,"Like I said, not a bad place to begin as a first time employee in retail. The management team has been overhauled since the last time I have worked there- twice. The store constantly changes it's staff but that may be in part of the store manager. She can be rather cold and insensitive most times."
good,"This company is all about family, loved the staff. A typical day at work is like working for a day care. You get to play and interact with the kids. At the same time you get to help the expecting parents pick out outfits or surprises to let the husband know what they are having."
good,"A typical day at work was pleasant, working with the customers was enjoyable. I have never worked in retail before so I was able to learn about sales."
good,Picking and packing was simple. Work ran out quick so I helped other departments and learned new things. Unfortunately I was seasonal so didn‚Äôt last long. Pay was sort of fair I guess.
good,"The culture at Best Company is by far the greatest asset. You can tell that they truly care about the happiness of their employees. It's a really relaxed and calm environment, even though the work we do can be fast paced. I don't dread coming into work on Monday mornings and the managers are extremely patient and understanding."
good,I have worked in different departments in Carter‚Äôs Osh Kosh warehouse factory. Had a balanced amount of work for an individual. I was an E/Comm and an Outbound associate at Carter‚Äôs factory.
good,great place to work its a easy going place with amazingly friendly staff. the ladies who work there are amazing and the customers were always great to be around
good,√©tant toujours a cette emploi je pr√©f√®re garder cette information confidentiel
good,Assistant manager/Customer Service Lead.  Assisted in opening and closing the store.  Active Key holder to assist with service providers and customers.
good,"I absolutely loved and still love this company. I loved my position and my coworkers. But we had gotten a new store manager that hated me, would yell at me in the back room for hours on end, told associates that she didnt like me, and would cause many issues. It got to the point where I couldnt do it anymore. I reccomend working for the company they just need to ditch the store manager at the location I was at."
good,"In the location I worked, my team was amazing and very kind and supportive. Other teams not so much when I would go help at different stores."
good,"Carter‚Äôs was a fun place to work at and gain experience, especially for a first time job. All my superiors were kind and patient as well as the majority of customers."
good,"good customer service, great place to work at, great people to work with. its located in the mall, gets to be around little children and mothers.store contains everything your child needs."
good,"My first time meeting the assistant manager, she asked if I was rich or something because of where my parents live. I mentioned this to other employees, who said she can just rub you wrong. Another night she had me as the only one on the floor (greeting, ringing, and folding). She got mad when tables weren't folded fast enough, as if I wasn't already working hard. The manager was nice, but this assistant manager ruined the company for me."
good,"Good Company to work for productive environment, like the people there. It had its draw back like most jobs but overall the facility is nice. The eating area was state of the art equipped with tv monitor, refrigerator, and plenty of microwave."
good,"The staff and team that i had when i started were amazing. We grew as a family and ran everything so smooth, the only hiccups we ever had were the big top guns when we weren't playing by their rules as far as making sales. Thye put a lot of pressure on that because the more sales then more hours for everyone to work"
good,Good place to work if you dont mind being on yohr feet all the time and going up ans down stars all day ling ! Lots of walking . other then feet hurting its good job
good,"Supervisor was very coordinating and guiding properly with patience."
good,"There was an atmosphere of teamwork. The environment was relaxed, but we were also busy. The hardest part of this job was the changes in management over the period of time I was there."
good,Carters is a great company to work for this company allows you to grow within the company just takes time and you will have them have a lot of patience how many areas different departments in Carters is shipping receiving and other lots of things to do..
good,I enjoyed working at Carters and with the staff but after the change of management it wasn‚Äôt as good as a work environment. The job wasn‚Äôt hard and I always had something to do.
good,A typical day at work i learned how to work well with others in tough situations management works well with you if you have problems and can‚Äôt come in very understanding
good,"A typical day at work would be just cashing people out, most days we have objectives we have to get done by the end of the night. Can get stressful when its busy and we have promo changes because you feel rushed. "
good,"It was nice always seeing the cute baby clothes and helping parents with their shopping. "
good,It was a good place to work. The environment was relaxed but it did get really busy in the afternoons. Employees and managers made it comfortable working there.
good,It was a nice place to work. Had to keep busy at all times. Had to sign people up for coupons otherwise our score would go down. A lot of customers do not want to sign up.
good,"The people are great, a hardworking younger group for the most part. The basic premise of what we do is interesting as well ... helping people all over the world manage their problems to get through the day. The company is doing great globally. The benefits are great."
good,"Carters was a good work environment. Wonderful training for employees, coworkers were like family. It was wonderful seeing Mother‚Äôs, grandparents, etc. coming into buy Children‚Äôs clothing- everyone is so friendly, this making the work less like work."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was connecting with parents and sharing parenting/baby experiences all in the transaction over baby clothes. My awesome diverse work team made the work days enjoyable too.
good,It was a regular warehouse environment. Long work hours and very busy around the holidays. I think they should be a little bit more flexible when It comes to taking lunch breaks and such.
good,"Rarely are two days every the same with both customers and projects. There is always something to do, even on slow days with not a lot of traffic, usually consisting of cleaning and consistent refolding. "
good,"carters Oshkosh is a fun filled environment to work at.  Not a good job to have as a career, but a good job to have for part time.  Wouldn't suggest management, as the company does not support them in any aspect."
good,Carter's was fun to work at because the merchandise was great quality at a fair price. The staff was always great and most of the kids were very well behaved.
good,It was an learning experience for me very fast paced and I learned a lot and helped train new people that applied to job I also worked on a scale and picked orders
good,"Great company to work for, staff is usually good and etc but the only downside would be the hours you get a week which is maybe just about 10 hours a week"
good,I really enjoyed working at the retail store.  It was a fun place to work part-time.  It is a very structural company to work for.  Great management and employees!
good,"management was reliable even though they specialized,the staff was professional and courteous,its a fun place to work just not enough hours and minimum wage pay. other then that it is a very easy going relaxing sometimes fast paste job.didnt care for the idea of calling in for shifts"
good,"A typical day at work includes addresses all customer needs, stock, replenishment and making sales."
good,"Carter's was an enjoyable place to work because there were so many children and families that came in. However, low pay and on-call shifts were frustrating because you never knew if they were going to ask you to come in or not."
good,"Company was managed by team that was collaborative and supportive. Goals were set and had good plans to achieve them. Culture was one of success only, no room for failure."
good,"It's a good place to work if you have little children or grandchildren.  The clothes are nice and a good quality. "
good,"I had a great experience working as a part-time supervisor. I learned a lot about customer service, and was lucky to have the opportunity. The worst part about the job was keeping shoplifters away."
good,every friendly place. we learn new skills everyday. my managers are wonderful. the most enjoyable part is seeing my customers happy.
good,Its an easy job but the location i was at had really bad management. I fee like overall the management is bad starting at with the district managers
good,With a two year old at home I have been pleased with the part-time hours and flexible work schedule. Management team is upbeat and personable. I have enjoyed my time at Carter's thus far.
good,Enjoyed and had fun working with everyone in Carter's. Saw lots of beautiful clothing for babies. Everyone was very helpful and everyone did there job.
good,"work was great and pretty laid back. had to load trucks but it was pretty simple. mangers were awesome, would love to work with them again. Hardest part of the job was live loads. live loads have to be finished in a certain amount of time and if you couldn't find the boxes then it could be pretty stressful"
good,"Fast pace environment "
good,This was one of my favorite jobs! Highly recommended for someone with great social skills.Friendly environment.Great staff as well.
good,I loved working at Carters Retail Inc. the workers there made me feel welcome since day one. Even though the retail side of it was a hand full. I loved interacting with the kids and adults.
good,"Carter's is a great work environment if you like being around babies & kids all the time. Also depending on the Store manager some are there to help you succeed & help you grow. I got hired as a sales associate & within 9 months I got promoted to Supervisor! The work place is awesome, my co workers are great & management team is perfect. Carter's to me has been like a second home. Yeah the only bad thing is that it doesn't offer benefits, that's only if you're full time which is only Assistant Manager & Store Manager positions. Other than that, part timers can't exceed 25 hours a week. Pay is good, reading some of the other reviews I say pay rate is all depending on your location. Overall Carter's is a great work environment, well for me it is. I'm happy to say I'm still currently working at Carters."
good,should make the locations large and more staff available I like the environment that I was located in wish there were more spreaded out threw out the Chicago area
good,Friendly environment and Supportive management. Collaborative work culture. Best of breed technology landscape. Room to improve on investment in employees and training.
good,"Nice place to work, good benefits, company should build within more instead.  I think all companies should build with in."
good,Supportive management and great team work. A lot of emphasis on operational and policy follow up. A lot of multi tasking and delegation needed.
good,"A typical day at Carters involves helping customers find what they are looking for and putting out new or current merchandise. As well as working with co-workers to prevent shoplifting. "
good,"*A typical day is full of laughter and fun wit coworkers ,which made the day go by so much faster .."
good,"its a good place to work at, the schedule is the worst thing, they have you up to midnight or more working on a weekday, and up to 11 pm on weekends."
good,"Happy place to work, with children. Quality of clothes is amazing! great prices. They do not pay as well as other stores but make up for that in other areas."
good,"The job itself here is easy. I caught on pretty fast. The management there was okay they had their favorites of course. My co-workers we very nice and were willing to work with you. The hardest part of the job was walking all the isle up and down for 8 hours because they were long isle with a lot of items to pick, but I'm always determined and willing to get the job done whatever it takes"
good,"I absolutely loved working at Carters. My main reason why I loved working at Carter's, because of the passion I have working with kids. So whenever the parents would come in, I would automatically get to know the kids as well as the parents. I really loved when the pregnant women would come in, have no clue what to get because it was their first. The parents loved me because I was so helpful and got to know the customers. However, I had to leave due to the short hours but if it wasn't for the hours, honestly I would of stayed."
good,"Easy going job, very mellow and puts you in a great mood being around all the small little baby clothes. loved the atmosphere and great customers."
good,"stock stock stock "
good,"I picked this job up as something extra because my other job wasn't really giving me enough hours to keep up with my bills. They're very good at working with scheduling, the hours are nice and short which I love, but if you need something to help cover bills and what not this isn't the job for you. But, I love the atmosphere and my co-workers! There really isn't anything hard about the job, you go, give your best customer service and leave. The most enjoyable part is seeing the different cultures, and babies come through. It's fun getting to work with everyone!"
good,"The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Carters Oshkosh was my first retail job and I feel I gained many valuable skills, such as merchandising and processing credit and cash returns and transactions. I really enjoyed being able to work hands on with the customers."
good,Working at Carters' brought a smile to my face everyday. The children that used to come in with their parents were always fun to be around. Loved the products.
good,Very busy and fast pace environment. Good management.  Nice people.
good,its a great place to work at good hours. not great supervisors
good,Carter's had great employees that conveyed a sense of safety and positivity.
good,Everyone worked together and made even the hardest part of the job (stocking) more fun!
good,"With retail there is never a dull moment. It's all about being able to multi task while never losing focus on customers. Customer service is always my number one priority. There is always much to do in retail between floor moves, price changes and shipment. Making sure that the staff is working together as one to accomplish the tasks for the day. I have learned to plan and prioritize according to come out with the best possible outcome for the company. I have worked with most of the associates for many years and I have watched them grow and develop their talent. I take pride in knowing that I have helped them in that process by always being a mentor and coach along the way. I am and very positive person who loves to motivate."
good,I scan clothes out the boxes to make sure the prize is right on them learn the computer and got no a lots or peoples
good,"A typical day at work is helping customers find what they need which is also the most enjoyable part of the job because you get to see the customer walk out satisfied. The hardest part of the job is not being able to find want the customer is needing and having to send them somewhere else.  My co-workers are great, we work together well as a team and all have a huge understanding of the product and store policies"
good,"A typical day starts early at AHA I review tha building operating systems, then do a tour of the building before employee enter the facility. I go to me dest ro review the tenants request and proceed to attend to the request, next I review the meeeting schedules and set room temperatures, then I dispatch work request to staff members and start  my PM request. Meet with my GM to review any request from the Executive staff. The most enjoyable part is the speak with staff member and AHA staff member. The building is older and have to go to budget meeting to explain that aging equimpment need to be replaced."
good,"A typical day of work would consist of our usual and new customers. Our usual customers were like family because you had the chance to see their family grow. I learned a lot about myself and also learned some helpful tips. My management team had their days where communication wasn't always 100 but when we were, we were unstoppable. The hardest part of the job was the lack of respect and communication given by a district manager. She never took the time to see how the team was doing she would just scold everyone and down talk. The most enjoyable part of the job had to be some of the customers and meet their newborn and becoming friends with them."
good,This is a great company to work for - we have great products to sell and great customers. It is definitely a job where you constantly stay busy and there's always something to do.
good,"a typical workday is gathering, sorting, discarding samples and items."
good,I was temporary help with the stock room during the busy season. I would come in and empty boxes onto racks to take out to the sales floor or would do back stock where I had to put the clothes on the shelves where they belonged in the right sizing order. I had great co-workers who helped me learn where things go and how to keep them organized.
good,I enjoy working on different things and this job provided just that.
good,In depth training programs for next level of succession for all employees. Resources abound to aid in the functions of everyday business practices. 
good,"I absolutely loved working at Carter's Babies and Kids. The management team was fantastic, as were the associates. The customer base was also awesome. I saw babies go from small bump to newborn to toddler in my time at Carter's. I truly got to know some of the customers and it made it that much more enjoyable. Directions from corporate were set with clear guidelines so I always knew what was expected of me. While I was at Carter's, I was assigned as head of marketing and merchandising. Though it was a challenge at first, it allowed me to grow vastly as a manager."
good,"It was a nice place to work.  I stayed for 16 years.  The company is growing leaps and bounds, so it's definitely fast-paced."
good,Got along with everyone and they were all very nice. Learned about how stores make their money and what they have to go through to have a good day in sales.
good,"A typical day at Carters would be to service customers, review what the sales goal would be for the day and come up with a plan to achieve that goal, greet customers with the current promotions, suggest additional items at the cash wrap desk, sigh up customers for future promotions, put out new merchandise and fill in sizes that have been sold and maintain the stores appearance"
good,I have worked here for a few months now. The job is fun and the people I work with are very nice and make it fun to come to work. But again I need more hours..
good,Performed basic retail duties. Learned a lot about customer service and how the retail world works. The staff worked very cohesively and overall it was a very good place to gain work experience at.
good,Meet and greet parents at the door as i come in for m shift. I learned much things about baby clothes. my manage was awsome she taught me alot i was very greatfull for her. my co workers wasnt so nice but i manage to get by. Hardest part of the job was dealing with the baby crying all the time lol it was crazing. Most important part of the job was meeting all the new people and babies also listening to the fathers and there stories.
good,Customers come in with lots of joy for children and have fun shopping. I enjoy making their experience as pleasant as possible.
good,Typica work day was to come in prepared to keep sales floor organized and free flowing. Keeping the clothing and accessories in the proper places.
good,"Carter's was a great place to work. I enjoyed the feedback I received when I did a good job,"
good,Learned alot about warehouse duties. Enjoyed working in the warehouse.
good,i learned alot through this company for how long i have been apart of it. They are a growing company and trying to better their employees to help their customers out.
good,It was a good experience working there. There was one manager who would outcast me and have me do the dirty work as other employees were.on their phones or talking to one another without getting anything done.
good,"Working as an Assistant Store Manager at Carters I help with planning schedules and delegating assignments to meet coverage and service demands.] I rotate merchandise and displays to feature new products and promotions. I assisted team members with delivering friendly, knowledgeable service by applying proactive monitoring and corrective action strategies. I open and close the store and assist  with training and managing associates in customer service and sales techniques. Over all Carters and Oshkosh is a good company to work for."
good,I learned alot their. First  time working at a warehouse and I enjoyed it. The hardest thing about the job is meeting production daily. I enjoy working their  People was friendly and easy to work with.
good,"It was a good job to work at very fast paced .. sometimes you had good and bad days but overall very great company. "
good,"Carters is a wonderful company to work for, especially if its your first job or for teens looking for something part time. Its pretty easy to maintain and not too many task to handle at once. I loved the overall experience and thw customers I encountered. My only issue was with the manager"
good,"Job was good, hours weren't very steady and management could improve on their communication skills with one another and employess. They weren't always as professional and organized as they should be."
good,"Carter‚Äôs is a place everyone loves to shop at for their kids so it is fast paced but friendly. Trained and shown majority of the stuff and what needs to be done. "
good,This is a fun and easy place to work if you are looking for a job as a teenager. This job can be fairly slow or very fast paced during holiday seasons.
good,"Hard to believe, but Carter's is one of the only places I could say the company cares for its workers. They are always raising the bar when it comes to investing in people."
good,"Very credible company with a lot of history and a lot of talented and loyal employees. Incentives and benefits are great: ample PTO and healthcare, 401K, etc."
good,"although the work was not hard, the management is was made it easy however cutting hours for coast efficiently is what I didn't find appealing and was the reason for leaving."
good,"Working at Carter's was a great experience, it gave you the opportunity to meet and interact with many people daily, you build relationships daily. Overall, Carter's is a very rewarding job to work at, there's growth in the company and great for any high school/college student who wants steady income and career growth."
good,Everyone knew the promotions and given great information about what was going on within the company. Very family oriented work environment. Hardest part of the job was dealing with disrespectful customers. The job overall was enjoyable. But they hired too many people and the store was unable to give enough hours to it's original employees.
good,Typical job.  Relaxed environment and structure and processes in place made it a good place to work.  My position was outsourced and coincidentally I was being recruited by my current employer at that time.  So Lease Admin is now outsourced at Carter's
good,A typical day at work is a fast moving environment with thousands of people from all walks of live almost everyone is cool except of the management team.
good,This was a great starting job for me. It really helped me get my foot out the door with wanting to be in retail. I helped open 2 stores and worked at a total of 4. This company gave me the experience I needed to seek bigger and better things.
good,"A typical day at Carter's consists of recovering the store while greeting and helping customers. At my store, I felt like I was doing most of the works when it was just a manager and me. There is daily shipment so we would be working on the boxes and getting everything out, even if it didn't fit we would make it fit. There is also ringing up customers and signing them up for the rewarding moments which is a point system. The manager would always push us to keep signing people up if we don't get a limit our hours were cut dramatically. "
good,It‚Äôs a fun job you can interact with your customers tell them about the discount we have. also we have freight every day Monday to Friday at least 10+ boxes replenish and new product. I think y‚Äôall will love to work at carter‚Äôs.
good,I work at Cater's through temp. It was a good job to have. I scanned baby clothes in the computer. By it being temp it was a temporary assignment. I wish it would have lasted longer but after peek season work gets slow.
good,"If you're looking for a first job or a few extra hours in the evenings and on weekends to make some extra cash, this is a great place to work.  I would not recommend it as a career, however, unless retail is your passion - there are very little opportunities for advancement, and decent raises are surprisingly rare no matter your work ethic and success at the job."
good,"Carter's in a great place to work. The work life balance is not great if you have children, but you could manage. Peak season is stressful, so be prepared."
good,Great job to improve your customer service and learn a lot about inventory and stocks. Great pay as well when I was working there. Management a bit off.
good,When I worked there the store manager did nothing but sit in the back office. She didn't even know how to work the cash register. The company itself was very caring and I loved the upper management.
good,"Its very fast paced its a great job to learn how to multi task. i gained experience in customer service and overall basic retail knowledge. For management i learned how to over come obstacles with scheduling and other employees. Overall the job is very easy you just have to make sure you are good at multi tasking, and stay on top of everything."
good,management needs to be more open to job growth within their associates when it comes to a higher position opening up rather hiring from the outside. Management needs to have the sense they believe and intrust their associates growing and going further in the company
good,I have been working at Carter's for almost 5 years this May 2017. A typical day is working cashier and greeting customers. Restocking the floor throughout the day is done as well but the main focus is customer service. Hardest part of this job is being able to finish a project and helping customers all in your shift. Carter's is very flexible with my school schedule and understand not to schedule me during days I have had class.
good,"Try to find a job where your work and effort is rewarded. I feel like I am going no where in this company. I was one of their part time supervisors in the Northeast region and that region is the BEST to work for. However, when I came down to the Florida region (southeast), I am going no where. I have the HIGHEST Rewarding moments capture next to the Manager (100%) and I am going no where. I have experience in management, and they had to bump me down to a sales associate because they didnt have the hours for me to stay in management. They have had multiple promotions go through and I wasn't one of them. TOO MUCH FAVORABILITY."
good,"Carters was a good place to work, some what organized makes the job easier to do. I would say it was too cliquey though when everyone speaks spanish and you do not you can feel left out of the conversation. Also I did not sign up tp clean bathrooms just not my thing. I also disliked the on call stuff I mean they are not busy enough for that extra drama of being a call in"
good,"A typical day at work were sometimes slow and sometimes busy. We would get around 20 boxes of shipment of day, but the crew that we had, we all made sure we got it done in a timely manner. I was apart of the management so one of the hardest parts were trying to make our sales goal on a slow day. The most enjoyable was helping expecting parents shop for their new bundle of joy."
good,"Great place to work, Learned a lot about the register, Management was a little messy but everyone got along well, Job was pretty easy"
good,I worked part-time and was not there very long but the staff was very welcoming and willing to teach. There wasn't much that I did not like about the company but if I have to give a con it would have to be management.
good,"Loved the culture and actual work, did not appreciate the compensation and slim chance of promotion or advancement within."
good,Carter's its a very stable company to work for. Pay and Benefits are decent. Career Advancemnt can be a little slow and the work/life balance is all that great.
good,It was an easy job and customers were usually happy and outgoing. I loved going to work.
good,The best part about working here is having hope everyday you come in. The place and people make you happy no matter how busy or hectic work gets. Seeing babies and kids made work the most enjoyable throughout your shift.
good,A typical day was satisfying customers with their shopping needs.
good,"I enjoy working at my job, everyday I learn something new. My job is to greet customers, help them find their items on the sales floor or in stock room. I ring their merchandise up take their personal information for PCP ratings, talk about promotions and discounts and how to get them. I love interacting with my customers that's the easy part, but it's replenishing the store that can be difficult at times and recovering lost items and damages, but as a TEAM we always make it through.The management department are great leaders we couldn't do it without them ."
good,"Typical day at work: Fun and exciting working with the families."
good,Its a nice place to work. My co-workers were nice and friendly. The hardest part of the job was climbing the ladders. My manager was a very friendly and thoughtful person.
good,"a fast pace warehouse. With good people working with you. i learned how to use a RF scan gun. they have nice co-worker, It is not a hard job in the warehouse."
good,"I enjoyed this company. I picked garments and placed them on racks, operated a computer to change quantity of garments that had been packed.Management was okay.I loved my co workers. They were very helpful. The job was not hard at all. The most enjoyable part was working together as a team."
good,"My typical day at work is 8 hr shifts 5 days a week. When I get to work I do paper work from previous day, I do open checklist which consist of opening registers counting money and paper work. When we open the main focus is customer service and task are second. My management team is amazing we all work together so we can get our jobs done. The most enjoyable part of my day is making the customers happy."
good,The enjoyable part is working with the kids. Working with this company has been good.
good,Culture is great here - if you are out to make friends this is the place to work. Everyone is so nice and genuinely interested in your development and growth.
good,Good job far distance from where I live . Could have better pay to compensate for distance. Friendly management and crew members. Little to no down time. Fast paced
good,I missed the interview because I had a family emergency but I feel I deserve another chance at the interview it seems like a fun place to work full time I was there last year thru a temp service and they let me go the day after Christmas management was awesome friendly people.
good,"New tasks and responsibilities are constantly being added with no additional compensation or incentive. Fast paced work, without enough staff & lots to complete while expected to have exceptional customer service"
good,Very collaborative and mostly friendly workplace with a lot of meetings and buy-in to move forward. Company always looking at ways to improve for success.
good,"I very much enjoyed working for the company for the short amount of time that I did. The company as a whole was very welcoming and supportive. Unfortunately as with any job, there are people who were focused more on their personal life then the job requirements."
good,Carters is a very organized company and the co workers and high bosses are very respectful. Our hours and quite flexible and very helpful for my daily schedules.
good,"I Carter's was a good place  to work . I the culture there was good . Learning I had a lot of that  , u learned different departments in  the business. My retail when up and working in a warehouse"
good,great first job. you love babies apply. The good thing is they give you 3 hr shifts at first then you increase. Nice place to work. Shipment is heavy but its a clothing store.
good,"This is a great job for anyone who enjoys being around children. A typical day would including cleaning up the store, helping customers and folding clothes to make sure the store stays up to expectations."
good,There were lots of things I learned here. I loved the atmosphere and it was a great place to work. I enjoyed working with a diverse group of people and loved the ability to provide excellent customer service!
good,"I enjoy working here although my store was a neighbor hood one. So there we times where I didn‚Äôt get a lot of hours in the week. This is my first ever job, and I give it a thumbs up!"
good,"Would recommend to anyone who desires work/life balance, never worked over 40 hours in two years. Company is continuing to grow and evolve so there are a lot of ongoing changes but all good things!"
good,Applicable to my specific store & management but communication was sorely lacking. Elements of professionalism and being non biased as well occurred..
good,"it is sometimes quick paced and fun while other time it is demanding and stressful. You can easily move up and management is supportive of that, and helpful when you do move up."
good,"I loved working at carters it was a very peaceful environment, every customer that would come in with their baby or toddler had a smile on their face every time I would greet them employees were fun to work with as well"
good,I enjoyed working there with all the baby clothes and my manager was great. I was in charge of the presentation of the store as well as many others. They are flexible with hours.
good,"had great products, upper management was from NY and not local, only had 1 local store. The benefits for health were good but salary was not competitive."
good,"There are typical days for managers of 8 hours or more, and we are constantly working on shipment and floor sets to make sure the store is always up to policies. We move fast and efficiently."
good,If you enjoy doing retail and have young children then this is a good place for you because as you're helping customers you can also see what new gear is in for the season and you also get discounts.
good,"I worked seasonal / part time. Its easy work. I was pregnant so I chose to work part time for the extra money. Job is really easy, you  just run the register and learn the computer and clean and sort through clothes."
good,"This job is for the fittest employees emotional, and mentally. A typical day at work is dedicated to customer call volume which is not good if you are in a different department and you pulled from doing what you were promoted or hired to do every week. Sometimes would be fine, but the pulling tends to happen everyday. Management is supportive. The most enjoyable part of the job is eating, every week there is some meal, refueling station, or cookout."
good,"Great people but the pay is just above minimum wage. Typically, the customers are great and being around kids makes the store have a lot of energy but if a family comes in and just let's their children do whatever you are not allowed to do anything which is frustrating."
good,everyday would start with a manager telling me about how the day has gone so far and what deals we are having then she would give me a few tasks i would have to have done by the end of the night. customers are always number one priority and making sure they get everything they need and if they cant find what they are looking for then i would tell them where i think they will be able to find something like what they are looking for.
good,I personally worked a night shift in the warehouse and it was quite hard to balance Day family life with night work life. But the environment was decent. My position didn't require heavy lifting but it was a lot of walking and standing time. The pay was decent for the work
good,"A typical day at work consisted of opening up the store, opening registers and continue with paperwork and reading emails; before opening the store we would get as much merchandise as possible to the sales floor; associates would help with bin rotation and bar rotations to fill the floor with as much merchandise as possible; as one of the assistant managers for Carters I learned that workload wasn't distributed evenly but that everybody would pull their weight to make it easier on the other manager, which made this one of the most enjoyable part of the job; there was also room for learning to build yourself up for possible promotions or job advancements; the hardest part of my job was working holidays, which made it difficult to be present at family events and celebrations."
good,I felt welcomed by other employees and management when I started working here. They answered any questions I had and were patient with me while I learned.
good,I enjoyed working at Carters. My co-workers were extremely friendly and welcoming to me. My manager was always flexible with my schedule and helped me whenever I had questions.
good,"Working at Carters is like being part of a family; they are kind, loyal and give you opportunity to grow and learn. A typical day on the job varied depending on what was coming up on the calendar, for the most part I would cover reception duties when the receptionist was out or on vacation and handle all inquiries regarding seminars."
good,This is a great company to work for and they make great clothes for children. Great culture combined with an awesome team.
good,Working at Carter's was a great experience with future and present moms. Meeting mothers of multiples to mothers of just one. I had a great time working there with nothing but smiling baby faces everywhere!
good,"Working at Carters in the Woodbury Commons Outlet was an enjoyable experience. I learned how to conduct great customer service with their Hi-Five plan. Management was good most of the time. They are very understanding when it comes to certain situations. My co-workers were always fun to be around. It is always great to have a fun yet professional work environment. A typical day at work was me on the sales floor making sure everyone was being helped, replenishing and making sure the sales floor was clean, and of course making sales. Hardest part of the job was getting use to the long hours but that was easily manageable. Most enjoyable part was working with and helping the customers."
good,just has a lot of theft which brings down the morale of the store. quality of product is amazing and lasts a long time. had a lot of valued customers who shop there and makes it even more enjoyable.
good,"Most of the time I do a lot of merchandizing, customer service and recover.  Making sure that everything is in the right place. Keeping the store as tidy and productive as possible."
good,"Awesome co-worker and manager! You learn some great skills and you get to speak to new parents and interact with children!"
good,Very productive place to work that contains a lot of room for opportunity in your personal career. If you are looking to become a CPA this is a great company to start your foundation.
good,It was a very nice place to work with and the management was very nice.
good,I enjoyed working because it was consistent and great environment.
good,"If you're good with customers, then this is a pretty easy and fun job. It was my first job and I learned a lot about work ethic and to always put a customer's needs first. The managers here are easy to talk to and will always work with you on scheduling and needs. Co-workers are very friendly. It is very enjoyable to see people excited to buy things for new babies."
good,"Overall, I have had a great experience with Carter's. I am very glad I chose to work with them directly out of college. A first job in your major is a huge step to take for a college grad and I was very fortunate to be able to find a home."
good,"Carter's was a great, laid back company to work for. I LOVED my management, and a typical day, although busy, was never boring and always fun. I found that any question I had was always answered and if I wanted to be trained in any area, management would make it happen. Co workers were great as well, which made it easy to want to get up for work in the morning! My only problem with the company was that there was not very many opportunities to move up to a higher position."
good,"Each day there is always something different to do and I love staying busy. When I am asked to get a certain task done, I finished the task and more. I like doing more than what is asked of me because I do not want the next shift having so much workload on them so I strive to do all that I can. I also like to make the managers proud of my work. I make planners each week and assign task to associates that needs to be done. My DOR is execution so I make sure all audits are completed and all product is on the floor and organized. I have learned a lot in the position that I am in and dealing with a heavy workload. I love all of my co-workers and learn from them every day and it makes me a better supervisor. I enjoy everything about my job it would be hard to pick one specific thing but I enjoy receiving new product and moving walls between old and new merchandise."
good,"It was a pretty easy job. I would walk in, say hi to everyone, and ask my manager what i was doing. He would usually have me check stock first. After that I would walk around and make sure costumers were satisfied. The management was great. So were the co-workers. I enjoyed helping people through my time being there."
good,Being a team member for Carters Inc. was great pretty easy work environment and lots of cute little visitors everyday!!
good,I worked at Cater Services as a fill in job to not only help myself but
good,"Experienced Multi store leader of high volume markets. Passionate brand focused, results driven through developing talent and setting high expectations. Responsible for the opening multiple brands such as Gap, Gap Outlet, Gap Body, Banana Republic, Carter‚Äôs and OshKosh. Extensive knowledge of Outlet business, high velocity product output, and commission's based environment in a high customer service environment. Extensive knowledge of Puerto Rico and Florida markets. Responsible in overseeing Puerto Rico, district. People development expertise creating a legacy of talent and promoting leaders."
good,"Clocked in and jumped right onto the regaster. When noone was checking out I would look at the merchandise on the floor and see what needs to be replenished. Help custumers with questions and finding what they are looking for. Also, I would straighten up the floor and make sure the merchandise is where it should be."
good,"Store would be busy ever Thursday thru Sunday, and were giving enough hours to pay for schooling, gas, rent, etc. I had to take a break for school and moved back to Bullhead."
good,Nice place to work however the supervisor team requires a lot of work from the management team. Usually the team is really nice and enjoyable to work with. I had a great time working there.
good,"Learned many things including opening and closing procedures, floor planning, inventory, and customer relations."
good,"I was only employed as a seasonal sales associate at Carters. "
good,This is not a bad job. I worked 12 hours and it was rough. It was busy most of the time and when peak season came it was mandatory overtime which was good money but left you exhausted.
good,Overall I enjoyed working for this company. They had a great team and they ran things in an organized fashion. I enjoyed the time I was there I just needed to find a better opportunity. It‚Äôs a good job if you are available on the weekends.
good,"The overall workers and managers make working there great, they really try to understand and connect with you, to better optimize performance for the store and for you."
good,Great environment and lovely coworkers. There are changes being made and training being introduced that seems promising enough to combat some issues the company has been encountering.
good,"worked there for a few months was a good place to work but management was not good, Felt like the manager did not treat the staff well we would get yelled at alot but she did not last long there. Assistant manager and other staff were great!"
good,"Confidently and proactively helps resolve issues for customers and can balance a number of customers in a busy retail environment. "
good,"Easy job to do. Hours very, if units and transactions aren't met in sales they give your store less payroll which mean less shifts for you which means less money. Something people can't control."
good,I enjoyed my time as a seasonal employee. I did not have benefits or paid time off offered as a seasonal employee. They have a really big breakroom with plenty of shelves for storage.
good,Working with great people. Helping customers find what they are looking for. Using the register for checkouts and inventory lookups and inventory prices.
good,"The perks of working for this company is great overall, but there is always room for improvement within both the company and it‚Äôs policies, the people they have serving for them."
good,"Not enough head count, always pulled in a dozen top priority directions, great management and culture. Always growing and great to be part of a winning team."
good,I enjoy working at Carter‚Äôs part time.  It‚Äôs a place where I can go and go a job and get a little break from Mom life.  I put my head down and I work.  It doesn‚Äôt require a whole lot of thinking as a lot of it is routine.  The schedule is flexible and I‚Äôve had to change it many times with no issue.
good,"The management at the Mebane location is great! It was a fun place to work and advancement opportunities are available. The customers were a lot of fun, and the employees are all very upbeat and positive. I enjoyed my time there and only left because we moved out of area."
good,I liked working there as a teenager. They were extremely flexible with my high school schedule even while involved in sports (baseball). I am grateful for the opportunity there.
good,"I loved all the people I worked with."
good,I love the Culture that surrounds Carters and the work life balance it provides.  It truly know what its customers wants and needs are and really makes sure thats the environment the stores and teams creates
good,"As a Visual manager, you wear different hats. Visuals isn't the only thing you'll focus on. You are also helping the store manager come up with plans to beat LY sales, hiring, schedule, stock, payroll, training, developing, grass root. As visual manager you'll have to have an open availability and must be ready to come into work when DM ask you to come in. Schedule isn't flexible and might get one weekend off a month. You are required to work over nights and no down time during the holidays."
good,The kids that come in can be very entertaining and adorable. The parents that come in are not so fun. Management is a little too full of themselves...
good,"The carter's I work at is amazing. My coworkers are friendly, management is understanding and reasonable, the customers are not too rude. Overall, a great place to work."
good,Carter's is a great place to work..very family oriented.  There are reasons this company is one of the top to work for but does not always adhere to all.
good,"Worked here when I was in high school. 4 hour shifts in the evenings during the week, and 6-8 shifts typically on  the weekends. The job wasn't super demanding, but inventory and floor sets could be very time consuming."
good,Carters is a family place to shop and work at. I enjoy going to work everyday and it makes me happy when the customers are happy. Seeing everyone with a smile on their face puts a smile on my face. I've always wanted to be helpful and I've always wanted to take care of people and working at carters gave me a great first experience.
good,"Love working at Carters fun and love the environment, for me the most enjoyable part of my job is working on shipment and talking to customers. I've learned a lot of new stuff that i thought i would never learn :)"
good,"Clearly very organized as far a company policies go. A day on the job was straight forward and clear on what needed to be done and the tools to execute the job were easily found."
good,"fun, easy going place to work"
good,"Carters was easy to work at but you stood around a lot with nothing to do. Easily got bored. Also not enough hours, paychecks weren't great. I got let go because they didn't tell me when my hours were and never showed me the schedule. I should have asked though. Wouldn't work there again."
good,"Great part-time job. Not a ton of room for growth, but there can be some if you're a really hard worker. Associates didn't get a lot of hours. Pay was kind of low for retail. Only made $8 an hour for 3 and a half years before getting a substantial raise just prior to leaving the position. Typically not stressful, but when it got busy it could get kinda hectic. Loved my managers. Breaks were standard. Worked well with me while in school. Sometimes a bit catty between teen employees with gossip. Overall a pretty good place to work."
good,"Carters strives to sell the best product at the best price.  The take their time to develop the team, processes, and the product. Having enough payroll is a struggle in any company, but fortunately its not salary so managers are compensated for their time vs working as hard and long as needed for the lack of payroll."
good,"Fun, growing company to work for. Has many growth opportunities for anyone looking to expand their resume and job credentials. Great location and employees."
good,"I would open the store with the morning manager, count the bins in the stock room, pull merchandise out from the back, help with incoming stock, check out customers."
good,"A typical day requires communication with customers, restocking the store, receiving shipment, and answering any questions customers may have regarding the products."
good,I worked here for about 3 years. Management was not the greatest and it seemed like there was a new rule implemented every month. It was fun to see all of the cute baby clothes but it got boring if no customers were coming in. The pay was pretty standard for a retail minimum wage job. Great first job.
good,"The people there are very helpful and willing to help train people when needed. The management is very friendly and helpful as well as organized. The atmosphere in the store is very bright and fun. The hardest part of the job is remembering where everything goes and keeping everything on the floor organized. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to see kids all the time. A typical day at work consists of alternating between working the register and organizing the clothes out on the floor. It is a great job for anyone who wants to learn or continue working in retail. It is also a great job for anyone who loves kids. If you can not stand on your feet for a whole shift or you do not like kids or organizing, then this is not the job for you."
good,Great part-time position with a fun and friendly atmosphere. The management at the Carter's in the Boise Outlet Mall was one of the best I've ever had the pleasure of working with!
good,Was given responsibility of managing client accounts. On a daily basis I had several tasks to accomplish such as calling our different account holders to collect payment and managing each accounts. Great Co-workers. We had casual Fridays and company lunch once a week.
good,This is a Great place to work but the hours are very minimal. The shift lengths are also very minimal. Management is very friendly. The company even gives new/expectant moms a gift card.
good,My hardest part of being a supervisor was gaining the confidence to decline helping a customer or taking back product that was not able to be sold because it was washed or tampered with. Also dealing with LP. In the beginning of working as a supervisor I was very nervous to approach the situation but I quickly gained the confidence.
good,I love warehouse jobs. I love working there. Every one gets alone. Managers work with you. Every one works together. Its very in order. Every one is on the same page.
good,"Typical Work day is slow , I've learned how to deal with customers and how to multitasks and management is a little disorganized and My co workers their cool and there's really no hard part of the job and making people happy talking to people from different countries"
good,My job at carter's was very steady I was a sales associate and I loved my job because I get to interact with a lot of people and help them look for certain things for nice occasions. My team at work got along great no drama what so ever. But sadly I had to leave their because of a family emergency out of the country.
good,"Carters helped me with my speach towards other people i was very shy at first & all that went away thanks too them , my co-workers i loved working with they made me feel like they actually liked me being there"
good,"Fun place to work, people are great, customers are great. The work load can be very stressful at times not enough hours in the day"
good,"Great co-workers"
good,"The people you work with really become more like family, you work together as a team and help get the job done. Children clothing store get to see people shopping for new borns all the way to pre-teens"
good,"Carter's is a vibrant and innovative environment to be a part of. This is among the most knowledgeable groups I've had the pleasure to be a part of, with a high level of energy and engagement. Nonetheless, it is a demanding place, and very high pressure. Great experience to have, overall."
good,Working here was a privileged. Everyone was nice and very welcoming. What I've learned here was to be very fast moving and to multi-task. I wish i could have worked here longer but was only temporary.
good,this job is great when it comes to making your own hours however doing this job requires you to have thick skin. there are times you will have less than pleasurable experiences with customers and management. over all the dispatchers a pleasant and do their best. not all days and times are equal.
good,A fun fast paced environment that made you flexible in all areas of work. The only con of working is trying to get customers to sign up for coupons/rewards and being judged based on your sign up rate.
good,"Carter's is a great place to work. The employees are outstanding, but HR is out of control. Middle management is understanding, but the higher you go the worst it gets."
good,"If you like constantly being busy and akways having something to do then this is the perfect job for you. It is very fast paced and you have to know how to constantly be multitasking. The benefit are not good, but the staff and management are very friend and nice to work with."
good,Carter's is a great place to start off at entry level management. It is family orientated and helps you strengthens your weakness.
good,"Cleaning, Cashier, restocking"
good,"Typical workday is a standard 8 hour shift that can be anything from hectic and extremely busy to slow and allows for catching up on other missed tasks. Multiple shifts to accommodate different life schedules. Management at this location is great and strives for excellence and fairness. Most co-workers also strive to work their hardest as a sense of pride is important here. The workload can sometimes be overwhelming, however it can also be quite rewarding to accomplish a full busy day."
good,I have enjoyed working here this past year and have picked up a lot of new skills.  The people I have worked with have made working there enjoyable.
good,"while employed at carters i encountered many situations and gained more knowledge and more. since it being located at international drive serves its high population and fast pace environment in which i loved the most. the hardest part would be simultaneously assisting three or more customers at once, in which the majority of the time id refer my customer to another co worker. the most enjoyable part was   assisting the customers and making sure that they are satisfied and happy with a promising return to carters on international drive."
good,Carters Distribution was a job that always has an off season. There are periods when they work overtime constantly and then other periods when they aren't working but a day or two out of a week. The pay was not stable even with the unemployment benefits that were provided during the off days. The job that I was doing was pretty easy. Just pick clothing using a RF Scanner from different locations and put them into boxes that are on a belt.
good,When I first started working at Carters I loved it every single day. Great people and loved everyone. We were the only Carters in town so we were always busy. We all worked hard as a team and got the job done right. While working there the hardest part of my job was having a social life. I invested a lot of my time in Carters and I feel like it was taken for granted. I loved my employees but the company would expect so much from you but did not show the appreciation. The most enjoyable part about this job was that I saw little children everyday. Seeing all the children's clothes was fun because you could make relationships with customers that come in frequently while also watching their children grow up.
good,"Great company with fabulous employees who are passionate and work hard to ensure the company's success. Sadly, the company is relocating and closing this office."
good,"A good place to work ,relaxed atmosphere,sorry the place had to close due to government cutbacks as the service for the children was excellent."
good,"I would open the store which include counting the safe, and registers. I would then handle paper work that need to be completed and upon completion open the doors to the store. Upon every customer arrival I will greet and customer service them. Ask if they need help and help them in any way possible. I dont see any part of my job hard because it a great job and fun environment. The most enjoyable part of my day is putting a smile on the children faces while servicing their provider. I have learned management skills, customer service techniques, and computer skills such as Excel,Word."
good,"They allow room for growth,They‚Äôre very organized and help u in any areas that you may need help in.No question is a dumb question.This is a great company to work for.They cater to family on a budget by always having sales on clothing,They make every thing easy to shop by how well organized the stores are kept"
good,I was with the company for 16 years.  I watched the company grow and give many opportunities to those who were interested.  They were always striving to improve the employee and customer experience.
good,"Working at Carter‚Äôs was a good experience, since it was my first job I learned a lot about retail, I learned how to handle money, and how to work the floor. They worked with your schedule, which was great."
good,Very fast paced heavy workload and nice work home life balance. No day is typical new things everyday. Love the staff. Can move up if motivated and willing to relocate
good,"I love working at carters! all of my coworkers are so nice and easy to get along with, it‚Äôs an easy job but unfortunately as a part time employee I barely get hours.. Only 4-8 hrs a week."
good,Carter's a good place to work it just you're not guaranteed your 40 hours if they can guarantee for the hours then Carter's will be an awesome place but other than that you don't get your 40 hours
good,I packed and picked plus other things for things while I was there it was a nice opportunity just the distens to get there was kinda harder even while driving
good,"I work as a Quality Technician and I loved it. I am already a person that's detailed so this was a perfect job for me."
good,Great staff. Typically all female. Not much cashier training but you eventually get the hang of it. Relaxed clothing but business casual in a sense. Easy tasks and flexible hours
good,I really enjoyed working here they were willing to train me for the management position at 16years old and it tought me alot from attendence to scheduling to displays and inventory
good,"Typical daily work requires you to be Consistent, Collaborative and Productive. Everyone clicks in making sure you're delivering a satisfied customer service. It's a fun working environment. It can be stressful sometimes especially on weekends but this is where Consistency and focus comes in. Manager was great; very social and fun to work with. Highly recommend it if you're a college or high school student looking to make some bucks."
good,Oshkosh was first job I went in with fresh eyes. My co workers and managers was friendly towards me. The pay was good at $9.00 an hour and we had a 30 minute lunch break than a 15 minute break if you had a full time position in the store. The only down part was not being bilingual because it was located in tourist destination and most customers spoke Spanish or  Portuguese. But other than that it was an ok job
good,This job has a fun environment and the staff is always friendly. Keeps you busy and is a great job if you like interacting with customers. Flexible hours but you don‚Äôt get many hours per week.
good,"Good work place, fun and interactive. Folding clothes gets old and there is little pay for the customer attitudes and having to deal with the stealing that goes on. Co-workers were amazing but it is all about the relationships you establish. Carter's was not suitable for my lifestyle and the money I made there was not suitable for the cost of living in my area."
good,Very fast paced and good people to work with in the stores. Strong ethical culture that is customer focused. Most challenging was the freight process and completing it in a timely manner.
good,"Carters was a fun job.  The clothes are good quality and cute.  There is a LARGE work load, so if you are looking for a place to just skate by then this isn't the place for you.  There is always shipment and markdowns and visual changes that take a lot of time."
good,Buen ambiente laboral y con capacidad de ense√±anza a nuevas personas para integraci√≥n de su equipo
good,The job itself is fun and when busy makes the day go by really quickly. The other employees are good people who are eager to help new employees out. Everyone in management is excellent to talk to and make the working environment all the better.
good,"Lots of super cute baby clothes to work with. Carter's is a very relaxed work environment, with the main focus being helping parents find clothing for their children."
good,"It is an okay environment some of the employees were lazy and ratchet ,but other than that a good place to work.  I really enjoyed that they gave me the opportunity to choose what position. Although, I regret choosing picker/ packer because you have to stand for hours and my feet were in excruciating pain. If you are going to work there I suggest to work in a place that involves a lot of movement."
good,"Carters is a great place to work when you have a great team. For the most part, schedules and hours are very flexible, however they offer minimal hours unless your a manager or assistant. Career growth is very slow and usually play based on a favoritism and not as much on experience and job performance. The pay rates are not sufficient enough. "
good,"I love working for Carters, the only thing I dislike is how little they pay and how they give you very little hours. It's not the location that's the problem but the company and the DM that oversees the DFW locations."
good,Newly formed 501C3 non-profit for addiction therapy services. Dedicated founder instilled with the ethic to make a difference in the lives of those facing addiction issues.
good,"The company is pretty awesome to work for, but i am not okay with their absence policy. It‚Äôs extremely unrealistic for day to day life. Management is everything with this company. Luckily my managers have been pretty good, however there is a lot of come and go with managers and assistant managers. Our store in particular has needed a lot of extra help from other local Carter‚Äôs to even just stay afloat. Some of them are awesome and some of them suck. I think the district managers need to take better care in selecting the managers for the stores because things can get really bad if there‚Äôs the wrong manager. I was offered a higher position within only two months of working there. If you do your job and show that you care about it your manager will give you adequate hours and opportunities for advancement. I genuinely enjoy the customers that shop with us and i love helping them."
good,"Fun and enjoyable experience, Fast past retail, there would be times where it was slow but otherwise it was a good experience working with them fore the little amount of time I got to work for that company."
good,"Les journ√©es de travail sont souvent productives. Il y a plusieurs clients qui magasine dans le magasin. Parfois, il y a des clients plus o√π moins agr√©ables, mais tout de m√™me le travail continu."
good,"Very strict rules"
good,It was a good place to work required to work Holidays because of type of business sometimes employees didnt accept that It was Mandatory Benifit were excellant mangement was poor new company in area Great break area work procedure wasnt the best
good,"My day mostly consisted of replenishing the floor and accommodating the floor for stock flow. Gave great Customer service, sold merchandise and rang up customers."
good,"Carters is a great company to work for with great benefits and discounts,lots of opportunity for growth.The customers are great the environment is also good.I love working with the customers and with the new parents finding all the things they will need to be new parents."
good,"Very static job, no room for promotion from within. Hectic inconsistent scheduling, no weekends off, minimal pay increases after 6 months and 1 year marks."
good,"Working at Carters helped me grow as a person because i learned how to work in a team environment. Also, I gained customer experience by dealing with various situations."
good,The workers are very professional and nice. They make sure everything is in order to make the store run efficiently. Work hours are good. There is always something to do around the store.
good,It is a fun job. I enjoyed it even if it was a seasonal (temp) job. The people are so nice and will train you quickly and correctly so you know how to correctly open and close the store.
good,"I started working there sophomore year of high school and quit senior year when my schedule got busy. Easy job, but management was always changing, and I quit because the manager would not work with my schedule."
good,I had a routine that was respected. I had a general task list and would ensure its completion. My work spoke for me and it was sufficient.
good,"A typical day at work was started with positive feedback and positive criticism as well as the preparation for a day`s work ahead. Smiling clients arrive and we help them with anything they need from sizes, colors, and fashion advice."
good,This was an awesome place to work with good people. They will teach someone who doesn't know about the job and turn that man into someone they can rely on.
good,"Job was great when the store was busy, during the dead hours you as an employee had to wander around aimlessly in your zone unable to be stationary even if there were no customers in the store. When customers entered your zone you approached them with a hello and see if there is anything you could help them with, if not you leave them be and come back in 5-10 minutes or if you see that a certain item has caught their attention, if your customer wants to purchase we would check if there was anyone at cash to help them or a line up that could be shortened by having both tills going simultaneously, if there is no one at cash we would attend to our customer from start to finish."
good,"A pretty fun gig that consists mainly of folding tiny clothes and scanning shelves for misplaced toys. The managers are all super helpful and nice, and the store is so small it doesn't take long to organize at all."
good,"A typical day at work is with less customer,if no customer its very hard."
good,Carters is a very fun place to work especially as a mom being able to see all the new clothes. All the employees work hard and all the managers will jump right into working with their hands when needed.
good,My job there was a cashier and backstock. I would back stock when no customers were there. I enjoyed the kids that came in as well as the assisting customers with there kids fashions.
good,"Amazing people to work with, very polite and nice to everyone that walked in the business. I learned great organization and filing skills, communication skills, and client management. My co-workers were very helpful and kind, always helped me with any questions that I had and assisted in any help that I needed."
good,"Although I liked this job it was not my favorite. A work day usually included, folding clothes, cashier and customer service, and promoting sales. the people were friendly but the employees were very prone to gossiping and making others feel less than. It was not a healthy environment for me at the moment. But overall it was a fun place to work at."
good,"There are days when it is busy and business is good. Coworkers are friendly and so are the managers. However, there are no benefits and hours are short sometimes. The hardest part of this job is getting hours. I loved working with my coworkers they were friendly and we always had fun working. i learned excellent customer service skills and dealing with the register."
good,Great environment to work in. The people are great and very helpful.  I enjoyed my time working with this company.Overall a good place to work.
good,"I thoroughly enjoy my job at Carters and Oshkosh. I get to see happy families, happy babies and children daily! How awesome is that? I have learned so much about product, and retail as well as children in my months working there. I have been part of the management for several months and I really enjoy it and never saw myself becoming an M.I.T. My co-workers are for the most part a blast to be around. We are able to work and have fun all at the same time. The hardest part of my job it most likely planograms, and stock days, I really can't complain though. The most enjoyable part of my job is definitely seeing babies come through the store, i absolutely love babies!"
good,"Greeting and assisting customers"
good,"Wonderful and fun place to work but had to close the store. A typical work day basically consisted of a lot of customer service, inventory and  making sure the customers are satisfied. At this company, I was able to advance. I began working as a cashier, then after a year or so, I was assist manager, then finally I became manager. The hardest part of the job for me, was managing different types of people. I loved the working with my coworkers and the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing a smile on the customers faces."
good,The company is good to work for and the rapid growth is beginning to shift focus from a scrappy entrepreneurial culture to one with much more (unnecessary) red tape and formality to get things done.
good,"Its a very nice place to work since they cater for the children, the managers are friendly fun but keeps u on your toes, they will praise u for your hard work corrects you when your wrong, the hours are poor but the pay is inbetween good and bad..the downside of it would be the hours and some of the customers b ut thats to be expected in any occupation. That said the co workers are very nice and friendly and they help each other out went its needed."
good,I have learned a lot working there.  I get along with all of my coworkers. I enjoy helping out in all the departments that I am cross trained in.
good,"This is a great company to work for. In total, I have been with Carter's/Oshkosh for 7 years. I went MIA for a short while and found my groove again with the company, shortly after returning from Europe. I love talking to people, helping our customers find that special something for their grandchildren, nephew, etc. We have a specific customer that comes to shop with us. Our clothing is high-quality and long-lasting. I absolutely love doing floor sets, giving the store a ""make-over"" when new seasons come around."
good,"I enjoyed my time there supervisors learn store manager work because they usually put their job off on you.. Some people that could be a complaint me personally I loved knowing I could do my bosses job and almost better than they could. You learn a lot about visual merchandising, As well as employee management its a great learning environment, If you allow it to teach you and are open to criticism this job is for you as for raises they didn't offer them unless you were promoted or once every year you get a review. You do receive incentives management and employees. I would totally work there again."
good,The job isn't hard or that demanding.  The warehouse is very big that is separated in two different buildings
good,"Enjoy working with customers coming in to shop for their children."
good,Unload trucks and packing clothes. The management was ok. Friendly co-workers. The hardest part was no a/c. The most enjoyable part was getting paid.
good,This place is ideal for a temporary job. There is a little laziness from the managers. I really liked helping the children and their parents pick out new outfits.
good,"2.2 Billion in overall sales, growing very fast and very good job security."
good,"A typical day at work includes many tasks such as product merchandising and employee supervision. Customer service and team work are everyday achievements. The management shows everyday excitement in achieving new goals for the store, and for executing excellent customer service and promoting team work amongst employees. My coworkers maintained positive outlooks and expectations for the store, and customer satisfaction was always first priority. The hardest part of the job was stock room merchandising and trying to keep the stock room constantly organized. The most enjoyable part was the constant interaction with the customers and employees."
good,"I would go in, clock in, go on register and help customers, organize the clothing, stock, pick up phone, greet customers. coworkers weren't very talkative. Hardest part of my job was watching for stolen items. I loved making conversation with customers."
good,"Can be stressful at times, but overall great place to work."
good,"In partnership with the Buyer and Planner, determined how much inventory of each item to allocate to 170 stores within Girls Playwear (GPW) product category ($100 million)."
good,"A typical day at work. We greet the customers help them find what they are looking for, put out new product, and help the customer at check out. I have learned our customers are very wonderful. All the people I work with are great."
good,the management is the best.
good,I enjoyed working for Carter's and was disappointed to leave due to a corporate restructuring taking place.
good,"The store is often always busy, so if you want fast pace, this is where to go. When receiving shipment, it is often in large amounts. A great management team"
good,When working at carters their top priority were the guest. I learned so much through my fellow employees. Everyone was friendly and outgoing. Would highly recommend if you need the job experience.
good,The work environment is friendly and I've made great friends while working here. The usual customers are friendly and understanding of the company policies. Children are always running around and sometimes make a mess of the store.
good,This job was a fun job to have throughout high school. I would come in for a few hours and work on the register and would face the clothes and items on the shelf. I learned a lot surprisingly about kids and how different companies do things and how to work systems.
good,"I loved the management at the store I worked at. I loved aspects of the job such as back stock and organizing the floor, etc. however, I'm not a sales person and there was some pressure to make people get the rewards and credit cards, otherwise you got lower ""scores"" and it would be a lot taken if even one person didn't do the rewards or credit cards."
good,Decent job . Days went by fast . Always work to do pretty good management. Don't barther you long as you work . The meeting  are informative . An people I worked with pretty cool .
good,It‚Äôs just a regular warehouse job. Managers were good and informed all opportunities Allow people to work at their own pace well still meeting a quota job offer three breaks
good,It‚Äôs was a great experience I Enjoyed my time while I was there. They gave plenty of opportunities for associates to move up & excel with in the company. All & all it was a nice company to work for
good,I love carters it was my first warehouse job it was just far but overall it‚Äôs a very great company to work for. Easy to grow with the company what you don‚Äôt know they don‚Äôt mind showing you and training you on new stuff
good,Good job I got paid good but the hours where small and not good the managers where cool and good no trouble with them and the employees where also cool
good,"Fun retail store with the opportunity to help shop for babies and cute kids. If you do not like kids or parents, do not work here. Otherwise, not too stressful."
good,Would recommend to anyone to work there as a mechanic it is a job you can see yourself in for a while cause it‚Äôs a family atmosphere there and they are pretty understanding when it comes to time off
good,"working at Carters Oshgosh as a sales associate is predictable. There was an incentive program to sign up customers for rewards system, if you did not meet a certain number of customers your hours were reduced. Was not a fan of that, but coworkers were nice and it was a good job to have while searching for another job"
good,"A nice place to be employed, work load was never too much to handle. Multi-tasking is important along with being able to work effectively and efficiently with others."
good,"The people I worked with are always friendly and are hard workers ready to lend a hand, and show you the necessary  tools to improve. Sometimes can be very slow and it's a smaller store so you can find yourself looking for things to do when all projects are completed for that day"
good,"Many opportunities for advancement, the company cares about you and wants you to succeed. Its not too big of a company that you get lost in the system."
good,Great work place. Flexible with hours and days. Awesome sales on a daily basis. Provide parking spots for mothers and mothers to be. Slow paced great team.
good,"The company is all about hiring within and training there staff to get to the next level. Its like a family the staff is caring of one another. The management team work collectively to create a safe, clean, and respectful work environment."
good,"My time working for Carter's Inc. were great! I love how everyone got along and worked as a team! My store manager at the time, were awesome! She took the time to train in areas that needed and was very supportive and encouraging!"
good,"I open/closed my drawer for my shift, assisted customers, preformed returns/exchanges, cleaned before closing and helped re-stock. Co-workers were very helpful and fast-paced as well."
good,"Worked with Carters Inc. has challenged and equally developed my ability to plan and drive execution along with time management. Corporate and executive partners are more then friendly, supportive and open for suggestions. Carters Inc work culture is disciplined, structured and carefully outlines in its core values. The hardest part of managing within Carter's Inc is that you are limited to your abiity to flex your schedule as ALL managers are hourly. The most enjoyable part of working for Carters Inc is your work life balance being protected because you are hourly."
good,The customers were awesome and the managers did their very best to make sure everyone was always happy. It's a very fast paced store but customers are regulars and always so patient.
good,"it was only seasonal but barley any hours. i was given barley any training hours. after saying they would keep me for full time, they didn't, never heard from them after that"
good,i hated the enviroment the people were so rude . it was very slow paced one of the worst jobs ive had . ive meet alot of great people there i must say
good,Management was great. Really understanding and supportive and always there to answer questions. Typical day at work was stocking the floor and helping customers
good,"I absolutely loved my job. The customers were great, there was always something that needed to be done. I loved seeing all the little kids and babies that came into the store, and as a person without any kids, they were hands down my favorite part of my job. Most of the time it is fast paced."
good,very nice place nice workers nice clothes clean place. good manager. co workers are nice and work well together and we are all best friends forever and ever
good,A typical day at work was fast paced. i learned how to work the machines and scan guns. management was great. the workplace was dealing with other people from country. the hardest part was keeping up with the pace. the most joy able part of my job was meeting friends and family.
good,the management at Carters was quite pleasant the only negative review is the paid it suck!!!. Overall if you are a teenagers in high school it is a great way to start off your work experience for the future. They work with your school schedule when your in college and even provide you with a 401 k plan.
good,Carters' Osh Kosh or The Genuine Canadian Corporation is a good employer. Well established & does excellent job as a retailer. 
good,This job was always extremely fast paced unless the store was empty which was hardly ever. It was an enjoyable experience and management was great. I would recommend this job to a friend
good,"loved working at carters had an amazing experience, i would have stayed longer if i was full time unfortunately the part time hours were not enough for me."
good,"some days were slower than others"
good,Fast pace with many different departments for a single project. Teams work together to get the job done on time or before schedule. the company uses your children as models and they are very family supportive.
good,Good company to work for not a lot of growth opportunity. If you do try to move up in the company they allow other sales managers to apply for the position within your store instead of your company first.
good,I didn't have no problem with the managers or workers. sometimes it was a stressful job .but I enjoyed working there. the coworkers were friendly and understanding
good,"n/a fun work place,it was very fast pase type of place,i had  a nice experince working there.i  would recommened anybody to work there.they also have very nice benifits."
good,I enjoyed working in the many different departments & learning new things almost daily... Overall the lead staff are good to work with. But at times there did seem to be a lack in humanity from direct management (in the warehouse/on the floor management).
good,A lot of young people work there nice to get out and meet new people and build relationships with the managers a good working environment good pay great to me
good,"Moved back home to be closer to family. Still be working there if I did not move. Decent place to work, did not mind the job. I liked my position in the company and the people I worked with."
good,"My time at Carters was not very long. But the time I was there was good because we were always staying busy with the high volume of people, being that I worked in a very busy town."
good,"You get a little bit of everything working here. You learn to handle people, money and the business aspect. Floor sets sign changes etc. As a manager you get to go out and recruit. Ive had the ability to travel for work and see new locations as well as meet more people."
good,"While working at Carters was a pretty easy going job, there were certain times where flexibility became a problem and I was stuck in tough situations between work and school. Other than that, Carters was a fun and enjoyable job."
good,"Company is going through some changes, and always improving company standards, and software."
good,"Carters Osh Kosh, is a fun and productive place to work at. Hours are somewhat okay.  Assistant manager drama. Really don't like the far drive. My check is always gone by the second week."
good,"was not a difficult job, however there was always something to keep you busy. you rotated what you did during your shift such as cashier, working the floor, or stocking the back room."
good,Love working with the staff. They always have a good smile on their face. Customer service is excellent at the location I work at. Very flexible hours.
good,"Work day went by fast, learned patience is key. Management was on top of everything to make customers happy. Keeping the store clean was a hard task because of all the children that come in."
good,"A typical day at Osh Kosh included coming in clocking in, and then most likely needing to reorganize clothing or refolding or hanging the clothes. Most of the time there was new merchandise which would have to be stocked in the back and then bringing out the rest into the  store. Rearranging and remodeling the shelves was a monthly arrangement sent by the company itself. Then there were the customers , who usually needed help with knowing what the deals or sales where and finding a particular size , since they usually had kids and need answers and help quick."
good,this is a great team to be apart of not only has the customers and employees have been nice but also the clothes are really cool. The hours of working the store can be bad.
good,"I only worked there for Black Friday, it was a good experience. I had a lot of fun with the other sales associates helping to keep the store neat and clean."
good,"I was a CSL for a couple of months. Great customers. Great staff. Great company. The only thing I did not appreciate was that when I was hired for  second job, it seemed like they did not want to work with me. I mean for God sakes, they only gave me 12-18 hours so of course I am going to find a second job so I could feed my family. So I had to step back and leave. discount was amazing on top of other sales though!"
good,"It was overall a great place to work. My fellow associates and managers were friendly, welcoming and willing to help when needed. Sometimes the managers would get a little overwhelmed and flustered easily when there was a lot going on but they tried their hardest to not take it out on anybody."
good,I had a great experience at Carter's working as a supervisor. I had great associates which together we learned new things inside retail world. Days were busy and lot of traffic but it made it very active and encouraging.
good,It is a great place to work and they treat everyone fair. They want to help their employees grow and learn as much as they can. They want everyone to do their best and to be a dream team.
good,Carters is a very good companies that offers great benefits and atmosphere. Very corporate in approach and at times you feel you are in a strange world. Overall good company with good advancement opportunities.
good,"I was a sales associate so my jobs relied on customer service, store cleansing, and product stocking. I loved the management! Great inviting workplace. The hardest part of the job was dealing with some customers who didn't have the best attitudes and could be hard to deal with but thats what comes with working retail. Carter's focuses on creating a great environment for all employees and they want to work with you so that you can perform at your best ability."
good,Pleasant atmosphere. The most enjoyable part of the job is selling the product. Visitors that come into the store not knowing what to look for and showing them everything we have to offer.
good,a typical day at this job was 12 hour shifts per day packing baby clothes into boxes to be shipped to stores. I learned that Carter's not only sells baby clothing but kids clothing as well. management was okay but you rarely saw them. the hardest part of a day at this job was walking back and forth for your whole shift.
good,The staff is very welcoming and supportive. Managers are understanding and want the best for the team as a whole! There is definitely an opportunity to move up.
good,Its A Good Work Environment A lot Of Work Good People Sorting baby clothes and boxes and loading trucks easy work nothing hard.Everyone Liked The Job Nothing Bad To Say
good,"Worked hard to help all customers on a daily basis, trained new hires , provided incentives for associates, always ensuring that i trained my associates to do express empathy when assisting customers"

good,"All about safety"
good,I really liked working at carters the environment was very efficient. The management was tough but fair. The hours were good. The work was tough at times but break times were nice.
good,A typical work day included managing the cash register as well as providing customer service for all customers and making sure they are happy with their purchases. Keeping the store organized and presentable was a big requirement during a typical work day as well as keeping replenishing the merchandise. I learned how to properly manage a cash register as well as learn exceptional customer service and being able to handle any problems that may have occurred. The management was very helpful but made sure to keep the job and store very professional. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the new sales and being educated on when sales would end or start as well as what was on sale and what was regular price. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was to help mothers pick adorable and comfortable clothes for their children.
good,"Pros: Always a project to work on, mom's working hours, pleasant management, staff works together well"
good,Carter's was a great pace to work in my job class. The operations department was a great place to be. The only complaint I have is we did not see any management unless something went wrong.
good,"The childrens place is a fun and energetic place to work, with a good staff and a sufficient amount of hours for even part time associates. Training is sufficient and well done."
good,I love my job and the atmosphere. Not too strainous but can be a little demanding at times. The night time hours are a little difficult to do and the dust is hard on my allergies but other than that I enjoy working there.
good,Very fun to work for a company which sales lots of baby clothes and up to size 8. Also music was very good to listen to and associate's were very friendly.
good,a typical day at carters clock in get our work assignments from the boss. had pretty good co-workers job was very easy almost to easy. Pretty much enjoyed everything about the job.
good,It was a  great work place. with a great percentage of guild lines and rules to be followed. I had to Keep record of each items using a computerized system which gave me computer awareness.

good,Ability to promote and move up. Great opportunities. Team environment. and great for a part time job. Great training and upword friendly coworkers.
good,You learn a lot about sales and how to use store equipments as well as cashiering and being social with customers. The best part about the job would be seeing new people

good,It was a nice place to work at got to see all the little kids run around and help the customers with any questions and like to keep the store clean and help out with inventory.
good,"Typical day depends on your department."
good,"This job afforded me many opportunities to work with different agencies, schools, and community organizations.  My co-workers were awesome and team players.  It was unfortunate that the company decided to re-locate into another city."
good,"The little kids dressing up for halloween was adorable. Little babies dressed up in their costumes , children ran into the store trick or treating for candy."

good,This company is very customer oriented and believes in doing everything they can and even going beyond the expectations of a customer just to give them what they desire. I've never seen a company care as much about a person as I have working here. I would highly recommend this company to fellow friends and acquaintances.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help a new mother find the perfect outfit for her baby. I once had a customer who was pregnant with her first child and she didn't have a clue about what would be warm enough, easy to take on and off, and what size to get. I do not have a child, but working at Carters Oshkosh has given me a skill set that I can use to help parents find what they need."
good,"Great place to work. Labor intensive, nights weekends and holidays are a must. fun atmosphere. great people always and opportunity for advancement"
good,"Large company"
good,"Carters/Osh-Kosh is a great and exciting place to work, I enjoyed meeting new people and the fast paste of the jobs on the weekends!"
good,"-Safety programs and audits"
good,"Management groomed a strong team and kept the store well organized. As a first job, it helped to build a good understanding of just how a retail store should operate. The Sunrise location was used as a training store, so there were many new hires that cycled through. Everyday there was a fresh new look to the store, due to product placement and sales racks. As a sales rep, we would closely work with the incoming customer, give sizing advice, assist with outfit choices and know the customer left satisfied with their purchase."
good,I will open or close the store when I work. I have to open and close the registers at the beginning or end of the day. I delegate tasks to other employees to ensure that our workload is completed throughout the day. We take care of our customers and ensure they find everything that they wanted. We make sure that the floor is stocked in order to ensure every size is represented. The most enjoyable part of my job is to see all our customers enjoying themselves while they shop for their children. The hardest part of my job is being able to finish all the tasks that need to be done and make sure that we are taking care of the customers.
good,"i learn how to convince,provide,and analyze what a customer want.I gain confidence in facing different people."
good,Hardest part of the job was standing all day long. I enjoyed the people I worked with.

I also worked with the cash register, promoted new sales and promotions in the store. I enjoyed working in the store because I love children and it was  a very friendly environment to work in."
good,Working at Carters for 16 years was a rewarding experience. I learned a lot from the people I worked with.
good,"I have to say my employees are the best. I enjoy on the spot coaching and helping my staff succeed. Seeing them grow and develop is amazing. They all are comfortable to come to me with any problems or concerns they have and if I do not have an answer I will make sure I go above and beyond to get them the answers. I also enjoy role playing. I myself am a visual person, so I believe it helps role playing and acting for the employees to fully understand."
good,"Great store and deals. the work environment is something that makes you want to work and be there. I  cleaned, put out stock, fold clothes, set sales and mark downs."
good,"-good job"
good,"come in to work 30 mins prior to associates to view daily forecast and unit expectancy, which will determine needs from associates to obtain specified goals"
good,"I was instrumental in developing company's annual sales from 1.5 million dollars to over 12.3 million dollars. I initiated the first computer system to organize and overhaul the record management systems, track commissions and financial records and developed a data base of customers (active/potential), vendors (active/potential) and for mass mailings. I increased existing customer's sales and developed potential/new customer's by introducing new product lines, conducting sales meetings, doing product demonstrations, and training seminars."
good,"I worked tempoary during the christmas holidays. The store was always busy, but that's what I liked about it. the co-workers were easy to get along with and very helpful. I worked as a cashier and in the stock room so I always had something to do."
good,"If you like working with people, this is the job for you. The atmosphere is happy and a nice place to work. Co-workers and management were both great."
good,I love working for Carters. I have learned so much from my SM which can only help me as I advance i my career wether it be with Carters or another company.
good,I loved helping the moms-to-be because essential you were helping them prepare for one of the most important moments of their lives. Learning to deal with different personalities that came through the door was a challenge. Parents get really demanding.
good,loved working at there outlet loved the people and the company great benefits and over all stats
good,"What it really boils down to is that this is a retail job. It has its differences, but overall, employees do the same things here as any other retail position. It's all about customer service- greeting, assisting, following up. Then there's some time answering the phone, processing shipment, folding clothes and straightening/cleaning up after customers. If you have a great team of management and fellow employees, then there's definitely motivation to work and succeed and enjoy working. Everyone I work with is enthusiastic and friendly. We always have smiles ready. There are times when dealing with customers is tough, but it's also really rewarding to help the first-time parents pick out the perfect take-home-from-the-hospital outfit, etc. I recommend a job with Carter's to anyone that likes kids and families, interacting with all different types of people, and someone that with hard work, could move up.  "
good,Fast paced environment with a strong focus on sales and customer service. Excellent support from upper management on all aspects of retail business. Great co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people and being able to give the highest possible customer service and seeing return customers.
good,loved working for carters unfortunately left due to redundancy
good,"I was fortunate and had a wonderful regional out west.  Too bad she had to go back to ontario.  She was passionate, caring, accommodating and fun.  She always worked with you"
good,I worked in the Inbound Department driving the ReachTrucks Receiving skid pallets and placing them in the proper location my Arm Scanner would tell me. I also worked in the Outbound Department driving Order Pickers locating boxes in different  locations in the warehouse and making skids and bringing them to the proper puralator order my scanner would tell me. I overall really enjoyed working there I got along with everyone that worked there and my manger would always ask me to do extra jobs for him because he knew I would do them as fast but properly as possible.
good,"Customers are great, employees are great! I loved working there. Easy to catch on. Managers are very understanding with setting schedules. Great place to work for starters."
good,Construction work that consist of home repair or remodel. The job site changes daily along with the job it's self. It's a fun place to work where you can take pride at your work.
good,"Everyday you come to the same sales associate job, needing to replenish and recover the store. At times you have good days, mostly unenjoyable ones though. Carter's has very particular coupons and sales that have limitations, so it's hard to explain and comfort customers when they don't go their way. Management is fine, but it's hard to find motivation with them and yourself at times. You're always welcome to advance, but at the cost of losing competent workers."
good,"A lot of interaction with customers, flexible hours, great team. There are many times that require you to use your knowledge in different situations and you definitely have to constantly be aware of details"
good,"If you can handle the overnight schedule, I would recommend it. Depending on what department you go to, you will consistently be working. The slow times in the year are one of the biggest flaws."
good,"fast pace, multi-tasking, heavy workload"
good,Great company to work for. Managers are great and undertsanding. Spend your shift pulling out stock or sizes that are needed on the floor and customer service.
good,Buena compa√±√≠a y sueldo pero pienso deber√≠an ser m√°s flexibles con los buenos trabajadores que hablan espa√±ol
good,"Good place to work"
good,Carters is a pleasant and fun place to work. The management is supportive and the company believes in promoting from within. They believe in training their employees to understand the business fully.
good,I love working for carters. its a fast paced high volume retail environment in which I learn something new everyday. I love my management team and i feel my store manager has helped build and further my careeer. Carters use of changing technology and updated operating systems have been a great addition to my management goals and skills. I am currently looking for a full time job only because my Osh Kosh and carters in my area do not have a full time opening and i am ready to move forward into a full time position.
good,Es trabajo c√≥modo todo el d√≠a est√°s activa el personal es muy amable
good,Got to use radios so we wouldn't have to shout across the store to ask another associate a question. Management was very informative and helpful. The hardest part was getting people to sign up for the rewarding moments club and if they didn't sign up it reflected negatively on you and gave you a bad percentage.
good,"Liked working at Carters, they have great discounts and always had a job list to keep you busy."
good,"nice management, time goes fast if you stay busy. its always nice to help people pick out an outfit or just helping them in general. all the co-workers are nice. they feed you around black friday"
good,"Great Benefits for full time employees, including a full match to 401k. Friendly staff, family culture. Have to work on all holidays, however this is retail in general."
good,"Working at carters is fun and laid back. I word at a double brand store, which includes both Oshkosh and Carters. This means double the work load. My managers are AMAZING and quirky! There is so much room to move up in the company. The only bad thing is that with us being a double brand store and there being so much work to do there is always someone slacking with their work. Which means it's left for someone else to do. Other than that the job is amazing."
good,"Carters has an excellent training program.  The management takes time to invest in its people."
good,"This is a nice place to work. Always something to do to keep busy. Lots of learning opportunities. "
good,"Very good place to work with great management.  Great work to life balance, and opportunity to advance from sales associate positions into management positions."
good,"Need to have a fast pace and can't be slacking. Need to be a fast learner, have good communication skills. Have really good people skills, be easy going"
good,Gave me great experience in interacting with customers. Made me more familiar with sales and how to talk to people in persuading deals. Also helped me interact with babies and young children since it is a baby/child store.
good,"I enjoyed working there,its an amazing job great people great enivorment .very clean and loyal people people to work with . I wish I was still there I loved my job there."
good,I absolutely love working for the Carters/Oshkosh store in Tilton. Everyone is incredibly kind and helpful. The managers are leaders who are willing to do everything you do and help coach you in anything you have trouble with. The only thing that I would say is hard is the pay is quite low and the hours during certain times of the year aren't great for making an income. But I would definitely recommend this job to those starting out and to high school students who don't have many bills to pay.
good,"Carters was my first, non seasonal, retail job. I love everything about it! On a typical workday, depending on the day, you will High 5  customers and make sure they're cared for. I learned a lot about KPI's and driving sales. The management here is outstanding and they're good  with helping you if you're unsure about anything. The coworkers are pretty great, if I ever needed a shift covered someone was able to cover it. The hardest part of the job is being a college student living on a biweekly paycheck. I enjoy seeing all the new outfits we get in."
good,"Often fast pace, unless it was a weekday. My fellow employees were amiable as well as my managers. The most diffiuclt weekend for me was Easter weekend. That's when we were our busiest. One thing I didn't like was the lack of hours. Also we weren't informed if the work schedule was changed."
good,"I loved everything about this job. My co-workers , the management, the customers, the job itself . The only down side was the i wasn't able to get full time there. So the pay just wasn't enough for me."
good,Working at carters was a great experience for me the environment and management is wonderful.They have so much opportunities to move up and learn so many different job functions.
good,Hardly get hrs but i would end up making $300 in two weeks the mangers were always nice and friendly and were patience ans caring about helping you out.
good,Work at Carters is a very hectic yet productive. I've learned to always stay extra proactive and to plan in advanced (weekly) due to the amount of guests we get visited into our store and the culture of the guests. Managing our store is an easy yet challenging at times due to time changes in associate schedules. I can't say there was nothing hard but fun and enjoyable to work for this company. I need a challenge and a different view in retail.
good,Carter's is a good store to work especially if retail is new to you. Management teaches you everything you need to know about retail. I enjoy working there because I always enjoy my time spent with customers and fellow employees. Its a well maintained store and the staff are hard workers.
good,"GREAT management. Owner is a beauty."
good,"Spend the day assisting customers with purchases and buying decisions, and restock shelves as needed."
good,"always busy. Always entertaining. we acted like a bunch of kids in preschool because we dealt with a bunch of children who came in with their families to shop and get new clothes. I learned that being a manager was easier than a thought, and by golly did it put my math skills to use. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and my boss very much."
good,"A typical day at Carter's consisted of helping customers find what they were looking for and me providing them with the correct sizes they needed. What I learned while I was at Carter's was how to manage, become responsible, handle money, and help the guest leave with a smile on their face. My management here at Carter's was good but I feel it could have had some improvement, but as an overall look at my co-workers they were very nice and hard working. The hardest part about my job was that I was a young supervisor and some of the employees that I over saw were older than me. The most enjoyable part of my job I must say were all the babies that came in and out of the store."
good,"the best part of the job is working with a wonderful working crew and getting the chance to interact with different customers from different cities, states, and countires."
good,"Carters was a fun place to work, great hours, friendly staff, great management, great employee discounts, great insurance benefits, no commission but pay was awesome for management!! Job security was good and advancement was very good! Overall working for Carters was a fun experience and as a mother the discount was very helpful. It was a neat experience seeing repeat customers come in with their kids and watch them grow!!!"
good,Is a good place to work . Great team work and co-operate environment with opportunity  working on diverse projects. Good company to work for with opportunity for growth and development
good,"- With the push to give such great customer service you become very involved with your customers. They become like family."
good,The days started and ended very busy. There were always plenty of people in the store and plenty to do regarding organization and stocking. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and building connections.
good,"I have loved working at Carter's & Osh Kosh! Every employee I've met, even the ones from corporate, have been friendly and down to Earth. All my closer coworkers are just that: close. It has been like having a second family working here."
good,Fun environment! Love working with new moms and babies. Shopping and sharing experiences and the love for the product is my favorite part! Fast paced environment and consistent product and promotional updates.
good,"For as long as the store has been open, I have loved working there. Since it is a new store, daily sales goals are unrealistic and hard to reach, with cuts hours for sales associates..."
good,"I loved it there until we received a new manager. The first manager was sweet. She made sure everyone understood the job, and she made sure everyone was able to have fun at work."
good,I learned a lot in how to do customer service. I did a lot of different tasks throughout the day. The rest of the staff was very supportive when learning the ropes of the job.
good,This job has taught me a lot. From very great customer service to creating bonds with employees. Management was great in this area. The most enjoyable part of my job was the great attitudes and positive vibes.
good,"Good work environment. The company really cares about its employees. Fun customer base to work with. Good job security, because people will always be buying baby clothes."
good,the happiness of your job depends strongly on your store management staff. would recommend ages over 18 to apply only because they work you long and hard most times.
good,"coming to carters get ready to work, I learned to work in a fast pace managers are always on there job the most enjoyable part is you get a lot of exercise"
good,"I absolutely LOVE my job and have since day 1. I started at the end of February this year. During a typical day I am greeted my the manager on duty and given a run down on the day's current sales and traffic, store status concerning shipment and replenishment as well as goals and tasks expected for my shift. The management are very helpful and are willing to work with personal schedules. We have an amazing team that always puts the customer first. We are laid back but work very hard. We have a great time and laugh often. The atmosphere is wonderful and have had customers even comment about it. There is just something about the store that just puts you in a good mood as soon as you walk in the door. I think the hardest part of the job is changing floor sets and signs when we get new product shipments. The only thing I have had problems with is being understaffed. We need more people. We are in the busy season and need more help to fully meet the needs of our customers."
good,"The company is an ok place to work for, but your management team makes or breaks your experience. Unfortunately, job security is not great. They will fire you over any little thing it seems so you're always thinking about making sure you don't do anything wrong to lose your job. Not the obvious things like stealing, but how you might apprehend a shoplifter. It's not exactly clear what you can and can't do, but do the ""wrong"" thing and you're gone. They're only out to protect the company and not its employees. Turnover is also REALLY high."
good,"Very supportive home office team. Always felt supported and had what I needed at the store level. The downside is we have small mgmt teams which makes it very difficult if something comes up,  and you need to call in due to being sick or having a sick kiddo. We could use additional key holders"
good,"Always have something to do during your shift"
good,"There's rarely a rude customer. Management at my store is great. Learning environment, very upbeat and family like. The only issues many employees had were the amount of hours."
good,"Typical Day: "
good,I absolutely loved my job! It was fun even on slow days. My manager was the absolute best along with my coworkers. My manager worked hard to resolve any problems and was very sincere. Customers were enjoyable and always made my days at work happy. However i would literally only get 3 hours per week sometimes. If i would have had more hours i would have never left!
good,"Awesome place to work, fast paced, and great management. You learn something new everyday on the job either from management, co-workers or customers."
good,"A work day at Carters is very routine.  Turnover reports are sent and given to each shift.  Schedules are expected to run and complete in a timely order.  If any problems occur, notification must be sent to the on-call duty person.  I learned Control-M  and Magic software.  The people are very nice to work with."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is the Customers. Talking to them . And i enjoy my co-workers they are very nice.
good,"keep busy, repetative customers- get better relationship with them, management was enjoyable at the branch level but no loyalty to employees at the upper management level."
good,"ambiance calme, une √©quipe avec laquelle on peut s‚Äôamuser"
good,"Great people, love the customers and the value of a smile. They understand what needs to get done and how it needs to get achieved. Communication is what needs to improve on."
good,Carter's is a fantastic company to work for and with. They are very family friendly and customer service savvy. They treat their employees well and spend a great amount of time making the workers feel appreciated and valued.
good,"nice co workers, good benefits, great management, I learn a lot from this company"
good,"This was probably my most favorite place to work and wish I could have continued there, but due to personal reasons in my family life I had to leave. Fun place to work, great compensation."
good,"Typical I work the cash register, recover the store, put out shipment, and when closing do the store cleaning. The managers are nice and I get about 12-18 hours a week which is decent for part-time schedule. "
good,"Very positive environment to work in. Coworkers are very motivating and friendly. There is no one I do not like to work with. Occasionally tough to gain more hours per week. However, I  would recommend to a friend. One of the better retail jobs."
good,"I have been working here for about 2 years and am part of a great team. We work really well together, management is great and very accommodating, and there are opportunities for advancement through the company."
good,"Carter's is a very great and flexible workplace if you are a student in high school or college who needs to focus on school, yet keep a stable job. There are quite a few day to day tasks, however shifts go by fairly quickly. There is plenty opportunity to grow within this company, and you learn a lot about retail and merchandising while working here"
good,Wonderful way to associate with business world & learn to properly situate and accommodate guest while managing to mantain a mutually beneficial relationship with consumer and provider (hotel establishment)
good,"Retail is not for everyone short crazy shift and crazy hours. Retail consist of a lot dedication and time. A regular day is usually open put out new merchandise, restock and back stock fix up clean refold close."
good,"Basic retail job, you learn to multitask people, the cash register, and keeping children from throwing the merchandise around. It is a fun environment with the right managers and co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help a parent to be and calm them from panicking about their infant."
good,"Good work/life balance and a very friendly workplace."
good,"The only bad thing I can say about Cater's is there were not enough hours available.  Management does an amazing job on pumping up all staff to push sales and making the store successful."
good,"Was my first job, I got it recommended bye a friend who had worked there for 2 years. I was very shy, nervous and self conscious at first but after I was there for a couple of days I got better and better .I liked all my co-workers they were sweet hearts, they helped me out a lot. I left carters because of family issues that are now solved. Most enjoyable part of the job was really making new friends and stocking and arranging the store making it nice & neat."
good,It was a good job while it lasted the manager was really great at teaching and explaining to me how to be successful at work and it made me great good sales whenever I worked it was a good experience
good,"We did not know our schedules until 2 days before the start of our shifts. The managers are friendly, but the thing with the schedules makes it difficult to work there."
good,"Everyone is understanding and wants to help you thrive in not only the company itself but in generally, life and in your career. The flexibility makes working here easy."
good,Devoir aimer conseiller et travailler avec les enfants.
good,small store allows for the development of close relationships with customers. High chances of promotion as long as you are focused and do your job right
good,"A typical day includes talking to your manger about what task that are needed for that day. I learned alot about folding clothes and the size of clothing. Management is really nice , most of the management is young, my co-workers are team players and are fun to work around. There is no hardest part of job, the most enjoyable part of the job is helping pick out adorable sets for new mommies."
good,"I love working at carters"
good,"Not bad if you‚Äôre in high school and it‚Äôs your first job! I loved my manager and the people working there. It would also be pretty dead. The only reason I quit this job was because of the lack of hours. They would literally have me working 4 hours and like 2 or 3 days per week. They had way too many workers. But wonderful manager, so loving and friendly!"
good,"great place to work, girls were friendly, customers fantastic, a lot of exercise.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
good,The co workers are easy to get along with! They are encouraging people and they make sure you smile when working there!
good,it was a really good job while I was there but some worker was very rude and disrespectful but I guess you get that everywhere
good,Great fast paced work place with very friendly people to met. Only bad thing is one of their racist assistant managers who fired me without me knowing.
good,"The business has nice employees who take an interest in others. however, the management of the employees is poor and the business has introduced a lot of unnecessary restrictions on the paperrounds. this made the job more difficult."
good,Overall typical work days run smoothly. I have learned that management and associate won't always get along. My coworkers and I agree on a lot of things. The hardest part of my job is trying to make everyone happy. I enjoy working at a kids clothing store.
good,"Fun, fast paced environment. Friendly, co-workers, and management. Very understanding and flexible. Gained a lot of knowledge."
good,"Being able to interact with expecting parents,and baby shoppers on any occasion kept our customers smiling. Getting new shipment became exciting for employees as well as customers."
good,its a great company but it dosnt value its employees. No room for improvement or employee development within the company
good,"A great place to start in retail. Teaches you the basic essentials of learning how to operate a register, customer service, cleaning.  It is fun because you interact with children and families."
good,"I never saw myself as working at a baby clothing store, but it gave me a new perspective when it came to providing great customer service. i enjoyed the holiday season the most at this job,"
good,I love working with people and children and this job lets me do both. I love to help people make desictions on what gose with what. I also loved to see all the different little children
good,"working at carters was fun! Management would always come up with more fun ways and prizes for signing customers up for the rewards programs, it always got everyone more excited about signing customers up!"
good,"Short and less hours, lots of work ,management expectations are too much. Just ok for part time work,  no career development or enhancement,  you are given 5 hours per week."
good,"I was hired as a seasonal employee and then got be a part-time employee. I was responsible for greeting customers and assisting them, show them things they normally would not buy and get them to purchase it. I had a great manager. I had to leave this job due to not getting enough hours."

good,Carter's would be a good starting out job. It's not meant for someone to live off of. Would be perfect for a 16 year old or a mom that needs the discounted clothing.

good,"Each day I would go to one of my stores and merchandise the Carters children clothing, following the POG. I would take pictures of my work and send it in to my boss.  I learned to be very independent and work on my own.  I was able to make my own schedule and my own hours.  I loved this about this job.  The hardest part was the lack of contact with other carters workers or Customers.  I am more of a people person, so this did make the job difficult at times."

I learned how to communicate with customer's and their children in a very friendly way. My coworkers were very nice and they enjoyed working their. The hardest part of the job was organizing the stock room on Black Friday. The most enjoyable part of the job was greeting people, and getting to interact with customers."
good,Enjoyed working with the employees there. Very fun and upbeat atmosphere. Fast paced and laid back.
good,"The versatility of working each day -- no two days are the same.  Assisting customers with purchasing for their children.  I learned how the retail market works and operates.  As part of management, every day was a learning experience and made the work day highly rewarding.  Each and every co-worker was expected to work as a team to make the overall shopping experience a positive one for all customers.  Not having the ability to have Sales Associates work more hours due to lack of hours.  The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing all the beautiful babies, sometimes multiples, shopping in the store.  The babies were the reason we had our business!  "

good,Very calm retail position. Everyone is friendly and the customers are pleasant
good,"Working at carter's is a very good experience. You get to work with parents and interact with their kids. I Learned a lot of patients,setting and achieving goals,as well as learning how to deal with many obstacles. The hardest part of this job was dealing with the many mangers that came and went. The most enjoyable part was working and helping the customers and making sure they were happy and satisfied when they left."

good,I was able to learn and grow with this company. Flexible schedules and great management teams. Carter's prefers to promote within and gives every opportunity possible to help advance careers.
good,Good company to work for and you learn a lot about retail. The pay scales need to be updated and I didn't like having to be on call to see if they might need help.
good,"very collaborative, people are genuine and care about each other."
good,Great store with benefits that match. Loved building outfits and gtting new moms and seasoned moms wardrobes. Humbling sales not pushy . Plus a generous discount.
good,"I love working at carters osh kosh, the hours are flexible and can work around me going to college full time 14 hours per week, but the pay is low and hours depend on sales. I love the job but wish i had guaranteed hours"
good,A nice company to work for with flexible hours and excellent management (Concord Pike location). The customers are always friendly and co workers always work together. But if you are looking for work with constant hours and good pay this is not the job.
good,"i am no longer at carters, but it was a good place to work.The manager was great. there seemed not enough time to put product out and it was delivered every day."
good,I enjoyed my time at Carters. I had a pretty good start and a great group to work with. I wasnt able to get as many hours as i would like on a weekly bases but very friendly easy going place to work.

good,Carter's Oshkosh et un bon endroit pour les √©tudiants qui n'ont pas besoin de beaucoup d'heures de travail. L'endroit est plaisante mais sans plus. travail r√©p√©titif mais aucunement for√ßant physiquement
good,I was a stay-at-home mom at the time and only wanted to earn some extra holiday money. I was only hired on with Carters to help with their year end inventory count. My co-workers were courteous and professional.
good,i have been in garment industries as QA for 22 yeas more. I can working under pressure and  fast to adaptation. I'm control and monitoring from raw material to shipout. And give win win solution if any issue during process. Follow buyer requirement for customer satisfied.
good,"carters values its employees, has great benefits, corporate is encouraging life work balance, great customer base, love the brand and the product is so easy to get behind and sell"
good,I would work there again if they would take me back. Fun and friendly place to work.  Alway's happy customers.  Clean and alway's new products.  Good hour's to work.
good,"Despite a few hiccups in management, I found my experience at Carters noteworthy and essential to the development of my time management and organizational skills. I would recommend this job to anyone who enjoys interacting with people and maintaining a clean work environment. This job does require being on your feet for long periods of time as well as some occasional lifting."
good,"Carter was the first Property Management company I had ever worked for the Manager were great to work for , and the upper Management came out to know who were at each location and talk to you on a individual bases to get to know who you are as a person."
good,love it! The fellow employees are the best part of this job!!! Helping customers find exactly what they are looking for is very rewarding! The only flaw is when hours are low during slow periods.
good,The experience from Carter's and Osh Kosh was very fun and working where there are children was always an interesting day. Developing management skills were definitely encouraged and communication was necessary due to many employees. The job was completely enjoyable and easy to work in.
good,"I loved this job. Between making customers happy and stocking, there was always something to do. The staff was like a big happy family, we always enjoyed working together and being around each other, that made our work place a healthy environment. The hardest part about working at Carter's was not always having the sizes the customers needed or even inventory nights, there wasn't any hard things about the job. You always had something to do. There was never a dole moment."
good,If you like working in retail and like working around kids than this is the place for you. I loved my job here. Especially working around in the kids clothes and seeing the new products that was always coming in I was always wondering what collection I was going to buy next for my kids
good,"Working at Carters is a great place to work with customers and help them find things that they need or want. There are great opportunities  for advancement too. Working at this job I have learned a lot about problem solving and the best way to work with customers, to show personal interest and work hard to help them in anything they may need. The work environment is very pleasant of course you get one or two people who come in upset once in a while, but it allows you to put a smile on their face when you help. The hardest part of the job is that there are not a lot of hours available so if you are looking for a job that gives you more than 10 hours it may not be a good job for you. The most enjoyable part of my job would definitely be helping ones who are pregnant with babies because they are so excited and you get to be that person that makes their day even better."
good,Carter's is a great place to work. The management can be a little over bearing and nit picking but overall its a fun place to work for a good hourly wage.
good,poor management team but friendly atmosphere
good,"I loved working here while I was still a high school student. The hours were reasonable and there was no pressure. You would typically be out by 9:30pm which is perfect for a student,."
good,"always kept busy, there was always something to do something to be done, friendly people to work with, hardest part was getting people who didn't want to sign up for rewards to sign up for them, or by being denied by them"
good,Un travail tr√®s agr√©able avec les enfants tr√®s motivant mais un gros manque d' organisation du personnelle
good,"There were always really fun times to be had, and you're never stuck doing the same job over and over again. Managers are flexible and give you room to try new things. The only downfall is that if you're really good at one particular thing you will do that more often than not."
good,"typical day at work would be on the cashier, helping customer find baby outfit for the baby to go home in or just the basic thing that a baby would need for when they get home. also helping them find size that might fix the baby/ toddler that they are shopping. when customer are not in the store filling the table or the racks. clean the the store or take out the trash. the co-worker that i have are amazing and very easy to get along with. the management their is very understand to outside of work issues you maybe. the best part of working their is see the cute little babies their. the hardest part is when you have a rude customer in your face trying to talk down on you. but working this is fun and like it ."
good,"A typical day at work would be getting chatted in, depending on the day & shift you would do stock, fill in merchandise, and do mark downs. I've learned how to play the role of a manager and see some insite from a higher level than just an associate. It kept me busy & I knew exactly what was expected of me every shift. My co-workers we're a pretty good group of workers, we did what we had to do although a lot of petty drama, we were like a family. the hardest part of the job was having to pick up after children that would knock down everything. The most enjoyable part was seeing the kids and the moms being so happy about the deals & leaving with smiles on their faces."
good,I learned how to do floor sets in a timely manner. We received shipment daily and had to process the shipment and have it out with in 1 business day. So i really learned to mange my time and merchandise and floor set effectively. I also learned how to upsell and multi task in a fast paced manner.
good,This job allowed me to work freely at my own pace. I really enjoy working with all my coworkers as well as management. This job required very little strength but plenty of walking.
good,"Other than receiving minimum wage, this is a great place to work."
good,had a lot of fun working there we became family and for the most part were all still in contact.  Everyone was smart and cared about the work to be done.
good,"The reason I loved this job so much, is because it allowed me to be around the children and help new mothers or mothers already to pick out clothes for their children."
good,"Work 8 hours on a good day. Have not had many work days because work is very slow right now. I like the environment. It is full of positive co-workers. They make the job easier. Hardest part is standing for a full 8 hours, but I have adjusted to it."
good,Never had issues working here. Managers were always very understanding and were there for me on a personal level. Only had to leave because I was going to school
good,"I would greet customers, set up and clean the store and be a cashier to customers as well. A typical day would be to help customers and make sure the store was clean and that all merchandise is in tact and accounted for. I would also supervise employees to make sure we are all on the same page."
good,I loved the job. It just didn't allow me to be myself. I learned how to be paitient. I wish there were longer brakes. The mos enjoyable part is helping expecting parents pick the right things for their babies.
good,Carter's was a wonderful company to work for. Interacting with the clients and setting up product displays were fun and interesting. There was never a boring day while working there.
good,"I enjoyed my time working with my teammates at Carter's, the atmosphere was always warm and everyone was always friendly,and helpful whenever I needed help."
good,"Great place to work, love being around the people I work with and the customers are almost always in a friendly mood. Plus side is interacting with kiddos when they come in with their parents. They love getting stickers from us, or telling us about being big brothers or sister's, or the clothes their picking out. We make it a fun experience for them as well as their parents!"
good,I had learned so many things in Carters. There are tips on how to drive sales and increase traffic with just a few simple steps. I can now use those techniques in just about every area of work field and get a positive result from using it. It was pretty amazing and I do intend to continue using what I learn from Carters and apply it with everything.
good,"This was a very nice and exciting place to work, I enjoyed my time there. I gained experience with using the cash register and learning to do go-backs. There was nothing hard about the job, but the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting people and helping them with their clothing needs."
good,"I really enjoyed this job. Unfortunately hours got cut after the holidays. I folded clothes, helped customers, stocked shelves. And the employers are great. I would still be there if my hours didn't get cut"
good,"A typical work day starts with coming in, in the morning opening the registers, turning on music, and opening the front doors. Ensuring every parent and customer that comes in is greeted with a smile. Followed by replenishing the store, keeping the store recovered and clean, and of course giving our customers amazing customer service with ""Hi-Five""."
good,"Osh Kosh is a great retail store to work in. You will get great training and have fun in the process. There is a lot to do, everyday, and there is never a dull moment."

good,"I am able to develop sales and customer service and completion of the sale operating cash register, and storage and replenishments clothes on the floor."
good,Great and nice environment!! Management were great and I did work lots of hours.
good,It was always interesting to come to work and have such good customer interactions with those who just want more for the child in their lives. Management was fair and co-workers are easy to get along with and very kind. Hardest part of the job would have probably had to be inventory work which is just time consuming but still a fun environment to be in. The best part is seeing the children around the store who not only wear the merchandise but seem to truly enjoy it.
good,Great company and great coworkers. Well managed store. Lots to learn
good,"On a typical day at work, I would greet customers, and help them find certain merchandise. I learned how to understand customers better on certain things they needed, or what they were looking for. My management was amazing. My co-workers were very helpful.The hardest part of the job was going in the back in the stock room and finding certain merchandise. The most enjoyable part of my job, was helping the customers."
good,"I have work experience at Carter‚Äôs, good break times one paid and one not paid. The managers was so help full and they have good communication with the labourers and fixers etc."
good,"A lot of recovery. Multiple tasks throughout the day. Rewarding Moments program performance is heavily stressed and monitered, but once you get the hang of it, it isn't hard to reach the expected RM goal."
good,If you want a fast paced job normally this wont be the job for you... unless it is holiday season. Overall a relaxed workplace with pretty cool co workers.
good,"If you work fast and do what u need to do the job is simple. People are too use to working at jobs where then can go hide in the back and jump on your phone. Not here tou are consistently working, if u dont then the work will get backed up and you or someone else will have to finish it. Pump out the work do it accurately and quickly  u will be fine"
good,Easy and very calm. People are friendly and really easy-going. Most days aren't busy which gives us time to clean and recover the store to make sure guests are happy when coming in.
good,"I had a great time working for this company. Everyone is so friendly and fun to work with. HR was easy people to talk to about any issues or questions. "
good,"i like the job, my bos was nice as well as my co-workers. Whenever I felt sick they were kind and let me leave early. I only worked there for a short period of time."
good,"I loved working at Carter's. The job atmosphere was enjoyable, you're surrounded by baby clothes all day! My managers were friendly and helpful, and co-workers were great. The only reason I left the job was because the hours conflicted with my home life, sadly. As in most retail jobs, the hours could be rather late and it was difficult to find adequate childcare. Perhaps, down the road, I will be able to apply to Carter's once again."
good,Good job slow pace sometimes don‚Äôt have enough work hours it‚Äôs fun sometimes and also get boring sometimes. Work hours slow down sometimes due to not enough work
good,Carter's has been the best company to work for. The company lives by it's values and gives their employees everything they need to succeed. Upper management will engage with sales associates and will get their hands dirty if need be. The best part of this job is being part of a great team with a smart and supportive District Manager.
good,Management works hard to ensure code of ethics are followed. Opportunities for advancement available within the company. Very customer service-focused and teaches interpersonal skills.
good,"I do love how relaxed it is compared to the other big retailers I've worked for in the past. The only thing is the hours when your a part time you should only work 4-5 hours a day. And prefer no weekends but that's the retail world for you. I love the non childish and snake- like behavior I had to endure for years at big retailers. Now I see why no one leaves because the culture is just so relaxed, so if I wanted to pursue a ASM or SM I would have to relocate to get it."
good,"Great company to work for , depending on how hard are you willing to work and your management team. If you want to move up you have to be able to work any time."
good,This is a good place to work if you'd like a little extra pocket change. The hours were flexible and allowed room to do other things. The store was small enough to know where everything is. The customers are friendly and it's not exhausting. Shifts are usually 4-6 hours.
good,"Amazing aura, plenty of room to advance, flexible with schedules. Pay is also nice. Sometimes just short handed and not many disciplinary rules were followed as far as call ins or no shows. Overall, love it. I'd go back!"
good,I loved working at Carters. The management is kind and works well with everyone. Leslie was incredible whenever you wanted an extra shift or needed to take one off she worked with you to make it happen. If I was able to live off the part-time hours I would have never left.
good,"The combined store of Carter‚Äôs/Oshkosh is an amazing place to work. The employees are some of the friendliest people you could ever cross paths with. Customer service is  tremendous, not to mention the store is constantly kept neat and organized."
good,I enjoyed the managers making me feel like home. It was easy to learn my role and they were very understanding if mistakes were made in the begging. I enjoyed my co-workers and helping mother new and old find the perfect outfit for their babies. A nice environment to work in.
good,"This was my first job and it was perfect to an extent. I loved the clients, the atmosphere was nice, you could work with children and adults, and you dealt with baby clothes on a daily! Downfall is that at at Carters and Oshkosh you have call in shifts,. An hour before your shift you had to call and they would tell you if they needed you to come in or not. It sucked because on those days you could never make solid plans."
good,I learned how to give great customer service also learning how to answer the phone. The hardest part of the job was seeing the customer leaving unsatisfied and also trying to move up in the workplace.
good,It is very fast paced and stressful but I have learned how to lead and how to work hard with this job. The hardest part of the job is high expectations that you wouldn't expect a part time job to give you. The wage is decent for a part time job but could be better for how much work and thought I put into it. I love the customers and the people and management.
good,"nice place with nice people to work with.."
good,Great staff and a pleasure to go to work everyday.I have learned how to provide great customer service throughout the years. I have also learned how to coach and develop my staff and promote my staff from internally.
good,"This is a nice company to work for. Personally I have learned a lot working here. Training and development is something that is huge to be successful with this company. As long as you are willing to learn, go above and beyond, you will do awesome! I have never gone home thinking i did not like my job. I love it!"
good,"Team oriented company, rewarding and fun place to work. Company strives to succeed together and values its team members from the most seasoned manager to the newest sales associate. Workload can be really high during peak, but not more than other retailers. Empowers managers to make good decisions and take care of customers."
good,I absolutely love working for Carters. It is a wonderful place. It is a fun friendly non drama work environment. Kids clothing is a real passion of mine being a mom of twins. I enjoy going to work everyday.
good,"I was so sad that I had to leave, it was my first job and I grew with the brand new store we opened in Orange. I loved the atmosphere and I enjoyed everyday at work."
good,At Carters its always nice to work with friendly and reliable co-workers and for a company that is stable and provides with a positive and peaceful environment so that the employees could easily concentrate on customer service and also be productive through their day at work.
good,"I love working at Carter's, its really fun and you get a lot of regular customers who only stop in when they're in the mood to shop. The management where I work is awesome. They really care about their Sales Associates and the company as a whole does as well. It is a very fast paced job for the retail setting, but that makes the hours go by quickly and in general the work is fun if you have a positive attitude."
good,"Loved being here, was just unable to work two jobs and have no days off. Would love to go back though at some point! Great coworkers and great management, probably the best I've seen."
good,Working with Carter's is a joy. Management  recognized and showed appreciation to sales associates. It doesn't take that long to get promoted in the company. The work environment was always a pleasant one.
good,"This was a great position to have as a part-time job. It was wonderful getting to see all the adorable babies and kids come in, and I loved seeing all the outfits we had. Co-workers were great most of the time, and management the first summer I worked there was great. The second summer I worked there our management wasn't the best, but it wasn't unbearable."
good,"The company is great to work for. The store staff are all wonderful. The experience is well appreciated. However, the current location I am employed with are sharing very fine hours with a large staff. I would prefer to work more hours."
good,Often is a high stress environment with many projects to complete in order to keep everything up to date as well as provide the best customer service to every individual through the store.  This company thrives with team work and multitasking.  The hardest part is to complete every task in the given time frame do to overwhelming amount of tasks all the while trying to manage the customers.  The most enjoyable part is interacting with the customers.
good,"It's only been about a month since I started working at Carter's, but I love it! It's a really relaxed environment, and my managers and co-workers are really nice. They aren't snobby like a lot of retail managers and co-workers tend to be. They are very helpful, kind and organized. I like that I can talk to them about anything and they aren't scary to approach. "
good,"A typical day at work was filled with fun, different tasks. I learned a lot about visual displays. The management was great and very easy to get along with. My co-workers were very helpful and fun to be around. The hardest part of the job was heavier traffic days. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to set up colorful and appealing visual displays."
good,My daily duties were to come in thirty minutes early to put out orders that were set out by third shift. Kept everything flowing for the remainder of my workshift.
good,"Great place to work, office is centrally located, and benefits are equal to or better than most other companies"
good,I enjoyed working at Carters. All the employees are very polite and give a warm welcome to the team.
good,"I was a temp worker over the holidays at the Carter's warehouse. The Carter's staff are really respectful and eash to talk to. No matter what question I had, there was always someone there to help me out. The supervisors were amazing, they were kind and offered good coaching. I worked in the ecommerce department as a picker/packer and gained great skills. I'm sad I was unable to find a permanent job with Carters, but grateful for the work."
good,"It's an easy money kind of job, sometimes it does get stressful since we are under staffed, but overall this has been my favorite job. I love the environment, and everyone is so fun and nice, it's a great place to work! Management is great, and I've left so many jobs due to management, but the people here really do care about you, and your life outside of work. The best thing about working here personally is two things, the discounts you get, and seeing babies, helping families choose the best things they need for their children, so in the end we all win. I do wish we got paid more, but it's a good job overall especially for high-school/college kids!"
good,"pretty slow traffic during the start, and gets more traffic throughout the day. Great coworkers and managers are really understanding, and I've learned how to interact with customers in such a great way and build great relationships with them. I would think the hardest part is of working at carters is the amount of merchandise but I really love interacting with children and customers and my coworkers are fun and very friendly."
good,I worked here for a couple years in high school. My managers and co workers were amazing. It was a more relaxed environment as long as you completed the tasks you were asked to do.
good,Very good experience it was temporary job I always gave good customer service. We were selling baby clothes and accessories and the clientele was very good and kind.
good,I worked cashier more than anything and the hardest part was learning the new system that the company recently received so even though I've worked retail and done cashier before it was totally a brand new way I had to learn but everyone at the one i was working at was very nice.
good,Very good job for outgoing people who like to help others or who like being around kids. Sometimes thw store can get very busy so you have to be able to work and think at a fast pace
good,A typical day could be anything from tidying the store to restocking or being on cash most of the day as well as assisting customers when needed. The management at this job was great very understanding and appreciative of its employees. I found the hardest part of the job was learning how to run the till as just to do a one item transaction there were so many buttons and pages to go threw. The most enjoyable part of this job I think was just the job overall it wasn't to crazy the customers were friendly as well as all the staff and every one was so understanding when your being trained and cant work super fast.
good,An overall very nice company to work for. Staff was pleasant in my store it was more family oriented. A lot of the staff that I met with I am still friends with years later.
good,"Good first job, flexible with school hours and work"
good,"I enjoyed working for Carters/Osh Kosh distrubtion center, we stayed busy it was great pay for the job all the departments required fairly easy duties I actually went back to work there on two occasions and enjoyed it both times...the people there are helpful and it's definitely a growing company alot of job security pretty much as long as you come to work and do your what's required then you keep your job"
good,"Some things are hard to understand due to poor instruction, but overall amazing coworkers and management. Very laid-back and forgiving environment. I dont feel highly pressured but I do feel encouraged. Biggest issue is rude customers and no backup from some of the assistant managers."
good,This company is great to work for. Everyone is always so kind and it feels like another family. Working in a children's store may sound scary but the children are adorable and the staff is always helpful.
good,"workplace culture"
good,working at carters was great because i love kids so i figured it would be a good fit for me. while working there yes i was only temporary i still think i should have got hired on but its okay we all make mistakes. if your someone interested in working at caters i would tell you go ahead just keep in mind there's a lot of kids running around so if you don't like kids this job isn't for you.
good,"Environment is great , stressful at times depending on your DM . They have good benefits for managers and good discount for employees. Can be tricky when HR gets involved."
good,"I loved this job. It was my first and it was very hard to leave, but I really wanted to move up in the company and it wasn't possible so I had to move on."
good,"The owner is very nice, and the customers are what make the job amazing. It's a very demanding job that requires lots of physical labor while still holding a smile on your face."
good,"Carters, Inc. was a very chill and productive environment with career employers always willing to lend a helping hand. Wanted more time with carter's."
good,"it was a great job for a starting sales associate . you could build friendships with your coworkers and customers. the managers were fun and laid back, also goal oriented and wanted nothing but the best for the store."
good,"Great Team. Friendly co-workers. Its busy, but a stress free atmosphere makes everyday all the more easier and you'll find it there. I learned some customer service skills and basics in construction/building, and supplies."
good,Carters open me up to a different form of work. I enjoyed the curiosity of learning something new and being in a warehouse. It was somewhat my first real job and I enjoyed it there. Work was always fast at all times.
good,"When you walk in you are greeted by your managers. I've learned how to manage and angry customer, and how to calm them down. Management is great and super flexible. They are easy going, but also can get down to business. My co-workers are great. There is never any drama and we all know what we have to do to get the job done. The hardest part of the job is having that one mean customer that tries to ruin your day, but the most enjoyable part is getting to watch new mommies pick out the cutest outfits for their new baby."
good,Everyday no matter how challenging our day may be our main focus is always our customers. Since I have become a supervisor I have learned how important it is to look at the big picture. The hardest part of my job is balancing all of our tasks on the days we do not have enough coverage. The most enjoyable part of my job is talking to all of the mothers that come into the store. Helping them shop and relating to one another is always a good time!
good,"I loved working at Carter's/Oshkosh Retail. I enjoyed assisting customers, new and regular, in the store to find what they were looking for and building relationships each day with my customers. Overall, the management was nice to a certain extent. After a while, I felt they became unprofessional towards me and it started to make me feel uncomfortable. However, the most enjoyable part of my job was accomplishing my goals for the day while also making every customer's shopping experience an enjoyable one."
good,"This was such a fun job! The people that work there are super friendly and funny. The hours aren't so great, about <=10 hours a week. The work isn't hard but if you have problems interacting with people at all, I would suggest not to work here. A lot of the job is interacting with the customers for extended periods of time."
good,Nice environment to work at. Typical day consists of keeping the store neat and clean. Tending to the customers is number one job.
good,"Will usually open the store, upon opening I will make sure all sizes and all merchandise was out properly on the sales floor. Made sure the store was clean and sanitized for the kids. Once opened, greeted customers with a warm and friendly greeting. Began to assist customers with their questions and concerns, about sizes and best choices. Afterwards would ring out their transactions. The hardest part would have to be understanding all the different languages the tourist would have. The most enjoyable would be interacting with children and foreign customers learning about other countries. Overall the Carter's family was great."
good,"I loved working at Carter's/Osh Kosh Warehouse, my favourite job. the work was good and fast, the people I worked with were great absolutely loved the work environment."
good,"A typical day at work is hectic. As an assistant manager I open or close the store. My shift varies, most of the time I am the closing manager. When I open the store, I check our E -time for missed punches, I entered all missed punches, then I opened all email from the corporate office to print all the important paper works and daily sales goal.  I made the daily sales planner for the day and made sure that  who ever is scheduled for that day will get their to do list. I also prepare tills, received freights and processed them and prepared them for the sales floor. I assisted customers with the products they are looking for, and I also ran the registers.  As a  closing manager I made sure that the sales floor is recovered and that all merchandise are folded neatly or hang by sizes, and all returns are put away in their proper places.  My co workers are good people, the hardest part of my job is lifting 30 to 60 boxes to be processes, some are light 25lbs and some are 50lbs. the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to assist customers with kids find what they're looking for. I loved helping customers."
good,Very fast paced and fun. Management wasn't to bad. The store manager was very strict and to the point but it taught us time management and responsibility.

good,Productive workplace friendly staff Good management. Friendly customer base. Flexible hours and good benefits easy pace decent hours. Could use more employeesBut overall good part-time job
good,Carter's is a great place to work.  They take into consideration the associates' point of view.  Many innovative changes have come from associates' suggestions.
good,"Great place to work if you love children.  Management works closely with you to ensure you succeed and help you grow.  You must be able to stand, lift, bend and climb a ladder.  You must also be able to deal with a variety of customers and help them choose appropriate outfits and accessories geared to their needs."
good,Carter's is a great place to work. Carter's values there employees by listening to there concerns and doing its best to accommodate those concerns whenever possible
good,"The customers were usually pregnant, with children, or family members buying a gift. Whenever shipment came, we were to hang them up on racks and bring them onto the sales floor to pack out what needs to be replenished. Certain people had the responsibility of changing all sales signs within the store as well as displays on the windows and hanging from the ceiling. The store was to be cleaned every night and faced before leaving so it can look presentable for the customers the next day. We all took turns on the register unless it was a long line and we helped each other out. The manager tried to make sure we were't miserable but having a fun time while working which made working a little more easier. We had to interact with different people and give our input on what size clothes to wear, what looks better with certain clothing etc..."
good,"The company is fantastic, with wholesome values that they really stick to. The atmosphere is a great place to work, and the benefits are amazing."

Over all my time at carters was very well i would rate my experience a 5 stars."
good,"Carter's is a fun place to work, we get to work with lots of little kids. It is a perfect job for helping with the cost of schooling and they work around your class schedule so you can go to school full time while having this as a part time job."
good,"I currently work at Carter‚Äôs, and I love working there. The co-workers and the management all work great together as a team. They are flexible and understanding with schooling and the life challenges people face from time to time. When another Carter‚Äôs close by is in need of help, they work together to provide a co-worker to help out. The only downside is the pay is not enough for an expensive area, and there are not enough hours to help employees make enough money to pay bills. Working at Carter‚Äôs is a great experience but a 2nd job alongside it is a must to make enough to live off of."
good,"I helped customers as needed, worked the cash register and kept the store organized and clean. On occasion I would get called in to replenish merchandise and unload the boxes in the stock room so we knew what we had available. The hardest part about the job was dealing with difficult customers but the great thing is that each customer was a new chance to help someone out."
good,Nice place clean bathrooms. Co-workers so helpful people. Pays good but don't always get your hours till summertime. Short lunch breaks. Over all good place.

Over all I love working here because the managers and other associates are amazing and really care about what they do. The hardest part of working here can sometimes be the work load. The work is not hard but when we are closing and it is really busy, making sure everything is complete and in place for the openers can sometimes be difficult. My favorite part of my job is my coworkers and the customers, everyone is so down to earth and it makes me feel like they are all family."

good,"Absolutely loved working for Carters and the store manager Jan is amazing . I worked there for almost two years and i felt like family! If i ever needed something part time or wanted to go back to retail, I would work there."
good,"At first I was nervous because I started with barely any hours, but luckily I have an open schedule and I am fine with covering anyone that needs it and being called in last minute. So I've ended up getting almost full part time hours. Obviously if you need at least 20 hours a week, guaranteed then this isn't for you. But if you looking for a second job or some extra money while you're in school then it's perfect. They are very flexible and my managers are very considerate of your personal life, like spending time with your spouse and family. They are fun and they better you in a good way. I enjoy everyday I have to work and look forward to going."
good,"Once i clocked in i was doing what i was told , usually i would be put behind the cash register and ring up customers. Other times i would clean the cash wrap and do go backs. I sometimes closed the store as well. I learned ways to make more money for the company, for instance for every 50$ spent you earn a 10 meaning i let the customer know if u get one more item you could earn the reward if close to the goal that is.The hardest part of the job in my opinion is when we had to obtain information from the customer, but with time I've been able to achieve that obstacle."

good,"Working for Carter's was a wonderful experience. I learned a lot about the retail world and had many opportunities with the company. After several years of work I decided it was not where my heart wanted to be, I wanted to teach. So I left Carter's to return to college to obtain my teaching degree."
good,"Carters is one of the best companies I've worked for. They have a great atmosphere, friendly staff and promote within, giving all their employee growth potential."
good,"I really enjoy working at Carter's mostly because of the people. I'm not sure about other Carter's stores, but where I work everyone is funny and sweet. More than anything, the job has given me great retail experience. On a daily basis I get to do a variety of tasks from unloading shipment, to straightening the store, to helping cutovers, or vacuuming. I'm never bored and there is always a new project to be started. My mangegers are some of the funniest people I've ever met which only makes me want to work harder for them and make them proud. Because of them and my co-workers, I enjoy work. The hardest part of the job is trying to help difficult customers, but on the contrary, the best part is also working with customers.

good,"Working at Carter's was very enjoyable, it felt like hanging out with friends while doing mild chores.

good,I truly love working here. But I do not enjoy the shifts with a possibility to start earlier due to if you cant come in due to plans they do not like that. You have to be able to go to work if the schedule says you might start earlier then those days you can not make any plans.

good,I loved working here because I got to meet very wonderful people from very different cultures and backgrounds. I learned some management responsibilities. Most of my co-workers were very fun and outgoing and others were hard to get to. The hardest part of my job would have to be working with a difficult customer.

good,A typical day at work for me is coming in clocking in and getting right to work. I've really haven't learned anything that I didn't already know. The management team is very good. They communicate everything that going on within the warehouse with the employers. I would say the workplace culture is fair. There really isn't hard parts of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be getting off early when there is no work in the warehouse or/and clocking out.
good,"I've wanted to work at this place for a while & now that I have it, it's not all that's cracked up to be. if you're a sales assoc. it's fine. if your a manager or CSL there's a lot that you have to do. on the upside, its really easy to advance & this company really looks out for its own.

good,"Carters is about employee development. It is a great place to work for young or new management members. The training is the best."
good,"I honeslty loved working for this business and the people were great.  At the time the store had just opened so people were still discovering us. Even with that the hours became very sparse , and I ended up only working 3-4 hours a day maybe two days out of the week. Getting paid bi-weekly my checks would finally come in and they would be enough to pay for some gas in my tank to get there and back and some lunch really. In the end for me personally in my circumstances, a mom of a toddler whose fianc√© worked over 40 something hours to pay bills , it became more of a hindrance to work there for basically nothing .In the end it was a waste of time trying to work there when i could be working somewhere else that would at least give me some hours to better benefit my family ."
good,"Working at Carter's help me improve my Customer Service skills and I got to work work friendly, hard working people. The managers were very supportive and provide you with everything you need to be successful"

good,"I have worked at Carters since August of 2015. I started out as a temporary sales associate, mostly for the holidays, and because I just needed some extra money while going through college. After the holidays the company graciously decided to make me a permanent sales associate. They continued to work with my educational schedule, as well as my coworkers' schedules, allowing us time off to study and visit family during the holidays. After a while, I needed a second job to pay my bills, given that I had just moved into my first house. I worked at Walmart as a nearly full time cashier, and still, Carters worked with that schedule as well. I was offered a promotion at Carters and I gladly accepted, allowing me a 16% pay raise increase, and a new job title of Part Time Supervisor. I continue to work there as I have made a second family with my coworkers and management team."
