rating,review
bad,Worked for gamestop for 4 years is was ok at start but then kept getting worse. Unrealistic targets and your hours get cut to minimum if not met. No job security and management are intimidating bully. Also found that the company is very sexsist and money hunger.
bad,"If you want a career, don’t work for GameStop. This place literally uses employees and customers to the maximum for their own benefit. You will not receive commissions on getting membership signups, however they will push you to keep selling the pro membership. Most people don’t want the new membership as it has less benefits and isn’t worth it. Seriously, go flip burgers."
bad,Dl was all about personal interest  not fair to women . Valued male employees over all others. Made me work after being robbed . Wrote me up for being clocked in while at police station filing report. Fired all of my key holders the week of the switch launch and wrote me up for going into overtime since other stores would not lend staff. Was a great job I always met or exceeded expectations. Even won customer service awards but still treated like garbage for being female
bad,"Since competitors are putting them out of business, those up top are afraid to lose their spot to new people so they do all they can to get results out of you and take the results for themselves and will go so far as to set you up and blame things on you that are their fault. Worst company ever."
bad,As a store manager you're overworked while your team gets maybe 15 hrs a week...maybe. They find reasons every year to not give raises or bonuses. They still hire at 7.25. If you arent harassin1g every xustomer with 50 thousnd things then they fire you
bad,Unwilling to accommodate family medical emergencies and other issues that may arise. Unable to revise schedules easily and offer no benefits and low pay
bad,"Low wages, poor management, senior management "
bad,"Gamestop sets unrealistic goals as the company scrambles to cover promises to investors and shareholders at the expense of customer satisfaction and that of its employees. It's all about their metrics."
bad,"It's cool to sell video games and what not but this company doesnt look at your hard work they are only focused on numbers $"
bad,"In an ever changing and growing market, the company has not, or ever, been able to create a sense of direction, sustainability or investment into the employees. "
bad,"Tenetevi lontano da questa multinazionale che sfrutta i lavoratori."
bad,Unfortunately a horrible experience and horrible company.  NO concern for employees or the effect the corporate office decisions have on others.  Would not recommend this company to anyone.
bad,The low pay rate and high expectations of sales with the threat of being fired daily isnt worth the stress. Calling HR never works when treated unfairly. The company is dying in the industry and you as an associate will get punished for it regardless of whether you make sales goal or not.
bad,I dont have anything nice to say. so i wish to say nothing. the rest of this will be random words to fill the required characters to move on. watermelon.
bad,"the corporate does not care for its emplyees and onl care about sales, the store that i worked at was great, but the higher ups were on a power trip, and that ws not good at all"
bad,If you want to enjoy this company stay as a GA. Once you get into SGA and above the amount of responsibilities that you have compared to the pay is awful. Been here 4 years. It use to be fun but now the company is deep in trying to save itself it forgot how to treat employees well.
bad,"This isn't a very good company to work for if you want a living wage. It is VERY rare to have good upper management. Corporate often tries to get people to stretch beyond their limits to achieve typically unrealistic goals. There are very rarely enough hours given to actually run a functional store, and more often than not, managers are corrupt and abuse the little power they are allowed."
bad,"From the start, my manager would call me in early and/or stay late, often both, and then leave or come in late. Poor treatment of employees is reflected by the fact that no one cares about the quality of their work. I was blatantly harassed by my manager, even after speaking with him about it, often in front of customers."
bad,"GameStop has an enormous turnover rate, they don’t treat their employees very well at all. It was a frustrating experience working there, and I would not recommend it."
bad,"They had about a 5 week waiting time to avoid hiring people to early for there ""seasonal position."" So I go in for a interview waited  3 weeks and only then do I hear back saying they wished to hire me, then after I drove to the store early to finish my paper work I was not ask *nor did I think* about bring my direct deposit information. So I drive back to my house get the information and realize I can finish the application at home to avoid wasting my time so I get to the information page and start to work it out before reaching to where the system would not allow me to put in any of the information even tho it was all correct. Finally I call back up there to be told if I cant make it back up there today then they would not be able to hire. *complete waste of time.*"
bad,"Time at work could consist of either event planning/ hosting, pushing hard on sales (add-ons etc,) Taking in and processing shipment, answering phone calls, providing assistance to upset or confused customers."
bad,"This was one of the worst racist,backstabbing companies I have ever worked for. Totally was a waste of time. The money wasn't good and the people who you work with were so backstabbing it's a wonder anything got done from the hate they should."
bad,was treated extremely poorly as the company began its downfall. the company continues to lie and treat its employees and customers like garbage. Was never given the opportunities i was promised.
bad,"In my four months at GameStop, I was only able to work five total days. They kept their managers working over regular employees. The job was extremely mundane, and few customers came in."
bad,Run as far as u can. Worst job I ever had company is terrible management just terrible everything is terrible. Gamestop need to be out business asap..
bad,Horrible. No room to grow. Many opportunities for promotions within but they always chose outside when manager on duty would promise promotion. Very inconsiderate with their relationships with their workers and request unreasonable sells numbers on limited hours.
bad,would never go back even as a customer. had you as new hire pass out flyers on the stores busiest day instead of helping customers asking me for help. for 13 hrs. on black Friday. I deem this highly unprofessional  I have had jobs my first day I was almost put in charge of the store and for anybody to be treated like this on there first day is beyond unbelievable.
bad,This is not a job for anyone looking to make real money or have a work life balance. Perfect job for a teenager just starting out who wants to be able to play a game for 3 days without buying it. This job deals with a very difficult stubborn demographic of people. The pay is mediocre and the benefits are nonexistent. Great starter job at minimum wage for a first time job holder!
bad,"Gamestop won't be around much longer, that much is obvious now. When I left the writing was on the wall that it was failing. Associates got yelled at for not meeting sales figures; were and are threatened to be fired if numbers don't improve. What it really boils down to, is gamestop is getting blockbuster'd and corporate is blaming a massive shift in the market on associates. You need to stay very far away from modern gamestop, as a customer and especially as a potential employee."
bad,Do not work for this company that makes its money from ripping off customers and associates below the store manager level. This is afew years ill never get back.
bad,"This place is a joke. Gamestop constantly changes their own rules making it harder on employees. I'm not one of the 15 dollar minimum people. But gamestop doesn't want retail staff. They want actual sales people. With that comes proper salaries, bonus, and incentives. The discount is a joke. The management have absolutely zero clue about gaming culture and nothing we do works. The company is bombing.from a"
bad,It’s terrible a terrible company that sets over the top goals that are impossible to meet without being sleazy. Little to no compensation for your work and effort.
bad,Was my first job and was the worst thing ever. Management was awful and talked bad about the employees constantly. Would never give me any days to work and the pay was terrible for the minimum work they would give. They didn't schedule me to work for 2 months and eventually said I was fired
bad,"Seems odd because I do like video games. But Gamestop is the worst company I have every worked for. With in the first 2-3 months of working for them they began to threaten my job for everything. Missed preorder numbers for the week, ""you might not have a job next week"""
bad,"Corporate doesn’t give a s*** about you, commissioned based sales quotas with no commission for incentive, your commission is you get to keep your job"
bad,"Horrible management. Not enough pay. No commission but you have to push certain products. All in all, this is a terrible place to work. It's a waste of your time really. Sexist upper management so if you are a female you will get no where with this company and if you do, you are treated horribly. The hours are designed for high school students and you have to be 18 to apply."
bad,I mean look at the stock they just cut hours to the point where you can not even go to the bathroom because for a 9 hour shift you are alone 6 and a half hours
bad,If I could give this place 1 star I would. DM's are ridiculous! They allow managers to micromanage a store. The SGA's do all the work and the ASM & Managers get ALL the credit! Poor GA's are lucky if they ever get more than 6hrs a week.  I can't wait until this company closes!!
bad,"Working for GAMESTOP was a joke , they make you work y for no reason ,they dont even know what to do or eves how to do they own  work and  always is your faul"
bad,"My experience at Gamestop was confusing. At first working here was a fun and learning experience. Then you start to realize that no one cares about anyone except upper management. What I mean by that is you are working in a fast pace, high cash and low security environment. What I mean by that is if you are an opening employee you are there solo. You carry out cash deposits SOLO to the bank for one. Also you are alone in the store until 1 or 2 in the afternoon. Then that employee is alone from 4 to six that evening."
bad,"Nothing is ever good enough, no matter how hard you work it does not matter. They violate many government policies but you can't do nothing because they will let you go."
bad,Gamestop will squeeze their workers for everything they are worth and believe in a mentality that they do nothing wrong. Gamestop loves to do things that are counter productive and blame their workers when something goes wrong.
bad,"I've been with this company for 11 years and at first it was fun just talking to people and helping them pick games out and such...but now...I wouldn't waste my time working there!!! "
bad,"GameStop is not a company I would recommend anyone join.  It is very competitive, which in itself is not a bad thing, but there is not actual incentive for doing better at your job.  The only upside to the job is the discounts/free merch that you can sometimes get as an employee, and the pay is not great even at higher levels.  The job hours were inconsistent, almost never the same days or hours worked.  My previous manager there, who i told I could not live on minimum wage at 20 hours a week, I told him I would be looking for a second job to make ends meet.  He apparently didnt like that, and started cutting more and more of my hours.  Eventually, my last month there I worked a total of 15 minutes for the entire month.  My last paycheck was literally 2 pennies.  When I confronted my manager about this, he didnt state that he would help with putting me on the schedule or anything like that.  So I officially 'resigned' from gamestop, Yes, he made me right out an actual resignation letter to leave an hourly position as a Game Advisor, the lowest tier job other than temp."
bad,Too high of expectations placed on associates for truly poor pay.  Constant additions to your work load without proper infrastructure or support from the corporate end of the business.
bad,I worked there for seasonal work and the managers are incompetent and scheduling is garbage. Never knew when I was scheduled to work and they never had it posted.
bad,You will not get very many hours and you will not get paid very much money and you will not ever get promoted.  However- the game discounts are pretty cool.
bad,"GameStop managers play favorites. They over work you and move you around without any questions, like you really don’t have a choice. They will call you in on your off day after working 9 days straight to go work someone’s else location then get mad at you for going into overtime. It’s not worth it."
bad,Poor management. Too many employees and they are often unreliable without accountability. This company started going down hill a long time ago and they treat their employees horrible.
bad,I  personally don't know what to say to this job since work ethic in this location was poorly done and co-workers constant call out and your managers don't really care aslong you meet their quota
bad,"Get ready to stare at a wall of games you cant play and alphabetize them, then watch while some customer destroys the wall and you cry a little knowing the manager is going to come out and see the destroyed wall as soon as the customer leaves and punishes you for it. After that you can look forward to getting your hours cut in correlation with the amount of preorders that you cant sell because customers don't want it."
bad,When I first started working it was a blast but as the focus shifted form games to collectables the quality of work environment became extremely toxic.
bad,"Pessima formazione in fase di stage, disorganizzazione completa a tutti i livelli, nessuna possibilità di fare carriera, colleghi maligni e pettegoli."
bad,"It did not take me long to get this position. It was fine once I first started work here, however it went downhill when I wasn't allowed to be flexible. I spoke with management about my availability, which was completed ignore after months of working here. Pay is VERY low. I should've listed to the workers on my daily trips to GS. Don't. Do. It."
bad,"Make your numbers or they’ll let you go. My district manager really said if you’re here for the money just leave, same guy who hires girls because they sell more. Underpaid and find out 2 other people who know far less get more than me. Corporate sends stuff for the manager to share with the staff only for her to keep it. Got a 50 dollar gift card and unless the assistant said something would’ve have kept it also. When  I got a second job because they keep cutting hours due to poor sales, they cut my entire shift so now I don’t get paid at all. Poorly run company with a backstabbing staff."
bad,"Yes Gamestop is considered to be a forerunner in the gaming and tech market however, for no full time positions besides already entrenched managers..."
bad,"They promote people based on how willing they are to blindly follow abusive policies and suck up to their superiors instead of based on quality of work. You are likely to be fired/reprimanded for doing exactly what you are told because someone above you has personal issues with you. This happemed to not only myself but also the assistant mamager who trained me, who was legitimately the hardest working individual I've ever met but he was driven out of the ckmpany because the DM didn't like him."
bad,Gamestop cares about their future.  Not yours!!!!!   Their Circle of Life selling culture is a blatant rip off of other companies with a Disney label.
bad,bruh dont work here this place is awful and the company is going under just look at their stocks lmao XD. with the rise in digital downloading this joint aint gonna last much longer
bad,"From the Regional to District Leaders, they use manipulative tactics to influence employees mindset and maintain a cattle herd mentality for you to stay and be a drone. They want you to embrace their culture so you can be contained in four walls and not let your abilities flourish. The selection process for choosing upcoming candidates to represent the brand are slapdash at best. The training structure for employees is not real world applicable. You will not have the necessary skills to help further develop your entire self and become successful if you step into a closed minded setting for your life."
bad,"Management does nothing but harass you about sales goals and expects you to attack with every sale in the book making customers annoyed and uncomfortable.and yet are yelled at for not achieving sales goals when you have no time to complete them. As a Sales Associate you recieve, on average, about 12 hours every 2 weeks  it's very low pay with major responsibility. Long story short I don't suggest working for this company unless you want to waste your time."
bad,"I’ve been working at the company for 2 year ...favoritism is everything at this company and your efforts are not acknowledged if you’re not the favorite ..the pay is bad too ,company ask too much of workers without rewards"
bad,"gamestop pressures their employees to sell every single thing in the store to every single customer, making both customers and employees uncomfortable. Pay is terrible, hours are worse."
bad,The place is horrible to work for! If you want to try to get somewhere... Guess what? You dont! They will pick favorites! And even if you tried your hardest! They will pick you up and throw you back down! The pay was horrible! And they won’t even train you good! I was missing a lot of training because nobody would train me! Just don’t apply! You’ll have a horrible time! Plus you have to upsell games! And if you don’t! You will get into trouble!
bad,push add ons and sales down customers mouth sales sales sales low hours low pay management is awful just not a good place to work at all do not work here it will make your love of gaming a chore
bad,There are typically six quotas you have to meet daily. I was at an awful location. Management tried to only work me 6 hours a week spread out over three days.
bad,"Tänk efter innan ni söker jobb här. Inte mycket som går rätt till. Lagar följs inte, mycket bullsh*t osv. "
bad,"I worked at gamestop for 3 years and loved it initially. It was fun working with guests and with coworkers at the store level, but not so much when it came to the higher ups. Projects due in heavily restricted time periods. I.E Projects that require 4 or more hours to complete but only given an hour to do it. I was an assistant manager for almost 1 year. When I was promoted from SGA to ASL I only got a dollar raise for double or triple the workload added on. 32 hours minimum 40 hours max. No overtime whatsoever, if you do go over 40 hours by even a minute, literally... your district leader will write you up. Depending on your district leader. After 3 years of working at Gamestop (I have never had a disciplinary action against me,) I was terminated without warning for handcounting an inventory count instead of scanning the project because that was how my manager trained me. The employee discount is 15% off new and used items. But not on new consoles. It does not stack with nice sales, usually the sales are better than your discount. But the discount does stack with a membership. An extra 10% off used items."
bad,They provided very few hours. They do not give a schedule enough time in advance. They make promises but then do not follow through. This is the worst place I have ever worked. They provided maybe 4 hours a month while I was there and refused to let me know when I was scheduled to work until after the day passed and considered me a no call/no show. They also called my next job and attempted to get me in trouble with them as well. Promised that they didn't care about sales when I was hired but then started telling me I needed to sell more of a specific item.
bad,Company does not care about their employees . They allow certain individuals to advance when there is better qualified people . It is about who you know. They drive numbers down your throat and make you harass customers.
bad,A work day can include questionable metric goals. Leadership is on razor wire and it passes stress down hill. No training is truly given to help middle management and you could be left working busy shifts under manned and the stores can be disheveled.
bad,"needs improvement very unprofessional, employer fails employees, unwilling to train properly. bad commination skills as well as customer service skills"
bad,My time was waisted i learned on my own and under a year i became assisstant manager not hard not worth the stress and the compensation is a joke. Wish i never took the job or the two promotions thinking that things could possibly get better.
bad,"I barely got any hours, even as a full time employee, and I was accused of theft at a store with no cameras and no evidence pointed towards me. When I quit to go to another store, I wasn't rehireable due to this. They're going out of business for a reason."
bad,was stuck working maybe 8 hors a week if i was lucky they never had me do anything other than clean the store and organize all the games wouldnt recomend to anyone
bad,Management is awful and the pay rate is way too low for what they expect of you. When you have an issue with your manager there is nothing that the upper management does with it. They expect you to solve all the issues on your own or just accept the fact the things are the way they are.
bad,I worked hard for this company for 3 years. I kept getting false promises of promotions. As a guest adviser i had no benefits except a small discount on purchases. This was the absolute worst company to work for. I would never recommend anyone to work for this company.
bad,The people I worked with were rude to me but also its not where I live now so not all GameStop’s are the same. I’m sure this company is good to work with just not where I was at.
bad,It's really cool to be able to try games out and have the small discount they give. But it's difficult to advance due to favoritism.The pay is minimum and the stress maximum (if you're a hard worker). Hours aren't guaranteed
bad,"Man the register, organize games in alphabetical order after the kids make a mess of them, and stay late vacuuming the store. If you think it's be a fun, easy-going job where you get to talk about video-games, you're wrong."
bad,"Poor management will kill any drive or motivation in a workplace, and Gamestop is a prime example of this. I left because I couldn't work for someone who only looked out for them."
bad,"This job was the absolute worst. When I first started it was okay, talking about games with people and the discount was nice, but the only thing the company cares about is numbers. They will look for any excuse to fire their employees if you went over on your hours you were written up, if you made a small but correctable mistake on a sale or trade you were either written up or fired on the spot. I had been there since 2014 and only had a dollar pay raise. The discounts aren't even worth the job. The manager will put out one schedule, then put out 6 more within the week. There is absolutely no structure to this business. Nothing ever gets accomplished and if you are the last one to leave for the night or the person to open then you get blamed. Don't let ANY employee tell you that GameStop is a fun job to have, they are lying and are only looking for a sucker as their replacement."
bad,"I worked here for a holiday season and it was terrible. The manager hired me to fill in for other employees taking time off. It must have been over staffed because I was only ever scheduled for midnight releases, black Friday, cyber Monday and days before and after holidays. I tried my best to get full time or a larger portion of steady hours. End of the season I was let go because I wasn't making a big enough improvement to the stores sales numbers. Because 90% of the time I wasn't scheduled to work."
bad,The job will teach you quite a bit but you aren't paid for what you're taught. Corporate asks so much from you and your team but won't give the hours to complete them.
bad,"Gamestop's management if very mismatched and mishandled, their training is a joke, and they punish you for good customer service, For example it's punishable to approach an individual who's visibly uncomfortable being approached, be it by a ""sales vulture"" or just someone in general. The Hours are sparatic and mismatched which means you will have no sleep schedule and may be often called upon to work double shifts often (mandatory by the way) and so much more."
bad,You will be bullied to meet sales quotas despite a severe lack of customers to begin with. Customers come in angry half of the time because of GameStop's rules that the employees simply have to follow. Do not work for this company it is an incredibly unpleasant workplace whether you love games or not.
bad,This was suppose to be a gamer's dream job but it isn't. The benefits are terrible. The hours you get at work is based on your quota. If you're quota remains a consistent low you have a high chance of losing your job. Do not recommend working here.
bad,"will never ever work for that company again, it's a game store that's lost its existence of a game store. The pressure to gain preorders and sell cards all of it was just dumb."
bad,"- Poor Pay"
bad,"If you are not on par with what they give you or how they treat you, they'll treat you like you're insane and give you hints on seeking professional help when its literally the leadership quality that is lacking. Its cut throat, if your numbers isnt looking great, kiss your hours goodbye. No one tells you if youre doing a good job or not, theyll go out of their way to take your hours til you choose to quit. Its pathetic and i hope people begin to realize that the job culture there is a monstrosity."
bad,"Sales rep with little to no hours, all favoritism. Not worth work for the company even if you like video games. no real benefits to work for the company"
bad,"Key holder for 4 years"
bad,"Extremely strict on preorders. You have to harass your customer constantly. Talk up used over new. You have to lack a heart and strong salesmanship really, if you try to simply help someone you will be in trouble."
bad,Couldn't keep a manager for more then a month or 2. all the work gets placed on you. always getting called out on doing something that i know was done correctly
bad,Gamestop has no sells compensation to motivate employees they're all for the gain of the company and the manager. everyone else fights for low hours each store is given a month and low pay.
bad,I wouldn't recommend gamestop for any one the pay is bad. the store leaders don't really give you a chance to go your own way. and for part time its minimum wage.
bad,"very high demands with no compensation or incentive for employees to actually be better. they give you too much to do - always change procedures. more than likely, when you finally learn how to do something they will change it next week. the pay is the worst for what they ask you to do. people only work here because they are in high school and dont pay their own rent (which would be impossible off of a gamestop salary) or they do it as part time to get the discounts."
bad,"Inconsistent hours, management takes all the hours for themselves, higher ups demand you lie to your customers to make a sale, No time for breaks if ever DO NOT ever work there"
bad,"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,"
bad,"Get ready for executives that don't understand the customer base and customers that blame you for the stuff executives force you to do. Gamestop is a lose/lose situation for the employee at most levels and locations. You either don't work enough or work too much. Missing goals are always, always, always held against you. And be prepared to hear the same hour long block of extended marketing ads masquerading as television programming for a month straight until they switch it out for the new month. If you love games stay away from working at Gamestop, it will actually make you depressed."
bad,"Again, I do not agree with forcing people to review their old employers. What if it was a negative experience and they do not want to risk someone who could identify them?"
bad,They say the value their employees but they don't. You hours are based on a number system of what you sell. The things they push to sell are no longer prevelent in our curry technological age.
bad,"As a long time manager, I would say this job is not worth the stress. Underpaid, overworked, micro-managed, and consistently threatened by higher-ups to either fire any person who does not hit a unrealistic sales goal or to hire new people and eventually fire them for the same reason. I would not recommend working here to anyone."
bad,"I worked here for just over a year and came in as the ONLY non-management when I started. Initial boss was wonderful, responsive to questions and VERY helpful. Leaving boss was overbearing, unhelpful and rude. I was hired for part-time initially but barely worked 10 hours a week after my starting boss left (for a better paying job mind you). My ASM was wonderful and always helpful and trying to get me to get a promotion because they felt like I deserved it after showing them my initiative. Instead DM/RM hired OUTSIDE of the store. Did not enjoy working here and being talked down to."
bad,"none of the management cared about the wellbeing of other employees. Employees are paid minimum wage, but are expected to be responsible for tasks that are assigned to assistant managers. It was a borderline racist environment, and entirely toxic."
bad,"This is an awful company to work for, even for retail.  Employee safety does not matter, pay is low, and your job is always dangled in front of you thanks to unrealistic sales goals."
bad,"Perhaps not the case everywhere, but certainly under the South Bay SD region district manager once you more into a supervisory position. Often bullied and yelled at, uncompensated for overtime (time was edited by higher ups) despite overwhelming amount of work with never enough hours or manpower. This is the experience at a busier store, supervisory level. Entry level at low traffic stores was a breeze."
bad,Management was very bad as well as the way the store was being run customer service was nonexistent work hours were very low sometimes there was none at all
bad,"Gamestop is an enigma. Video game and pop culture thinly vail atrocious management, terrible pay, and a poor work environment. Great for a first time gig I suppose. But stay clear for any professional or long-term prospects. A glorified pawnshop that preys on the ignorance of children and their parents."
bad,Stress levels way too high. Unrealistic expectations. Company is failing. Upper management doesn't listen or care about you. Company doesn't truly value its customers.
bad,this company its about profit at the cost of the manager and their employees no consideration or respect for the manager and will dismiss the employees for their own personal vendetta. No opportunity for growth if you are not in their inner circle.
bad,I would not work there if I were you there are to many reasons why you should not but these are a few.you do not get paid much as a sl I was only making twenty one thousand a year.they are constantly sending merch that will not sell but require that you do. You have to sell a set number of game warranties a set number of  preowned games a set number of preowned systems a set number of system warranties  a set amount of trades a set number power up cards in its three variants sell a set number of collectible items and to get a set amount of pre orders and that is every week. That is on every transactions you have to try to get each of those.you have to bully each customer every time to get them to buy these things . It’s hard to sell someone a preowned copy of grand theft auto five for 54.99 and a 3 dollar game protection guarantee  when the new copy will be on sale for 29.99 and this happens often. I do no recommend working for this company.
bad,"It's a good starting job, but other then that not good for anything else. I worked there when I was in high school, but I can't see how any adult could ever work there. The hours are not enough, the pay is not work the troubles you have to go through. You don't really learn anything from it. It's a good starting job, but I would never pursue a career."
bad,"Gamestop knows you want to work at a videogame store.  Because of that they will always pay you minimum wage, yearly raises that can be under 10 cents even upon a very successful year in review, and you will be fired immediately without an investigation even if you aren't in the wrong, because you are cheap to replace.  No self respecting human being should work here."
bad,"The regional managers truly believe that they are better than anyone else. The teams aren't recognized for jobs well done, but rather made to feel as a number on paper."
bad,"En extremt bra arbetsplats som tyvärr misslyckas i ledarskapen. Företaget prioriterar alltid billig arbetskraft framför bra arbetskraft vilket gör att folk som ej har erfarenhet blir placerade som chefer. Sverige chefen är bland den bästa chef du någonsin kommer träffa men när det kommer till placeringen av butikschefer runt om i landet så fungerar det tyvärr ej. "
bad,"Do not work there. They do not care about their employees. You work to only meet sales quotas, which determine the hours you receive at the job. Not worth the headache."
bad,"GameStop is a company that is all about increasing number in any way possible. Most often it is at the expense of the customer or the employee."
bad,5 years of my life I am never getting back. NOTHING is good about working for GameStop. VERY poor Senior Management. They say that base everything on behaviors but this is not true. You can display all of the expected behaviors and they will still threaten your job based on certain metric numbers. They can't stick with one plan long enough for it to work. They say they are evolving but they are not they are going backwards and will not be around for much longer. This will not be based on the products they sell but the way they manage the business. Worst pay with horrible overly expensive benefits.You can be a top performer yet they will treat you like you are lucky to be employed by them.
bad,"I had multiple HR issues with this company that were never taken seriously. The hours were outrageous for one manager. Payroll was constantly cut and you are expected to work those hours cut. You are one person doing the job of 5 with no help from management. If you are sexually harassing, you are reprimanded for reporting it."
bad,"Between bullying management, unreasonable demands and complete lack of security, Gamestop is about as bad a retail work environment as you can get. I wouldn't go back to work there if my life depended on it. All about the money. Meet the sales quotas, no matter what, or you're gone."
bad,Gamestop is a joke. they barely take care of there own only cause they have to otherwise no one would work there. I did not like the fact that game stop preys on their customers .
bad,"Managers do their best, and co workers are the best part of the job. However, corporate makes the job nearly unbearable. Tasks upon tasks with no allowance in payroll to complete them, on top of a changing in focus to collectibles rather than games to try and stay afloat."
bad,a lot of nepotism if you are not part of their friends group then you will not move up in advancement the customer where all great but this is not a job I would tell someone to go and work I even stopped buying my games there after I found out the truths behind this company
bad,"Every week it was nothing but complaints, no matter how well you were actually doing. The worst part was being told to flat out lie to your customers and then being reprimanded when the customer found out. The management on a district level is actually great but the up and ups do nothing but degrade and bash until you crack."
bad,"Terrible pay, no breaks for managers, and if you are a female expect to be harassed even by managers and coworkers. If you complain they will move you to another store, where it will happen again. Then eventually they will move you out of the company."
bad,"The company struggles to know what actually leads to positive results. Despite having no connection to the field, upper management insists that they know what is best for each store in every area. The brick and mortar aspect of the stores is overlooked for corporate based solutions that do not work, and an ever changing method to achieving success while refusing to be accountable for past and present failures."
bad,"They expect so much from you and return you get little to no hours. 10 hours a week isn't anything. If your good at your job, your boss gets the cred."
bad,"company sucked didnt care about its employees, upper management lied to its employees, upper management gave out personal information. racist managers"
bad,"Poor management, manager lacked people skills, always made everyone else stay up front while they stayed in the back playing on phone. Pretty much made all the other employees do their job."
bad,"just do your research go to youtube and Watch the videos. my experience was bad, just for saying that I was going to study they lower my hours to 3 bi weekly."
bad,"I did not enjoy working here whatsoever. No holidays off, No paid vacations.I wouldn't recommend this place as career. However its a great stepping stone to get entry level skills needed in today's workforce.I would recommend this job to college or young professionals."
bad,"working for gamestop was the worst, long hours no vacations and I was a store manager the only good thing about working there didn't even come from Gamestop itself, the free merchandise was from vendors"
bad,"started with intent to become full manager, poor schedule, favoritism among staff. was never actually let go, simply wasn't scheduled to work at all for over 6 months. considering recent news stories, im better off."
bad,"it was a really cool place, with cool people who came to buy games, the other workers were nice, and i love video games so it was like a dream come true."
bad,They work you half to death for low wages and lie on you. I really do not want to write a review just look for a job but this is all that I have to say.
bad,"I never saw my manager and I was hired as a e-commerce specialists but never got to do it. Despite asking for things to do, there would be times where I sat at my desk and did nothing."
bad,"this job is for a person who doesnt need a job. they dont pay well, the store i worked at smelled like dead fish, and the store was always dead. the manager was nice but the customers were rude."
bad,"It was cool working here as my first job, but after almost 2 years and gaining a bunch of knowledge about the management food chain and job advancement path, i was able to see that nobody moved anywhere. Where you started is where you will stay."
bad,"I honestly hated  this job. I love games and enjoyed the customer service aspect of it because talking to customers was easy, but the management were always awful. They threaten to fire you if you don't make the sales quota they force on you."
bad,"If you like sales this jobs for you. Managements terrible. If you start as seasonal expect to start at 8-10 hours a week. If you're not bugging every single person that walks in the door about offers and sales pitches, don't expect to be there long. In my opinion if you're walking through the doors of ""Game""stop you know exactly what you're there for."
bad,"Horrible treatment of employees. Get write-ups for not selling things people don't want to them. If you don't hit your ""numbers"" for the week you will get written up and ""coached"". Hands down the worst work environment I have ever been in. I don't think a job has ever cause me as much stress and lack of sleep as Gamestop did."
bad,"They hired me but they very rarely put me on the schedule. The manager kept forgetting about my existence. When I work, they will not allow me to take breaks because of the fact that I work for less than five hours."
bad,"I've been working at Gamestop for about three years now. Though I've enjoyed working with most of the people I've worked alongside and had many great experiences helping customers, the lack of decent pay and the inconsistent schedule has made it a miserable, stressful, and unstable work experience. The business practices and policies of the company are questionable and hard to follow without feeling like my personal beliefs on how to treat customers are being violated. There is a cult-like atmosphere generated by the company that makes me feel uncomfortable. The company stresses putting the needs of customers first and ""protecting the family"" which they believe the customers are a part of. They do this all while pushing sales of unnecessary add-ons, insurance plans that penny and dime their customers to their own ends, and insisting on consistent preowned sales that do little to no benefit to customers who don't want preowned products let alone trust their legitimacy. While they've never done anything that made me feel unsafe working there, the company standards always felt disingenuous and unfaithful to the interest of the public. I don't recommend working for Gamestop to anyone, as there are far better retailers to be associated with, and that is not a high bar to set, in my honest opinion."
bad,"I never received hours while as a seasonal associate and the manager, ""KAG"" as he called himself would never communicate with me even though I would call almost every day to try and work."
bad,"high targets with not 1 cent commission. You get nothing for hitting your targets , If you don't hit them they cut your hours."
bad,Do not care about employees at all. Same workload as a store manager minus a decent pay or recognition. Current employee but my days are numbered here due to lack of management.
bad,Days were simple not hard but management made everything terrible.  The in store management was fine it was corporate that really made the job super stressful.  You had mandatory sales numbers which sometimes were completely unreasonable and no benefit for hitting them other than you can keep your job.
bad,"This Position was my first real job and i despised it, It was incredibly out of the way and i had to take long trips to get there. The atmosphere was morgue like and i didn't really do anything while also getting busy work by middle management"
bad,"I would never recommend someone to work here. Its stressful and not worth the pay. poor work-life balance also. Do not work here for the reason that ""you like games"" its a bad reason to work for this company."
bad,"Environment of sexism directed at female gamers was apparent and came from both employees, management, and customers alike. Prices were unfair, rules rarely made sense, and there was no accountability. Pay is low and not worth the time."
bad,I got the job there because i knew someone that worked there and i enjoyed for some parts but the rest was so boring and the manager i had was very rude and very disrespectful to me.
bad,"Barely paid for the work you're required to do. Hours aren't reliable and you're probably never going to get a raise. It can be fun working there if you work with the right people, but usually it's the worst. Corporate has unrealistic expectations of employees and doesn't remotely care about anyone's well being."
bad,Honestly I don't think it's bad company to work for.  It's the management.  The district manager that I worked under was the most inconsistent and naïve person I've ever worked for in my life. I'm ashamed to list her as my last manager for I know that she would not rate my work ethic fairly.
bad,"Terrible place to work. Management is always breathing down your throat. Comission-based system, but you don't earn comission. Almost always single coverage. Can't go to the bathroom unless another worker is in the store."
bad,"terrible everything. Low hours, low wages, poor management, sexism, and high turnover. Would not recommend to anyone but a high school student, or a hardcore collector looking for discounts."
bad,"Can't say much good about working for gamestop. The GM at this location made that nigh impossible. Had to be on the phone with HR on a regular basis. Trying to deal with everything going on there. Enjoyed working with customers, helping them out etc. Did not enjoy having to lie to customers about what we had in stock though, when certain items would go on sale. Overall, not a trustworthy company by any means, truly wish I could say something better about the company as a whole. I learned that no matter how hard you try, certain people will always hold a higher position in a retail environment and there will always be one side picked over another, that there is no such thing as fair in a retail environment."
bad,My time with the company started out quite fantastic and I only owe that to my hiring manager and the crew that I started with. The longer that I was with the company the more horrific things became. Customers became such a low priority that almost all of our interactions were scripted.
bad,This company is hunger driven by pre orders and credit card accounts. If you can make your store manager happy so they can make their DM happy youll be fine but youll have to be a slave in the process
bad,I actually went to work there hoping to start a career in the field I love Gaming. The managers keep the Hours for themselves . I average hors per week was 4 maybe 5 hours maybe 2 days a week if I was lucky.i would get paid for 8 to 10 hours a pay period. Please know how can anyone honestly work those hours and live fulfilled.
bad,"I will never work for GameStop ever again. I worked 4 hours a day 1 or 2 days a week. How is anyone supposed to support a family on those hours at minimum wage? Then if you don't have the right ""numbers"" they give you write ups and threaten your job that you need to survive."
bad,"You would think a Game place would be a great place to work. However the reality is much different. Upper management, has no clue as to what goes on in stores and expects the stores to achieve unrealistic sales goals on the sales of magazines. However, this is based off of some years ago and I hope this has changed for the better!"
bad,it felt like i got trained then the seasonal period was over. i was only there for like a month. i also didn't get any hours. most of the time i was looking at a computer guessing what to do.
bad,"I worked in different gamestops all over the bronx and harlem and all i can say is bad about it but it is all the truth. They pay you minimum wage to do 10 jobs at once and expect you to get everything done which is honestly impossible. If you like to be treated like garbage by guests and management, overworked for very little money, forced to practice very shady bussiness strategies (steal the guests money without actually stealing it), forced to come into work on your days off, threatened to be fired or hours cut, sexually harassed by managers or district managers or higher above, no future, harass for every little thing ,and deal with a bunch of stuff that is honestly inhumane to any work place then Gamestop is the place for you."
bad,The thing with this company is that they dont care about the employees at all. The manager once told everybody that if someone comes with a gun at you you have to risk your own life to save the store. If you are a woman the manager will make you work more than the male employees and if something happens in the store even if you were off everybody gets fired but the manager.
bad,"They are not concerned with their employees, or their customers. The store is driven by bottom line and run by a management and corporate crew that is too disconnected from their stores to understand the needs and values on a customer level."
bad,I never felt like it was going anywhere. I was in constant fear that the shop was going to close.  Never felt appreciated and I would never work for this company again.
bad,"I loved the interaction with customers that came in. "
bad,Want to work for a company that changes its policy over night and can fire you for not knowing? Want to maybe work 10 hours a week and that if you are on the good side of the lazy management team of Gamestop???
bad,"Gamestop was ok for a part time position while going to school but nothing to take seriously. They expect way too much of you and dont pay nearly enough for the responsibility given. You are expected to push sales above all else, while working alone and given minimal hours to do so. You are reminded everyday that you are easily replaced."
bad,This company often abuses the help of it's employees and takes them for granted. Severely under paid for what responsibilities you are given as a key holder.
bad,The amount of responsibilities the make us take on vs. how much pay are not fair. If it we got commission then I wouldnt complain but this company is so backwards and they dont care about employees.
bad,"If you think this job is all about selling and talking about video games to customers, this job is NOT for you. This company is all about selling not just video games/systems, but EVERYTHING in the store Numbers are extremely important in this store and if you don't make your numbers, don't expect hours. The pay is very low. It's minimum wage. Unless your state has high minimum wage that's 9 or more dollars, you'll be fine. A typical day at work is just meh. You come in, welcome customers, promote deals and sales in the store and help customers look for games. You also have to constantly organize the shelf alphabetizing the video games while customers are browsing the store during store hours."
bad,This place is a nightmare to work. There are conference calls everyday about the same stuff.  Corporate does not backup store management and district and region leaders do not have realistic goals based on your area. This business is going down hill fast and will not be around much longer.
bad,"They simply don't care about you. They work you to the bone, especially if you are in management. They do not care about family life, just the bottom line."
bad,"Downright illegal practices. I ended up calling the Department of Labor, as I was frequently asked by my DM to work doubles, overnights, clopens, etc. I'd rather die than work for GameStop ever  ever ever again."
bad,one of the most draining places to work it doesn't help to work small shifts with no amount of hours for minimum wage and deal with uncertainty throughout your time at the company the best thing about working there you get to add an employee discount to your power up card
bad,"I would not recommend anyone work for this company. On multiple occasions I was passed up for promotion, despite my excellent employment record and superior job experience. I was also asked, nay, expected, to then train this person above my station how to do their job of telling me how to do my job. It is a disgusting, deplorable practice encouraged by a foul, despicable company run by liars and thieves. Do not work at Game Stop, and do not give them your business, time or money."
bad,Worked there for 6 years and when my daughter passed away they didnt even give me a few days off that I requested. This is one company I never want to work for again. I cant wait until they get taken out by online sold games.
bad,poor management In the store poor pay and hours and the staff is very picky and strict in the selection process they also don't have very good benefits either.
bad,"When I started Gamestop it was amazing, my team was on point and we managed to find a way to cover all of our bases. Of course we had to clean and get result hence what we call circle of life.  Overall my crew was my work family and we always knew how to help each other and our customers to the point that we had to help customers from many other stores. Gamestop is pretty easy once you get use to  the rules, and the stores location. The reason i quit gamestop though is the lack of direction the company has with its employees, trying to make impossible goals and expecting one person to somehow remodel your store and tend to customers by yourself, also the drastic hour cuts were ridiculous. On top of that they tend to separate a team id they are doing extremely well to try and spread that kind of results throughout the district, but it puts of a strain to try and train so many rookies with the workloads at hand."
bad,"Company sucks, they are always behind in trends. Push old content and tech. You must meet quotas or you will be fired. Also they will not pay you very well, I was up for assistant manager and asked for the company avg for pay so they refused to hire a assistant and instead hire a bunch of low level employees to train up to push me out."
bad,This company has forgotten what made it great so many years ago.  The new management does have the intention of ever making the necessary changes to ensure that customers are getting the best deals.
bad,"Working for gamestop was terrible. They hired me in, then would leave me out of work for weeks. I'd get put on the schedule once a month, while people who were hired weeks after me got promotions and all the hours I was looking for. I was the only employee that worked once a month. It was very unpleasant."
bad,A lot of people think that working at GameStop is fun. It isn't. From the non sense that your expected to say on every single phone call to the mandated robot like behavior that is required by the staff this place is not good to work at all.
bad,"This is by far the worst company I have ever worked for. They pay you nothing and expect you to work 80+ hours a week. They also will try to get rid of people every month or so for no reason, including accusing them of stealing. I was a store manager and had to fire a guy that clearly did nothing wrong and he really needed the job. If you can avoid it, just simply do not work there for any reason."
bad,Good company and good culture place to work and learn more new technologies with improving skills and encouraging people around to learn more. This company has a good culture.
bad,Te prometían quedar fijo y no cumplieron con ningún compañero.
bad,i worked there for more that four years and learned a lot in retail which was nice but the constant micro managing and having no possible way to move up the company except wait for the next person to get fired or leave really annoying i was a great employee and my customers loved me as far as the company goes i was just another number.
bad,"Its a nice company for High School kids starting out in the work field. But too many shady practices. Management would reduce hours just so they didn't have to pay the entire staff, Managers would constantly take week long vacations with out any real briefing."
bad,"You'll have to give it up working in a place like this. You'll be expected to upsell with EVERY purchase, desperately trying to sell people things they more often than not don't want, much less need. You'll learn how ridiculous their trade policies are before long, as well. And from what I've learned from upper management, you'll need sociopathic behavior just to advance."
bad,This is the most prejudice company I have ever worked for the management let's you know that they do not like black people period and only whites are promoted and the foreigners are used for the hard work but never promoted. This place needs to be cleaned up it stinks whatever u do don't go there especially  if you are a decent person with your head on right.
bad,This company has the potential to be one of the greatest companies in the world. Unfortunately its upper management does not support it's store leaders. Once they are in a store they are left alone with the only communication to motivate through fear and threats.
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of cleaning, organizing, and attending to the ""guests"" that would need any assistance."
bad,If your under the age of 21 this job is great after that it loses it spark.  After that it is a good place to visit just not to work. Your going to have to deal with a lot of kids and work with a lot to some of them maybe your boss fyi.
bad,Very unfair job. Game stop use to be about how the customer can connect with the employees. Now it is all about the employee hounding you for sales. You must follow all the customers around which sometimes makes them uncomfortable. The lost prevention manager and regional manager look at the employees as if they were just numbers. Everything with gamestops is now about getting the numbers or you're fired.
bad,"Excluded from contests won by store. Getting 100% in circle of life but still have to talk to upper management. Conference calls in the middle of a shift alone. either being stuck or have to go in during national emergencies. Hour cuts every week. Unrealistic goals set, more worried about the extra $ and not to employees or customers"
bad,Gamestop is run on scams.  The people there are there the longest still work there due to favoritism.  The managers wouldn't do their part half of the time.  I didn't realize that being a manager gave you the right to call it quits in the middle of a shift on a busy day.  I am ashamed of the people I once called friends.  They teach you to scam money off of customer to get your numbers up to look good.  Not to mention half of their products aren't  checked.  Games are constantly coming out of the package broken.  The cell phones they sell hardly work and the plans they are put on are the worst.  Never again.
bad,"After all is said and done with basic retail work, you'll have management constantly telling you your job is in jeopardy. Their expectations are ridiculously high and their pay is incredibly low. Being apart of a team never feels like it, you always feel like your being attack and told their is nothing better than gamestop. Higher up management does not care about employees that are beneath them Then if you file a complaint they always break confidentiality and tell the person that you are complaining about. What should be a decent job seems like you are always killing your self for nothing. Everyone never seems happy behind the scenes of things, but the best part of the job is the customers and just making sure that they are happy, even when your upset."
bad,"This company was awful (at the time I worked there) to be an employee of. It required you to out right lie to the customers to push product and subscriptions. This would lead to poor reviews, which you would then be held accountable."
bad,The pressure that GameStop places on their store leaders to hit their COL (circle of life) score is ridiculous. It causes stress on the entire store staff and makes the customers feel like the store staff is like a bunch of used car salesman.
bad,"Worked there for 6+ years. Female, constantly being sexually/verbally harassed by other employees and customers. Reported two of my coworkers who were very aggressively talking about assaulting me to my boss and the issue was never taken to HR, they were just scheduled when i wasn't working. Managers work alone a lot of the time, especially in the mornings. Bad pay, worked there for 6 years and only made $9 as a manager. Had to quit because working there traumatized me."
bad,"When minimum wage went up to more than I was making as a lead, they said that was my raise.  I left shortly after that blantent display of disrespect."
bad,"La mia esperienza in Gamestop é durata due anni circa, non so come."
bad,"good place to work if you are a student "
bad,"Managaement is young and unexsperenced, fork lifts leak fluids, they don't lay off they find ways to fire you, very poor communications with the higher ups, benifits suck I've paid most of my med's out of Picket. Parking is very bad you will get hit one or two times a year. Management team lies all the time so much you don't know half the time what's the truth. No room for advancement, they do not even allow you to change shifts for children care."
bad,"Minimum wage pay for demanding customer service, sales goals, and hostile mid level management. Very little respect for employees, or recognition of hard work."
bad,"Uses shady tactics to make it's revenue and uses fear tactics upon it's employees to make us lie in order to make GameStop a buck. It shows how low companies will go to make customers buy their merchandise along with unnecessary products. They punish us if we are unable to sell additional products such as preorders, pro memberships, and etc. They have guidelines called the COL (Circle of Life) which explains ways of ""raising the maximum output in sales for GameStop."" The guidelines basically have us harass the customer for their time and money, making them uncomfortable and wanting to leave immediately, and basically makes the point of ""acquire the profit, not the customer"" shine plain as day."
bad,You are demanded to do anything to gain sales. Company takes advantage of employees who work there and love the company or games. They are well aware of this and exploit it.
bad,worst job i ever had.  terrible culture only ting that made it worth it was the customers and you konw how touch and go that can be.
bad,"Stuck with the company for two years. Was promised multiple times there would be advancement opportunities. Was passed up several times for every dumb reason you could imagine. Management finds every reason they can to write you up, and try to make you quit. You are NEVER guaranteed hours, even as a key holder. "
bad,"It is okay as a part time job, but you are going to find that management either doesn't know what it is doing, or play favorites."
bad,"terrible bad management didn't care about any one and never came out of the back to help with anything"
bad,"This was a job working for a company that cares very little for its employees. Between ridiculous holiday hours and just as absurd regular hours, the job is extremely stressful. District managers constantly stonewall employees for promotions regardless of their tenure, goals met, etc. The only reasons to stick around in this job would be the discount and benefits."
bad,the company is very behind as far as the technology that is used though out the store. gamestop is know to have very long lines and it is due to the fact that the tech is very slow and old and there is never enough help. people are usually scheduled to work alone. now as a customer i avoid to even go in that place. almost every location is dirty and looks run down. one of the worst companies I've worked for.
bad,"Gamestop is having a hard time adjusting to the digital age that is here, task work keeps piling up in between guests a d more and more work is added but also more and more payroll is being cut."
bad,this job doesn't pay you enough to deal with its policies that first say to do this thing it when u do u get in trouble because some one else wants it another way
bad,"Least favorite job I've ever had. Zero training, product pushing, terrible management. Managers were constantly being verbally abused by higher-ups. Dirty environment, outdated cash registers."
bad,Management is selfish and the work very demanding not worth the pay they constantly Want you to sell but there is no commission just bonuses for the boss they want you to know about all games but only managers get free games from vendors plus you don't get a break unless you work over 7 hours
bad,Gamestop is the worst company i have ever worked for. They are more concerned about the selling culture than making there customers happy which intern promotes better business. They often falsify documentation and often edit employee hours which is against the law.
bad,"Management was terrible, corporate leadership was terrible. There is an entire focus on selling and not helping. It was a very immature environment. The company lack professionalism."
bad,The culture flip flops from customer orientation to strictly sales and quota and back again depending on the level of panic from the investors. Always new tasks and programs but never any more hours for training. Salary does not meet the workload. Store managers work 50-60 hour weeks but are only paid for 44. District managers are hands off for support but will bully store managers when numbers aren't met.
bad,Unfair upper management. All team members were harshly held responsible for things out of their control. The best part were the peers and relationships built. The worst was the expectations laid by uppermanagment that were either not achievable or unrealistic.
bad,I literally just filled out this review so I'm unsure as to why I'm doing another one.  This is not a great company.  My workers are great but the higher ups aren't and the customers can be the most rude individuals on the planet.
bad,"They let me work 4 days in a 2 month period. Their store managers are nice, but whoever controls how many hours they can give out is, needs to be shot because hes denying hours to people in dire need of hours since they cannot find other jobs."
bad,"Utterly terrible. I've seen in 10 year employees cut with no prejudice."
bad,"Do not make a career out of this if you intend to have a family or any sense of self-worth.  Repeatedly called upon to do more for less, work 60 hours or more, new employees are paid more, company threatens you as if you have no other options or places to work, pay is horrible, benefits are horrible, management is unaccountable, need I go on?"
bad,"They do not care about customers, they not care what is best for stores individually, and they about you. Number and sales, that is all that matters and they will pay your nothing for working for them."
bad,"I had absolutely no formal training whatsoever and they immediately put me on the floor to help customers when I didn't even know how to ring out one. I had no experience in sales pitches and that ultimately became my downfall. No hours, ever, and they expected the world from me when I could barely provide the ground I was standing on."
bad,No one treated me with respect. No hours. No way of moving up in the company. Horrible customer service. Lack of traffic flow. Worst Job ever
bad,"The hours are ridiculous you have no time for family. The benefits are terrible. The management has no concern for its employees and they are very disrespect. The disciplinary protocol is jacked up if your not a favorite you will get in trouble. If you think because its gamestop that this job is good and will be fun, you thought wrong."
bad,I can't say to much about working for this company only because I was hired for the holidays. so my employment started in oct. 2015 and ended jan.2016 working only three or four days. but all in all if I had received more hours I know I would've enjoyed it . I did enjoy those four days.
bad,"A typical day at work started with having trouble parking, because all the spots are taken up, you eventually start parking across the street  and taking a ten minute walk just to get in the door. Once you're actually inside you have to put anything you have that has metal in it in your locker because it's a metal free workplace. The metal detectors don't always work and sometimes you have to step to the side and get checked a second time. Then work starts, don't expect to be told by your supervisor you're doing a good job even if you get better numbers than anyone else. They will just say that you need to keep working harder. The worst part of all of this isn't the metal detectors, or the horrible management, or even the crummy overpriced food which you have to waste your whole break standing in line to get, it's the low job security. If you make three mistakes they let you go. When the quota is 132 a day and you're refurbishing a hard drive every three minutes it becomes very stressful trying not to make any mistakes. I made friends there that never came back, and two people from my department were let go in the month that I worked there. (They moved me there a month after I started working there.) So in closing, if you're okay with working for unappreciative managers, having a nearly unreachable quota, and thinking everyday ""could this be my last?"" then by all means, work here."
bad,If you plan on applying for a job at GameStop don't. It is a job that does not really lead anywhere and poorly compensates you for the work you put in. It take years to even get to a position of management. I have had co workers work there for 7 years and don't receive more the 13 dollars an hour as an Assistant Manager.
bad,"The place always had a lightheartedness to it but with games come angry parents and annoyed coworkers. Even if you try to keep up your spirit something always happens and naturally everyone is to blame. Raises are miniscule and rarely come by. Complaints fall on deaf years. Some stores are better than others, for sure. Others fall quite short."
bad,"no work life balance, employees are treated like garbage. Customers are treated like numbers, and upper management holds ""classes"" on the floor in front of customers on how to treat them like numbers without them knowing it..What else is there to say"
bad,not a bad place to work other than the management and lack of communication and shotty hours you get as an employee i only get one shift every two weeks
bad,my coworkers were great. It was just a waste of time. hiring because they need help and then give you three hours per work schdule
bad,"the management at GameStop is horrible, they work you like a dog for such a small pay is beyond comprehension. I'm a gamer at heart but working at game stop makes one not even want to play video games anymore."
bad,One of the worse companies I've ever worked for. They constantly micro-manage and expect your life to revolve around Gamestop. All that matters to them is money plain and simple. Their definition of training is a joke. I learned more from figuring out things by myself than learning from the store manager. They hand out unrealistic goals and if you don't achieve these goals its a write up and provide nothing to help you. I could write an essay about this place but I will refrain from doing so. The only positive to that company was being able to meet some really cool and interesting customers. This company takes someones passion for video games and exploit it by turning you into a mindless soul.
bad,"This company is awful. No breaks, no lunches, if they could chain people to the cash registers they would. The CEO is running the company into the ground. I would give them another 4-5 years before they declare bankruptcy."
bad,"The work days are slow and feels meaningless at times. The pay wasn't great (for its time) and the hours lacked tremendously. Granted that it was a part-time position, it didn't do any justice. Would not work there again."
bad,I used to love working for this company. But they promise things and don't deliver. They have no respect for their employes. It seems as thought they care about their ASM's the least. They make stupid decisions that make no business sense and make more work for employes.
bad,"It's basically a job for someone who's starting off in the workforce and considers video games a hobby. The management is discombobulated, communication is extremely cloudy, but the work is simple and repetitive. They'll promise you promotions, raises, but will never follow through and/or give it to someone else who is less qualified (but liked more by higher management). It's a popularity contest. The company lacks positive reinforcement for it's employees; instead instills fear in each one of them to motivate or help meet company sales plans. Overall, if you're a gamer (and young), the atmosphere is very easy going. A typical day consists of helping customers pick out games, filing trade-ins from customers/shipment, recovering the store, keeping marketing displayed appropriately, etc. The customers can be insufferable and you deal with a LOT of feeble minded individuals but admittedly the job is a great way to surround yourself with what you enjoy outside of work life. Just make sure it's your first job or you have a second one. You'll find that Gamestop will stretch the responsibility and expectation of it's employees after previously  offering a position, promising a pay raise, and/or proclaiming the opposite would happen. They'll tell you that to get you to take upon the work load but won't follow through on their end. It's an endless circle you stay in to enjoy the trivial benefits of their discount and the rare company incentives. Good luck lol."
bad,Dead end job with very little job advancement. Its only tolerable if you have a passion for gaming. Unfair and vindictive upper management makes work unpleasant.
bad,"Its your basic retail job environment, selling video games to customers that own platform based video game systems. didnt pay very much at all even for a student which i was at the time of my employment."
bad,"Pochi dipendenti, troppe pretese. Ottime idee difficili da raggiungere. Necessità di creare un equilibrio."
bad,a company with no concern for its employees. Required to work whenever there is a problem even if its your day off and even if your on vacation.Retail goals are extremely high and lead only the busy stores to succeed.
bad,The pay horrible many tasks are assigned above your pay grade. management has no idea what they are doing. Not military friendly constantly changing all the time for the worse. only good part would be the free games sometimes.
bad,"The company's ""sales drive"" made it seem like they didn't want customers to return to their stores ever. Corporate hardly dished out hours for in store employees and literally worked their store managers to the bone. Some even worked more than 80+ hours a week during holiday season for a laughable salary. There is blatant sexism within some of the training procedures that corporate forces their staff to do, and even more lack of concern for current employees. When working a day in the store, you'd better be prepared to stress about every detail of a sales transaction, because  every position on the retail level of this company is expendable. The employee turnover rate is astounding. you do not make commission working here, yet are forced to sell discount cards, credit cards, and shove video games down your customer's throats. GameStop is in no way a fun or endearing work environment."
bad,"Gamestop comes off as a fun loving and hard working environment. When in fact it is all fun. The management is poorly skilled in handling job tasks and merchandise. During my three months or so there, I was scheduled for about 5 shifts in total, all for supposed ""training"" My training consisted of handing out flyers, and alphabetizing games on the sales floor and in the storage room. I learned next to nothing about how the company actually worked. My shifts were spread out in ridiculous time intervals, it would be weeks before I heard from the manager about a potential shift or not."
bad,"the manager was rude "
bad,"always had problems with pay "
bad,"This company treats it's employees worse than any company I have ever came across. If you aren't one to kiss butt every time the district manager even cares to look at you, don't work for this company."
bad,"Typical minimum wage retail except with flimsier hours, nothing special"
bad,its usually expected to work less than 20 hours maybe 4 a week if you are lucky
bad,"It's ok if you need a job. It is not the best, would not consider it a career and just not right for some people"
bad,"Just don't."
bad,You do everything that the store manager is supose to be doing while he or she is in the back on their phone getting paid slightly more then you.
bad,"A typical work day was decent. The biggest problem I had with working here, is that hours were not very good and the pay was not good. Also, I didn't really know much about video games, and I had thought that when I got hired I would learn about them."
bad,This job had horrible management when I was working there. I cant speak on how the management is now.
bad,"Typical day would include changing over marketing for the new quarter or new signage. Didn't really learn much because corporate was down are throat about selling subscriptions to the worst gaming magazine in the nation. There was no incentives to subs besides 10% off used games. Being a gamer I thought this company would be awesome to work for but boy was I wrong. It was never about recommending a game to someone coming in the store... it was about making the company money.. every transaction. If they didn't see you sell a subscription to every customer the higher ups would say Why aren't you hitting your goals everyday? There was no payoff for subscriptions/hitting your goals every month. Was apart of one of the most profitable stores in the Northeast and a 2.5 million dollar store. Hit our goals every month and not even a raise because they don't do  that. Ive watched 15 people I know work for this company and leave because they don't pay you what your worth, will pay someone less with less productivity to come take your job along with zero job security and advancement. When this company was EB Games.. Thats when they took care of you..."
bad,"Very low pay and hours another job that is only good if you are a manager, but at the same time they offer very low chances to get promoted, not appreciated on a daily basis"
bad,one of the worst companies i have ever worked for. The manager was not only horrible but did very shady things around the store and no matter how high up in the management team you go to complain they always protect the managers no matter how bad or unfair they are.
bad,"On all my days off I would be called in to cover the lazy store managers shift. Most days he would just come in, clock on, then leave the store to go deal with personal matters and leave the store in my care."
bad,"When working for Game Stop, you become friends with your customers. You enjoy interacting with them and getting them excited for video games. "
bad,"A typical day at Game Stop is opening the store for business. Counting and verifying funds. Welcoming customers, giving them information about weekly deals and game trades. I have never been trained. Everything has been learn as you go. Luckily for them I am a fast hands on worker. The management team that I work with in the store are great people but the District Manager only shows when expectations and goals are not met, never when goals exceeds expectations. My job is not hard but it gets stressful when they set goals that are unreasonable and unrealistic.      "
bad,"This company is horrible to work for. Unless you live in California. Over the last 5 years they have tripled the amount of tasks and demands they require, which change daily based on whatever idea some VP has to increase some percentage margin, which you get asked to redo two or three times, then ultimately told to undo. There is no corporate support nor is there any payroll given to complete these tasks and store managers are required to foot the bill and end up working 60 to 70 hrs +. I watched many Store managers family lives fall apart working 6 days a week, then ""required"" by their District manager to work their 7th day or lose their job. If you ask for more payroll you are told ""you can't talk about payroll"", or ""a good manager can make it work"", but the only managers I have seen accomplish this don't care about their stores and are eventually fired. The overall mindset of the corporate office is work a store manager into the ground until they quit so that they don't have to pay out benefits or bonuses because some new fresh video gamer will come along ignorant to the job and can be abused by the system at a lower pay."
bad,Inactivity of management and coworkers unless individual had personal goals.
bad,"First and foremost, YOU MEAN NOTHING TO THIS COMPANY. There is no loyalty, and you're constantly made to feel like you should be scared for your job."
bad,"Game Stop is the worst company to work for, They do not respect their employees what so ever and don't care that you have a personal life. The feel that Game Stop should be ur entire life."
bad,"Horrible company to work for..no work life balance..constantly changing things in the stores with little to no notice or support..they will make you work long hours because you are salaried and then doesn't give back the time you put in..doesn't pay well..nobody at corporate talks to each other so you get multiple people telling you what to do..they don't even consider your insight even though you can tell whats best for that location..this company cares about its bottom line not about its people..if you want to be a slave and have no life,get no respect and no support then this is the job for you.."
bad,This is a horrible company to work for. I enjoyed working with my coworkers and enjoyed the customers but GameStop as a company is awful. They do not look out for their employees in any way shape or form.
bad,"I only worked at Gamestop as a seasonal so I did not have a lot of time to get to know the company. I worked during Christmas time, but other than that I got maybe three to four hours a week and I was not paid very much and they let me go soon after. I mostly stocked shelves, alphabetized and greeted people as they walked in. I trained very little on the registers because supposedly only the managers were allowed to use them."
bad,"One reviewer mentioned Payroll , there is none ! Don't be mislead guys and gals , you is working solo for most of the day . The job is not hard , just a million things to do ! Shipments , trades , phones never stop ringing , changing the New Release walls , Best Sellers wall , titles on hand scans , category counts , did I mention that you are working alone for all this ? I'm sorry , I forgot that you have to do customer service too , ringing registers , sell their PUR memberships , sell Reservations , skip protection , WebinStore , are we having fun yet ? One last thing , there's like a Conference Call everyday , way too much babysitting . I hope this helps you a little bit , I don't have any hard feelings GS , met a lot of wonderful people , made some friends , but I would never do it again !"
bad,"I worked for the Gamestop for 6 years. At first, 2006-2009, were good if not great. Then everything changed and it became all about the bottom line. Cutting payroll hours, focus on everything other than the customer experience, horrible pay, and never any focus on the positives happening but always focused on the bad. It has been rated the 10th worst place to work in America and I would completely agree."
bad,"Poorly managed, not given proper training, not given enough hours"
bad,the workers were really bland. they did not act as if they wanted to be there i would be in a good mood excited and they would send me away to a corner to sort games because i was too hyper for them. the job itself was easy but the people i could not work with.
bad,"Always want to work for Game Stop, was hired and layoff after 3 weeks due to revenue and company do not want to pay for benefits. supervisor inform me I would be able to reapply as part time, but at this time they are downsizing with full time hiring. Game Stop only want to hire anyone under the age of 30, I am 60, so I immediately let go. I enjoy my job a Game Stop but was not given the chance to prove myself."
bad,"they suck , have no type of organiziation , company is no good"
bad,this company is nothing more than a point of sale for gaming system consoles and software.
bad,They are always firing people even those who are dedicated and giving it there best effort. Store managers work 60 hours per week and are told that is not enough. Mind you store managers are only paid for 40 hours. District and regional management are not held accountable for there actions as often as they should be.
bad,"i was the top store manager in the district and they fired me over garbage. Your district managers dont care about you, they will stab you in the back just to save them selves"
bad,"Horrible employer to work for. Bad hours, bad wages, bad management. Unreasonable sales goals. Unreasonable availability expectations. ""performance based"" company."
bad,"Working here has been by far the worst experience I have ever had. You are asked to go above and beyond yet you are paid so little and are often times refused any hours for your accomplishments. Management makes no secret that what should stay behind close doors does not, in fact, the open door policy is actually quite literally ""open for all to know."" Too many complaints and too little standards of work ethic."
bad,I wouldnt refer this job to anyone........Anyone.....From top to bottom overall bad
bad,Nice guests but work environment makes you not want to stay you work like crazy for little pay company treats you like your nothing just a number atmosphere is different depending on who is there sadly shouldn't be that way.
bad,"Gamestop is a sinking ship. Don't bother applying. They are a HORRIBLE  company. Some of the employees in my district were nice, but anyone with half a brain gets out as quick as they can."
bad,"You have to get tech trades with a unrealistic number  had to train my boss because our district manger refused to hire within and refused to show up to help with things as a ASL I wasn’t trained to fully do  "
bad,"If you decide to pursue this position be prepared for poor compensation, communication, and inconsistent directives. Each day this company gets closer to going under and it's clear why. They can't even consistently keep a CEO for more than 3 months and every time a seat changes they have a mandatory overhaul and change EVERYTHING in the stores without providing the resources to complete the changes."
bad,"If you have any ounce of self worth, I'm sure there are plenty of other companies that would treat/pay you fairly. Lots of empty promises. Increasingly more workload added yearly with no pay increase. Extremely high turnover due to stress vs reward."
bad,"I've been with this company for 2 years and each time I would get close to a promotion, they'd shaft me somehow. Not letting me move stores to closer ones after getting moving myself, hiring other people and putting them above me instead. The job isn't fun, along with overall sales goals and they constantly put other things on our plate without ever giving us more money."
bad,"I gave over 10 years to the company as a store manager, they are a greedy corporation. There is favoritism. All you are good for is to make them money and if you don’t (keep in mind the company is dying) then you have to be held accountable. I’ve decided to leave about a month ago and currently looking for a better and healthy work environment."
bad,"What started as a great first experience turned into a horrible time. Manager's had no clue how to hire proper employees, didn't do anything themselves, and the district leads were all power hungry morons."
bad,The hours are extremely limited. High volume stores operate with the same amount of hours as low volume stores.  Believe in only providing cheap alternatives to solve problems opposed to more reliable options.
bad,"Pretty horrible company, You work as if you make commission, without making any bonus or commission at all. The only ones who get a bonus are the manager. So if your not a manager, you work your butt off and are expected to work hard, up-sale everything, and yes I do mean everything. Annoy customers with 12 questions during checkout, and get nothing from that, while your boss makes profit from it. "
bad,"Never any hours always sent home early almost everyday lack of communication and you have to make sales otherwise you get fired. The DL was a pain and always a smart butt, and your hours are based on everyone else’s sales. Would never work there again. Not to mention people talked about you behind your back and sometimes right in front of you."
bad,"My time at Gamestop was marred by internal strife with regard to the store leader, as well as other coworkers. Many employees, and the at the time manager as well, did not do their work appropriately which left their work on top of the other work to be done. All this on top of the ever increasingly angry customer base because the company policies are increasingly anti-consumer."
bad,A typical day is getting screamed at by crackheads selling their children's game console for drug money. The staff is the only rewarding part of this job.
bad,"During my time with Gamestop I had experienced inconsistent managing , biased treatment from management as well as very terrible working conditions. When I was Store Manager I was salary. Which ment often times working 10 to 12 hour days during regular seasons and 14 hours a day during holiday seasons. As you can imagine this takes away time from family and is incredibly stressful. I had to have a room mate as the cost of living had increased very rapidly in my area even with my position. My manager is known for never promoting an employee despite several being in the presidents club ( top 1% of the company) every year."
bad,"I think I was only hired because I was a girl, and I was the only girl there. Hours were horrible (sometimes four hours a week with $7.25 an hour pay) and so was the job itself. A cramped tiny store filled with people while you and MAYBE one other person try to ring everyone up and fix and stock the store and clean up for the night isn’t fun. Manager at my particular store was very rude and was say some gross sexist things sometimes that if you said anything to a district manager or corporate, they’d just take it as no big deal. "
bad,"Don't work here, unless you're really desperate. When I was working in store, staff were being constantly threatened by head office to sell, sell, sell an embarrassing amount of 'extras' at the till. And the incentive to sell? Well, if you don't reach your targets, you will be disciplined. Simple as. The cherry on the cake, is that all members of staff in a store (bar the manager) receive minimum wage. No bonuses or raises for long term members of staff. Nothing. There was numerous times were I was left to manage the store I worked in, because head office couldn't source a manager. As a keyholder, I was left to manage a busy (and understaffed) store. I was doing payroll, rostering staff, opening/closing, auditing/stock-keeping, interviewing new staff. No bonus, no manager pay. Just minimum wage."
bad,"Constantly asking more and more of employees with the promise of promotion, but never delivers or compensate. Bathroom is always broken and cockroaches in the lunch area."
bad,"They underpay and over work the full time staff. Minimal labor usage but expect maximum profitability means you will be working as a manager alone more often than not, and part time employees will work at best two or three shifts a week. You will need another job. Outdated business model with no flexibility with each year we post lost revenue and profit, but they are unwilling to change, or commit to a change at all even when we are told from higher ups that 'the company isn't in any danger'."
bad,"The job was fine at first, but the customers in the area I worked in made the job more difficult to work in. There were too many managers coming in and out and the turnover rate is horrible. They never give the stores hours so stores tend to be messy (but not the employee's fault). Sometimes they would even have a key holder or manager close by themselves because we lacked the hours to have more than one or two people working at a time. Their selling culture is also very pushy and forces workers to get numbers that not very plausible at certain stores."
bad,"This company has the potential to be a fantastic workplace. Gamer culture makes it a great chance to have fun in a great workplace. Unfortunately only those that are willing to brown nose, sell out coworkers, cheat and lie are awarded. I have seen people be pushed out to ""retire"" when they made too much money due to seniority, people ""let go"" on trumped up reasons, and demoted because they might expose someone else's wrongdoing. I spent 10+ years working here only to find out I had cancer and that I was going to have surgery on my leg. Three days later I was called into the office and told my position was being eliminated. I was given severance (the only nice thing about all this was I didn't have to worry about income while receiving cancer treatment and surgery), and signed paperwork saying I would retaliate for being let go. If you are a hard honest worker, make a wide path around this company. Your mental health will thank you for it!"
bad,No set schedule..8 hour days..no paid vacation..no sick days..company has rules and guidelines that even they don't follow.. 2/10 wouldn't recommend..
bad,I am absolutely grateful to my manager for hiring me and giving me the opportunity. Though I have nothing and i mean absolutely nothing against my manager the company itself on the other hand was disheartening. I went an entire month without a shift as well as the expectations not only being unrealistic but downright demoralizing.
bad,The job was very stressful being that you are graded on only two aspects of the job. !) Your ability to get people to subscribe to the PowerUP Rewards Pro card 2) Your ability to get people to preorder games. The staff never really taught me anything that well. There are supposed to be modules that you are supposed to complete but I've never done any while working there. The only thing that i was shown how to use was the register that they used to ring up customers. Not saying that all the people who work there aren't amicable but it wasn't a job that you'd be excited to go to.
bad,GameStop is a company that pick and chooses who will get hours. They play favorites with employees and ask more of you then what you will get paid. Hour depend on how well other employees do and management does not work with life events or other important life issues.
bad,"You will notice after a few months that you'll see how much a game costs and why you never bought a pc to begin with. Console games will be driven digitally and reselling used games for 66% profit is a shame. Sure you will try games before they release or on release date but you'll be alone with one more supervisor. The only time you will feel like you're working hard is black friday, but from there on you will stay part time until someone leaves as a keyholder."
bad,"As of the date of posting, Gamestop has been doing so poorly as a company that it is preparing for a buyout after having its most recent CEO in place only 3 months before leaving abruptly.  Gamestop as a company is in close with some of the most greedy and non-consumer-friendly companies in the gaming industry.  This mess at the highest levels can be felt at the lowest levels. Despite being the beating heart of the business your average worker is treated as less than dirt by even District Managers.  Customers used to come for the games and service but the industry is moving faster than Gamestop is willing to improve. Their computer systems are slow and out of date.  It's all about numbers and scamming people out of their money. Telling them to buy things you know they will hate.  And let's just not discuss the dumpster fire that is their ""trade in"" program. Research just how bad working at Gamestop is and how bad the company is. Don't waste your time."
bad,"An extremely stressful job for just retail. Poorly managed, usually working alone. If you're the lowest position, you get ~5hrs/week."
bad,"I worked here for a year and a half. During that time I never got more than 8 hours a week in which I was forced to bother customers and force sales on them that the customer didn't want or feel comfortable with. Management was okay for a while until we got a new manager, he disregarded the fact that I had an untreated anxiety disorder which made it hard to force engagement on customers."
bad,"I worked 10 years with countless promises that I would be considered for promotions, only to be fired for a late deposit while other employees committed the same offense with no punishment whatsoever without ever achieving said promotions."
bad,"Had good and bad things"
bad,The store I work for is just getting really bad employees don’t like each other manager doesn’t care and if you don’t sell pro card you get no hours..
bad,"It became extremely and unnecessarily stressful working for gamstop. I found myself working long arduous hours. Being the only person in the store during a shift meant that I could not leave for a break. After awhile, that gets to a person."
bad,"The atmosphere is competitive and hostile. Management above you will not hesitate to let you know that there are people willing to do your job for less. High sales expectations never match the customer flow of the day (This is always your fault, of course). Employees are constantly pushed to partake in slimy business practices. If it's all you can get, be prepared to be taken advantage of to the maximum amount. If you're not on call during all of their business hours be prepared to not get any hours. If you land a management position, prepare to take the blame for everything."
bad,Management was shady and hardly did their job. Customer relations were bad and poorly put together. Many of the customers would walk in wanting a very specific item or deal and our job was to make them spend money either on things they didn't want or sell them things without them knowing. Scummy and shady.
bad,I had worked for 5 years at Oxford Valley Mall Gamestop before being moved to Neshaminy Mall GameStop without a single problem and an amazing work place until I was put in The Nashaminy Mall Gamestop where the manager could not Keep a solid team or schedule employees properly. Other employees would blame others for their faults and get co workers in trouble for things they were not  even in the store to do. I never had these or any issue till i Was moved to this store.
bad,"I worked at gamestop for several years, and noticed the company begin to shift its goals to favor cutthroat and short term fixes while neglecting needs"
bad,"Horrible working hours. Over worked and way underpaid. Expected to be at work more than off leading to disgruntled managers, broken relationships, and physical health issues. District managers are more concerned with numbers than the health, safety, and livelihood of their employees."
bad,"Worked at HQ in Grapevine.  Lots of tenured staff, highly political, lots of drama and rumors spread like wildfire (true or not). Play THEIR game THEIR way or GAME OVER for YOU."
bad,"The job used to be great. Amazing district managers who cares, corporate who made intelligent decisions, and each store had its own personality. Now everything is robotic and micromanaged. Corporate makes life miserable and the DMs are the among the worst people I have met in my life."
bad,Sounds like it could be a great place to work but its really not.. To the company you are a number not even really a person. You can be replaced quick and easy. As a new employee your expected to know just as much info as the managers but without the pay or titles to go with it.. I was pretty much able to run the store before i was even a key-holder.. They pay is junk for what they want you to do. I will never tell anyone thats a job to go to.. even for fresh outta high schoolers.. McDonald's would be a better place then this company
bad,"They say that they will treat you as family to get you interested in working for them vut after you start for a you will realize its not a family at all. The management is cut throat and picks favorites. I worked There for 6 years and had to self train with no direction. There is a horrible work life balance and you are always bothered on days off. If you make too much over time and raises; they will find a way to get rid of you. They are a fire at will company. No matter how well you do you will always feel threatened and worried about losing you job over performance issues, shrink, and guest services. They have very poor training programs that don't train you well and you are rushed through it.  The pay there is horrible but it will get you through only in a pinch. I did like some of the people I worked with under me and at my level as well but overall it's not worth it."
bad,"I have worked for Gamestop for years and has been the worst retail company i have ever worked for. i will keep this short and sweet but the whole time i worked for the company i noticed that they do not care about there employees in the least and the turn over rate is ludicrous, in a one year period i saw 5 managers terminated for no good reason. These managers were fantastic the customers loved them the employees loved them but god forbid if they didn't trick customers into buying products that they don't need, such as season passes, those are not the only problems with that company but they are some of the big problems that they have there."
bad,A typical day work would be clock in listen to the manager for 15mins about where were at for the week and help customers with their needs clean store and go home.
bad,"Working here drove me away from my love of gaming.long hours, understaffed, poor compensation. Treats employees like they treat customers. No loyalty."
bad,se non sai leccarlo a dovere ti lasciano a casa che tu sia brava o no nelle vendite.PRIMA in vendite in lombardia OTTAVA in tutta italia lasciata a casa senza motivazioni
bad,Don't waste your time with this company. The culture is horrible and the change of promotion is slime. This company prefer part-time employees and this isn't realistic for the normal population.
bad,thee managers were rude and mean to employees some times even the customers. hours were very bad but the pay as decent (at the time)
bad,"Gamestop is poorly managed and extremely dysfunctional as a store and company. I was lied to at the beginning of the process in regards to keeping my previous employment and the opportunity to continue my education. After working there for a month, this was all reversed, and I was told that I could essentially take a pay cut and a demotion in order to have FIVE HOURS PER WEEK for class, or I could take write ups whenever I could not be ""on call"" and then fired. I immediately resigned."
bad,"I worked for Gamestop for 2 years, pay raises were minimal...they would only allow me to work 32 hrs a week baring me from any insurance even as an assistant store manager."
bad,"Before I was hired at GameStop I was working somewhere else. A place I liked working, but just wasn't getting enough hours (was working around 4 days a week during the off season.). I was told at GameStop I would be able to work fulltime hours and some overtime. I left my current job to work at GameStop."
bad,"The work gets very crazy."
bad,"I felt like management was out of touch with the community they were working for and intentionally oblivious to the going-ons of the crew. I never witness so much retail theft within the staff and I see that it happens everywhere, but when obvious culprits get away with it and let the part timers (no matter how long they were a part of the ""team"") take the fall, I find it repulsive. some of my coworkers were honest and good people others were not. I can honestly say this is the only place I have ever felt sick at the thought of clocking in. While it started very well and I did really enjoy working with the people I worked with. I feel like this place only hires people to drive them out of the industry."
bad,They do not give enough hours to complete the required tasks and try to overextend each employee. There are very limited opportunities to advance in the company.
bad,You are asked to do a lot and meet a lot of deadlines without to many incentives being offered in return.
bad,"The company as a whole has incredibly unrealistic standards of what employees can do with limited resources, and even less support.  Typically I am alone on a shift for roughly five out of eight hours in my day.  I have the same list of tasks to do each morning which would be fine only I am given only a half an hour to complete these tasks, and doing so takes the average person at least an extra hour on top of it all.  This of course does not include when they decide to send in price changes which typically consists of about two hundred to five hundred price changes total.  Again this would not be a problem if we had more time, or better yet more people working on the tasks.  Not to mention the small things such as needing to use the rest room.  I can not use it during this time because then who would watch the store?  There is no way other than closing down the store just so I can make a run for the rest room. Horribly unprofessional."
bad,"Gamestop can be a cruel employer. Like many modern retail outlets, they love to shove a great deal of work on their employees without really paying for it. During my time there, I saw work hours be continually cut until only the managers (the salary employees) were able to take up the slack by being forced to invest countless hours of what should have been their own time. All the time, ""standards"" were raised while support from the company dwindled. I gave this company 12 years of my life and I regret it thoroughly. If you choose to work here, make it part time-- NEVER let them make you salary."
bad,"While working there I learned that Gamestop asks a lot from their employees but does not pay them enough to balance it out. Management was impossible to work with, rude, and didn't seem to care for employees. And being a part of management, there seemed to be no advancement opportunities unless you met their high demands of sales. The hardest part of the job was working by myself, while having to do projects, keep the store clean and organized, keep up my goals for certain sales, while providing customer service. Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to provide customer service which led to friendships."
bad,Videogames have been a long time hobby. This company doesnt care about them at al or its customers. They lie to us to misinform customers and the product never comes as expected or promised. They treat their employees like second class citizen unless you are an attractive female then you get whatever you want. All over poor show
bad,"I typical day at Gamestop includes reading emails about new promotions along with organizing all the video game in Alphabetical order which takes hours only to have kids mess it all up again. Besides that you have to constantly push reservation on customers even when they dont want it. If you get lucky and get reservations alot, its the only way they will move you up even with good experience. As far a management, most manager that don't go to college doesnt support the idea of college students furthuring their education. Its a great job to earn a lil income but if your mind isn't set on moving up to be a manager while going to college they dispise you in everyway. I've learned that its not alway good as it seemed. Also, if your a person that can't stand up for him/self don't bother applying because they will walk all over you."
bad,"This is the worst company you can work for, starting with their benefits that barely cover any cost when you have a medical visit. You can only get moved up in the company if you are friends with someone higher up in the mgmt chain. Most of the managers and DM's are horrible at their jobs, constantly firing people and keeping the worst employees. I was not fired but coudln't stand working like this any longer and left the company. They make employees work off the clock and I've witnessed this in different districts and managers so it isn't a regional issue but a company issue. Vacation days are not guaranteed, multiple times I was not allowed to use all my days and was told I had to lose them. Raises are a joke, you lucky if they give you over $.20 cents. Even if you have great numbers and are in the top 100 out of 5000 plus stores you still won't get promoted, it's a real buddy buddy system there and theres no rhyme or reason for why they promote employees but I can say the turnover is very high and alot of who they promote fail w/in a few months because they promote the wrong people and keep their good employees from advancing causing more turnover. This company treats their employees and customers like dirt, stay away unless you are that desperate for a job."
bad,Company has changed drastically over the 10 years that I have been there . It has been occupied by store managers with no experience of running a business.
bad,"Pretend to give back to the customer, make sales. Standard sales job, but there is a faint sheen of dishonesty in their training. Their training bombards you with information with actual training from management being almost up to who you work with. My manager didn't defend me when I made a call as a member of management. They hung me out to dry simply because they didn't want to argue to help me keep my job because she could absorb my hours. "
bad,"The company is too numbers focused. Real issues aren’t addressed such as store maintenance, consumer happiness, or employee happiness. Any and all issues pertaining to another other than daily quotas remain unaddressed by management."
bad,"Its a good job to get your feet wet in retail but the job itself has no room for advancement. Hours are flexible, the pay could be a lot better though"
bad,"Partiamo dal fatto che come azienda parte da una base di formazione pari al nulla cosmico, nella maggior parte dei casi succede che ti assumono da stagista fai le prime settimane (2) affiancate da un collega e improvvisamente ti ritrovi con 7 ore di fila da solo in negozio a fare apertura o chiusura. Per concludere dopo un anno di contratto a chiamata ti lasciano a casa senza preavviso e nel mentre del tuo lavoro sono cambiati anche stranamente 3 store menager. Se avete una vita sociale dimenticatela perché avrete milioni di gruppi lavorativi, se avete la fortuna avrete anche un corner TIM, e per concludere avrete continue pressione da superiori su vari KPI e spingerli nel modo più aggressivo possibile."
bad,"Chill job, but they constantly pushed to sale memberships that nobody wanted and if you didn't sale any it would affect your review in a huge way. Manager was nice and so were co-workers."
bad,I'd rather not due to the fact that several people I worked with made the work place manageable.   That was enough to keep me there until better opportunities presented itself.
bad,"Gamestop only cares about the bottom line and does not care about the employee. You are seen as replaceable at any moment, no job security what so ever. Be warned, they will replace you if they see fit to."
bad,"Making you get numbers, rearranging the store every visit from the DM. DM promising promotions but using that to make you work harder. I was basically the Assistant Manager without the title or pay for months."
bad,"I was an all in Gamestop employee up until the last couple months. As a store manager the company throws a ton at you constantly to keep control out of your hands as much as possible. Busy work, conference calls, counts, shipping, scheduling, receiving,  weekly employee reviews, etc... Makes you do it in minimal time while working alone since payroll has been cut drastically to cut costs as much as possible and will fire you for sitting while clocked in or for being anywhere near the store while clocked out. ""time theft "" is a phrase they use to scare anyone if they dare don't preach gamestop at any living creature that comes near the store."
bad,"Gamestop suffers from a slow decline thanks to digital media slowly overtaking physical game sales. You will absolutely not get the position you apply for, or have described in the interview. I was told low stress, never working alone and minimal hours so I could go to class. Ended up being worked as much as they could without putting me into full-time hours, closing alone by the end of my first week, hard goals for signing people up for credit cards, protection plans, and upselling as much as possible and overall entirely too much stress, not enough support, a ridiculous amount of online training that is redundant if you have any retail experience, and all for about 12 bucks an hour and discounts on used games with no benefits. It's definitely not worth your time, unless you're part time working one shift a month for the discount, a guy at my store did that, if you need a career or want to be able to make ends meet then look elsewhere."
bad,"very few available hours, too many staff members, poor communication from management, draconian sigh-in procedures.  sales are unreasonably priced and stock is often below required numbers."
bad,"Corrupt, broken, with horrible upper management. They push the Circle of Life so hard they will encourage you to sell things to people who don't understand what they are buying. You feel like your working at a used car lot."
bad,Management lies and steals money and replaces it for then next day gives you no hours treats you badly and allows new people to take your hours this creating a hostile environment if a new person is hired you probably wont work for a month
bad,"They had predatory practices towards their customers, barely gave out hours for GA's, and pushed trades and reservations over actual store profit and low loss prevention. Not sad to have been let go."
bad,My store manager was very overbearing and didn't take responsibility or hold himself accountable. He would find away to deflect mistakes on someone else.
bad,".No hours for lower level employees"
bad,"This job does not offer much opportunity to move up in the management. I learned alot from them when it comes to pawnshop laws and buying product from clients, compensation is a low but its changing for the better."
bad,"As a store leader, or as an ASM, you're asked to do a near infinite amount of work, with never enough hours to do the work in, regardless of method you use or how hard/fast you work. It's an unspoken rule that you're gonna end up working off the clock, just to get projects done/price changes, remodels etc. You will never be 100% on anything, and your DM will make sure you know it. Multiple phone calls and conference calls a week, as well as almost hourly emails, will make sure you know how garbage your store is, regardless of location, event, weather, or staffing. I was given a temporary store leader position when our SL quit suddenly, we had 3 GAs quit, and an SGA. I was told i wasn't allowed to hire anyone, and that i would need to make it work. Keep in mind, minus those employees, im down to 1 SL/ASL  (myself), 1 SGA, and 1 GA. For 7 days a week. Doesn't make sense does it? Even more hilarious, is that with the cuts to staffing, I STILL had nary more than 115 hours to work with for all 3 of us, each week. "
bad,"Working at Gamestop was a joke. I was store manager and was given a store that had all new employees with no store manager for over a month. No training was done with the employees. The asst store mngr wanted to leave because the district manager left her to drown in a store she wasnt trained to run. When i brought this to his attention he said ""I brought them pizza and cookies, what else could I have done?"" This is the general approach to everything. The DM is essentially a retail story teller; he thinks his job is reading you the marketing book every week. I had problems with a dirty bathroom so i put a sign on the toilet asking people to keep the bathroom clean. After a week of a clean bathroom, the DM came to my store, ripped down my sign, and then left urine all over the toilet. Game companies pay for advertising in Gamestop stores and the regional manager forced me to take down paid-for advertising because he thought a differenr game should be showcased. I was told that my store was doing great before I went on vacation. Then when I came back I learned a nearby store was closing and SUDDENLY I was terrible and my store was terrible. They essentially wanted to move that mngr to my store, so it was time to get rid of me. All they care about is you harassing the customers, which is funny cause most customers stop shopping at Gamestop because of the used-car salesman approach every Gamestop is suppose to follow. My google reviews during my tenure were fantastic, but I guess providing a great shopping experience isn't enough. You get some free games and tech periodically, but"
bad,Do not recommend if you're trying to stay for long periods of time. Only recommend you to join if you're looking for a part-time you will only have a better experience as a part timer highest I recommend you go is a key holder.
bad,"Quando iniziai con il contratto da tirocinante ero contentissimo. E lo sono stato per qualche mese, dove ho imparato tutto quello che c'era da insegnarmi."
bad,Only way I would reccomend working at GS would be if you know the manager you will. E working for before you start. Everyone above the store level will treat you like the expendable fodder they think you are even if you perform well. Getting lucky with a good Store leader is the only thing that makes these jobs do-able
bad,Headline says it all. Gamestop's quotas set at overly competitive work environment with a constant threat of losing your job looming over your head with each sale you do (or don't) make. Truly awful experience aside from the discount on games
bad,"People would ask me if I liked my job and I would reply "" I dont like my job, I love my job."" But that was before we had a change in management. Our old SL left and we got an SL from another store, this person wasnt in the store a week before things got turned upside down. My first shift working with the new SL was so hard on me I almost walked out. This person felt the need to hover over me and tell me, in front of customers no less, that I was taking in a trade wrong, yelled at me for putting their keys on the counter instead of handing them back to them because GA's arent allowed so much as a drawer key for the games and we have to borrow key holders' keys and basically told me that if anyone tried to undermine them as an SL they wanted to know. New SL also was a hypocrite by saying no one in our store was having meaningful conversations with guests but would ignore a guest walking through the door when we have all been taught to greet every guest upon them walking in and to thank them for coming in when they left. It was a pretty easy job and was fun but it only takes one person to ruin a good thing. The pay is mediocre for what few hours I got a week, 10.75 an hr for 4 hours a week. I was passed up for key holder on 2 different occassions with no explanation as to why when I have loads of retail management experience and felt that I was only hired out of necessity not my personal gaming experience or retail experience. This was a hard job to walk away from but it just shows that great people leave jobs because of bad management plus the threat of Gamestop filing bankruptcy"
bad,"I used to like my job as a supervisor.  General manager hired friends instead of capable employees and actively tries to fire me and another female employee who was the assistant store manager. His friends never did their jobs and once my fiancee and I got pregnant, it got worse.  I brought documents from my doctors and my assistant manager printed the state law regarding pregnant employees but it didn't help. Had to involve hr but he just told me to either quit or move stores because my general manager wouldn't get better. The harassment got so bad, my chest physically hurt and I quit. Terrible job for half the population. ""Great"" other wise. My assistant manager left the store shortly after I did. We were the only 2 women employees.  Definitely not female friendly."
bad,The job is great for young individuals looking for a job but I wouldnt recommend this job to anyone unless you have no choice and you need a job asap or you really love gaming and money isnt an issue; there is very very little room for company growth and you will never see a pay raise unless you have a higher position
bad,"As the company went on to accept trade-ins on more and more items, from older consoles, to Ipads, phones, and other PC hardware, they became desperate to push these promotions because their profit weighted heavily on it."
bad,This job really doesn't pay well and you won't get many hours. It's really not worth it unless you just want to be able to say you have a job dealing with video games.
bad,"I was barely given any hours. Usually 15 or less. When I was actually working, I was heavily micromanaged and I didn't know what I was doing most of the time because I was never properly trained in."
bad,"There is no way to promote in the company unless a position opens up. You could get a promotion in 2 weeks or two years. Upper management can play favorites, so if you weren't from one of their preferred stores you're S.O.L. You'll be told you're in the running for the next available position, then you'll hear nothing from them as they choose other people, not even constructive criticism as to what you can improve on to better your chances if there's a next time. Pay is horrid with the discount and occasional freebie the only redeeming quality, but discounts on games don't put food on your table. If you need seasonal work or just looking for something to do during the day, go for it. If you want a job that respects you and your time, look elsewhere."
bad,Gamestop is a company with potential but they choose to squander their benefits on the higher ups while the common associate and store will faulter do to the lack of investment.
bad,"Most days consisted of micromanagement from corporate all the way down to the local district manager. Most sales and other graded metrics for success were undercut by one department or another. A market VP demanding preowned sales while the new merchandise is available $50 less. Marketing elements would often show up halfway through a sale or not at all. Each day I walked through the door feeling like I had 14 hours of work to do and 8 hours to do it in no matter how much was delegated to my amazing team. We constantly beat our sales and pgm yet always felt our jobs were in jeopardy. I always felt that our directives from above left sales associates in a position where they did not some business because they would be ""graded"" poorly."
bad,When I started in November i enjoyed working at gamestop. Hours were steady and we were always busy which was great. But after the holidays the hours died off and i was not on the schedule as much.
bad,Management doesn't care about you and never will. They don't have a clue as what they are doing. This is not a company that you should try and move forward with.
bad,I sunk three of my life into this company that I will never get back. In order to advance into higher positions you had to be best friends with the managers. Your hours where cut and you where written up if you couldn't meet the sales quota on a slow day.
bad,Applied for management and got the interview. Went to the interview and was treated very poorly  and belittled halfway through when I had all the nessecery skills.to run any store any day of the week. Says we wanna start you from the bottom. Managers were very rude and lack communication skills and leadership skills. You never get any hours or pay out of them unless your manager. Company still has yet to apologise or do anything about it
bad,The upper management cared more for sales of add-on items (subscriptions and item protection) than actual customer interaction. Staff was seen as highly expendable and replaceable.
bad,"Gamestop is pretty stingy with hours for part-time workers.  Store managers however, usually work about 60 hours a week and the good ones are burned out in a year.  If you have a bad one, expect a toxic competitive work environment with people poaching sales and throwing you under the bus.  Don't expect support from your district manager or HR.  They know a lot of people think Gamestop is a fun place to work and expect high turnover."
bad,While the job can be fun and interesting it can also be incredibly stressful and heavily manager dependent. If you have a poor manager you will have a bad time and seeing as they do not regularly hire or promote from within the advancement opportunities can be very limited. Know your manager and your team well and you will do well other than that find another place to work
bad,This position wa unnecessarily difficult. Corporate is very inconsistent and inflexible. Everyone who works for this company for too long gets the life sucked out of them. This company does very little to help is store managers.
bad,"Don't bother with this company. Horrible pay, horrible hours, your work is never considered good enough. Managers treated store associates poorly. Avoid this company at all costs. It'll never be worth the amount of stress this place instills."
bad,"Not worth it even if you like video games, plus management is terrible... Management had favorites and put downs and threats where the most commonly used form of ""encouragement""."
bad,"Glassdoor consistently sites Gamestop as one of the worst places to work in the United States, which I happen to agree with. It's clear very early that the company overall puts sales and profit ahead of the way employees and even customers are treated. Payroll cuts lead to employees being forced to handle a store alone for many hours a week, which often leads to them being disenfranchised and a high turnover rate. The video games industry is changing, but Gamestop insists on standing their ground until the trends and tactics that made them rich in the 90's somehow miraculously work again. In the dying retail industry, Gamestop's ""Power to the Players"" Mantra is an ironic death rattle."
bad,"Pays minimum wage with no benefits. Even the managers aren't paid enough if you review how many hours they work vs. pay/benefits. Employee perks are worthless/no valuable discounts. Everything is about numbers (membership cards, game reserves, etc.), and your entire career there is based on that instead of your ability to manage customers, employees, inventory, etc."
bad,"GameStop used to be a great place to work, but they have been struggling to stay relevant in an ever changing market and their employees are paying for it."
bad,"Poor upper management. The company doesn't know what it wants to be; it is slowly becoming a bargain bin, carrying scooters, trinkets, and items that don't relate to what the company is projecting their image to the public as."
bad,"They seem cool or ""hip"" to work for due to the gamer culture but the love of money has transformed this company into a ""used"" sales frankenstein of the game store pioneers such as ; EB Games, Funcoland, Babbages, etc."
bad,"I was hired as a seasonal sales associate with the promise of being hired as regular sales associate after the ""holiday season"". I was never trained on register nor how to properly communicate with customers or anything necessary in order to be a beneficial employee. After four weeks of work I was terminated and told the company had no more hours to assign. I was not compensated nor paid for a single shift I worked. I continuously called the store and the manager was unable to assist me, stating he was too busy and ""drowning"" in work, after telling me there was no need for my employment. Finally, I called the corporate office myself and after being disconnected three times and spending over an hour on hold I reached Human Resources to find out a previously fired employee filed an incorrect address with no permission or knowledge from me, meaning all my checks were sent to a stranger's home. A week later I'm still in the process of trying to get my payments for my incredibly short and disappointing time working at GameStop."
bad,"Days working at a store location is particularly fine everyday. The customers can be great when you give them excellent service and the environment overall is fantastic for gamers, it feels like home. However, even though it may seem like home its not worth the trouble to live in it. Game stop treats their employees unfairly like any other ""machine-like"" company. The pay is poor and the amount of hours a GA would get, even for a store that makes high sales is low. Advancement is slow and its all based on appeal rather than skill. You can be the best working GA in your store with great promise within management but you wont be promoted unless you are liked by the district manager and so on. I've known GA's who do a great job and have not seen a promotion for years and yet the promotion from GA to SGA is still not worth it. The pay is still much less than you would get at another company and you'd still probably only receive as many hours as your best working GA; nearly two days of work a week. Co-workers are sloppy and your team is only as good as your best man/woman. The hardest part of working at Gamestop is Gamestop itself, customers are great, the company... not so much, the pay... not even close, the hours... you've gotta be kidding me."
bad,"No room for advancement, they'd rather hire someone from outside to fill management positions of any sort as opposed to promoting from within. Hours are EXTREMELY BIAS and based on commission-like quotas, and younger employees get treated like garbage. Managers steal from the store, don't help out, and the customer base that shops here is absolutely horrible. Worst customer service job."
bad,"I really liked this job. I only worked til seasonal shift was over with. I wish it wasn't just a seasonal position. My co workers were really nice. They showed me how to do things properly. A typical day at work was stocking the shelves, greeting customers and cash handling. I enjoyed helping others find what they were looking for."
bad,"Working at Gamestop is a horrible experience. You go in every morning, an hour before opening to count the inventory (yes every day). You also have to move items from the trade hold, into the normal inventory, and finally you have to take the previous nights deposit to the bank. To make matters worse you have to do all of this within the hour before opening or its a problem. The computers alone take 10 minutes to start up so you cant even do anything for the first 10 minutes, giving you only 50 minutes to do everything. "
bad,"^ That should answer all your questions."
bad,"I am a store manager, The only thing about this company that is consistent, it's how inconsistent it is. Do not plan to have a  life outside of work, or a family while with the company, you will be forced to work over 70+ a week and since you are salaried you will not be compensated. As a Store manager the only thing you manage is yourself. You will not get adequate payroll to accomplish all that needs to be done and you are not allowed to do any task while the store is open. Which means you have 2 options, you either come in at least 3 hours earlier which for most stores means 6a or you stay 3 hours later which for most stores means 1a. You are expected to accomplish all by yourself. Their goals are unrealistic they will ""coach"" you for not achieving what they wanted you to achieve, now they never coach you for not hitting your goal, in order for you not to win unemployment, they coach you on behaviors. I am in good standings with this company and i am not a bitter ex employee, I just want to warn everyone to stay away at all cost. No matter how good it looks, i promise you it is not."
bad,"Typical Day:"
bad,"Made schedules, inventory checks, cashier, stock, shipping and handling six days a week 8 to 10 hrs as a assistance manager. No raises and no advancements."
bad,"If you are an avid gamer you may enjoy it, however the relentless product pushing and unrealistic expectations can drive even the most sane person completely nuts. Failure to achieve these high expectations results in 'coaching', success in achieving the expectations result in chronic questions and interrogation as to how you can possibly be able to do it. They have no care or concern for there employees and utilizing the open door policy can result in a quick termination. I'm happy to be away from such a thankless company."
bad,"Well, I was willing to take any job when I began to work at GameStop. The pay was pretty terrible ($7.25 an hour), and in this day and age of an economy we live in, that's pretty bad. The store I was working at was inside a mall, so it did promote bad eating habits unless you bring your own lunch. The staff was pretty fun to be around, made a horrible day much better. Would joke around (in a positive way) with customers, and ourselves. At the end of the day, the pay, the ""so-called"" discounts they give you, and the compensation plan is not worth the hassle working at any GameStop. Not disrespecting those who do work there, but working there wasn't for me, and at the end of the day, I was only after a paycheck to have some money in my pocket. "
bad,"The company does not care about you, they only care about reservations and pro cards. If you do not meet your weekly numbers you are fired. Managers are not safe either, they promise full support but never give you what you need to succeed."
bad,"As much as I love video games, this job was horrible. Mainly because of the managers."
bad,"As a manager you work long days usually by yourself with minimal breaks. For a typical store that is open 7 days a week the store would recieve around 80 hours for it's hourly associates. Barely enough for two employees there at any given time. The current District Manager is somewhat of a basket case and has no backbone. He is constantly worried about losing his job and scearching for his store managers approval. The work life balance isn't for anyone with a family or who enjoys spending time with their friends. For example the during the holidays your excpected to work 6 days a week for up to 60 hours a week while only being compensated for 40 hours. Also you do get 4 paid holidays a year, but actually when it comes down to it you only really get 1 and that is the 4th of July. Christams is another but that is the only day you get off that week, Thanksgiving is another but, you have to work that day and lastly New Years is the last one that you get and it is just counted as your regular day off for that week."
bad,If I could do it over I would. I worked here for about two years and never truly felt appreciated.
bad,"A typical day at work would have the regional manager send an mass email out to his or her district to have his or her employee's continue to push the reservation of games and subscriptions to their magazine. This push to sale is at any cost as long as it doesn't hurt the company, they dont care if you lie, cheat, or steal to the customer (although they will completely deny this and their corporate policy says otherwise): not telling them about a promotion so you can use the extra bonus to reserve games and/or push subscriptions. After that you have to get started on work that over works you and tedious to say the least. Getting paid minimum wage or a little bit more to do jobs and marketing work that is worth double to trip that pay rate. By the end of the day you will be worn out and frustrated and your paycheck will not reflect that amount of effort."
bad,"On a typical day of work I come in and have to pick up the assistant managers slack. Management is unfair and puts the welfare of themselves before the welfare of the employee. The hardest part of the job is being a hard worker and not getting noticed for it while employees that get hired on after you get promotions because they are friends with the upper management. Also, having hours cut down to 4 hours a week and not being able to pay bills. The best part of my job is making the customers happy and getting discounts on the merchandise."
bad,"When I started at Gamestop I was excited, having enjoyed many video games. In the beginning, I was told the job only required a 44 hour work week. I was also told that the company had recently changed its policies in order to retain employees. They had draconian standards that had caused them to have tremendous turnover."
bad,"Hated working here. Hours stink and no over time. It is fun, but that's about it. Only good if you're a Store Manager or higher."
bad,"If you have ever heard the phrase, die a hero or live long enough to be the villain? Gamestop should own that phrase. You will love till you advance. The higher you get the more they will pile on without proper training other then a quick read and a multiple choice quiz before they expect you to know the next four steps without training. The gist of gamestop is why pay for different jobs when we can expect one person to do them all?"
bad,GameStop has been fumbling as a company and will constantly cycle through new people.  They will find excuses to demote or get rid of you to have enough hours for the obscene amount of people they hire at each store.  They won’t respect you.  Please don’t work for them.
bad,"So essentially my biggest issue with GameStop was how they treated us when we closed. I was hired on to be a store manager, and was told that the store was in no danger of being shut down (I was asking because it's a very poor area and everything else was shutting down) I was told zero chance. Five months later, I was given six days warning that we were shutting down and I was out of a job"
bad,"Management is unappreciated and underpaid. Daily pressures for numbers and results leads to a competitive and combative environment, where upper management micro-manages every situation while placing their failed results solely on store level associates."
bad,I was a year in to my job at GameStop. I loved it. I was so good at my job I was quickly offered an assistant management job at another store over an hour away. I didn't even mind and was excited to start my career. The district manager then came in to discuss something with me. They ran another background check on me but this time an old arrest showed up. He stated that I was on suspension and to contact HR. I was never convicted but they still held the arrest against me. I was fired 6 months later through the mail.
bad,"Don't work here if you respect your time and family and mental health. If you like video games and customer interactions, but you also don't want to make a loving wage, then go ahead and apply."
bad,"Worked here for 3 years and peaked at the SGA position, only good as a second job and even that's pushing it. The pay sucks, hours are inconsistent, managers either lazy or stupid and the DM was a low-key racist who rather see the store fail then to hand me any sort power. I stayed after 4 team members quit leaving only me and one other person, working open to closes for a whole month only for them to bring someone else(white) and fired me 3 days b4 the location shutdown. All in all the less money you spend there, the better company needs new everything b4 I shop there again."
bad,Overall the company is in trouble.   They don’t know how to take care of their people and upper management is backwards thinking.  They’re policy’s are rigid
bad,"There's favoritism, and they always favor the dumb ones. The management is not fit to be in charge.  They play fast and loose with the hours.  Just not a good work environment."
bad,"The general attitude you get from upper management at Gamestop is that you are ""easily replaceable"". The company as a whole is going through incredible market pressures and has been too slow to adequately address them. This has created a culture of panic on the lower rungs of the ladder. Increasing pressure from middle/upper management to outpace previous performance in an ever tightening and narrowing market, and upper management buckling to pressure from shareholders has created an atmosphere where you are engulfed by impossible goals and ping-ponging business strategies, all while just compensation is dismissed as inconsequential."
bad,"Ho lavorato presso il Gamestop di Bassano per 3 mesi e dopo il terzo me ne sono andata. Il rapportarsi con i clienti era la parte migliore del lavoro ed io che sono una persona empatica, ero contenta di parlare con le persone e di aiutarle. Era bello veder e che i clienti  tornavano anche per parlare per farsi consigliare e non solo perchè dovevano comprare. Detto ciò mi sono trovata male con lo staff perchè ero sfruttata al massimo, facevo ore di straordinario e non mi venivano restituite se non quando mi lamentavo inoltre i colleghi a cominciare dalla store manager, facevano come gli pareva: lasciavano me in cassa per fare pause caffè lunghe anche 3 ore. Il mio impegno non è mai stato riconosciuto se non quando gli ho annunciato che me ne andavo. Ti obbligano a mentire per riuscire a fare dati, ti obbligano a raggirare il cliente per fargli spendere di più e se non facevo dati era colpa della mia mancata ""aggresività"". Ho avuto un problema con una collega solo perchè le avevo chiesto di poter prendere da mangiare,( non avrete pausa pranzo e mi sono assentata due minuti ) ,e dopo che mi aveva dato il suo consenso per andare, mi ha ""segnalata"" alla store manager che invece di mediare ha dato tutta la colpa a me( come se avessi fatto chissà che cosa)  e quando le ho fatto notare che tutte facevano così( pause caffè lunghe, pranzi, pause fumo) e che solo a me non era concesso, io ero la paranoica. Inoltre ha giustificato il comportamento della collega come giusto e non come poco professionale nei miei confronti. Me ne sono andata perchè non condividerò mai questa mentalità non"
bad,"I started working here because I love gaming and I lived close by. The assistant manager was awesome. The general manager was alright, very self-centered and so by-the-books it was almost painful. I left because of the micro-managing and the ridiculous expectations they had for Pro membership enrollment, trade-ins, and the amount of pre-owned games that were purchased. I left because $8.00/hr doesn't make ends meet in today's world."
bad,"This business is only beneficial to the store management position, this is a place that if you are any lower, you are probably living with your parents or have another full-time job to supplement your income."
bad,"You are pushed to meet unattainable goals. When you do somehow manage to meet goals, there is no reward. When you inevitably fail to meet goals you are reprimanded. "
bad,I worked at gamestop for about 2 years and it stated out great. As time passed management got lazier and the regular employees were being worked harder. scheduling was a nightmare and management would consistently leave early.
bad,"The environment is inherently fun - you get to go to work and talk about video games all day.  Then you start getting knocked by managers for not meeting sales quotas that even the top sellers struggle to meet.  Basically, they make everyone feel like they are on the edge of being fired all the time.  I did great work at that company and experienced harsh criticisms from management - management that is filled by a revolving door of people coming and going.  The turnover for all positions seemed astronomical."
bad,"Honestly it's fun but the negatives weigh them out. Under paid under appreciate, it's terrible. They ask too much of you and gender plays a major role in there advancement."
bad,"One of the common misconceptions for GameStop is that all you do is sit around and play video games all day.  Unless your task happened to be testing systems all day that is the furthest thing from the truth.  Commonly starting out at minimum wage and offering horrible raises the company can bring plenty of employees with that misconception and the social prestige of working at GameStop.  Part time work is the only thing to be had when starting and even then you're lucky if you happen to get over 10 hours a week.  Few benefits are given to part time employees; sick time, paid vacation, and holiday pay are not included with those benefits.  All in all, a somewhat better job for a person trying to make some extra cash in high school than anyone beyond that point in life."
bad,"Purtroppo una realtà che è peggiorata di anno in anno, dal  2007 fino al 2014 una delle migliore aziende, ambiente stimolante si lavorava divertendosi e si guadagnava."
bad,I wouldn't recommend working here due to the low wages/high stress and imbalanced work/home life. It's hard to pay bills on the wages they pay their employees. It's a great gig for those who are single and love to work weird non consistent hours.
bad,It is quite common knowledge that failing to hit a weekly quota can result in serious ramifications and possible termination. The company's expectations are far too high for a declining industry. Management was uncaring and threatening about job security.  The only enjoyable thing about working there was quitting and vowing never to return.
bad,"Company doesn't value its employees. Harsh sales goals that cant possibly be met,and when they aren't met the team is harassed threatened. All around horrible work environment."
bad,"GameStop as a company does not communicate well with it's employees on any level. Whether it's huge sale sets up under time constraints and understaffed stores, entire store planograms that go un-updated for months at a time by marketing teams, or even to the smallest things like release dates and inventory allocations, the entire company flounders. Information always comes in too late, and store layout executions that a required to follow an exact planogram go unchanged for months at a time despite the constant influx of new inventory."
bad,The typical workday is picking up after a bunch of entitled kids and the management teams are all so demeaning. Everyone seemed to hold a grudge against people and no one seemed to enjoy the job.
bad,Working at Gamestop unless you are a manager or assistant manger is horrible. I got maybe 16-20 hours a week at best. The pay was just over minimum wage and when the manage or assistant manager was not there I was expected to do all their work for minimal pay. The managers were also always changing my schedule and never notifying me of the changes until i would get a phone call telling me to come to work. Horrible Company to work for and even worse no communication within the company between employees and management.
bad,"Il bar è molto carino e discreto, situato nel centro della città, purtroppo lavorare nell'organico non è il massimo"
bad,Gamestop can be fun if you are in highschool this isn't a place to work if you want a career. when i got into the role of working as a manager for the store i was working about 50-60 hrs during the normal season and during christmas about 80. all of that for just 35-40k a year.... no way! again it is fun if you want to play video games and have a part time job
bad,Not abreast of current GAAP or SOX procedures.Great environment at first but  as time progressed the environment as well as culture got progressivly worse. just not a great place conducive to working.
bad,"While I enjoyed my time playing video games, and getting great discounts on games, overall I felt that my time with Gamestop was wasted. I spent many thankless hours working hard to please my superiors, and never moved up in the company. While I don't regret how hard I worked, as I feel hard work is the key to a happy productive life, I feel that it was all for nothing, considering that I was never given the chance to progress up the chain in management."
bad,"A typical day at work would be too stand on the floor and help out customers . I would also take quizzes about my gamestop knowledge online and organize and make sure everything is set. The person who hired me only had be come  in for a couple days as a seasonal job , i am still apart of gamestop in there files but i dont get any hours."
bad,from my experience most of the management is in it for them self and doesn't care who gets burned in the end . to get promoted its all about who you know and who your friends are. they have no respect for anyone who is working the butts off
bad,"I love video games and I love the people that play video games. This, however, is NO reason to work for GameStop. This company forces you to ask every customer if they're interested in ten different things that they do not want. I think that in-store sales are declining for this very reason. When I go to GameStop and I have a question I will ask it. If I want something I will go and get it. I do NOT want someone else telling me what I want, and this, unfortunately, is one of the prerequisites for working at GameStop. You must be comfortable with asking every person that comes into the store to if they'd like to purchase more than what they're already planning on purchasing. Most customers just say, ""No thanks,"" as soon as I start my pitch because they deal with it every time they visit the store. This wouldn't be the end of the world if it wasn't for the ranking system behind getting pre-orders. It's not just about endlessly badgering customers, it's about competing with your employees to see who can get the most pre-orders and card subscriptions. This is meant to give the employees some sort of incentive to get more than your co-workers when really it just forces most employees to quit within a three-month period, maybe six if they're persistent."
bad,Its holiday season and I barely get 10 hours. who could live like this off of $8/hr a every two weeks.
bad,"A Forbes list counted Gamestop, Inc as one of the worst companies to work for in the United States a few years back, and that sounds about right. "
bad,"The company started off as a good place to work and seemed like a career you could grow in.  Once the new refurbishment center was opened every employee was monitored on a constant basis, bathroom breaks were recorded and cell phones were not allowed even if there was an emergency.  Everyday would start with a department meeting where your supervisor would layout who would do what and what number was expected of you for that day.  Everyone was scheduled to go on break at the same time which lead to overcrowding the break room, overflowing microwaves (10 microwaves for 1,000 employees) and not enough seating.  The parking lot could only accommodate for 2/3 of the employee population.  Every year you would be given a review to assess your progress on a scale from 1 to 5.  This system was flawed due to the fact that in order to score a perfect 5 you would have to be in every department at all times 100 percent of the time.  Morally and ethically the company is as corrupt as they come.  The pass fail process for the quality of the products being sent out to the stores was completely based on the profit margin and therefore constantly altered to make numbers look good and product quality lacking.  This is one of the worst companies I've ever worked for right below Walmart."
bad,a set amount of number to make the goal. fixing today console and apple systems. making your number when there is no laser or parts for that system. playing video games during break and lunch.
bad,"Its was mostly rearrange the merchandise, and ring up purchases. This was my introduction to the world of working, and it didn't go great at all. One of my managers was not there most of the time, and the other was verbally abusive. My co-workers were very run of the mill and one of them was sneaky and underhanded. The job wasn't hard though, the hardest part was just dealing with trade-ins. Still, it was very fun to talk to customers about video games."
bad,"My best moments and memories of working at Gamestop were when I was able to interact with others that were passionate about the industry, as well as helping those less knowledgeable to make smart purchases. "
bad,"A typical work day consisted of opening store,processing shipment, inform customers about games, sell pre-orders for coming soon games,train associates, and close. Store management at store level was great above that there was very little training to develop further into the company. The hardest part of the job was not getting development to further my career. The most enjoyable part of my job were the customers as well as the people I worked with."
bad,Gamestop is a political corporation. They will not promote unless you know someone and even with that qualification you still need to be lucky enough to be chosen. I was next in line for a store manager position for two years straight and did not receive that promotion because of personal and racial politics.
bad,"Gamestop is the most unorganized company that treats their employees like morons. There is no communication from the corporate level to the store level, unless there is a visit that everyone should be worried about."
bad,"Over all wasn't too bad, but wasn't the best place to work. Never gave much hours, after the season was over they got rid of all their female employees. NOT and equal job opportunity. They didn't fill you in on information you needed to know."
bad,Typically as a store manager for gamestop you do no actual store managing. The higher ups dictate everything and you are just the lead monkey at the store. The morals and ethics of the company are questionable and the things they ask you to do usually makes you feel sleezy.
bad,"Co-workers help create an enjoyable atmosphere, but corporate is running the company into the ground. Only way to currently advance in this company is to work somewhere else and be recruited, due to new hiring practices focused on outside talent at the expense of current staff."
bad,Unless you're a male manager expect a lot of trouble. I only worked 9.5 hours a week on $7.25 an hour. The job itself is hard and tedious so it isn't worth it at all. I suggest looking elsewhere.
bad,"Gamestop was my dream job, I was off and on with them for ten years and that’s because of military service, this company used to be about helping the customer, now it’s about cramming as much information down their throats as possible in order to get a sale. They don’t look out for their employees, the spit on the little guy every chance they get. I’m not sure how the company has stayed in business making the decisions they have made"
bad,"Your coworkers will make or break that job. I only liked the people I worked with at my first store. After that it was all downhill. I worked at 3 locations over 4 years. They want you performing at 100% in every category everyday, that’s the culture."
bad,I have a vast amount of experience in managing a team and I was lied to when I applied stating that there are no manager positions available and then wasn’t put in the system. There is no communication between anybody. And all I hear is the the DM is a DBag I have yet to meet him and if I did I would ask him why someone of my caliber is overlooked and ignored. I can help change this company and grow it.
bad,I wasent even properly trained until I was there a few weeks when an employee asked me if I had done a specific thing in the training yet. I also did get many hours.
bad,"it's an ok job, with some ok perks, and a great team. if you want some fast and dirty job experience, this is the one for you. if I could go back I might."
bad,The manager undercutting everyone’s pay and had favoring towards males. He would only have a select group of people work for long hours while there was over 15 employees. He would have his friends hang out in the store and disturb the customers. Many of us quit that job and he was fired along with his group that worked with him. I don’t want to work at this company ever again due to horrible pay and disgusting experience.
bad,Never again worst possible management at the higher levels use and abuse good talent too many politics paid based on favoritism no work life balance etc
bad,"Do you need to make some extra cash to go on vacation? "
bad,"this is an high school job, they treat their supervisors , managers horribly. The pay is low and it is not a job for people who have more then one bil."
bad,Gamestops people are annoying and the managers have lied and treated people terribly. Gamestop would probably be a great job if you love to hate your job.
bad,"GameStop is a top-heavy, poorly strung together mess. Its ""mission"" is a show designed to keep the employees satiated from assessment to assessment.  Its 'flexible' hours are a joke, your time to be in and out is determined for you and asking for change just leads down a dead end path. Any event hosted by the higher ups to answer questions is a way to keep giving the roundabout answers and shoot down anyone who dares to call out the err of the companies ways. Other departments are barely held accountable to their work where as certain teams are hounded for any mistake."
bad,"As the store lead I was never home spent 44 hours if not more working at the store or on call, I was the circle of life is a huge part of the store leads job and at some times can be very stressful. Very poor support from district MGR"
bad,"GameStop was something of a volatile work environment. It did not provide many means of advancement and it was so focused on sales it cared not of the employee. Short staffed and underpaid, GameStop did not care for the volume of traffic. It did not let you work overtime despite needing the extra time to get work done. While illegal GameStop also not so subtly hinted at working unpaid time."
bad,The environment is really bad. Very bossy people working there in the management. It was a bad experience overall. Very difficult to learn something as the organization is very bad.
bad,I could see someone in high school working at here but anyone older I dont think they would make a decent living working at gamestop honestly. I enjoyed playing the games
bad,"it's not even half as good as what you hope it will be. there is no advancement and the position is underpaid thanks to the amount of interested applicants for your position, the upper management outside the store level is demanding and views you as a dime a dozen tool they have plenty of replacements for."
bad,"It seemed cool at first once starting out, hours were nice but you quickly learn once vested (fte) that it ends there. While i did learn alot of technical skills its very much like pulling teeth to get them to let you do something you want to do."
bad,"I had an incredible manager during my time at GameStop, but every other thing about working for the company was not worth it. The pay was minimal (almost literally) with raises only coming for moving up in the company. There is no effort to keep people that do well or love the job, and it leaves employees feeling very replaceable."
bad,"Managers have bad communication. And will schedule an employee and then take the hours away at the last minute."
bad,"When you're younger you think that gamestop is a dream job, then fast forward to when you get to work there, you start at minimum wage, with no guarantee of raises, then are forced to push products and services that people don't want or need and be reprimanded if you don't meet a quota."
bad,"I couldn't wait to get a more stable job. My direct manager, the store lead, was great; fair and kind. The district and regional managers were absolutely terrible: constantly changing things last minute, making things up, lying, blaming anyone but themselves. I feel so bad for everyone that worked there and continues to work there now. The culture was horrible, and everyone is paid far below what they should be."
bad,There's a severe lack of respect from anyone in the corporate office for anyone in the stores. I was told by my district manager I should just quit instead of voicing my concerns about the culture of the store. Unacceptable to me.
bad,"Skulking about, scouring the store.  Preying upon browsing customers.  All the horror stories one has come to expect to find in the modern retail landscape are ripe for the pickling at GameStop."
bad,"I typically worked 10 hours per day at least. I learned a lot about time management, payroll, business presentations, bringing in high volume sales, working under stressful conditions while remaining calm, and managing a fairly large staff successfully. The culture is probably one of the worst parts of the job. The goals are incredibly high and if you do not reach them one or two weeks your job is on the line. There is always pressure to offer unnecessary items to guests in order to hit goals even when the item has nothing to do with the guest's purchase or interests. The upper management is awful and has no idea how difficult things are at the store level. They set lofty goals and expect them to be hit, wondering why a lot of their stores aren't reaching expectations. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to talk to customers about similar interests and help them as best I could. I had so many regular customers and it was always fun to see them come to the store."
bad,"While Gamestop is nerd heaven from the outside, on the inside its another cookie cutter retail that asks you to place way more effort into your job than the pay. Between the low pay/hours, lack of any benefits, and the stressful holiday work, this job should be a secondary or temporary job at best. Gamestop is, however, a place that is a great job for those with no job experiences under their belt, but should seek a different permanent job or secondary job within the first few months."
bad,"I LOVE GAMES. Which is why my dream job since I was young was Game Stop. When I started yea it was fun. The problem I had with it was that my position was the 3rd rank manger who did everything the 2nd and 1st ranked mangers did but got paid less. The 1st ranked leader gets all the free stuff, systems, memberships, and majority of the games. Not to mention the discounts are garbage... my discount did way more at RITE AID. If you only want game stop for free games and your not a 1st rank, 2nd rank, and possible a 3rd rank, good luck.... but if you're lucky and do get a game hopefully you like games such as Deformers and Has-Been Heroes. ALL INDIE GAMES."
bad,"All I really did was train, I was never put on the schedule to do actual work. Not much can really be said about the job when I never really got the chance to experience it. I would be scheduled to work and go up there only to be told I was not needed, so I'd spend two dollars everyday just get up there as I had to take public transportation there. I was still paid for all the training I did."
bad,"Minimum wage, part time work. sometimesu will go weeks without hours ( non holiday seasons ). Even if u DID make it all the way to GM of a store, you wouldnt even get past 50k a year..."
bad,"I was one of 3 people hired as a seasonal employee looking for a little additional cash separate from my full-time job at CVS. The store I was hired at was in a mall around the holiday season so it was very busy. My hours were inconsistent, some weeks I would work one day for 12 hours, some weeks I ""wasn't needed."" pay was minimal ($8.50/hour) the commute from my house to Gamestop was so long that when I was eventually offered to stay on as a full-time employee I declined the offer."
bad,My DL was horrible. He picks on the struggling stores and refuses to help them succeed. If you aren't in the corporate click you won't be taken care of.
bad,"I've been with the company 2 years this November, and it is by far the worst company I've ever worked for. The only good thing is the discounts on products/games. "
bad,I was hired on to do seasonal work through the fall and early winter. Over the course of 4 months I had only worked 3 times. However I did enjoy the few times that I did work.
bad,"Gamestop was okay as a part time job. When it comes to getting more hours and a possible key holder position and transition to management, they will tell you what you want to hear to keep you satisfied. Even though my stats were good and I had never had one issue there, I was strung along with the lies of moving up. I was only moved up once there was no other option. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting customers who were just as interested as you about certain things, or when you can give a customer the correct knowledge to help them make a purchase or not."
bad,"Gamestop will bleed you dry for everything you are worth and leave you as a dried out husk of a man, taking your life essence, and using it to fuel their fascist corporate agenda. Working here will shave days if not months of your life. BE WARY."
bad,"This company doesn't care about it's employees. They try to berate you into selling products, and make you lie to customers in order to increase the dollar value of each sale."
bad,"very little hours given, the excuse is a seasonal usually only get 5 hours a week, but that is not beneficial to even have the job when it doesnt even pay for your gas, After many promises of being hired on  for a real part time position, I was let go and now that store doesnt even recognize that I had previously worked there, so yeah not very good management or structure"
bad,"This company is great for high school students just breaking into the work world, but definitely not for adults that have dependents to provide for."
bad,"Gamestop was just a seasonal position for the holidays. I went in knowing that it would be, overall it was HORRIBLE. Hours were 4.5 to 8 a week. I loved talking about new games with my coworkers and that was the only pro aside from the discount on products. They switch managers so easily it is not even funny. A typical day in a shift at Gamestop would just be meet and greet any customers, find out what they are looking for and get it for them so the registers could ring them up. In our down time we would find any game cases and alphabetize the in the best way possible. Gamestop did not schedule me after Christmas, and when I came in on January 25th to  inquire about my W-2 I asked, ""When are the SEASONAL(team members) being let go?"" which is what I was and the guy working said, ""Are you serious? You guys get let go on the 16th!"" They never contacted me, reached out to me  or made any effort to communicate that I didn't work there. That is what made this company so bad to work for."
bad,"More like selling a car than regular retail. plenty of incentives for Managers. But balancing whats important now vs. the big picture creates a hostile working environment. Your employees don't really work for you, so control tends to put you and the DM at odds."
bad,"At an entry level position, the job is a dream. All you do is sell, you get paid, you go home. If you get promoted, it becomes a nightmare. Once you are promoted, you subsume the same amount of duties as an Assistant Manager without the title or the pay raise (which is miniscule). Schedules are varied and unless you specify, are at the company's convenience. The store I was at changed schedules without telling the employees, then blamed them for not being on time. "
bad,"The job in itself is fairly easy, however, management rarely commends people for their exceptional performance but at the same time they will belittle you for rare negative performance. The environment is nice as you will have coworkers who will share interests with you so conversations will be engaging. One of the huge downsides is the amount of product the company wants you to ""shove"" into someones face during each visit. Most people become turned off by this and it is difficult to establish relationships with people when they deem you as pushy or a nuisance. "
bad,That company is a terrible place to work. There is nothing positive about working there. It is a hostile work environment and it is just a horrible company. 
bad,"A day at work consist of interacting with customers! Doing distro, RSB, and other duties! I learned customer service and how to interact with people in a variety of ways! Management was ok. The best thing was they are very very good at working around your schedule! The people I worked with were usually good! There is a high turnover rate because its a video game store! If you don't do your job then they will replace you because there are plenty of people who want a job at a video game store. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the massive work load while expecting to get good numbers for the company with no compensation or for that matter even a thank you! The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the people!"
bad,sales goals that are attainable only half the time and store resets and marketing kits almost every other day. as they also make games that they know are flops their main priority rather than bank on hot titles. poor upper management (district)
bad,"Upper management so far removed from what happens in the stores. No hours. Min wage, very low to no raises."
bad,A very noticeable bias to immigrants. Full time employees very disrespectful to temps. Work area dusty . I developed  a chronic cough and sneezing. Will not return.
bad,"Always thought I wanted to work here until I actually worked there. It's okay at lower levels, but the more you advance the more you see the company's agenda is just to make money for themselves and not care about creating any value for the customers."
bad,Being a store manager I could go on and on about how bad the corporate treats a lot of their employees. I will say the benefits are great! Other than that it's not worth the constant belittling.
bad,"I think the title really says it all.  The coworkers can be great, provided you work well with them, but corporate policies are terrible and the fact of the matter is, until you are a store manager, you are 100% expendable."
bad,"I want to start out by saying that this is a case by case basis and before you work at a Gamestop location you should do research on the store you are looking to work for before thinking about having a job there. "
bad,The store leader was amazing. We built a great team. Literally everything else is toxic. Hostile work environment driven by fear tactics from corporate. Threats of termination almost daily. Passive aggressive practices designed to pull as much money as possible from every person. Don't work here.
bad,I was super excited to get a job with GameStop I am a gamer and genuinely have a passion for gaming . Unfortunately they do not provide a reliable schedule and will have you work 1 to 2 days a month .. not a place to work if you want to make an honest living
bad,"If you are lucky to advance beyond GA, then you can get some hours. Gamestop likes to hire a lot of low level employees and only give them one day a week. You are required to push pre orders and warranty. Many call outs and have seen people work off the clock in order to get corporate last minute demands done but at the same time not go over hours. There isn’t much room to grow unless someone quits."
bad,"To be honest, Upper management had no clue how to run a retail store.  Spew the same stuff everyday but don’t follow any of it.  All employees are super lazy especially upper management just hand off all responsibility to staff. No job security , no hours , low pay.  The only plus sides were decent employees , free rentals , if available you can choose your own hours.  If you need a first job this is easy as sleeping"
bad,"I wouldn't recommend it. No matter how well you do, or how little you all get the same thing, nothing! Except you get written up alot if your numbers are low, after awhile they will just fire you."
bad,"Sad job in general, and it was stressful and i wasnt able to move up unless i pushed far too many games to my customers. Its one thing to recommend, another to push all the time."
bad,GameStop is notorious for their treatment of their employees and shady business practices for a reason. The company forces employees to get customers to sign up for credit cards that they do not necessarily need or want. The fact that the company attempts to put customers into debt for video games should tell you all you need to know about their business model. 10/10 would not recommend.
bad,They want you to be super pushy with things like there reserve list and it makes the over all customer experience lower in quilty not to mention when your busy and having to rush it looks bad on you if you don't push things
bad,"I love my management but there is no change for advancement unless you want to work at stores in bad parts of town. I was told that we would be working on keeping consistent hours, 'no promises though' (GameStop Policy), on how many that would be. "
bad,I worked at gamestop for a year. I was promoted to sga. The upper management is the true problem. They move people around to much and promote from the outside.
bad,"Old Gamestop from 2007 and Gamestop of today are two very different things. They went a different direction and have almost all but destroyed everything we worked so hard to build. Wasting money on Spring Mobile, Simply MAC, Kongregate, Cricket , etc. They lost so much money there, so they cut tenure bonuses and have crazy turnover. They refuse to embrace digital mediums and are now to late to the game to make a bid on streaming services. So, stay away it’s a very toxic environment. Refer to Circle of Life as a selling tool."
bad,"I am a college student and a young mother, working at gamestop has hindered my life more than helped. I had always been passionate about gamestop until recently, I only get one or two four-hour shifts each week."
bad,I loved working at Gamestop because my other managers where awesome but the pay is terrible and the higher ups have no idea what they are doing. They started to make you approach people like car salesman and the standards they had for reserves and getting people to sign up for the power up card is horrendous. And most of the customers don’t understand how a business works so most of the time they got upset over trade in prices.
bad,"Applied to the job asking for around 30 hours a week. When hired, I had about 3 or 4 weeks total of no hours at all, and all other weeks were only 1 or 2 days. At most I did 3 days in a week, because I was called in. It seemed they mostly did call-ins but because of my other job I was rarely able to accept. After 4 months I worked a total of around 15 shifts. Not at all what I was looking for, when seasonal ended I just felt I had wasted time, effort, and stress."
bad,I loved my job at Gamestop but I was not a fan of the company itself. My original manager was fantastic but my last manager was not a great person. It was always a fun job and I met some wonderful people while working there.
bad,"Gamestop is the wet dream workplace for nerds who want to talk about video games all the time. What they don't tell you is that corporate constantly makes horrible sale decisions, usually going all in on failing titles like Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, and then blaming the lower level workers for the games not selling. There are no incentives to do try to increase your personal sales or numbers, raises are hardly ever mentioned, and even shift managers like myself only get an average of 12 hours to work a week. The only two positions guaranteed full time are the store leader at 44 hours, and the assistant store leader at 32 hours. Shift managers average between 10 and 14 hours a week, and lower level employees would be lucky to get a 4 hour shift once a week, with most lower levels working 4 hours only every other week because we aren't given enough hours to go around. Most Gamestop stores are understaffed and hiring is incredibly exclusive and usually relies on being friends with the store leader, and most managers are extremely accusatory if something goes wrong, as we are all constantly threatened with the loss of our jobs for any slip ups or even the slightest under performance. While some of my fellow co-workers are fun to work with, I often don't get to see them due to working by myself due to lack of hours given to others."
bad,Most days I had to meet nearly impossible goals selling preowned products or new products also to get people to trade even if it wasn't worth it for them
bad,The upper manangement consistently puts pressure on each employee with trying to reach unruly goals every week. Employees work by themselves all the time and have no type of protection.
bad,Gamestop is a specialized retailor focused on Video Games and Video Game culture. The company strongly emphasizes guest interaction and a full service selling experience.
bad,"I hated working here. We were never appreciated. It was work work work constantly with no break. We went through many managers in the few years that I worked there, because they all got fired. The regional manager stopped by one time and told our manager to fire anyone who didn't speak Spanish. That was very rude and unfair. I would never go back to gamestop."
bad,A typical day of work consists of assisting customers in finding the right product for their needs. The most enjoyable part of the job is discussing and selling products and features.
bad,ernjoyed my three years here. first job as a manager company was able to promote real quick left for better opportunities. Overall great company.
bad,"I'm sure that many gamers dream of working at a store devoted to their favorite hobby, but working at GameStop isn't secure. While, you can check out any game in stock, brand new or used, for free, corporate is awful. It's a numbers-based job; you're expected to get a certain number of pre-orders and new cards, but it's not commission based. Pay is minimum wage starting out and your entry level hours are very limited. Scheduling might be the worst part because, even if your numbers are good, you're not guaranteed to work 10 hours a week. Corporate moved my manager, but didn't train my assistant manager before promoting him. My ASM was so stressed out, he quit. They didn't even train our new manager so she's stressed out and constantly worrying about something. Maybe my experience with GameStop is particularly bad, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it."
bad,It was a good place to learn how it feels to struggle to get by. Thats why I left. I needed to be in a place where I made decent wages and wasnt spending all my time and money playing games.
bad,"Gamestop as a whole isn't a bad place to work, but in this region, it's terrible. The district manager is a pathetic excuse for a human being. I was put on a three week training program to improve my subscription sales, and in the middle of week 2, I was fired for poor subscription sales. I was almost fired early into my career as well because I put my thumb over the mouthpiece of the phone (district manager had called during christmas rush), and he thought I put him on hold."
bad,A typical day was very fun at Gamestop.My co-workers were generally fun to work with and I had a great and fun manager.At gamestop I learned how to receive and ship packages.There really is no hard part of working at gamestop except the constant organizing of the daily mess at the end of the day.The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the regular customers and talking with them and having fun with co-workers.One big problem is the amount of hours you are given every week to work.Some weeks you may get only 4 hours in one week.16-20 hours is the average amount of work time you usually get.That being said Gamestop is more of a side-job/part-time job than anything.Another problem is the worthless changes that corporate forces you to do that makes you think they have a bunch of monkeys working in their department.
bad,My job used to be amazing. Very customer focused with a welcoming environment. My direct manager is wonderful and I love my customers. My district manager ruined the work environment for me and a large amount of my peers. I have no passion for my job and it seems the corporate focus is back towards metric goals and not customer service and providing an experience.
bad,"The job was okay but the culture is terrible and management is awful. They preach over and over to take accountability for your actions and mistakes. However don't expect that from them its always someone else's fault, which is not surprising because honestly most of the supervisors and managers are terrible. To be fair ther are a few good ones and they are awesome. However most will give you wrong information or directions, then blame you for doing the wrong thing even if you follow their directions to the tee. CYA (Cover your you know what)  is the most important thing because they will always try and throw the blame at someone else and it could be you. I do have to point out that this is mainly at the ROC (Refurb Operations Center) and not the corporate office. The culture and management is much better there. However the Corporate office is separated from the ROC so we don't see much of corporate and since we aren't the money maker we use to be I doubt they even care. The pay is decent but in my opinion its not enough to justify the stress and you aren't going to advance much. There are people who have been there 10 plus years that won't take promotions because its not worth it. One good thing is that the warehouse is climate controlled air conditioning in the summer and heater in the winter. It is often cold in the summer, though not always and if it gets to hot they will turn down the air."
bad,I would only recommend this job if you have no bills to pay and don't need any kind of discount and/or benefits from your job. This job is definitely the most unbalanced and constantly shifting job i've ever worked.
bad,went in for a game left with a job. Given 15 hours a week if that.90% of the time i was called out of work because it was slow. Was on the phone or computer for work most of the time (things other employees didn't want to do).
bad,"If you're someone who's a passionate gamer, GameStop is NOT the place to work. GameStop is all about making sales. I was on the sales floor, cashier, doing operations and an overall Keyholder where things had to get done in a time frame. It was hard to focus on sales if operations had to be done and vice versa (which was the hardest part of the job). The one thing that kept me around for these 2 years was working with my co-workers. My SM and ASM was like family to me. They've taught me everything I know. Eventually my SM had to move to another store and my ASM got moved up to SM. The district manager was not so nice. He'd smile in your face and be as sarcastic as possible but he moved very funny to me. I remember I was left stranded because I was closing and our gate was stuck/jammed. I call the DM for help and he had no solution for me. He told me I had to stay there until I found a solution. If I'd leave without the store correctly secured, I'd be terminated. Right there I knew they didn't care for me or my well being. What's worse? Getting robbed or getting robbed with one of your workers being murdered? Eventually my dad came and played with the chains to unjam the gate. This is where I felt like I was working for a company who didn't appreciate me. My work ethic started to fade because I feel your job is suppose to make you feel appreciated."
bad,"I could go on for days about the inability of upper level management and the unfocused approach to the industry of the company. However as an entry-level job that frequently hires from within, there are okay opportunities for those willing to fight for them"
bad,"•	3 year job experience at GameStop"
bad,"I work at Game Stop only for seasonal and it's amazing how much of a depressing job it is for such a little time spent there. The managers or company I should say puts a 1000lbs of pressure on it's employees to sell pre-orders and magazines to customers. They write severe quotas on your progress. I didn't mind it but their advice and tactics of ""shoving"" unwanted merchandise or cards down customer's throats is appalling."
bad,"The company doesn't value hard work, promotions are slim to none, and pay raises are miniscule. The Management I had was decent, but for the most part they are overworked, stressed out, and the turnover rate is higher than I have ever seen. I saw so many friends come and go in the business because of how poorly they were treated in the company. The perks of renting games is okay depending on the manager, and the discount of 15 percent off new games is nothing to write home about. Overall the experience is poor. The only good is the Store Managers and the work and home life, otherwise everything you stand for and do doesn't matter to them."
bad,"After working here for almost a year my hours slowly dwindled to nothing. Sales goals became too forced and my performance was based on random customer buys. If you can sell an ice cube to an Eskimo then you'll be fine here, otherwise look elsewhere."
bad,You are expected to hit numbers with no comission compensation. You are expected to do huge workloads and often work on your own. Everything is a one man show and you are extremely underpaid.
bad,"I wish I could have them back. I was promised advancement then forgotten as soon as that manager moved up, then passed up for advancement in order for them to promote the females I helped train to do the job I was supposed to have. The pay was poor and raises were laughable. Before I could quit, I was fired over something they had no proof of simply because the manager I had was a manchild."
bad,little hours worked. little pay and there is little advancement in the company. love helping people with games but hated advertiseing what to preorder and what not to.
bad,"horrible hours , slow business , terrible managers,  who are now fired, and constant hounding from higher ups for more sales , preorders and trades . do not work here"
bad,"GameStop needs people during the holidays. Afterwards, you are but a single grain of sand on the beach, it doesn’t matter if you are there or not. I was dropped to 4 hours a week and then my boss told me to get my phone turned on. I have three kids, and 4 hours a week doesn’t pay for food for the week, let alone any kind of other bill or necessity. They tell you that advancement is possible, but then don’t advance you. This is a terrible place. Any gamer who wants to work there, save yourself a lot of stress, look elsewhere for employment."
bad,"Pay is Terrible, they have like a 1 strike tolerance policy for most of their policy violations so there is no chance to mess up and it doesn't drop off for 1 year. Can get wrote up for anything the managers can think of for no reason as well"
bad,Draining your life and having customers tell you are you okay was not fun. stay away from gamestop please. Sure you meet awesome people but upper management is a terrible wreck.
bad,"I had wanted to work at Gamestop since I was a kid and the moment I got my foot in the door everything seemed to good to be true and boy was i right. There tactics that they verbally force you to do to sell product, manipulate customers, and the constant threat of if your not pushing hard enough you will be let go is unreal in a place that claims to be about the gaming community as a whole and is there to help you find what your looking for. Weather it was having to look people in the face and tell them for the 100th time that the 10 games they are trading in is worth $8.50 or $5 cash made me absolutely sick to my stomach when I knew we would turn it around and sell it for far more. This may be considered great profit in the business world the overall effect you have on the people you claim to serve with a smile will eventually see that and you will lose it all.I would never recommend this place to anyone for any reason other than I need a job now and have kids to feed."
bad,"On the outside looking in, it looks so fun. Getting to be around great people, great customers was fantastic. From the inside looking out, it was one of the worst job experiences I've endured. Entry level pay, raises were .25 or .50 at a time. The ability to be promoted to SGA from GA was simple, anywhere above that was next to impossible."
bad,it was stressful they wanted you to make a certain amount of sales in different areas and if you couldn't they would let you go. They would tell you to do it by any way you could even if you had to lie.
bad,"after asking if i was able to transfer to a new gamstop closer to my new house that is 2 hours away, mind you this was a transfer for a move 3 months out i was writen off the schedual"
bad,"The obsession with the ""Cycle of Life"" and employees following the script was a hindrance to both my performance and my varoius feelings about the workplace."
bad,"This job is extremely stressful as all corporate cares about is Magazine subscriptions and game reservations. Customer service is the last of their worries. If you don""t produce these on a regular basis your job and hours are in jeopardy."
bad,"Gamestop treats their employees as though they could all steal everything in the store at any given moment. Even managers with a great track record are subject to disciplinary action if their store isn't performing in any of the six areas they choose to track, most of which you have no control over. Their middle management doesn't take the time to get to know their subordinates."
bad,"Don’t waste your time. I put in 6 years with this company and I’ve seen the ups and downs. They’ll be out of business soon, likely to file bankruptcy by the end of the year."
bad,You have to do so much work and handle so many responsibilities for very very poor pay. It's fun at first but then it will eventually hit you how little the company actually cares about its employees.
bad,"Gamestop sometimes gets an unfair reputation for the faults of individual managers, yet was no worse to its guests or employees than other retailers. However, it seems incredibly unlikely the company will remain in its current form much longer due to falling profits and failing ventures. I would recommend this job for someone young who does not know what they want to do but I would not recommend this as a career option as the pay isn’t good enough, the stress from management is too constant and the future of the company is too murky"
bad,The Gamestop I worked at had great people and management but just paid poorly and offered too little in terms of hours. Sure it was cool being around games and people with the same interests as you but it isn't the place for a permanent position
bad,"Now more than ever at the end of every fiscal year stores for this company will close, the job security with this business stands only with heavy volume stores and online. The online portion contradicts the instore sales and doesn’t support store sales but still expect you to sell paid memeberships and preorders for games that will be 40 dollars cheaper in 3weeks."
bad,"I enjoyed my time at Gamestop as a sales associate, moving into a part-time management position was a mistake. The number of things we were required to sell at the register was ridiculous, most guests didn't want to listen at that point in their transaction, and management continually pushed and punished if sales were not where they needed to be."
bad,Working random hours with no set schedule and unpredictable hours weekly. Pay is minimum with no real benefits other then lower cost of video games and accesories.
bad,"I spent a lot of time wondering why my manager was quick to tell me I wasn't performing well enough, but did nothing to help. More of a ""pusher"" than a leader I guess."
bad,"You get no guaranteed hours unless you are at least an Assistant Store Manager. Even shift-leads can work as little as 10 hours a week. The Store Managers are salaried and often made to work between 50-80 hours a week (depending on season) only to be laid off once they seem to earn one too many raises. Over the 2 years I worked for the company my store had seen:"
bad,"The company and the management do not care about the workers. Even as a keyholder, you may only see 15 hours a week, unless it's during the holidays. Regular sales associates get less. This place was a waste of multiple years of my life."
bad,GamesStop is a gamers heaven at first glance. One of them places where don't really know how bad the place is to work until u actually work their. The hours are bad as well as the pay if u are not a manager or a assistant manager good look with ever being able to survive and pay rent and bills. High responsibility without the salary to match. Rarely if any advancement in the company. Also years and years of great and hard work means nothing. I have seen good people lose their jobs for the smallest of things after working there for over 9 years.
bad,Very shady sales practices and harsh accountability for underperforming according to the “standards” they set.  Favoritism leads to career advancement.
bad,"My first manager was amazing this review would of been a 10/10 if he stayed. my new manager was horrible , did 0 work paid me less while I was there since July."
bad,"I really enjoyed doing what I did at Gamestop being that I love to play video games, however the store violated many company policies on a daily basis (including an employee living with the manager of the store) that was very frustrating to deal with. Upper management was difficult to deal with as far as communication. Many times employees were made to work off the clock to complete a task by the deadline without going over payroll."
bad,"A typical day at work - when I was given hours - was spent selling video games, consoles and accessories. We were forced to constantly push our membership card on our customers. The hardest part of my job was getting hours. Myself and the other female who worked there loved video games and did our best to sell, but we were lucky to get one day a week towards the end of our run there. The males were all put on every day. I was not the best at selling, but that's because I would not aggressively bully the customer into buying product, though I did make a blatant effort. I feel this is why I didn't get enough hours. They were too obsessed with selling rather than what's right for the customer, the pay was minimum wage with no commission for all our efforts, and they were oddly unforgiving about facial piercings for a company that caters to a large audience of pierced individuals. The only perk to that job was being able to rent used games for a few days and a very small discount, plus of course talking about video games with customers."
bad,"I think every gamer has a small 'dream' about working there. All I can say is, don't do it. Your passionate hobby for video games will be crushed. Having to deal with a terrible commercial running 24/7, poor store organization, and that one ignorant co-worker of yours can drive you mad. The work is easy, but repetitive unless you are a store opener."
bad,It was the only jobs i grew to hate. The management was disorganized and unprofessional. I put in a year at gamestop and i do regret it. The company has few benefits. The people running the company have never been at any of the locations and it shows with everything that they do.
bad,So I was an assistant manager for game stop. I was dishonestly fired by the district manager.. in July of 2018 my manager came to me telling me our district manager asked him to find or make up a reason to fire me so he could promote another associste.. it was in August they made up the lie that I was talking badly of a fellow associate and fired me. Then promoted the other associate. I wasn't allowed to defend my self or my story or anything. The cameras don't capture audio so there was no proof of what was said not to mention when asked to show me the footage he claimed he had he denied me that and then backed it up with the manager admitted to over hearing it as he walked in... which according to any court is hear say and inadmissible... game stop is a share holder business and they don't care about customers or employees just the money they get.
bad,"I have been there almost two years and had been past up for a permotion twice and now have a week with only 10 hours, the next with zero. It lives up to the memes about it."
bad,I use to love working here! I was there for 7 years! and it meant nothing to my hire ups! Beware with this company. You only get far here if you are already besties with the hire ups!
bad,"Customer service and standard retail stuff like re stocking, using the registrar, answering the phone and so on. This is not the problem with this company. The problem is the huge pressure that is put on staff and managers to get sales (ex. magazine subscriptions, pre-orders, warranty coverage and now I think credit card sign ups, although this happened after I left) this pressure is in turn put on the customers. Its not the aspect of getting sales that is bad its how they make you do it. I was told I needed to be told no by a customer three times before I could leave them alone about something (even if it is something that you know they will not use or need) if you were lucky you only annoyed them but I know a lot of people who won't come back because they feel hassled. If you don't get these 'numbers' your hours will be cut and you will be put on when you really can't get the sales to recover so it is a downward spiral. Getting hours is the only incentive to employees to get these sales. "
bad,typical day at Gamestop was different everyday because i always had to be updated about the new games that are coming out each day. I learned how to cash people out and restock games on the floor. The co workers were always friendly and always worked as a team.
bad,"While I spent most of my time here, GameStop is a company that has no clear direction. Ever changing policies and floundering responses have really hindered this company."
bad,"My store's manager was great, the assistant manager was great, everyone was great. Except everything outside of the store was a mess. The regional and district management had such an apathy towards any responisbility to us that it was infuriating."
bad,I was frequently berated by my workers when I worked at Gamestop.  The managers were all rude and simultaneously incredibly arrogant about the medium of video games.
bad,"I love what I worked with not who I worked for. Very fast pace work environment, beyond stressful lake of pay and motivation from upper management. The more you do the more they ask with no compensation or even a thank you."
bad,gamestop is a terrible place to work. the way they treat their employees is sickening. you get no time off and they pay is abysmal. for a management position you make 10-11/hr and thats just not worth the headache you have to put up with
bad,"I cannot say much about Game Stop. Worst company I worked for. Upper management promotes/conducts favoritism. The work place culture is all about sales and numbers up to the point that they will cut your hours. No help from anyone and no one cares. Employees were on drugs at times and if you disclose that to HR, they would do nothing."
bad,"overworked under payed, worst management practices.. they dont pay overtime and expect you to work your behind off.. i hated working for gamestop. i am so glad i left"
bad,"You come in and have a million tasks to do, you hours are cut dramatically over the weekend and the district manager come in and gives you added work/ it sucks to work at gamestop"
bad,Daily phone meetings. Company policies are stated but never actually followed. Customers run the company. Management ( GM and DM) do not listen. No matter how hard you work or how many cards (elite and pro) you sell they treat as if it is still not good enough.
bad,it was my dream job. not too much is expected of you but you fill spare time with work while you socialize with customers or coworkers. point of sale machine was complicated but not too difficult to learn. things have changed in the company that make it much more corporate and seems more like they care less about the customers.
bad,I was consistently told not to come in on scheduled days due to staff scheduling errors. Then I was given about 1 day per week to work and was then let go because I was not selling enough Pro Cards when I was only working one day per week.
bad,"The job itself wasn't entirely bad. Some customers were nice and friendly. Others were just the absolute worst. Always had a terrible manager. Even when you're doing the best in the district, you are still not good enough."
bad,I enjoyed my responsibilities and my team. gamestop's focus is to far from their employee's needs. there was no room for advancement in the company past a district manager.
bad,GameStop is productive in stocking/restocking. At times it can be very slow with customers. The female manager is very rude and moody. A lot of the co workers were lazy.
bad,"Do not work at Gamestop if you expect to make enough money to eat anything other than Ramen and Spam. I hated that job with a passion. Just do yourself the favor, and just, dont."
bad,"Gamestop has a well deserved reputation for not caring for its employees.  Their wages were low, as were their benefits.  They consistently pressure their employees for more reserves with the threat of losing your job as the only reason to do so."
bad,"I was off work on my birthday and at the last minute they called me into work,  I had no way of getting there so they decide to fire me ihad only been there for 2 weeks"
bad,They are a great company to work for if you are into video games and to get you started in technology. BUt they do not give many hours at all. They are not very busy.
bad,"strict company sales guidelines, horrible training staff, terrible communication, upper management takes no part in daily store operations, payroll is limited even in management positions"
bad,"Experienced in principles of supervision and customer satisfaction strategies; consistently demonstrating adaptability,  flexibility, and advanced-problem solving skills. Ready to meet a new challenge."
bad,"good people & trainers but bad company, dirty warehouse & restrooms. Poor pay after been there for a while. favoritism. what made me keep going is the people there and not quitting without  another job lined up."
bad,"This company does NOT care about it's employees. I've seen many great people get fired or get run out of the place by horrible district managers and other higher up people. Pay is minimal, even for management, and you are expected to maintain near impossible sales numbers in several criteria with literally NO incentive other than you get to keep your job."
bad,Terrible place to work. Has so much potential. Corporate yells and screams at you if you do something they do not approve of. Pay is horrible. Benefits horrible.
bad,not enough care went into the employees and their lives.The long hours and crazy schedule make it hard to coordinate with life and other jobs
bad,Terrible for managers they want to much with no store help. 70 hour work weeks.
bad,"Horrid pay treats you poorly, DO NOT WORK FOR THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They do not care for you at all"
bad,"I'm not doing 3 total reviews of the same thing I said in my first one. This of course doesn't make my original review wrong or false, but I see no reason to repeat that stuff! Plus the fact that this site does this is kind of stupid."
bad,"Laid me off, so I am sad! I had fun with my customers. They made my job worth having!"
bad,"It is alright as a part-time job or if you are 16 and still living at home.  It is not worth working there for minimum wage and only working 4 -10 hours a week,"
bad,What should be a fun environment buying and selling video games has been tainted by unreachable sales goals; wholly inadequate labor budgets; too many different directives from too many departments; and a blurred mission statement.  The culture in the stores is one generated by a desperate corporate entity trying to save itself by cannibalizing its own people.
bad,"Typical day is your typical customer service. But tack on top of that daily counts, merchandising the floor, moving floorsets, marketing sets, and inventories at all hours of the night and it's a nightmare. Required 6-day work weeks at times and midnight events, the inability to take any weekend time regardless of seniority, the promise of promotability with no formally or informally communicated plan on how to get there, and much more. Management was completely lacking any willingness to help, though help was always verbally offered. Coworkers all hate the place, but love it at the same time. It's a love/hate relationship, because they've all become friends that game together, so they stay together even though it's terribly. The hardest part of the job is being expected to be a manager when you're not given enough hours to have coverage for the business, so you end up being a cashier most of the time. The most enjoyable part was the people underneath me on the chain. Many of them showed great enthusiasm and drive -- too bad it will be wasted in this company."
bad,glorified pawn shop constant police involvement lost touch with customer base
bad,"This is not a good company to work for, no overtime pay for overtime work. The leadership team does not care about the wellbeing of the employees."
bad,"At it's peak, I was there for on 2 hour shift in a span of 3 weeks. They will not schedule you at all so you need to rely on a second job. You must have knowledge of every game since the 1990's, because a lot of different people come in"
bad,Depending on which store u get placed but mostly face pacedyou will need a sense of urgency and great communication skills abd very attentive and respectable.
bad,"Gamestop is majority, everyone's dream job. It shouldn't be. But it is a fun side gig. The starting pay is $7.25. Than you receive a yearly performance review and pay raise. Depending on how much money you make your store and follow rules. You can expect a generous pay boost. If you are a moderate worker, you get at least 50¢ or a 25¢ raise. If you suck, expect a cruddy review and little to no raise. Certain locations offer a great experience, but that all depends on your district leads behaviour. When starting as a guest advisor, you'll learn of something called the circle of life. The majority of your job hangs on your numbers. You have to meet 6 sales goals either weekly, or daily depending on how pressured the store is to go above and beyond. These goals are, reservations, power up rewards renewals, pre-owned purchases, trades, and collectibles. The balancing of those numbers depend on the frequency of guests seeking those specific items, or your add-on sales abilities. If you sell a member ship, reservation, pre-owned item, trade, and collectable, you're set. Just don't sell anything else, at all unless you can balance that circle out. Cause if you get more new game purchases over pre-owned and renewals, you're screwed unless you can fix it. Now if you survive the first year, you should be promoted by now. Supervisor is the next step. Or an SGA. You get paid at least $8.00-$8.50. You gain more responsibilities, store keys and better benefits. I.e. free games if your manager wants to give you one, and a free elite pro membership. If your numbers are garbage, now's the time"
bad,"the hardest part of the job is working alone with many many customers in the store at one time, which would happen frequently"
bad,"This is like any other Corporate place.  You have your ups and downs, but the environment can be fun at times.  The relationships between coworkers are instant and reliable.  The relationships with upper management could take some polishing."
bad,I worked at a location in the mall as an Assistant Manager. They give you barely any hours to put your employees on the schedule which leaves you in the store all day doing inventory and a million other things by yourself. The employee discount only took off tax so that sucked also. As an assistant manager i got paid $10 dollars an hour with no commission for getting people to sign up for the rewards card. $10 for a management position? I got paid more than that in non-management positions doing less work. No thanks. I only took the job for the management experience which looks good on resume :-)
bad,"I got hired as an Assistant Manager with a pay rate of $10.50 hourly (horrible) and no bonuses, commissions, or compensation for the quotas that had to be met for pre-orders and subscriptions. I've had non-management jobs that paid more hourly. They also require you to do a million things on the job with minimal hours to give to store associates if you needed help (except during holidays). Only recommend this job for someone who really needs some sort of income or for high school students."
bad,"Gamestop was a hard place to work at because of its need to force it's rewards program onto every customer. A typical day at Gamestop consisted of trying not to have anxiety attacks to ""increase your numbers"".  You HAD TO convince EVERY customer to buy into the rewards program & the pay was minimal. No advancement opportunities. The best part of the job was the customers you interacted with. The district managers put pressure on Game Advisors & management."
bad,The company is constantly changing to sell new products that you don't have the space for. I had to take a mandatory 30 minutes break everyday meaning if I was the opening manager I would be in the store from 9am-630pm. It sucks
bad,"Its a cool place to work if you don't have any ambition, a family to support, and have 6 roommates so your rent is 100 dollars a month. If you're a manager they pay you in perks. But money wise its terrible. Its only okay if you're a gamer and you work part time."
bad,"I was The assistant store manager for Gamestop in lake Mary, the job it self is a job just like any job you have sale goals, you have to stock, clean, do inventory etc. it’s retail so weekends holidays are a must. But no respect from upper management you will always just be a number and they don’t pay enough. And you are constantly working solo because they don’t have hours to give the 4 other employees"
bad,It’s good for a work while college job not much else I have not been offered a promotion for as long as I’ve worked there and it’s not from a lack of effort the business is very focused on who you know and not rewarding to hard work
bad,"the title really sums it up. when you compare other customer service jobs to this one it doesn't add up. you don't get paid well, your hours change weekly, and you never know what your schedule will be."
bad,Typical retail but with videos instead. Benefits are not great and hours were un predictable. The pay was not great and up sale of video games or memberships towards consumers offered no rewards or bonuses to the employees whatsoever.
bad,"I've heard it said by one of the managers, ""don't worry how you treat the grunts, you can always replace them."" This was from a district manager. It basically embodies their view towards non management employees."
bad,"GameStop is an okay to work. You can definitely use it as a place to gain experience to start your career, network and branch out. Everyone that comes through GameStop gets a different experience."
bad,Typical day is a retail environment.  I learned little at Gamestop. Management is knowledgeable. Co-workers are the best and knowledgeable. The hardest part of the job was the pay or lack of. The best part of the job was the discounts.
bad,"I worked at Gamestop for over 2 years. The first year was good and fun because I got to revive my love for videogames by seeing all the new videogames first and being able to try them out. After that it became a stress because if you didnt meet a certain quota of reserves or game informers for the day, you could be fired even if you did $5,000 in sales. I believe Gamestop cared more for money then they care for their employees. Plus there is no such thing as benefits unless you are assistant manager or above."
bad,"A typical day, consists of selling, customer service, management, and of course inventory checks and balances."
bad,"At first Gamestop was really fun to work at, I loved getting to talk to customers all day about one of my favorite topics, video games. My coworkers were my best friends and I felt like we made a great team. Even though they were only five of us, we got everything done that needed to be."
bad,"The Head Manager was Mostly Incompatible and Childish in a sense of basic Immaturity, But what standard do you expect from a game store?"
bad,"Gamestop focuses on numbers above anything else. If you love to sell then this job may suit you, but it's high pressured depending on your DL. Hours aren't great, but if you have a great team then it makes working here so much better."
bad,"Worked there for 2 years as 3rd Key. Part time pay with full time hours. No benefits and when asked if I could get some due to the hours I worked, HR declined saying it would cost too much."
bad,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AkekOnVoMo - this video will give you a detailed look into what it is like to work for GameStop. Let's just say it is a horrible place to work, for example; where I live, Williston, every company pays you 16$ per hour when you start. However, GameStop, only pays like 10$ per hour and do not expect your pay to go up either."
bad,"I enjoyed my time there, for the decade I was there, but it wasn’t all blind. They demand a lot out of their staff, and compensate depressingly little for it. "
bad,"I worked there for almost 3 years being promised I’d get bumped up to  assistant manager as soon as they either moved or fired the current assistant manager (which never happened)  because of this I was held to a higher standard then the other key holders. I also end up having to do the assistant manager’s job as well as fill in for the manger when they were not able to work. I was supposed to be part time but ended up working full time with no benefits due to the store either being understaffed or under-trained. It was not unusual for me to get a phone call when I was off by one of the other key holder asking how to do something because neither the manger or the assistant manager were answering their phones. It also wasn’t unusual for the manger to call you on your day off to chew you out instead of waiting till you were clocked in. The manger also would not listen to anything the staff would tell them and because of this we were left in a  hostile working  environment  due to their  attitude/ aggressiveness as well as  one of the new hires having a god complex and running off several of our regulars guests and  belittling the coworkers. "
bad,Working at Gamestop was great and i enjoyed it and wouldn't mind going back But Gamestop got bad reviews in my opinion because of the last store manager we had and assistant manager.
bad,"I worked 2 hours a week when I was employed as a game advisor, the two managers that I had were both fired for bad practices and they both made sure to treat anyone they didn't personally hire like garbage."
bad,"Gamestop will work its employees to the bone to get as much as they can out of them. You are often pushed to get Reservations, PRO cards, and several other products our of each person that walks through the door. I personally did not push these as hard as I could at my location in favor of a more pleasant shopping experience."
bad,"As an SGA (senior guest advisor) you are key holder, you open and close the store, do bank runs and paperwork, shipping and receiving. Inventory Along with all other customer related work. You generally work alone all day because it's a small store with very little hours to go around. On top of no hours and little pay, more people keep getting hired. The assistant manager is condescending, with no interest in helping you learn or grow. She's also in a relationship with the managers sister so she apparently can do no wrong. I highly recommend not working here."
bad,"A typical day would include keeping the floor tidy, talking to customers on the floor or at the till, testing consoles, trading in games, processing games, restocking the floor, tidying the collectibles/t-shirts, hoovering, mopping, and counting up the cash at the end of the day."
bad,This place is a job and 95% of the kids coming in saw it as a dream job to play video games all day. The corp office had strict numbers and goals that had to be reached each week. If you can not preform up to the goals then they would find someone else who can. You are a dime a dozen in the Gamestop world.
bad,"I was overall disappointed with my experience at GameStop. I was rushed through my training and told I would learn mostly on the job, but for 3 weeks after my initial training I was given no hours to work. I was not able to access any training materials or official paperwork after the initial training session. Over the entire holiday season, about 2 months, I was only given about 40 hours of work, which was significantly less than any of my other coworkers. Management seemed extremely overworked, and their duties visibly suffered due to it. I found GameStop's corporate policies of constant up-selling to be a burden on workers and an annoyance to customers. Employee benefits were poorly communicated, with none of the senior workers able to explicitly tell me when certain benefit days occurred. I would not recommend this company to someone with other job options."
bad,"Working for this company was so bad. My experience at first was amazing. Where else can you Take about and sell video games. It was sort of a dream job. After a few months they started asking ridiculous demands of their employees. Our schedules were very inconsistent. Management did not care if you were sick, if you were scheduled you work or you are written up. The workplace culture was very cliquish.  The hardest thing about this job were the inconsistencies in work hours, duties, and accountability. There was nothing enjoyable about this job."
bad,One of the most stressful places to work from customers standpoint and management. Everything about the company is forced on you from sales to policies.
bad,"Gamestop is an odd entity in the Retail space, on account of its nearly anti-consumer practices, and the aggressive sales strategy if forces upon its sales force."
bad,"Everything I learned was self taught, or learned from watching our assistant manager. I've learned the protocol to open and close a store, what to do in case of a robbery or break in. The hardest part working there was our manager and her how she would ignore important protocols (EX: leaving the store unattended with only a Game Associate on the sales floor)."
bad,"The team I've worked with is supportive and helpful, however management needs a reassessment on how they interact with their employees and customers. They have implemented sales requirements that aren't honest and don't set well with me as an honest person. Also, don't rely upon them to meet the bills. I was told they would work me a certain amount of hours and they dropped me to one day a week."
bad,"If you’re a “huge gamer” and you “love games” avoid working at GameStop. The amount of people that walk through the door that have no idea what system they or their family member has is ridiculous. Asking simple questions is like pulling teeth. GameStop has one of the dumbest return policies ever (look it up).  It allows customer to basically use it as a rental hub. There is no support from upper management. Outside of your store no one has a backbone. They expect all these things to be done, but will not give you the support to achieve the goals. It’s sad that they are only focusing on the negative and not the positive. You have higher ups who call and get rude with you because of something without ever listening to your side. GameStop is very “the customer is always right”, which is dangerous because it breeds horrible behavior from customers. The whole GS needs to be reformatted. You can’t push away your employees just to make the customer happy."
bad,Gamestop as a company has become a place of commission type salesmanship without the actual commission. The sales percentages are the most important and it promotes a culture that causes people to reach those percentages by any means necessary.
bad,"Workplace culture very rigid. Tasks are simple but can get overwhelming from time constraints/other priorities. Strictly regulated goals. No real compensation for hitting goals/milestones. Will get recognition, but you just end up setting up a standard for yourself to hit every time. An easy way to get sales experience, but management is hit or miss. Discounts on games and ""checkout"" system most enjoyable part of the job."
bad,"The corporate detachment from the workplace is terrible, Their expectations impossible to meet and admittedly done on purpose. They will lie to your face for months and then admit it was a lie but in a way that makes it sound like they never 'really lied"" about it in the first place. They care 0 for the customers and even less for the employees."
bad,"Contratto di lavoro accessorio, pagata 7,50 netti all'ora per 200 ore di lavoro totali dopo le quali ti tengono sui carboni ardenti per farti capire (senza dirtelo) se ti assumeranno per un contratto di lavoro a 18h settimanali o no. Il contratto accessorio non prevede giorni di malattia o di ferie, nè permessi. Se ti licenzi, non c'è liquidazione."
bad,I will say it seems as though Gamestop has changed since I worked there. When I was there it was a nightmare when it came to upper management. The cons are I met some of my best friends working there. I also got to experience traveling to Las Vegas and seeing new games before their release date.
bad,Management needs to be fixed. Circle of life is also horrible. Don't wanna lie to guests. I enjoyed the job but corporate made you do things you didn't want to do and my boss was about as robot as a corporate office would want you to be. I just wasn't about their mission. I wasn't going to drink the Kool aid.
bad,"This company only cares about 1 thing and 1 thing only, Pre-Orders. It works the Manager to the bone with minimal pay. You cannot live on the pay this company offers and if not a store manager you NEVER get enough working hours to actually call it a job."
bad,"This is one of the worst jobs I have ever applied. I advanced quickly (too quickly) and they leave you to learn on the fly. Your requirements by the higher ups are almost impossible, and you will be working (especially as a manager) more than 60 hours a week."
bad,"Some weeks I work 20+ hours others I may not work at all.  Management expects us to get great numbers when it comes to sales, with zero motivation and no incentives to get those numbers."
bad,Its a good first job but its hard to get hours.  The only people that receive real hours are the managers.  Employees are not professional.  People call in sick or do not want to come in.  There isn't much advancement within the company.  Store managers get treated poorly.  District managers do not know what they are doing.
bad,"No wife? No Kids? Good job for you! If you're looking for part time work go for it! its actually kind of fun. "
bad,"Not Great. I hated working at Game Stop"
bad,"I have worked for Gamestop on and off for the better part of 9 years. In that time I've seen what used to be a very fun company to work with turn into a numbers machine with absolutely no interest in employee moral. I was an adequate employee. Certainly not always the best, but even the best were treated as though their jobs were always on the line if they didn't achieve impossible sales goals based around investor expectations and never customer satisfaction. My last GM was a great manager but they were one of several ive had, most of which were rewarded for stretching the tolerance of their employees to boost percentages ever so slightly. Of the 3 district managers I've had, not a single one understood how things operate at the ground level. In three years my pay had bumped up 5 cents. Very rarely will someone get enough hours to receive benefits. As a shift manager I pretty much did the same thing as my GM barring some paperwork, and received a petty 25 cents hr. more than a sales associate. I'm not entirely sure what a GM made as salary but they do get free games and systems, most of which would get traded in for cash immediately upon receipt. You do get to check out used games for 4 days at a time but this is at managers discretion, most of which don't want to risk the loss so that benefit is mostly moot. In a nutshell there aren't many jobs at the entry level for game enthusiasts and it was painful watching all of the bright eyed teens come in and tell me how much they wanted to work for gamestop. Especially when i know that they used to be a great employer! Even as a"
bad,Upon working at GameStop I was told one thing and when I showed up for work there was another thing. I did it part time but they were pretty up and down with the hours  I could have a day off they would call and offer some over time. Only for me to arrive and they had me there for a hour. Just crazy. The managers were unprofessional and relatively unfair. Openly talking about other managers and customers and I just started working there. Not my ideal work environment at all.
bad,It was hard working here due to the fact I always felt as though my managers were constantly putting me down. Expecting you to be shown something once and immidatly be a pro. I constantly felt like an idiot and did not feel appreciated.
bad,"Company is too focused on their own money-making goals, and not employee happiness. I was instructed by corporate to do better with my goals, despite several commendations from customers."
bad,"I thought working at GameStop would be fun and friendly, you get to stock games, talk to people about them, and occasionally rent a copy as long as the store had more than 3 pre-owned copies. Man, I was wrong. The work environment wants you to use annoying and disgusting salesman techniques. The second someone walks through the door, you're attached to their hip and you don't leave them alone until they leave with a game.  Being the type of store that it is, you get younger co-workers, it quickly devolved into high School drama and politics."
bad,Depending both who your manager is and how well you work with management they will either support you and give you more hours and a promotion. If you don't side with them the will limit your hours and not care about how well your doing. Also management will slowly try to get you fired or help you move up.
bad,"The work environment is great when you're working with the right people. Stressing over numbers sucks, and customers threatening you every day is taxing on your mental and emotional health."
bad,"GameStop is- I can barely explain it. GameStop was terrible. Training was long, but it didn't go over KEY subjects. Such as wiping systems, technological advancements, or modifications. It went over other subjects relating to their company, such as security and money. I was an SGA and for the first time I felt like I was management, but the training was so low on the in-person level, I made a lot of mistakes. Some which almost costed me my job. It was my first time working in a management position at any place, and my associates could care less. Also, you could get fired if you didn't sell enough. Yeah, that's right, fired. You had to stay on track with the others, or else you'd lose your job. Overall, don't work for GameStop unless you have high self esteem and adrenaline in coaxing customers."
bad,"Depending on the location of the store you apply for can be a hit or a miss. I worked at a location within a mall, and we had a high staff turnover rate. I worked there for about 10 months, and throughout that time frame I had gone through 4 store managers and 3 assistant managers. My district manager at the time refused to promote the two staff members that had been there the longest, regardless of how well they hit their sales goals just simply due to the fact that she did not like them and was rather vocal about it. She would rather hire outside of the company then promote those that knew what they were doing and then vanished for 3 months without informing anyone or giving anyone info to contact her. "
bad,"This was a job right out of college, started as part time keyholder, advanced to assistant manager within a year.  After that, became store manager in training, and was terminated for a policy discrepancy."
bad,"I worked at the same location for over two years when the new manager arrived. I was supposed to be the next manager. However, the new manager and assistant manager were having intimate relations and prefered one another over myself."
bad,"GameStop is a good place to get your feet wet but in no way a place to have a secure job. As a four-year-long employee, there have been multiple times where I have been passed up for a promotion and all for different reasons. This is not a job where you can make it a career. There is little to no room for promotion, if you're liked by the leaders then maybe, if not you stay where you are or they will find a reason to let you go."
bad,So many layers of mismanagement in this company. They say it is a store first company but if you are not at the corporate level you will never advance.
bad,"Ti sfruttano fino a farti impazzire, dopo piu di due anni di sacrifici ed energie sprecate ho deciso di andarmene dando il preavviso non di 15gg ma quasi un mese per fare un ultimo favore. Non mi hanno piu parlato i capi e non mi hanno nemmeno salutata l'ultimo giorno. Se state pensando di lavorare per gamestop pensateci due volte."
bad,"Hours are always severely limited for the part time employees (at least at my location) and always result in one or two days a week resulting in a three, sometimes four hour shift."
bad,"As a part time job to be around the gaming industry, but the higher ups treat the store managers and down below as expendable. They're slowly killing the company (along with the increase in digital sales)."
bad,"Pressure sales environment with not enough reward for hard work. The pay is sub-par all the way through the position of assistant manager. Impossible to afford cost of living unless you are a store manager and even then, the hours are ridiculous."
bad,"• I was barely given any hours working as a seasonal employee "
bad,"At first I really enjoyed my time there, but it began to spiral very quickly around holiday.  I get it, holiday is stressful time, but telling me i have no idea how to do my job and that I should be fired two days before Christmas because I didn't offer someone a membership when they just wanted a gift card? No, absolutely not okay in any way shape or form.  The thing is, everyone at a store level was fine, it was the people above my manager that made it so hard.  I did not want to leave, but I wasn't given much of an option."
bad,"GameStop pays very poorly compared to other retailers. Especially if you work as a key holder or higher (manager, assistant manager). Corporate also likes to set ridiculous goals that are near impossible to reach, and then punish the stores for not reaching them. Upper management also pushes for unethical sales techniques to get more magazine subscriptions and pre-orders. It can be a fun place to work if you get along really well with your coworkers, but there is always an emphasis on sales numbers and always an implied threat of punishment for failing to hit numbers."
bad,"This company has lofty expectations that they want met by their associates, but they offer no commission for the sales driven activities that they preach on a regular basis. In many locations, the business runs on bare minimum hours just to maximize sales, much to the disadvantage of their associates. This places the staff in a position where it is hard to get out from under the company because associates only make enough to scrape by with the wages they are given."
bad,"The job itself isn't difficult, its the management and the training the managers receive all the way up to the district management. There is no respect or appreciation for the employees that work hard for their bosses and the company.if you need a part time with little hours it isn't a bad idea to apply but if you're looking for a serious job this is not the place."
bad,"I am submitting this review before my lawsuit settles with them for unpaid meals when I would have to go out onto the floor during my lunches so I could ring out customers due to porrly trained staff and a high turn around rate. On top of that, it was near impossible for advancement unless you were best friends or went to high school with the former DM. On top of not being paid for working off the clock, breaks would constantly get denied due to lack of coverage. I could go on and on, but I wouldn't want to defame such a proud company. pfft."
bad,Very fun gaming place to work however meeting quotas and being threaten about not making the quotas which is the Circle of Life makes work stressful. The lack of a union causes underpaid workers and a low morale if the store isn't making profit.
bad,False hopes and shattered dreams unless you're willing to pucker up. I have enjoyed those I have met over the years as there have been many. A company that hires twenty for the holiday's and keeps two. A company that when you do a good job and earn extra hours you only find out with one day to use them. Relying on projections based against sales from prior years.
bad,"They seem like you are replaceable at any time of day, and will do so. Low pay because they use the fact that everyone WANTS to work there. Well don't, because at the drop of a hat they will use or abuse you, many times I had to work off the clock to get things accomplished and there is NO OVERTIME. They will fire you over a first offense of any miniscule thing. Honestly I regret the work I did for them as it was NEVER good enough. Albeit my high work ethic and drive to make quick advancement to management level."
bad,Monitor cash and stock keep the location clean neat and organized. Learned a ton about video games but nothing really about how to successfully run a business. Doesn't pay well for assistent managers and part time employees so the manager work a ton of hours. If you are a gamer checking out the game is cool but it gets old after a while
bad,Very stressful work environment. Pay is not suitable for the work that is asked to be performed. On of the worst benefits for working in a warehouse. This company is all about who you know nonmatter how hard your work if your not friends with upper management you get no where with company
bad,I used to have a great time working here. I no longer feel as if I'm respected. Hardest part of the job is dealing with management. Most enjoyable part is all of the free things.
bad,"Small company, with limited understanding of how to diversify products and services to meet a dwindling market share."
bad,"No room for advancement unless you're close to the boss.  Lies of promoting with low pay. Managers start at 9 dollars per hour.  Store managers on average make under 37,000 a year."
bad,"Constantly changing ideals and performance measures made this work environment increasingly difficult to succeed in.  Poor middle management discretion coupled with changing industry standards that leadership fails to adapt to allows talent to slip away from this organization rather than be retained and maximized.  Lack of advancement opportunities and growth, fostered education/coaching experiences etc, is also part of the negative outlook."
bad,"They will treat you terribly. Chew you up and spit you out. They are unfair to guests who shop in the store and force associates to met unrealistic expectations. The CEO is also on video talking about how terrible it would be to work in the store, he did not know he was being recorded."
bad,"It is who you know. If they don't like you. You will have problems no matter how hard you work.After working directly with people in diverse professional settings I am seeking to leverage my experience in a  different position in a distribution environment, because of working here."
bad,"only work here if you have another job and are looking for some side money. The customers will treat you horribly and you still have to bend over backwards for it (although some customers are the best!) "
bad,"I recommend Gamestop to anyone not seeking a lasting career. College students, seasonal help..etc. The reason being that Gamestop does not provide much for you in the way of job security, pay or benefits. Even at the management level those things are extremely low. It is however a great place to learn the basics of selling, and engaging customers."
bad,"-Great Employees to work with"
bad,"Great place if you love video games, but it is HORRIBLE behind the counter and trying to keep a store organized, while having a sneaky, lying district manager for a boss. People if you are in high school its a cool job, but if you have responsibilities and bills this is not the job for you. Stay clear you will not advance, or make money, they will just work the life out of you and expect you to be happy about it. With the way the gaming industry is going I expect Gamestop to go bankrupt in about 5 years. Not somewhere you want to start a career."
bad,"Limited to no options going forward, expects top of the line effort, but provides little to no support. Tells you to do something one way then questions what you did even when you follow managements direction."
bad,"On the outside looking in you think that everyone who works there gets to play games all day. That is not the case, far from it. You're not even allowed to play games while working. You're constantly pushed to sell subscriptions to their magazine and get reservations by the district manager."
bad,all they want from their employees are selling numbers. how many pre-order can you get in a day and how many magazine subscription can you sell/renew a day. management can be less strict and there could be better benefits
bad,"Very fast work day where we were supposed to focus on customers at all times while trying to juggle many, many, many other tasks with no crew to help us while working by ourselves as store managers. Not very professional."
bad,"Gamestop was a very corporate-minded place to work. The employees were disposable, and they made sure we knew that.  Working in the game industry was great, as I was passionate about the product, but I had a hard time dealing with the ""sell what we tell you"" mentality from our district manager, instead of allowing me to take care of my customers as they needed to be taken care of.  There were a few fantastic people that shopped there, made some decent relationships, but most customers were horrible and miserable and treated the employees poorly even when receiving outstanding customer service."
bad,"Gamestop is a job for the kids, not adults who have higher goals and an adult mindset. Honestly, you go in your shift and sell games and make sure the customer is what matters. Typical retail job. Management really depends on the person who's taking charge. People you work with are usually either really awesome or they're really odd.  Nothing about this job is super hard. What's really enjoyable is having the chance to breathe once the busy rush dies down and just to take a moment to joke around with your fellow co workers. Definitely recommend this job to kids who are in high school because they get about 10-15 hours a week, not for adults who are looking for more in life than just a simple retail job."
bad,"A typical at GameStop is pretty straight forward. If you're the opening manager, you open the store, do your morning counts, process trade hold for that day, and you process any incoming shipment. Usually if the store is given enough hours, you would have an associate come in and help during the morning hours. Then you work on other operational things throughout the day, like visual marketing, price changes, and updating the game displays on the wall. "
bad,"GameStop is a company that you could dream of working in.  Video games, electronics, incredibly lenient dress code, specialty store, etc.  But once you break through the doors and land the job things quickly change.  It becomes nothing more than a numbers game.  When management resorts to tough scare and intimidation tactics to assert customers into purchasing extra services, you know the place you work at may be too aggressive."
bad,"Not a great place to work by all means. Bad hours, constant management threats to sell or get canned. I got really fed up one day and decided to work elsewhere. I got lucky because Afterhours Formalwear was hiring so I left and have not looked back since then."
bad,"GameStop is a corporate organization operating like a small business.  They expect guerrilla marketing to be done regularly, as well as, ""concierge calls"" aka call your customers to tell them about deals they already received info about in their email.  They also expect grand midnight events, but they give you no budget for these, so either pull open your wallet or go around begging other businesses for freebies.  The only thing I enjoyed was the customer base.  I loved my customers!  I never felt secure in my job nor did I feel like I could advance despite my high performance numbers coupled with excellent operational skills."
bad,"does not value the employee"
bad,"Everyone says Gamestop would be a great and easy place to work at but it is not. Horrible work ethics, staff treats lower staff members like garbage, and they give all the promotions to the higher ups."
bad,"They don't care about the workers or the customers.  The discount isn't worth it. And if you are a female, no one takes you seriously.  Most male customers do not want to hear video game advise from a female because they often times believe we know nothing of the product.   Our district and regional manager were awful and treated every one awfully.  All of our store managers quit within 2 months of each other."
bad,"I have worked with GameStop for five years, and for no reason was suddenly demoted, receiving a pay cut and fewer hours simply because they are trying to cut costs."
bad,"The job is worse the higher up the management chain you go, but job security increases only marginally.  The company claims to not want you to pressure customers into anything but also has managers that set unrealistic expectation.  The job is really only as fun as the people you work with and if you really love video games."
bad,I would say this was my least favorite job because of how unorganized it was games were unlabeled the store itself was so small the bathroom was also used as part of the storage room. The company over hired and barely gave any hours
bad,Just another retail job. Long hours and it is company policy to pay exactly minimum wage.
bad,"working at Gamestop was very frustrating. The store managers ( there were 5 in the last 2 years) never organized the store. A typical day at work would be for me to do an inventory count on all new and used gaming systems and i-devices. Then count the safe and cash registers to determine change needs. Finally, i had to then make sure the store was ready to open. The work day was a typical retail work day. As the assistant Manager I was in charge of the store when the Store manager was not in. There were usually 2-4 employees working with me at any time. It was my job to lead them with sales goals and customer service."
bad,"Corporation treats their employees TERRIBLY! You can't call in sick, trying to get a schedule changed is a joke, and the pay is always as little as is legal."
bad,The pay is low based on other jobs in the area. Co workers are what make the job bearable.
bad,Very large company with good benefits for its employees. You will get to experience working long hours by your self to keep profits high. Be prepared for performance based management and pre selling games that have not come out yet. The work/life balance is geared towards individuals without families. The pace so hectic it would seem that upper managers only focus on rankings with out analyzing what will help increase their rankings.
bad,"When I worked at the company all hours were based on getting reservations for upcoming releases, corporate would send hours which kept dwendleing by the week, we would have massive releases and corporate would give my busy story the minimum of 70 hours (40 of which automatically went to the ASM leaving 30 for the 3rd keys and game advisors) leaving the Manager working double shifts orr the closer or opener alone at the busiest times.  As a shift lead I was lucky to get 20 hours a week at 8 dollars  a hour"
bad,"At first I enjoyed working at GameStop, it was a lot of fun. But as of recent changes to the company, I no longer enjoy working there, and they changed around their pay scale so they can cut employee wages for underperforming, when the industry itself is dying."
bad,"a typical day as an key holder at Gamestop is being asked to push retail value customers don't need, in order to pad our districts numbers. Gamestop is company puts emphasis on shareholder value, rather than customer service"
bad,"I got hired at GameStop around Mid November. I have yet to officially walk in and work my first day. I did do small bits of training when I had to do paperwork and go over things such as what I would be doing while working there. From what I've gathered from the few hours I have received the culture there is quite relaxing and friendly. Also, of course talking video games with coworkers and customers was also an enjoyable experience."
bad,"Es gibt kaum Weiterbildungen"
bad,"nothing you do is ever enough, you are expected to do everything with the minimum amount of support. Every employee is stretched thin with not so much as a thank you."
bad,"While working at GameStop as a store manager I was heavily micromanaged and not given free reign to run my store to make my business succeed. While I did not own the location, my store was constantly referred to as my business as I was responsible for setting marketing, hiring, sales, profitability, etc. Regardless of what efforts I made, none were recognized by my District Manager. Nothing was ever satisfactory and I heard leagues more about what I failed on in his eyes rather than on the many successes that I had with the company. I was also underpaid for my position to the point where Assistant Store Managers in my district were making more than me, and I was never presented with any correction with that. The HR department of the company is its only upside, as they intervened and listened when I needed someone to. The company focus says it is on making sales and profit by making service matter, but they are far from servicing the guest. GameStop used to be a store I enjoyed, and it was a dream to work for the company. However, with their changes they have fallen to care more about their profits than the people producing those profits, both from theu customer and employee sides."
bad,"The company as a whole has a very lack luster work environment although my colleagues were great, for the most part. Upper management was poor and the heavy pressure to push products onto customers, that weren't remotely interested in buying, made the job feel unnatural."
bad,"I spent five years working for Gamestop. While I enjoyed working with the people I worked with and for, the company demonstrated a complete lack of concern for myself or my coworkers in regards to compensation or fair treatment of their employees. I was fired from my position due to rising company standards and my inability to meet them in spite of being with the company for so long. I'm unsurprised at the considerably high turnover rate that the company has."
bad,"Absolutely the most unprofessional DM I've ever experienced. "
bad,"The store I worked at was absolutely phenomenal and the manager was an understanding and hard working individual.  That isn't always the case, in fact that's probably the exception, not the rule.  It's basically a job you do while taking classes for college or trying to find a better job.  The environment that GameStop cultivates basically sucks any fun the job could have right out of it."
bad,"Working at GameStop was an opportunity to go back to school. My manager was more than happy to work around my school schedule so I could do what I could to support my family and work towards my degree."
bad,"Wer hier arbeitet lebt keineswegs den Traum des Gamers. Eher ist es so das man hier jeden Tag Penibel jeden mist Nachzählen muss. Tagliche, Wöchentliche und Jahres Inventuren sind die Tagesordnung. Dem Kunden auf jeden fall immer was aufquatschen und über den Tisch ziehen.Nur keine eigene Meinung haben!"
bad,"Doesn't pay well at start, no hours if you aren't a key holder. Only work here if you think you can move up fast or you can start as some form of management."
bad,You're just a number and easily expendable. Wouldn't work here for anything ever again. The stress absolutely wasn't worth it. Customers were great but pushing preorders turned them against you. the work load is easy but having to worry about numbers and whether or not you'll have a job or hours.
bad,"little opportunity to move forward, upper-upper management made a lot of decisions that affected a lot of low level employees significantly and made in-store day-to-day operations difficult"
bad,"Unfair labor practices, shady managers, understaffed, etc. Your typical low paid retail job. I abandoned ship as soon as I possibly could, they exploit people who game as cheap labor."
bad,I worked at gamestop as a keyholder. I went through 3 different managers in a month. Was asked multiple times to stay after and work unpaid for 6+ hours after my shift. I felt offended when they offered old WII games that didn’t sell as an incentive for the best employees (in 2018 mind you). Terrible work place.
bad,"As a kid, I always thought that, as a gamer, working at Gamestop was a dream job, I was wrong. I would often go weeks without working, and when I would work, it would only be three hours for the entire week. The company does not care about it's employees"
bad,"I worked for Gamestop for 1 year. Within this time, I was only given up to 25 hours a week during the holidays. The rest of the year, I would be lucky to get 15 hours a week.  I was supposed to be trained for a management position, but did not receive it because the manager chose her friends who never worked for the company before over the employees who knew what they were doing. The only part enjoyable about the job was I was selling product I used often to customers who enjoyed the products also."
bad,The staff is poorly paid and under appreciated. The company over-all did not seem to care about the employees whatsoever. I would never work for this company again.
bad,"manager of the store was horrible and never there, made false promises during the interview and never went through with anything I was told. fun place to shop, but I would never work there if you love the store."
bad,"The pay is bad, in regards to all the things you have to do in a max of 8 hours, youre basically a commission salesman without any commission or bonus."
bad,"It was a different store when I started but as more changes started to arrive, the stress began to add up. Workers I met started to quit, policies were changing, and stress was adding up. Nepotism is high when it comes to working at these stores. Hours would be based on how much Reservations, Warranties, and Pre-Owned products were sold per shift. Fail to do so, hours will get cut. Its an ok job if you are a full time college student, but there is no career building there. It a place for those who are complacent with a mundane job."
bad,Gamestop does not pay well and you get only a few hours a week this is not a full time job and you are forced to push unnecessary add-ons to transactions which leads to uncomfortable customer interactions.
bad,Il lavoro di per sè è interessante e divertente perchè si è a contatto con persone di ogni tipo. Però il personale è troppo in conflitto tra di loro per i punteggi mensili e settimanali....e bevono un pò troppo durante gli incontri tra commessi e presidenti GameStop
bad,"I used to really like gaming, then I worked at GameStop for almost 3 years.  The majority of guests are fat and smelly.  People bring in obviously stolen items and expect cash so they can buy drugs."
bad,"Either you work at an insanely  slow storefront or, like me, you work in a high trafic location with not enough coverage to get all expected tasks resolved. one of the worst parts of the job in its current state is the sales culture where distriict managers and up are pushing high numbers so hard its actually causes employees to want to not help the customers. all in all, the company is on a downward spiral and i dont recommend it unless your becoming a full time manager and you need the money."
bad,Pay isn’t very high and until you are promoted to management hours are very limited. Also they expect you to hit 4 sales metrics than can be increased throughout the week
bad,like any place it depends on the store manager and district manager what things are like but this company is very odd in their practices. they look for reasons to fire associates.  they don't have send offs or show any sort of appreciation for 20 + yr employees that retire or move on. while the employees themselves your peers can make it a fun place to work it's not a place where one can make enough hours to have a living check from. it s a good place to work if you're in college and need extra money or as a second job other than that must be upper management or its terrible.
bad,"There are days when working at Gamestop is the best thing ever, and then there are days when you literally cannot wait to find a new job. Management is hit or miss, District managers are completely out of touch with workers. Hours don't really pay the bills, and there are no benefits unless you're a store leader or ASL"
bad,"Company was willing to fire any employee for any small reason as well as throwing items that the customers didnt want out, for a part time management position you were expected to act as a manager even though you are paid slightly above minimum wage and are held to a very strict sale goals that could end up getting you fired if you did not make these numbers any given week"
bad,"Typical day begins with ensuring tasks from previous are 100% complete otherwise you may be written up and fired. It is so competitive that your District Manager is consistently threatening to let you go if results are not improving hourly, daily, weekly and monthly. You are lucky enough to last over 9 months. Once you pass those few months it only becomes worse and the termination threat rises."
bad,"There is a strong pressure to get certain sales and addons. Your job and hours depend on meeting these metrics. You'll be alone during the slow season when there aren't enough hours allocated to your store. I averaged 20-28 hours weekly. Customers can get very angry about the low trade-in value of their items, which can be in unsanitary conditions."
bad,"At the time of my leaving, Gamestop had not yet established its new place in the retail world and therefore shook the foundation for future employment."
bad,"A great place to advance quickly with no previous retail experience, but that's because the turnover is so high. If you show initiative and put in the work you could be a store manager within the year. There is a reason why though. You essentially run your own business, but most follow very strict company rules. Sounds easy until you realize the rules go against any effort you make to make your store great. Retail is already an uphill battle, but the company is so out of touch with customers and employees that it sabotages everything you do. You could have amazing sales and profit margin, but if you aren't using their script you'll get canned."
bad,"The job is a great hobby for people who are looking for a second job. Also if you can get awesome managers than you have found a good store. Other than that, it is just a hobby."
bad,Many will tell you that working at gamestop is fun and it can be but as a career it's very difficult.  They just don't treat and take care of their employees very well.  When a store manager makes the same hourly rate as someone starting out at Sheetz or McDonalds there's a serious problem.  Best part of my job was the people I got to work with and my loyal customers not to mention training my team and achieving success.  Management was hart to get to there wasn't a really good culture to help build talent so it was a very do it yourself kind of thing depending on who was your training manager.
bad,"I know most people want to work here, but it is not all that it is cracked up to be. The pay is horrible and the demand for metrics can be out of hand. It is a normal retail job and if you are not ready for that stay away!"
bad,Worked as a seasonal because they didn't was to hire part time. Barely got any hours. The people were nice but that was about it. You were able to rent out games to try them. you need to have a full time in order to really have a good experience.
bad,What can I say about Gamestop that most consumers don't already know. it is a fun place to be socially but a nightmare to work at. I don't need to go into detail as there are plenty of youtube videos about it.
bad,"While being a dream job for some, this experience as an employee was filled with training to lie to consumers to push sales and meet outrageous quotas."
bad,"The unreasonable Sales demands coupled with a management system that has adopted the ""Assumptive Approach"" that did so much good for Wells Fargo customers provides an environment that is toxic on the best of days."
bad,Was promised all kinds of promotions and raises never got them or came close worked there six years and got a 1.75 raise the whole time. management is poor want you to sale sale sle and do everything a store leader does without the pay. Overall not a great place for a career.
bad,"Dealing with customer issues and resolving them in a quick and fast manor. "
bad,"This company will take advantage of anyone if it means making a buck. Performed management and associate duties. First manager was about as shady as they come, where as the second manager was an honestly good guy. The District Manager for the area was incompetent in his job and that really worked its way down the chain of command."
bad,Do not recommend working at GS atm due to the struggles the company is going through. Company known for punishing associates who sell NEW games instead of Used
bad,Corporate changes their goals or expectations on the fly and daily. There is also 0% job security and will replace employees. You will work with not enough hours to run your store but given more task than can be handled. You will work with mostly single coverage but expected.
bad,Management doesn't understand what they are even selling.  Blame gets put on you even though if a game is not good it is not the person in the stores fault for not selling enough.  They made a bad game it happens.
bad,"Think long and hard before applying to this company. Gamestop typically won't promote within, as several of my coworkers and myself were passed up on the opportunity to move up in the company."
bad,"The management was solely based on who  was the favorite, the system I'd how hours were given out was very flawed . Direct insults and insinuations were also a constant problem"
bad,"An sich macht es mit den Arbeitskollegen spa? zu arbeiten, es herscht eine flache hirarchie trotzdem sehr monotonen arbeitsstil."
bad,"busy, left alone all the time, no hours to give to employees, a lot of tasks to remember and it changes every week, barely any training, just given the tasks nobody likes"
bad,"Sehr viele Aktionen, oft ohne passende Werbematerialen. Ständige Erreichbarkeit schon als stellvertretender Filialleiter wird erwartet. Für eine Führungsposition sehr geringe Vergütung."
bad,My typical day while employed there was helping customers get to their needs by answering questions and encouraging them to buy our products.
bad,"GameStop from my district was terrible, it was ran by a reserve hunger tyrant who would go out of his way to make you fear for your job safety. No one was exempt from his tyrannical behavior, managers, assistant managers, and even low level game associates."
bad,"I was really excited to work for GameStop. I was hired on as an Assistant Store Manager 4 weeks before Black Friday, with no management experience. I was hired due to my leadership experience. I blew my District Manager's expectations, and was promoted to Store Manager. I got to bring along one of my other associates as my Assistant Store Manager. I got placed into a fixer upper. While there, three weeks into the job, my ASM passed away due to heart complications. After that, three regular employees resigned for better jobs, effectively leaving the store to myself and one other newly promoted employee. While I wanted to start a mass hire to restaff the store, it would seem that every candidate had to go through rigorous and ridiculous interviews, This made plenty of applicants go away or lose interest in the position. Labor allocation was terrible, and with an emphasis to be on the floor, no time was given to complete operational pieces. The company expected us to work overtime, but would not pay it. Eventually the cons outweighed the pros, and the District Manager couldnt be bothered to lift a finger to help or give one productive piece of advice."
bad,"My review of Gamestop, was that it was a very stressful environment to work in. The customers were pleasant at times but the overall aura was just deppressing."
bad,"When I first started working for this company I loved my job. I had a great staff to work with an a manager that made everything run smoothly and always had a little fun. A typical day at work consisted of taking inventory, customers, and shipment. Soon after management changed and Game stop started applying harder restrictions on trades and employees many people left or were fired over the simplest things."
bad,"Vill ej yttra mig helhjärtat av detta."
bad,"This was a very personality heavy job and also a great opportunity to learn people skills and your own ability to sell, train and manage."
bad,"Gamestop is a company that first and foremost cares about maximizing profits. If that means less hours for the people that they hire every year, then so be it. That also means an unlivable wage. Combine the lowest wages on the market with the least hours and you've got one awful company to work for. The only way to get more hours is to sell your soul and try to push Gamestop products on to people that they don't want or need. This is ridiculous. For a company making such an insane amount of money, you'd think it would start to trickle down to the lowest employees in the company. But it does not. Do not work for this awful company."
bad,"Spent 5 years in this company, and I worked for the number 1 store in the company. While at that store, my hours and job duties were cut in half due to the fact that my transfer was only meant to be temporary. However they left me at this store as a borrow for 2 years. I was never considered for advancement due to how it looked. I was ignored and on top of that I did see obvious favoritism showed to certain employees. I was overstepped by 6 other employees for advancement as a assistant manager. All these people were much younger then myself and not to mention I trained many of them myself. Also, they did not enforce breaks so most of the time I did not get one. However I use to enjoy the job, and what kept me around for so long were the people. The employees work hard, and take a lot of nonsense from higher ups and customers alike. Without the GAs at that company surely they would be less successful. Overall I was there for 5 years I saw a lot of things. If I was to write down everything that transpired there we would have multiple pages of negative things to say. I truly feel like I was screwed there and lead to believe that I was able to move higher up which was proven to me otherwise."
bad,"Working at Gamestop was fun but does get tiresome. You have to sell, sell, sell or management will yell,yell, and yell. Now, it's not all bad, but it's definitely not all good either. You do get the latest news on games, try them out and etc. But, you don;t get paid for the add-on accessories you sell, which means, no commission. Also, you have to work with great people or it will totally suck."
bad,"This a horrible place to work. The hours are terrible until you make Assistant manager. The work load is ridiculous! Your are treated as disposable, and the pressure the exert for a non commission sales job is laughable."
bad,"I started my job at GameStop right out of highschool. In the beginning the company was quite enjoyable to work for. Got to talk about and work with video games. Fun at first. Then the company made a shift. Sure, subscriptions and reservations were important when I first started, but they quickly became your only goal. Not to create a bond w/ customers or embody a healthy environment. It all came down to those subs and reservations. If you didn't get enough, good luck getting any hours next week. For a company that requires you to sell threateningly, they offer 0 comp or incentives. Management can go either way. Luckily I had easy managers to work with who taught me a lot at my young age. You will start at minimum wage, no matter your experience in retail. (unless at a key holder position). Not hard to move up because people leave on a regular basis. Just don't expect a lot more pay."
bad,Just cause you like video games doesn't mean I will work for free
bad,"Come in put stack of games away, take in shipment and also put that away. Help out with customers and closing time comes and i locked up and count the registers down"
bad,A really nice place to work if your in high school but not nearly enough hours or compensation.
bad,"If this is a high school job for part time, don't expect many hours to be available. If you somehow get hours, learn the culture, show enough promise (spend enough money/time) in the store to get promoted, the hours start to pickup, but the fun is just beginning. The pay increases are nominal, and the workload doesn't begin to be worth the time investment and stress, especially since work now follows you home. The further up you are promoted, the worse the job follows you home, many times interfering with off days for hours at a time. Clueless upper management doesn't help, simply delegating tasks without any real basic understanding of the actual time investment or spatial awareness to accomplish said tasks, but unfortunately rarely gives anything other than negative reinforcement. The phrase ""more flies with honey than with vinegar"" holds no water with upper management, who mainly prefer public shaming. However, the single biggest issue is the stranglehold on payroll hours. The vast majority of the time, employees work by themselves, even though stores will be swamped with customers. Short staffing busy stores to maximize the profits stresses the employees and irritates the customers. All these issues combine to large amounts of turnover. Overall, not the worst place to work I'm sure, but most definitely it isn't the best."
bad,"avoid at all costs.  you will be lied too by management of all types, regardless of how much or how well you do your job one mildly irritated customer can give you a bad review, mostly over things not under your control (trade values, prices on products new and used) and you cannot defend yourself in any way.  you will also have your morals and ethics compromised by taking in items that you may suspect as stolen on a regular basis but you have to honor the customer no matter how uncomfortable you feel and if you question it in any way it can get you fired.  I have worked with great people but they are under the same constraints of being controlled by fear from upper management."
bad,"They don't teach you correctly on how to find games to see if their still available. They never tell you when a new game is coming out or when a sell is happening. The workers were nice and try to help you but they really look out themselves. The manger always hit on me which was one reason I hated going to work, and he always tried to make me look dumb in front of customers."
bad,"You are extremely expendable.  Unless your Store manager likes you, they have absolutely no reason to keep you hired.  Unrealistic sales goals, on top of little to know hours unless you are an assistant manager."
bad,"I've worked for GameStop for years. I worked faithfully and never complained or grovelled. I climbed the ladder quick as well, from a seasonal hire to a Store Manager in under a year. My achievements were noteworthy and I was praised in a way. I only found out after too much time that I was being taken advantage of. My enthusiasm and skill left me in a vulnerable position as I was sought after to resolve issues quickly and cast aside when my usefulness dwindled due to a health scare. I loved this company and I believed in it. They just don't care about their people. It's unfortunate for them that they will continue to lose people, not only my unique skill set and drive to be the best, but others as well."
bad,"A typical day consisted of working the register, talking to customers and organizing the store, sometimes doing set ups for games. If you worked closing you usually cleaned the store and closed up while management or supervisors did register counts, work environment was fairly laid back besides sales and pre-orders."
bad,"A typical day would include the operation of a cash register, selling and registering GameStop Rewards Memberships to customers, handling customer complaints, purchasing games or systems, custodial work, answering any customer questions, answering phones, helping customers with purchasing decisions, and making customers happy."
bad,"Working for GameStop was quite an experience. GameStop as a job provider can be pretty hard to work for if you do not know what you're getting your self into, GameStop have a very long list of Duties, Requirements, Standards, and Ethnics, with a management team that will to quickly cast you aside at the slightest sigh of loss of performance."
bad,"Cutthroat competition internally"
bad,"From the refusal to implement realistic goals for their production to the sacrifice of quality for volume, Gamestop was interested only in the bottom line.  From hiring substandard employees for a grueling production line, to paying below industry standards in every position, Gamestop was more a refuge for the desperate than a place for career progression."
bad,"Not only did you get written up if people did not want to buy your rewards cards, you would be humiliated on conference calls. Customers were nothing more than statistics and they had no problem letting everybody know it. They were so money hungry and showed such a lack of respect to their associates it was sickening. I was with them for a year before my distaste for the whole charade eventually drove them to get rid of me."
bad,"Sell games to a wide array of customers, daily inventory counts, tons of tasks with minimal payroll support. What's not to love here? Well it is completely the and solely starts with the DM level and up. Most of the time you are a cashier, regardless of your position. They throw tons of tasks at you and expect them to be done yesterday. There seems to be a purge of tenured Store managers to do two things: 1. eliminate highly paid store managers and 2. Get new blood in that will not question what is being done. Think about it, you're hired to do a job, then after a year they expect you to dress up in a clown suit and do the same job but there is no reason to wear that suit. Most people will question why. Well if you eliminate that person and then hire someone in and tell them that you have to wear a clown suit to do the job, the new person will do it because they are glad just to have a job. "
bad,"Easy work, typical customer service job. "
bad,"I see this company implement new ideas that if they had anything in mind other than a bottom line, they would know they weren't going to work.  The company isn't interested in improving their relationship with the customer, so if you like to follow mindless and poorly thought out concepts, you will NOT like GameStop."
bad,"The company as a whole is absolute s--t. They treat the employees like second class citizens who have no lives, no bills, no hobbies, no nothing. You are expected to sell your soul daily for the sake of the sale and it's not as though you make commission. No matter how much you sell or improve the business the only persons compensated any extra are the actual Store Managers and higher. Even though the lower level employees are doing the work, at the end of the year it's the SM that is up for a yearly bonus. Usually at least 3-5000. The ASM is supposed to do pretty much everything the SM is supposed to do short or actually hiring and firing people (you scout as an ASM, no real power to hire or fire). The company just doesn't give you the sense that they care if you work for them or not. I understand that there will always be someone waiting to take your job, but the company makes you feel, after a certain point, like they're pushing out the door. It's unbelievable. I don't know anyone that's worked there for more than a couple years and will recommend it to someone else. Waste of 3 years (besides gaining mgmt experience)."
bad,The compensation for all employees should be met. The work environment is in constant question due to the amount of change and the shortage on hours. The people you work with are what you make them. Generally building a solid team and having the same standard for everyone made the work place enjoyable. Time management and hours put in has increasingly become an issue.
bad,"While employed by GameStop my home office was the SSC, or Store Support Center. This was the center of the entire incorporation and housed the CEO, Paul Raines. Throughout my experience there I felt almost immediately that they were all about making sure the profits were made but that the employees received third class treatment. This entailed working long hours, with non competitive pay and no appreciation. It sucked being under appreciated."
bad,"Great discount on games, kinda poor hours though (short shifts), hard to get hired into"
bad,"A typical day at work would include you opening, doing shipment, talking to customers, reading emails, and being by yourself for up to 10 hours before getting a break."
bad,they don't treat you what your worth.
bad,I found during my time there they promise promotions with no pay increase.
bad,"My experience here is good awful. The pay was bad, the management was bad, the hours were bad and the work place was bad. The only plus side is that I gained lots of friends through this job and there was an employee rental service for games. I forgot about the discount which was nice but overall this should never be a proprietary job."
bad,"Worked in Plano, it was so terrible. I hated the place so much. Its the worst job ever. No HOURS AT ALL."
bad,Good place to work just not a career. Sold millions in video game software and consoles. Operated one of the top earning stores in the company. Time to move on.
bad,"It was a nice orgaized store, but my hours were terrible. I was also layed off without notification, until I called one day to ask what my schedule was."
bad,"I love the people I work with, but the manager makes the job unbearable. The company also expects WAY to much for how little the pay is and forces you to go out of your way to ask people they don’t want to hear"
bad,"A typical day at Gamestop as a key-holder would include working with several different guests to ensure they have the best possible experience. Second to that would be handling daily counts or shipment. While there I learned a lot about handling money, customer relations, and managerial operations. The hardest part is dealing with tough guests, but on the flip side, working with people is also my favorite aspect of the job."
bad,"Don't expect to get much or any meaningful work hours as an employee here, especially if you're looking to get money fast. It's been over two months and I've only worked 5 hours."
bad,The attrition rate was astronomical.  In 12 months we saw three District managers and three regional managers come and go.   Also Representatives were simply promoted to manager in the absence of a manager.
bad,My gamestop had bad management and even worse coworkers that never showed up or had any knowledge of the job at hand. We had 7 employees but only 3 would get decent hours.
bad,No space at all for advancement and no living wages for employees who are long term. Management doesnt get reviewed. People who are not manager material get thrown into manager positions and they stay there for 20+ years and no one questions their horrid managing
bad,Gamestop is trash they force you to make numbers if you don’t make numbers no matter how good of a worker you are or if you normally make numbers if you miss the goal you will get your hours cut.
bad,"I've been working there a year and a half and only work 3.5 hours A WEEK. That's NOT a part-time job. It's inexcusable. The manager is good and so are the sups, but my fellow GAs are crud and should get fired so I can take their hours. I tell them I want more hours, but the district manager doesn't give them to me. The DM is also a micro-managing jerk. He tells us to get off of our phones but we literally have NOTHING TO DO. I need a JOB. I need to make a living."
bad,"I only worked at GameStop for about two years, and the biggest complaint that I have is the amount of hours given. On holiday seasons, the company over-hires and only gives about 4 hours a week. That is not nearly enough money for a college student to survive on. Being in a place that sold things that I was passionate about was nice, but the overall stress of dealing with customers was not worth the 4 hours a week hassle."
bad,When i began at Gamestop in 2015 i was naive in thinking it was a great place to work. The workplace environment is heavly dependent on the Manager and Assist Manager and the District & Regional Managers. If they are good its easy if they are bad every visit from them is a nightmare.
bad,I've been through four store managers and four different asl's. This is failing company that you SHOULD NOT APPLY.  Run far away. You will make more money doing less at any other retailer.
bad,"Worked as a manager for Gamestop, learning the underhanded business practices that take place. I was fired after stopping an armed robber that came into the store. But, because I didn’t follow their protocol of letting the armed robber take all the money and whatever they want and THEN call the cops and cooperate afterwards my reward for the perp being disarmed, dragged outside the store while I awaited the police to come was to be canned from my job. Requirements of the job is to meet unrealistic job expectations and sales goal for your region. Other coworkers were praised for their numbers if they used their own rewards number for sales where foreigners or poor people refused to become a rewards member. If people refused to be a rewards member or use their member number it made your sales numbers look bad according to corporate and thusly you are demoted or lose hours on the schedule. This company offers you absolutely no breaks outside of a lunch which is up to whenever they schedule a relief employee to allow you to take it. Benefits include discounts on used items and trade ins and once in a while being allowed the hours you’re looking for. I had many employees beg for more hours but corporate will only allow many of my employees more than 8 hours a week if they always were signing people up as members and getting preorders regardless to how slammed or slow the store would be the day they come in to work. They refuse to allow any take home study material for new hires and you’re not allowed to come in during off hours to study up on new materials through their training"
bad,Thought it was my dream job and quickly became my worst....if your a general worker its easy but once you become a Senior Game Adviser or higher the workload they expect to do is too much...I know longer play video games because of this job
bad,"Literally nothing was all that great about working there except being around and talking about games. The pay sucked. $8 an hour as a manager and advancement I am not even sure it was possible. The hours were about 20 a week or less the only people that had full time being the store leader and assistant store leader.  They would dog you and get upset if you didnt meet quotas with customers such as getting preorders or damage protections sold. The only easy thing was getting and selling preowned products as far as quotas were concerned. Had alot of fun but yeah it is not at all a viable career choice whatsoever. Only ""benefit"" was discounts. 10% on new products I think and 15% off on preowned. Then if you bought the gamestop card that added ontop of the preowned discounts which i think was like 25% off preowned products which was nice. Except as employees you had to buy it still..."
bad,It wasn't bad I liked doing multiple things i learned a few things about working with people you don't know and also helping people out and getting to know what their interests are.
bad,"Culture is terrible, constantly playing favorites and demanding a lot of extra effort while paying managers a trash excuse for a salary. Sales expectations are unrealistic, and the company seems to have no idea what it's doing in terms of a long term strategy to curb the bleeding of profits."
bad,I was with Gamestop for about 3 years and throughout my time there the company's standards have just gone down the drain. The best part of the job was definitely helping guests and talking with like minded co-workers. However that's where the pros stop. From the lack of proper training to there overly aggressive sales tactics Gamestop just isn't worth it. You make barely over minimum wage and they expect the world from you.
bad,"I wanted the best for the store I worked very hard in for 3 years. I worked my way up to Assistant Manager in less than a year. I knew I could have succeeded greatly, but apparently all because I missed a count the week of conference, where I was also short 2 ppl on staff, the new district lead that didn't even have respect enough to meet me in person thought I could not handle it as Store Lead."
bad,"This company is perfect for people coming straight out of school, a quick minimum wage job with reasonable training where if you like games, you get to sell them and engage in the hobby with the consumers you are helping. As fun as most of the people who tend to work there are, the problems start to rise once you get to the job itself. The hiring window tends to only exist in the build up to Black Friday and Christmas, so you get thrown in the complete deep end and most likely will get little to no real training for real use in the store as they'll only want the permanent hires to do the bulk of the processing lifting."
bad,Gamestop was a difficult place to work. It had a high emphasis on sales metrics without the benefits. Pay was far too little and not worth the hassle. Management was not very efficient.
bad,No one listens. They make you feel like nothing but minions. They make it super hard to advance and they move you all over the place and everyone is drowning in drama.
bad,"Typical retail job, never consistent schedule, lots of broken promises, always changes missions statement. Top level management changes to frequently making it hard to learn the new behavior and mission."
bad,"Typical work day involved arranging store, putting away stock as needed, assisting customers. Management is a gamble store to store, and the workplace culture was toxic, demanding numbers that were unattainable without harassing the customers. Hardest part was selling customers something they didn't want and wouldn't use. Most enjoyable part was checking out games."
bad,"I really only have an issue with this specific manager. I was really excited to work at a gaming store. Gaming is something I'd hope to take as a career path, so I always hoped I could get a job at a Gamestop. "
bad,you had to kiss butt to get any where and /or be buddy with the higher management to move up.a lot of 2 facing and back stabbing.the only good thing was the discounts and the customers
bad,"the company is the worst, my overall team at my location was great but the company itself is absolutely broken and struggling. the dristict leaders only care about themselves and could care less about customer experience they are only concerned with sales."
bad,"At GameStop a usual work day for a seasonal (winter/holiday) is. You walk in and sign in, grab the tablet, and walk around the floor organizing the games on the wall. if a customer walked in you greet them and ask for assistance if they need help you assist them in any way you can."
bad,"I was in the district manager in training program for over 2 years, was promised by own store/district multiple times during that time period and was always either training someone else who was less qualified or was passed over for the position. PTO sucked, no real sick day opportunities, no 401k, dental, or vision. Health package was awful, the employees paid for all of it with no employer assistance or payback programs offered at all. This company runs off of the guys who are too stupid to leave, college kids, and high schoolers, who think they will get paid to play video games all day."
bad,"Im pretty sure it was the store location, but from the online memes and everybody sharing the same hatred i could be wrong."
bad,"Depending on the position, you will either work almost no hours, or you will end up living inside the store. Entry level and seasonal hires would end up working as little as 2 or 3 hours a week for months on end. They will attempt to keep you part time for as long as possible, and even if you make enough to pay for the benefits, they're expensive and don't do much for you. The full time positions are required to work 40 hrs a week to 48 for some store managers. Pay was mediocre for all positions. There are several sales quotas you will be required to meet, for almost no incentive (other than your upper managers being angry at you personally). Upper management at the corporate level is always telling you what to do, and policies can change on the fly each day. Some days, you will end up doing three times the work you expected to do . If your store is busy you will NEVER get a break or have time to get everything done, and if your store is slow you will end up working the majority of your shift alone. Overall, maybe a good temporary job but, everyone who stayed gets suckered into doing more than you should have to."
bad,Way to dependent on add on sales management tends to play favorites. They ask you to work when they need it but if you need time off for an emergency your job is at stake. A good summer or winter job to get some experience in retail but other then that not worth the headache
bad,"Positive Outlook"
bad,"Wouldn't reccommend as a first job, at least from my experience. No one told me what to do or how to keep busy and questions were often met with an attitude that i should already know how to do all of this despite this being my first retail job. Glad it was seasonal so leaving wasn't awkward"
bad,"contratti da furto, coperture lunghe singole di negozio senza pause, dipendenti trattati come spazzatura, stabilità nulla buona solo per neo diplomati senza progetti futuri (durata media 3 mesi o se fortunati 1 anno)."
bad,"I worked for Game Stop throughout college as both a shift employee, and a key'd manager. "
bad,"I have been working for the same location for 4 years and was never once offered a promotion but I just recently found out that my managers promoted a coworker who I helped train when we hired him."
bad,the job was kinda sucky but the discount i got made up for most every thing but the last manager i had there made it worse but he was only my manager for a couple days
bad,Management was very unorganized and terrible. Never knowing what to expect day to day. Just very unsettling. Hopefully they can clean house or shut down.
bad,"Aside from being a fast-paced, heavy volume store, we were also the focal attention of the District Manager. As such we were subject to multiple overbearing visits that did little to no good. After two years I was offered no advancement opportunities into secure positions. Multiple managers quit the position and I was the only employee to stay at the store longer than six months."
bad,Working for Gamestop was an absolute blast. Then I was promoted to SGA and it all went down hill very fast. You're considered management but yet you're treated like a seasonal. You have no guaranteed hours and are expected to go above and beyond when it came to store operations. If the manager didn't care about store ops how can I? Nothing was ever done and it was just an overall bad experience. Selling to customers got a lot easier with time and became something very fun to do. Stay as a GA as long as possible.
bad,"Gamestop is a fun place to work, however, if you're anything lower than a manager/keyholder, good luck getting anymore than 10 hours a week. There are 180 hours that get distributed between all employees for any given week. Managers/keyholders get a mandatory of 40 hours a week (store manager, assistant manager, and one or two keyholders). Do the math. That's easily 140-160 hours just between 3-4 people. The remaining hours get distributed between anyone leftover (Usually about 4 or 5 other employees that are below management positions). I saw people that only worked 5-8 hours a week. Not to mention that if you're anything lower than a manager/keyholder, you are easily expendable and they will not hesitate to let you go if they feel like you're not contributing enough (even though it's impossible to contribute if you're working less than 10/hrs a week). Not speaking from experience, but I've seen it happen so many times, it's really quite disappointing to see people who really love working at Gamestop not get the benefits and experience they deserve."
bad,GameStop is a good place to start working and learn a bit about how a business is run. For gamers the discount is great. This where the good things run out. The industry is too fast paced for the small crew of people to work happily. Sometimes it was too difficult to enjoy your work or get a sense of fullfilment out of the job. More time and effort are spent keeping district manager's happy than customers.
bad,"I found my time at Gamestop to be pretty enjoyable in the beginning, learning so many different systems, while being surrounded by video games and like minded people. However the environment can get very hectic with trade-ins requiring a (pawn license) which meant you would have to go through a fairly lengthy process of fingerprinting while checking IDs. At the same time, there is a lot of unorganized upper management, and sales quotas being pushed without any incentive to its employees."
bad,"New manager isn't a nice manager to work with."
bad,Tough to get promoted past manager level. District manager was a nightmare. Lots of turnaround and firing of staff. Got shouted at and threatened to be terminated for not meeting goals. Wouldn’t recommend this company.
bad,"While working at Gamestop I found that it was not a very serious environment and the management would talk about the customers behind their back in very disrespectful ways, which in the end did not feel right. They hired me and promised me at least 20 hours a week but even in the beginning I did not get that many and work probably one day out of the week for 4-5 hours, if I`m lucky."
bad,"A typical Day at GameStop is productive you greet customers , help them with any request they need , tell them about new games that released,any games that are on sale ,any deals they can get with by purchasing the membership. What I learned from working here is first and most important  customer service skills by greeting customers and thanking them for shopping at the store. The Managers I worked with was really helpful with getting me use to store culture and training me to be a manager myself. I really enjoyed helping customers with their needs and putting smiles on their faces and make sure they left the store happy and satisfied"
bad,"The company professes to care about its employees and the motto in the company is ""Protect the family""  However this statement holds no actual weight.  My personal experience is that When I was hired as a Store Manager in Sacramento, I was hired at $45,000 annual based off of my previous salary and management experience.  When I was hired in Nov 2014 I let my DM know that I was planning to transfer out to Las Vegas in Feb.  When I tranfered I had to take a temporary step down until a Store Manager position became available.  Once a position became available, I was repromoted at a fraction of my original salary.  So, now 3 years and 2 merit increases later, I am still making almost $4,000 less per year than the salary that I was originally hired at.  When I contact HR about this they told me that if I had transferred straight over I would have kept my salary. But, because I took the step down first, I am out of luck.  Distasteful, that they are happy to use this loophole to cut my pay that I support my Family with, all while spouting ""Protect the Family"" as a motto."
bad,"I was with the company for nearly a decade.  Throughout the entire time I found dealing with the District and Regional Managers to be counterproductive.  Furthermore, the level of disconnect between corporate and store was astronomical.  Goals were unrealistic and the punishment for failing to meet said goals was harsh.  The level of turnover was discouraging.  Due to the employee turnover it was difficult to establish professional relationships with employees and work effectively as a team since the team rotated on a fast basis."
bad,Gamestop when it come to job security is lacking they would fire someone over things that such as having bad numbers. The pay for the money the company makes plus the tasks they ask you to do each and every week is terrible. They do not offer much hours but expect you to maintain low thief in the stores with only single coverage most of the time. They expect high sales and send to much to the stores and do not offer a way to help with the lack of space given. The discount that they offer is also not worth much. Overall they ask for to much and do not compensate for the tasks that they are asking for on a daily bases.
bad,"The managers played favorites the entire time, and would shift hours to the employees that they wanted to see in the store. They also weened employees of hours util they basically didn't work there anymore. Any they only fired one or two VERY poor workers, the rest they just cut hours until they quit on their own. The rules and policies changed week by week and that made it tough to keep consistency in the workplace. And they are really critical of spending too little or too much time helping customers, which probably lost them a lot of sales because each manager/assistant manager has a different balance they wanted."
bad,Very cut throat atmosphere where you can and will be fired for not meeting the very bloated sales goals each week. Be prepared to commit more than your on the books work hours to making the store up to code because of the very tiny amount of working labor that each store gets every week.
bad,"The only way to move up is to sell subscriptions and reservations, then you're forced to try selling even after customers state they have no interest. Seniority doesn't equate to good management. It's retail so terrible pay, even if you do sell a lot and get promoted. You're on your feet nonstop, with zero place to relax. ""Break room"" was a counter with a metal chair and a microwave."
bad,i had another job so i didn't really care about this one. when i was trying to move up the manager was not trying to train me and the next manager didnt want an assistant so i moved on
bad,Fun place to work because the manager was awesome and made the time you were there productive yet enjoyable. However hours were getting cut left and right and it was hard to get ~20 hours in a week.
bad,I was seasonal help and they only gave me 2 hours a week with minimum wage. I would not requirement you to go over here if you want to make any money. Its ok and you meant a lot of cool people but not worth the money.
bad,"If you like wages just about the minimum rate, work schedules that change constantly (even to the point of changing when you show up for work), if you like low morale, if you like poor and/or inadequate management and corporate skills, if you like management yelling at you in front of customers and if you like impossible quotas placed on you, then Gamestop is definitely the place to work."
bad,"Ridiculous expectations of employees, high stress, almost no room for advancement no matter what. Little to no training, ethically out to win one over on their customers."
bad,"It was fun to work at sometimes but, because of corporate standards for employees it either became very competitive or very hard to meet standards asked of employees. The company based your work performance based on numbers not quality, and if numbers were not met the reprimands and terminations were issued."
bad,As a gamer I did enjoy my time at Gamestop. But the worst part about it was the corporate office and the ridiculous goals they wanted the employees to try to achieve everyday.
bad,"Store leaders and assistant store leaders are the primary people in the store fronts with very little coverage due to major cuts in stores hours. Therefore most people working a shift are working that shift alone. Compensation is very low considering the amount of duties and responsibilities the mid-level management is responsible for. Upper management mostly micromanages business in their store fronts. Requiring their employees to use high pressure sales tactics to make sales, and using metrics to measure the employees success using these tactics, facing being written up for not hitting their sales goal on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis."
bad,"This place is by far the worst place I have ever worked. It is poorly managed, poorly staffed, and pays terribly. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because of the friends I made when I worked there."
bad,"The customer service base was awesome. Getting to talk about the things you love with your customers but everything else about the actual job itself was terrible! If your a lower associate the blame is always pushed to you. Even if your making your sales goals or even exceeding them, the upper management will always bring bad news. Its always been a lose, lose situation. Awesome you're meeting goals but you didn't get any of your tasking done! Or vice versa sure you did all the tasking requirements but you did reach out to each and every person that came into your busy location. The company is only thinking about its profits, but not giving any intensive for those that bring the profit to the store!"
bad,"Overall, I did not hate my position in the company. I in fact enjoyed my job thoroughly. I had a very good position in my store and felt I did a great job guiding my employees and teaching new hires to be strong salesman and saleswomen. A typical day consisted of opening the store alone and stocking the store properly. This amounted to inventory checks, receiving product, and taking care of customers. A great deal of my time was spent training new hires, interviewing potential hires, and scouting for new hires. I like to consider myself a very people oriented employee and therefore enjoyed the company of my co workers. The hardest part of my position was how often I spent working alone. The most enjoyable part of my job was the customers. I enjoy talking to and making my customers smile."
bad,"Gamestop expects unrealistic goals when it comes to it's store managers.  The pay is not nearly worth the amount of effort and stress.  Further advancement beyond store manager level is near impossible unless you have connections or turn in to the perfect ""teachers pet."""
bad,"Working here, holidays were fast paced and super busy and fun. Any time else? Expect little to no hours. Left due to 3 hours a week, one day a week. Management HATES their job, expect constant complaints. Very boring when not in holiday season. Co-workers have a ""better than you"" attitude, especially if you are a female in this workplace. Discount isn't too extraordinary, but you're able to take games home with you for a few days at a time. Got a lot of free posters & small pins. Pay is minimal."
bad,GameStop is a pretty awful company to work for. They literally do not care about their employees. They just push numbers down everyone; throats and the pay is really poor.
bad,For starters the most you'll work is twice a week. Overall it is a friendly environment but that's not going to pay your bills.
bad,"For starters, the company as a corporation is terrible, the pay is low, the hours are usually not that many per week, and your schedule will change each week. "
bad,"I only worked there as a seasonal employee and so have no experience with the real compensation or advancement, but in my short time here I truly enjoyed the management and work space."
bad,"Gamestop's corporate is awful, they do not care about employees and the way that the district manager over the Amarillo area is a very rude woman who should NOT be running a district. Now, there was some good here however, I very enjoyed my loyal customer base and most of my co-workers. All in all, corporate Gamestop is really bad, but the parts that don't involve corporate are great. Also, the benefits are terrible."
bad,Not a place i would ever want to work again or a place i would recommend a friend or family member to work at. I wish I would have spent that year working with a better company. Upper management has a huge disconnect with each store because they set goals which can not be reached and they have never been in a store or listened to our outcries or advice. Doesnt work.
bad,"GameStop relies solely on their management to work because they do not provide enough hours for the sales associates to work. The sales associates can't make money, so they leave/don't come in for shifts; basically, they don't care about they're job because they have no reason to. Managers are overworked and are constantly getting in trouble for bad numbers or not getting tasks done. It's a very unorganized and overall a terrible company to work for."
bad,Fun place to work but the growth potential is limited from my experience.
bad,"Customer service and item organization. Keeping the floor free of debris. While management was nice, hours were hard to come by. Worked with set group, HIGHLY friendly. Managing the cash register was the hardest part as i did not get the time needed to work on it an learn what to do. The best part was borrowing the games and talking with customers about the products."
bad,"Where else can you get paid to talk to people about video games all day! "
bad,"Overall terrible company to work for full time.  They ask way too much of their managers and demand unreasonable numbers.  Good luck getting a raise higher than 10 cents too, no matter what numbers or customer surveys say.  It has some perks like being able to check out games for free, and buy games at a discount but those are far outweighed by being constantly understaffed, under payed, and under appreciated."
bad,"A typical day at work with GameStop consisted of dealing with angry customers and attempting to accomplish more work than can be done with the number of payroll hours given by the District Manager, who may or may not be qualified to do his or her job.  Gamers in general are good people.  Qwerky, but good none the less.  If you are lucky enough to be in a market that is relatively small, GS can be very rewarding and you will find that your ""Core"" customers are very loyal.  If you are in a major metro area, good luck.  Midnight events every week, leave you very vulnerable to being robbed, which happens ALL THE TIME at GS.  Not worth the meeger pay.  As a Store Manager, the pay scale TOPS out at 45,000 per year."
bad,A typical work day would start by doing inventory of a specific section of my store. Then doing pricing and responding to time sensitive emails. What I learned from that job was how to communicate especially in a corporate setting. I learned how to evaluate employees or potential hires. My co-workers were all college part time people so it was rather difficult to make co-worker friends. The hardest part of my job was the pep rally type atmosphere the upper management would try to convey. They also would micromanage to a very high degree. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a decent staff and interesting clientele.
bad,"Started working at GameStop as a seasonal hire in Oct. 2006 during the Nintendo Wii launch. The season was very fun, talking gamers and moms looking for gifts was great. Working the holiday at first was pretty easy fixing the walls to look presentable, filing away games and taking in trades among other duties. I didn't get scheduled again after the season was over but got called back a month later to be rehired. About a month after I got promoted to a the lowest supervisor position called LGA or Lead Game Advisor thus began my journey down a road I wish I hadn't taken. The higher up you get in GameStop the worse it becomes as the burden of responsibility gets heavier and heavier with the more power you are given. After 4.5 long years of very hard work and persistence I finally got my own store. The amount of stress at work definitely outweighed the good with all the deadlines, lack of hours to meet said deadlines, the amount of pushy sales tactics to meet performance requirements. The only thing I ended up liking about the place was my fellow Store Managers and the free stuff we got from the various publishers. I wouldn't recommend anyone waste time with this company, they don't value their employees and it takes a long time to move up that is if you do it the honest way and don't kiss butt or back stab people. The pay was very lousy for the amount of work Managers have to do which most of it is by yourself cause the Company is too cheap to invest in the payroll hours so we could hire the right people and have them work with us."
bad,"Typical day working at Gamestop included busy clientele coming through on a daily basis, daily inventory counts for select categories, restocking products throughout the store."
bad,"Eh, could've been better. Hardest part of the job was selling their subscriptions to customers."
bad,Only way to keep your job is to get pre-orders and power up card subs
bad,"First retail job, overall was an OK experience. The coworkers were great to work with. Learned how to stock inventory, manage a small group of employees when the manager was absent, work a cash register, and meet sales expectations. The amount of pay for the position I was doing with all the responsibilities I had, was not worth it. The management was VERY POOR at the location I worked at. No training whatsoever, learned from other employees. Typical day was selling games and helping customers with trade-ins and other questions. Hardest part of the job was having no help and having to assist 20+ customers, which caused many customers to be angry with wait lines."
bad,"i do like the job, but there are not enough hours for all the worker to have a steady schedule or good hours"
bad,"Its retail. I'm a pretty loyal person. You ask me to do something or come in on my day off and I will do so if I can. I have done this many times for GameStop. If a fellow employee doesn't have keys or is freaking out over a register not being right, I'm the one they call and even if it's my day off I'll pick up the phone and help them out."
bad,"While my experience with GameStop did teach me a lot about working with people and managing a business, I look back on it with regret. I regret having practically donated my time to this company. Upper management is a complete joke. They constantly ask you to work harder without any extra compensation and are completely oblivious to how things work on a store level."
bad,I LOVED working there! I had everything under control! The only thing was I didn't get a lot of hours! I worked maybe 9hrs a WEEK!
bad,"I love video games and I was so excited when I saw a GameStop job fair for part timers at select locations. I was in school and the store that hired me was so nearby. I said to myself that this was going to be awesome. Then the job started...You hardly get any hours, no commission on additional sales and the pay already sucks."
bad,"I enjoyed being around videoa games and not having to sell something I dont like, but Gamestop has fell through in making sure their employees are taken care of, I appreciate the opportunity and the experience as amanager but I have more respect for people thus giving me the push to take on thr next chapter of my life"
bad,"Gamestop does not even attempt to hide its desire for money and money alone from its employees. It care absolutely nothing for the customers and wants nothing more than to send them out the door with 3 times what they came in for. The care for employees is entirely non-existent. You work hard as a part timer for only a possible $.15 a year and its not even based on individual performance but store performance. Did minimum wage go up? The your raises are wiped clean and any you made over as a key holder or manager is ignored and not increased to compensate. The job is horrible all around and the company doesn't try, even in the slightest, to be a good one. After taking classes for my bachelor's in business, I can personally say that they're doing everything wrong when it comes to having the slightest care for anyone."
bad,"At GameStop, policies and initiatives will vary from week to week, with high performance expectations but little reward in return. Good place for light part-time work if you enjoy video games and customer service, but is a poor choice for a full-time or career enhancing position. Hours are inconsistent."
bad,"Now workers are forced to sell sell sell and it noticeably alienates the customers. Even worse, most of the ""deals"" GameStop offers are ripoffs. Add in the fact that GameStop does not hesitate to remove content from the games sold such as online coupons. Loving to play games does not mean you will like working here and if you love the gaming industry, buy from somewhere else."
bad,GameStop rewards you in no way if you exceed sales goals or go above and beyond the call of duty. As a store manager you will work 50+ hours a week for peanuts. The company as a whole is shrinking and will be gone within 5 years of digital advancement and the non-existent of pre-owned games which is it's whole profit margin
bad,Your wallet will not thank you for long term employment at Gamestop. It's a great place to work if you're interested in gaming and the culture. Your chances of being promoted over store management are slim to nil. Most regional managers practice nepotism and hire their friends from outside of the company. Also you're always on call.
bad,"You get nearly no benefits until you become an assistant Store Leader, hours are extremely limited, goals often seem impossible, and advancement feels like a waiting game"
bad,GameStop will do their best to pay you the least amount of money for the most amount of work. Even management is underpaid and entry level employees hardly ever get any hours.
bad,"This is a quick and easy job. Good for a senior in high school trying to get easy cash. However, not something for long term. The tasks are easy, but the company expectations are outrageous. The company is definitely on a decline, there’s no reason for expectations on employees to be high"
bad,"When I got the job in high school, I was extremely excited to talk about video games all day - which is something that persisted through my entire time of employment. What's terrible are unrealistic sales expectations, confusing store policies and changes, being extremely overbearing to customers, and not being paid anywhere close to enough for the amount of work you do. The company is falling apart. I'd stay away."
bad,"You either are standing all day with barely any customers coming in, or you’re frantically trying to stay afloat with how many come in. Manager had a big ego and belittled everyone in lower positions than him. They didn’t care about their employees or customers and were too focused on getting as much money out of customers as possible. As a seasonal, you already are susceptible to trash hours, but it was ridiculously low for me, as well was the pay."
bad,"Job security was mainly provided through an unforeseen hardship. However, fears of being laid-off were substantial."
bad,"Awful company that exploits peoples passion to make a quick profit. The job can be made bearable based on your management, but with how harshly the company pushes goals it's just a bad experience."
bad,"The immediate working environment was pretty good, my managers and coworkers were pretty awesome. But once we got into the district and regional managers, they were awful and threatened to fire people for small things like leaning on counters, or claiming no one greeted them in the store when cameras showed that they had in fact been greeted. My manager said that a secret shopper had claimed they were not greeted for 20 minutes in an almost empty store while I was working the floor, when I know for a fact I had greeted every customer I saw that shift. My manager believed me, luckily, but said he still had to let me know. Be careful of working here, I have heard the toxic management is not limited to my area. Threatening jobs was commonplace, and there was a lot of stress on days we knew they were coming."
bad,"I loved GameStop at first. I learned a lot about sales and had a good SL/ASL who taught me a lot. Then, I got moved to a low-value store, that was on the verge of closing. The manager was awful. I was the shining star at this location, and I still got pressured to meet certain standards, that, due to low customer volume, was unachievable. I eventually requested a transfer to the highest volume store in the district and loved it there. Great manager, again, the District manager was always there so he could see my progress and how well I was doing, and eventually, I got promoted to a keyholder. I still had wonderful coworkers, until the ASL got fired, and was followed by a string of the worst managers I've ever had in my entire work history. No knowledge of sales, day to day operations, to the point every employee wanted them fired. Eventually, that person quit, and I got moved back to the location I disliked. I did not get along with another keyholder, managers and I's relationship got better, but eventually, I decided to leave to advance my career elsewhere. I feel as if the company didn't value my hard work and time, despite just having a child, and still working 40+ a week and upholding a high QOS. "
bad,"Game stop is a great job, environment, great place to work. Especially if your into gaming. Good management and everyone works at a team. Discount on merchandise is a plus."
bad,"If you want to work for Gamestop, there's a few harsh truths you'll have to accept first. 1.) You will NOT receive enough hours to make over $150 on any given check. 2.) There will always be someone ready to replace you. 3.) The company is changing and not for the better. 4.) You will never receive benefits unless you become Assistant Manager /Manager (which will take at least a year or two at minimum wage). 5.) You will have to work more than one job in order to provide for yourself as you will never be given more than 12 hours a week (again, at minimum wage). "
bad,this a little fun teenager job i don't recommended for people trying to accomplish something in the next few month but its fun if you just need some play money
bad,"Organizing, reorganizing, fighting customers, pressure to meet difficult metrics for pro-cards and pre-orders. I loved, LOVED, my coworkers and became good friends with a few of them. I had a few very good managers. Anybody above my store manager was terrible. The hardest part was trying to get the pre-orders, especially when you work part time and just aren't in the store as much. It took me 5 years to get a single promotion, and one year the district manager refused to give raises. Often I felt unappreciated and small, and very replaceable. However, it was fun to gush about games with friends and the occasional cool customer."
bad,"I was lucky where my actual store managers, except for one (my last one) were amazing people and were active in training and accommodating their employees. But anyone higher was questionable. I had an issue and reported it to HR, HR said they would look into it. Investigated, covered it up. "
bad,"As a part timer, you'll only make minimum wage unless you have experience, but even then it's unlikely that you'll make more than $8 an hour. You're held responsible for things you have little control over (pro card sales, pre-orders, trade ins) and you're expected to meet ridiculous sales goals."
bad,The environment is not well managed. Corporate will add tasks and then immediately turn around and contradict themselves.  All the while giving no actual information on how the tasks should be completed.
bad,"Starting off, if you're not immediately promoted or going to a higher position. It's not worth working for unless for a bit of extra change or pocket money."
bad,"This company was great during the great days; however, since the times has changed to DL content the company is losing money and it is not as great as it used to be."
bad,"Company does not care about their employees, they would rather promote outside hires than people who have already been working for them and are trained. Seems unfair and it's terrible that they penalize employees for poor metrics."
bad,The job started okay but things became Political soon after. Store manager was manipulative and didn’t do his job. I would not work for this company again.
bad,Horrible hours even as a key holder (15-17 per week) hours given to managers mainly. Poor management they’re power hungry. Only fun part is working with games & discounts are okay. Can be fired for anything at anytime.
bad,It is not recommended to work here unless your a college student that needs employment 3hours a week. Very pressured environment for only making minimum wage at 3-6hrs a week.
bad,Gamestop as a company is more interested in money than providing a meaningful customer experience. My time there was more detrimental to my mental health than anything I have ever encountered.
bad,"Seeing GameStop in the position it is in now comes as no surprise to me. The company failed to keep up with the digital demand of the games marketplace. Now it is a sinking ship."
bad,"Though I've been with the company for nearly 5 years and have worked as a shift manager, I do not make decent compensation for the stress the job inflicts. The job itself is fairly simple; however, the corporate offices force expectations upon the employees who only make just over minimum wage. The store leader only makes on average $16 an hour, I as a senior guest advisor only make $8.50 an hour; keep in mind that this is 5 years in. The company is currently in a downward spiral and is consistently cutting our payroll. If by some miracle they recover and improve wages then this may be a fine job in the future, but do not let them take advantage of you."
bad,I worked for Gamestop for years as a key holder. It’s fine if your a college student and just want to make some extra money. You’re not guaranteed hours all the time. The store manager and assistant store manager hours are delegated first and then the rest of the employees  depending on what is left. These hours are based on the timeframe from the prior year determining how much was made. You can be scheduled for 30 hours but they can cut your shift if production is even slower than expected. It’s great during the holidays. Not many problems and you can expect to really work and make all your hours.
bad,"im not sure, i didnt get paid enough and they barely gave me days to work. i was basically the cleaning lady and i wasnt allow to check people out. i didnt enjoy working there."
bad,It was fun while it lasted but hours were given on seniority and I was the new guy. Therefore the hours were really low and you had to meet a weekly quota which I was unable to meet because of that
bad,"I have worked for this company for almost three years, and they consistently continue to disappoint. The management is inconsistent and sophomoric, and those managers that have spent more than ten years with the company are far beyond apathetic. There is no passion in this workplace. Management can and will force employees into a popularity contest. Promotions are not based on acquisition of skills or progress in your position, but instead on how much flattery you are willing to dole out and how much begging you are willing to do. You need not have skill in retail to become a store manager here. The pay rate is abysmal for the work expected and pay raises are nearly non-existent. If there is anything redeeming about working for this company, it is the relationship you build with your customer base, and the access to current technology and gaming culture."
bad,Job is stressful once you're a manager/keyholder. Regular employees barely get any hours but they request to have a staff of 6+ people on the schedule.
bad,"The only reason why I stayed with Game stop was because I liked to interact with customers. Game stop would continuously ask the employees to do ""fixing"" and ""construction "" on the store even though it is not in our job description to do so. For example when I was a Sales Associate they had me get on a ladder to remove wooden paneling from near the ceiling and to scrape off the residue and to fix the patches where it was. Whenever a new change in policy or memberships would pass the upper Management would not notify everyone. I have had numerous guests know about the changes before anyone in my store was told."
bad,Wouldn't work full time for this company. There aren't really a lot of hours to give out. Shifts would be 3 hours to 4 hours long. Only time you would probably work more that twice a week would be during the holidays.
bad,"Is your store making sales plan and profit? Is your team engaging in the right behaviors to sell enough preowned? Is every guest being explained the benefits of trading in their games and accessories? What's your selling culture store, and are you getting at least 1.0% surveys each week? How many memberships, and preorders, and game warranties and hardware protection plans have you sold? Are you using the tablet enough? Is your shrink above .25%? Are you interviewing on a weekly basis? Are you creating a social media presence for your store? "
bad,"Since its hard to get fired, you might as well get your first job here and that is it... there is no other reason to work at a Gamestop. It brings no learning for future careers, no personal enjoyment, and they make you read a script to every guest that takes any sense of humanity out of the employees."
bad,"Job only cares about numbers, you can have all the knowledge about the products and be great at helping people but if you have a bad couple weeks with getting preorders you get in trouble. This is all years ago though so I dont know if they changed much since then but I assume not."
bad,It was an okay place to work great co-workers but terrible hours I would not recommend for somebody for full-time I had full-time as a worker but in the end they end up just cutting everyone's hours
bad,"Was probably one of the worst jobs I ever had.  Very stressful, received no help from upper management, they revied employees performance based on things out of control of the employee."
bad,"I loved the product I sold but did not like the company. I worked very hard for them and my raises annually would only be around 10 cents. No matter what you did you were written up or in trouble. If I got overtime I was written up, but if I didn't get my work done I was written up. I would clock out and finish my nightly task because I felt I had no other choice."
bad,"It could be a great place to work. The staff is fun, friendly, and outgoing. The compensation and benefits aren't the best, but they're average or slightly below. What kills the place is too many managers and very little upward mobility; they don't hire these managers from within. There is a very deep management hierarchy. There was a line of 10+ managers above me to get all the way up to the CEO. I had a boss, who had a boss, who had a boss...ad infinitum.  HR is a brutal beast; don't cross them. Management needs to loosen its grip on employees, give a little more flexibility, independent decision making, and let them do what they are very capable of doing. They have a highly competent employee base who are very knowledgable in their fields."
bad,One of the worse companies. It’s ran by people who have no idea how to run a business. It’s not just in store but also up in the corporate lines. Can not make good business decisions
bad,"High demand work environment, always something to do with little payroll support.  Managers left to work alone for hours, having to multitask job duties while trying to achieve world class customer service."
bad,"Not enough hours available to regular employees, all hours are taken by Managers, nothing learned, didn't make enough money to do much of anything outside of work."
bad,"Working at GameStop was very unorganized, it was total chaos I have never seen so much mess and filth and lack of attention to customers except for the regulars. I would never work in place like that again."
bad,First job was hired as seasonal and was kept on but once seasonal hours stopped coming in i was brought down to 5-8 hours a week. Changed management which hindered the company atmosphere
bad,"Game Stop is the kind of place that seems great to work for but isn't."
bad,"always had to push for pre orders on stuff we already knew they had no interest in, never had advancement, this is a job that should only be help by a college student trying to make some money on the side. or someone right out of high school"
bad,"I moved up pretty quickly, however once you hit a certain position, the room to grow is slowed to a halt. This job choice makes for good work experience."
bad,not much as only had 6 hours perl week a typical day was literally a hour per day witch is 9 dollars a day after taxes only make about 58 dollars so I forced to put in my two weeks notice before really going any core exsperinvces from the job or company
bad,"it's been a while since I worked there but it's like any retail job.  Not so good pay and not so good hours.  If you're full time like assistant manager you will get 40 hours but that's it.  If you're a store manager you are salary and they pretty much own you whether you're there for 40 hours or 70 hours a week.  It's good if you're young and need a first or second job, it'll help develop your customer service skills.  Not a place for the long term if you need money to live."
bad,"I don't recommen working here honestly, this was a somewhat fun job and had some people I got along with including the manager but I was to much for someone to do, they kept piling my working when I was alresdy doing something."
bad,High expectations with little to no compensation. Poor communication from management on every level. Work at this company only if you love the experience of helping out customers at a store level. The high level of management is complete garbage.
bad,"The job itself wasn’t bad, however customers are unaware of the way GameStop runs and operates. Which is probably why there’s a high turnover rate. And we constantly lose customers!"
bad,Gamestop is a terrible company to work for. Being forced to sell products customers don’t need just because they need to be sold. You’re thrown into the job.
bad,"this place is fast paced at some times, slow on others.  The pay was not worth the time spent there along with the task given.  graveyard shifts were not reasonable"
bad,You open the store play games tell people about said games work work work sell sell sell manager never there and assiant manager steals everything from store but its ok
bad,"The only positive thing I can take from my employment with GameStop is the coworkers. Work wise, nothing you ever do is ""good enough"". The level of stress from always trying but constantly belittled, shows how little the company truly values their store employees."
bad,"They expect you to meet sales goals, but don't offer any incentive for actually doing it. Would have weeks where the GA's would have little to no hours. Would tey to call people in once sales were up with little to no notice. Great work environment, just not a financially stable job."
bad,"They don't give you an opportunity to succeed. Not enough hours, employees spend years working there just to get a dollar raise and become an assistant manager."
bad,"GameStop was once a great company but over time it began to put profits over people and value the wrong things. The environment does not inspire an atmosphere of trust and for a videogame company, fun and enjoyment are essentially nonexistent. After the Store Manager level it is no longer a merit based enterprise for promotions, but rather “who you know” and how pleasant and obsequious you are to upper management. I left on my own terms because I was no longer proud to work for the company. Left behind some truly wonderful people who I hope the situation improves for but on the company’s current course is very unlikely."
bad,"Gamestop has changed dramatically in the handful of years I've worked for them.  What's truly jarring, though, is how it can change you as a person."
bad,"Basic retail job, but slightly more interesting as you get a minor glimpse inside the gaming industry, for better or worse. Not too much different from other retail based jobs. The same office politics and minimum pay as you'd expect elsewhere."
bad,worked my rear end off for one holiday season only to have the job given to a male with poor work ethic and spotty record. was only working female at location and was constantly put down when i showed i was good at something.
bad,benefits paid time off climate controlled easy nice breake room parking is very bad discount at stores a little laid back want more money wish overtime was always there .
bad,"As someone who is greatly invested in video gaming culture, I was one of those people who believed that GameStopn would be my match made. However, that was far from the truth, it was honestly the worst job experience I’ve ever had."
bad,The company is scattered in alaska with little to no contact at times.  They are very hands off except for pushing corporate affairs.  It's not bad for customer service training
bad,"I'm a game fanatic and I thought Gamestop would be the ideal job for me. WRONG! While you do get the occasional customer that you can have an enjoyable/relate-able conversation with on many occasions you'll get customers that are hard to work with. Then your manager will tell you the custormer is always right and say something along the lines of ""oh im sorry you had to deal with that, i'll get you fix up here shortly"" when it was clearly the customer in the wrong. Also your manager will put TONS of pressure on you to sell powerup reward cards. It doesn't matter if it's a little kid or an adult that doesn't have a clue what it is, your manager will still prompt you to sell it to them anyways. This job isn't what it is intended to be."
bad,Everyone that is higher up than sounds like a robot.goals are unreachable but you are expected to reach them. threatened with right up for everything. they never work with you.
bad,While working with guest to help them find what kind of game they need is very rewarding and very fun at times. The corporate office forces field teams to hit unrealistic goals and force lower management to write up and fire staff. Even though they are doing all the behaviors the corporate office expects and helping customers to the best of their abilities.
bad,Would be assigned all the shifts the manager didn't want or felt were beneath him.  Pressured to up sell all transactions and push the repaid rewards card if not then repercussions would happen.
bad,"GameStop is a competitive, stressful entry position that requires a great deal of patience. Do not pursue unless absolutely need a job. The required work does not meet the pay."
bad,"Gamestop doesn't care about the employees under the level of Store Manager (Leader). I've been with the company going on nine years and am certainly still just a number. There is little ability to move forward in the company. My store manager happens to be the best manager I have ever worked for in my life, and he was completely willing to work with my school schedule while I was in college. The corporate entity on the other hand, is horrible. I'm also sure not every person has a great manager as I have. The corporation gives a lot of babble about caring about employees, wanting to hear employee opinions, and making the guests come first, but this isn't really the case. Behind the scenes of what you hear on the Gamestop TV, (where they say they want to hear from employees and help employees), they actually only care about meeting and exceeding sales through the use of the Circle of Life (COL). If anyone is unaware that means you are expected to make extra sales every transaction and it is percentage based. This wouldn't be so bad if there was some level of compensation, but when your job depends on passing the COL then it only causes stress and worry about things you simply cannot fully control. The way they control employees and expect maximum profit is old fashioned. It's like no one in the corporate of Gamestop ever heard of the idea of increasing employee morale to incite people to WANT to perform better. Instead it is fear based on passing each week. Fortunately for me, I've taken the job as an underling while in school and got a lot of experience talking to people like"
bad,"I'm sure it may be fine if you are seasonal or don't actually need to work, but if you are looking for security, this is not the place. Severely inconsistant hours are the norm. Most times, I was scheduled four hours a week. The company is failing so corporate is severely increasing workloads while cutting hours. The place has basically become a toy store so a lot more cleaning and merchandising is necessary. While in larger stores duties are delegated to specific job titles, at gamestop everyone has to do everything. On the upside you get a lot of promo freebies and can ""rent"" the preowned games in addition to the employee discount."
bad,You get basically minimum wage for dealing with customers that are like fast food customers. I did enjoy selling video games and having my job being video games however management is very selfish and doesn't care about their employees.
bad,"Fun job, that lets you work with like minded individuals. However the pay is just not good enough to keep the better quality team members around. Massive turnover caused by this lack of benefits."
bad,"The only saving grace about working for this company was the amazing team that an employee can end up working with. Unless an specific employee is a manager of a store or and assistant manager, the other employees are pretty much expendable and aren't compensated properly for all of the work they do behind the scenes."
bad,"While it does take consistent responsibility & effort in terms of the managerial position(it's not always all games,its a professional retail job, but an exciting one). It is definitely a fun & hip work atmosphere to be at. Throw that in with a very friendly & tech savy crew(in my case), recipe for greatness. However, the unique customers we're the most enjoyable sphere of the job. The awesome interactions,conversations of games, whats trending & upcoming releases. All while being able to assist them in their purchases. It's really what satisfied me working for Gamestop in being able to serve customer from all types of ages,difficulties,cultures & gaming knowledge. Just amazingly fun if you enjoy the gaming lifestyle."
bad,"I disliked working at GameStop for a number of reasons; the management seemed mostly interested in sales, which is to be expected, but also seemed to want to alienate the client base by imposing far too many corporate restrictions on attire. We were a small store in a tiny rural town where most customers would come in wearing torn, dirty jeans, sneakers or work boots, and graphic tees, and yet we as game advisors were under strict instruction to wear business casual, no white shoes, no graphics on our shirts whatsoever. You'd think a game store would encourage game-related clothing at least as a way to start a conversation with customers. Despite my position not being commission-based, my ability to support myself suffered from me not being a pushy salesperson. Others with better numbers got more hours, while mine dwindled from 25 per week, to 15, to 5. And because I had fewer hours, I got fewer sales, and it all went downhill from there."
bad,the sheer lack of guidance by the district manager was outrageous and the competitiveness of the job is outrageous you do literally nothing but meet quotas in this job its stupid.
bad,"This is a highly competitive role at any level and every aspect of your performance will be held against you and used as leverage should your performance start to waiver. The company is headed down the pathway of Toys R Us and sales are decreasing and reservations are harder to achieve due to digital downloads and competitive pricing elsewhere. As a store leader you work 44 hours  a week, there is virtually no physical labor but everything hinders on your sales and merchandising, keeping a store looking clean net and organized. You will be short-staffed. The point-of-sale system is outdated and buggy. Your employees may sometimes work 4-8 hours once or twice per two weeks. Payroll is low. As likely as you are to be promoted you are just as likely to be terminated. You will be paid at less than the industry minimum. This job is good only for getting the title and relocating to a better paying similar position anyplace else. If you are entry level, you will be stressed working here. As a key-holder you face the most scrutiny as you carry more burdens and are paid almost nothing extra for your work. An assistant manager will have 32 hours per week if they are very lucky and repaid a bit more than a key holder and carry whatever burdens the store leader does not want. Good luck."
bad,"The job itself is okay at best. You come in, process some shipment if needed, open or close, help customers, inventory count, ect. You usually get along with your coworkers well since most of them are also video game fans. Getting to talk about video games with coworkers and customer is probably the best part. Kind of like talking about Star Wars movies or sports games with your friends. Since you have that common ground of interest, it is extremely easy to get along with everyone."
bad,Not a place to stay at for a very long time. Low pay and no advancement. I would not recommend working at Gamestop. It is good for someone just starting to work. But don't expect to stay for a long time
bad,poor pay from a company that is losing money.  They have shady upselling tactics at the register.  They rely on high school kids to do the grunt work for little pay and they spend their paycheck in store.  I would avoid this company.
bad,"You would have thought working here is fun but its a nightmare, the hours are awful, if you manage to get any, the management push for you to upsell like crazy, pushing the credit card and the store membership over sales."
bad,"in un giornata tipica le mansioni erano le seguenti:"
bad,"Working in the Distro Hub Was great very normal shift work kind of job, the mandatory overtime was rough around the holidays. The stores was abysmal constant demand for selling memberships and reserves just made the atmosphere stressfull."
bad,"Hope you enjoy being yelled at by both managers and customers day in and day out. Pay is awful, the discounts barely offset the cost of games and products, you are constantly hounded to PUSH memberships on people that might not even want one. The quality of your manager is a toss of a coin. I've worked under some of the smartest and kind managers in my entire life under Gamestop and I've also seen the dregs of humanity there as well. Take my advise, unless you are a student who isn't worried about bills and car payments, DON'T WORK FOR GAMESTOP!"
bad,In my experience if you do not know the right people here you don't get very far.  People who should have been let go move up and people that fight hard to move up remain stagnant.
bad,For a large company they don't pay well at all.  They had unrealistic expectations for performance and the amount of hours you had to work to make no money.
bad,"The time that i worked at Gamestop was very stressful and nerve wracking. From the amount of sales were expected to make on a daily bases even when no customers come into the store on slow days, to the constant pressure from the manager to get the sales. Just a very stressful work place and I would never want to go back or recommend any one to work there."
bad,"For a starting job, this place wasn't bad. However, they are constantly watching how much you get people onto the membership cards and your numbers, or else you may not be employed long."
bad,"After many years of working for and with this company, after advancing through the leadership and management field, Gamestop is only a company to work for if you either, A) have no ideals and will follow blindly what black and white numbers say or B) just need money. It's a corporation. That much is understood. You see, however, other corporations that will take care of their workforce, not back track on ideals or pledges, and have integrity when something goes awry. Their idea of 'Protecting the Family' is only on paper to look nice. The employees are treated as though they are a dime a dozen, and although this doesn't speak to a select very few of the management, from the top down it is simply a black and white numbers game. For those who care for their employees, care for their customer or client base, or care for the industry they strive to lead in, I implore you to avoid this company."
bad,Gamestop doesn't care about customer service. They see each customer as just a number. They do not care about employees unless you are the manager. They make you work long hours. They don't give you enough hours to properly run the stores. You may only have 83 hours for 7 employees and most of the time you will be running a skeleton crew with 1 person in the store at a time.
bad,"GameStop is not inherently a bad place to work.  Your experience will change depending on 2 things.  1) Your store manage and 2) your district leader.  The third factor is slightly less bus still important, the flavor of the month regarding their sales."
bad,You Would Work at this job if you already had extensive knowledge of systems and consoles. It is a good job to have around the holidays when there is a constant flow of people
bad,Was great at first but has quickly gone downhill wit DM'S fireing left and right. Now is not a good time to work for GS. Company has a complete distrust of employees and is quick to blame and does not acknowledge that digital distribution is killing us. That being said my store manager and co workers are fantastic and are the main reason I've stuck around.
bad,"Long story short, AO wireless went out of business and sold its stores to Cricket. Some former employees ended up suing Gamestop for hours of work unpaid."
bad,This is a ok job theirs just a lot of discrimination towards women in the video game community constant nasty comments from customers but other then that a pretty easy job and relaxed lay back environment
bad,"It's an ok job, and it is a JOB (Just over broke) not a CAREER. Management is delusional but what else is new. Customers are either really cool or not, and you get the odd freak and crackhead shoplifter. And no you don't get to play the games when your working, btw it is work, a lot of work."
bad,company cared little for their store management and lower. took advantage of salaried employees and did not value hourly ones. very hard to advance and did not provide fair compensation.
bad,The employees and managers were always at each other's throats for no reason most of the time. One of tje worst working experiences I have ever had...
bad,"During my time with GameStop at their corporate location, myself and the friends I have met across nearly all the departments can all agree that there is little-to-no oversight on middle management. This is likely the root cause for the massive discrepancies between executive leadership's visions and the execution. "
bad,"company is very mismanaged. successful stores are without reason faced with forced management changes from employees who ran their own stores into the ground. then the favoritism is rampant, you may find that even if you out perform other employees in every aspect consistently, they will continue to get more hours and more advancement opportunities. In my personal experience the store manager was secretly dating the employee who underperformed and never hit their sales goals, or expectations of execution, yet they were given more hours and more opportunity. All in all this was the reason I left the company."
bad,does not  care about employees employees. a very topical retail job where if you get good numbers they want to know why you cant always get them and if you dont have good numbers your job will be in danger
bad,The hardest part of the job is the constantly changing environment. you will never truly grasp the way they do things you will only do your best to stay afloat.
bad,"I started out as part-time but moved up the ranks quickly.  I was promoted to manager and had the best sales in the district for 16 months straight.   I was let go right before getting a $3,500 bonus."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend this job to any one that wants to be treated like a decent human being. the job itself will go great when you first start working but then as you go on you'll learn about goals for the amount of pre-owned you sell ,reserves on games,warranties on games and systems you get also the dollar amount on what you sell.The job is a hourly job but treats it like a commission based one where you have employees fired for not hitting those goals even though they most likely work a 3 hr shift once or twice a week."
bad,"Not much over time, and management was not so great. Other than that, a pretty good job for the most part. Mostly good for people with little to no work experience in my opinion."
bad,"A typical day at work is me basically doing everything that our ""Senior"" Game advisers didn't want to do. I learned not to talk back to a senior because it ends up getting me in trouble. The people at the same level as me were good enough. There was no advancement, they had their ""group"" and it stayed that way."
bad,Can be very busy but your given limited amounts of coverage to deal with high demand situations. Benefits are the products are easy to be passionate about.
bad,It is a place to work and you can borrow games as  long as your store is performing well and have no theft issues. they want unreasonable goals at times.
bad,Worked here during most of my years in high school and also part of college and compensation was alright but not very good compared to other places. I would not recommend this establishment
bad,"i really wanted to work at gamestop because of my love for games, I quickly realized that a job at gamestop made you have a distaste for video games. Always pushing protection plans, credit card, pro rewards, i get it, its about sales, but from my experience, the company is not handled the right way at all."
bad,"Thought there was more to this riding sales quotas. No longer about customer service, all about shoving pre-orders down their throats"
bad,"My manager only gave me 8 hours. I try talking to him about it but he kept saying ""I'll put you on next week"". The GameStop's manager only let his friends work hours."
bad,bad pay super long hours way to much stress. management is not realistic or ready. no help what so ever.  always on your own with goals you cant meet.
bad,liked the work I did just did have a life outside of it and weighed on my relationship with my wife. every shift thought they did all the work and not a team environment.
bad,"Entertaining first career, but many draw backs involving reservations and magazine subscriptions. Enjoyable coworkers and work environment. While working, I experienced management lies, harassment, and stealing."
bad,Need security unsafe place to work. This is a company that wants they store to be your life. Hardest part of the job not knowing if you will be going home.
bad,"I'm going to say one thing, they hired me and never told me it was only seasonal, and I only made about $150 after taxes for 3 months."
bad,"Bland work environment, some if not most management is un-knowledgeable about the products and services the company offers. Higher management blames employees for company shortcomings. Unprofessional in my honest opinion. "
bad,they are an ok place to work but i was told i would be paid one thing then they destroyed my pay rate substantially. definitely wouldnt recommend.
bad,The idea of working at GameStop is fantastic. The reality is being forced to be a robot. Being told to harass customers within seconds of them entering the store. And disciplined if you do not. By district managers who will have a heart attack if put behind a register.
bad,"While this job is by far not the worst job on the planet, it definitely has many issues and is not as ""fun"" as some people may think. See Pros & Cons, though that is not a complete list."
bad,bad and very low pay. needs improvement with almost everything.
bad,"Gamestop has the make of a great company, it just comes short on the execution. The motto is ""Protect the Family"", they just fail to mention that you are not part of the family. They value empowered leadership, but micromanage everything to the bone. A 44 hour week is very rarely that, and home life will need to move to the back burner or you will not be able to successfully function in your position. I learned a lot from my tenure there. I became a better trainer working for Gamestop. Initially, the most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with customers. Sadly, in the last few years, the most enjoyable part of my job was clocking out to go home."
bad,Management was the reason I left. Had to self teach how to do job and was getting in trouble from mistakes that could have been prevented with proper training.
bad,"While GS expects a great deal of personal commitment, it is at the cost of one's family. If you are a gamer whose life is work, then this is a great place. If however, you might have other life priorities, you will not be appreciated."
bad,"During the off season you struggle to make enought to live, and in the busy season they over work you. needs more balance."
bad,"Great company, great business practice.  Extra bonuses and perks of working with GameStop"
bad,This company isn't led very well. It's leaders have decent ideas however none of them have any experience IN an actual store nor do they understand what internal communication is. Rapid change paired with poor company-wide communication leads to entropy.
bad,"Your typical day at Gamestop will be of course helping customers. You'll learn how to push reserves and membership cards and what to recommend to people looking for games or media devices. "
bad,Simple clerical/retail work. Would become incredibly hectic ahead of holidays. Hours/days would wildly fluctuate. Little to no appreciation of work done.
bad,"It was probably just my store, but I would get in trouble for trying to adhere to the companies policies, my manager would never back me with a customer and would bend the rules of the store in order to make our store look good. This was also encouraged by our District Manager, who despite outselling every other member of the store and being employee of the month 5 months in a row, our DM (district manager) would constantly over look me for promotion."
bad,"Customer Service, help customer find what they are looking for and sometimes what they are not. Sales, and running a cash till."
bad,"Opening closing the stores, dealing with customers face to face, inventory control"
bad,"My basic job consists of helping customers. That ranges from assisting them in finding what they need to handling any complaints. It is also my responsibility to keep the store looking good; alphabetizing shelves and putting merchandise where it belongs, as well as cleaning. What is extremely frustrating is that schedules aren't completed until the day before the work week starts and there usually aren't enough hours to keep the store optimally staffed so that most days we are so busy with just helping customers that we can't get to all of the extra tasks that management wants us to do. The icing on the cake is that extra hours are rewarded to the stores that complete the extra tasks instead of being given to the stores the desperately need them."
bad,"Gamestop is a nice place to go shop for video games, however as an employee you are required to have outstanding numbers of sales, reservations, etc. You are pressured to pester customers to make purchases when you are getting payed little above minimum wage if not minimum. There is very little opportunity to advance. In down time be prepared to constantly organize all the video game titles in alphabetical order, over and over again. The job tends to become repetitive."
bad,"The average day at GameStop isn't too bad, until you have to harass customers to reserve games, buy into the discount card, and purchase warranties for their games.  District managers may have been towing the line, but if you didn't meet your goals (which were often too high) they would come to your store and watch you and your employees.  Conference calls and district/regional emails that tout how terrible you and your staff must be.  Your peers, however are fantastic.  A lot of great people work for GameStop at the store level. They are the only reason people put up with most of the bad stuff as long as they do.  "
bad,"The opportunity to get paid to talk about video games and the gaming industry is a huge temptation, but don't let the face fool you. This is a hardcore, unforgiving job in sales, including expectations to repetitively pitch offers, sales, trades, and up-selling add-ons in addition to cold-calling."
bad,"Wasn't enough hours to cover sales floor and get all the tasks going. We were always on the rush and the district manager was always negative about our work. Manager was coming in on his days off working for free .No more customer service you're not helping at ebgames you're selling. Always need to push the customer to buy more, ignore them when they say no. District manager told me to go because i had another full time job and i needed to be constantly available for gamestop even if i never had more then 10hrs a week."
bad,"Terrible company that seems to not take care of their employees. Very poor hours given to each store to not only take care of customers, but to finish daily tasks that are impossible to finish because of insufficient hours, causing the store manager to come in on days off or come in early or stay very late to finish some of the tasks. Company used to just sell games, accessories and systems, but have branched out to other technology such as phones, tablets, clothing etc... Too many goals to try to hit and if you hit one goal, the company skolds manager for not hitting other goals. Company has shut down over 500 stores world wide and instead of using the money for payroll to supply store more hours, they are opening more stores. Most of the time if you shop at a GameStop, you only see one employee working especially on a Saturday or Sunday when it's busiest the most."
bad,"I have worked at Gamestop for over a year now and it has been longer than intended. The wages are horrible for the amount of work you do. This company just runs it's employees straight into the ground. The worst part is that you can be the kindest and hardest working employee, but you amount to nothing unless you push reserves and the power up rewards card unto a customer. Oh, and you only get a decent amount of hours if your numbers are good as well."
bad,"Greeting customers, finding out what they are looking for, talking about future games coming up they may be interested in."
bad,"Gamestop is a company undergoing a massive change and thus the typical day at work has gone from fun and enjoyable to difficult and demanding. I learned a great deal there about every aspect of retail management but this knowledge was never really able to be used effectively as the upper management tends to ""micro-manage"" everything. My staff was a fun and friendly group of motivated and trained sales/service people who loved interacting with customers. These interactions between staff and customers are, by far, the best part of the job. The hardest part of the job is simply balancing everything the upper managment asks, as it was not uncommon to have 10-15 extra tasks sent each day along with the normal workload. This makes the job very stressful and frustrating, as managers tend to chase these things all day and usually must work FAR over the required hours to complete them."
bad,The people there can be fun to work with but have no problem stabbing you in the back if they feel dislike for you in anyway. Management is very poor within the warehouse and the air quality is horrible! The hours are great and as long as you just do your job and ignore the rest of the mess in the warehouse it's an ok place to work. If you're looking for a stable paycheck this is the place for you. If you're looking for a career where you can love your job and have satisfaction from it look elsewhere.
bad,good job when your young but not good if you have goals but it is a good job to start at to build your resume up
bad,"I loved the product sold, the staff at my location and even most of the other management team. The district manager was horrible and the company just didn't seem to care about the employees or customers."
bad,With the wide turn of hiring and firing this employment does i soon turned un interested in this employment. They are more concerned with making a buck that they care not about the employee nor the customer half the time
bad,"If you need a job, go for it. But make sure to have a back up plan."
bad,"its a sales job. if you don't push sales, you don't keep your job. i didn't like pushing sales toward people who didn't want or need the product, so i was fired. the company as a whole is also extremely wasteful."
bad,Management is horrible and employees are always let go before you can get promoted. They let people go so they can hire new employees at mininum wage.
bad,Sometimes backroom poltics played a part of the work and made it unpleasant to work with.
bad,I don't have any comments other than the manager that hired me was a very good one. He cared about his employees and because of that we cared about the store. Businesses need more people of his character.
bad,"A typical day at work was varied, but mostly assisted helping customers purchase games and other merchandise from the store. The atmosphere is pretty laid back and relaxing but getting scheduled consistently is difficult if you're not part of management or at least a senior game adviser. "
bad,In management there was not an emphasis on work life balance. you knew you were replaceable and had to get the job done. There were many weeks as a loss prevention manager that i would have to run a store with little or no staff for over 80 hours a week
bad,"Moving up through the store was easy as long as your competent, but once manager level is reached, there are so many schedule restrictions. You are forced to work certain days that there is little scheduling flexibility. For example you must work during peak hours which tend to be weekends."
bad,"It's just retail. Retail run from a dying company. The only difference between gamestop and a clothes store or even grocery is the product being sold. Admittingly, that's what keeps the employees around. It's not the pay, it's not the benefits; the company doesn't do any of that well."
bad,"This job would have been really fun and enriching, but the extent to which your job relies on your ability to sell memberships, pre-orders, etc. is totally ludicrous. If you aren't selling enough memberships each shift you WILL be treated quite differently by management. Keep in mind these memberships are 15-30 dollars (the free ones do no contribute to your overall grading) and most of the customers you'll meet are parents buying special occasion gifts for their kids, not avid gamers coming in regularly. Also, for the actual regular customers, be careful not to be too nice to them. I had to quit b/c I got a stalker at my place of work and was told I'd be terminated if I couldn't ""handle it""."
bad,"The work environment can be quiet easy depending on the day and very chill depending on your coworkers. However awful management and little pay dont out way the stress of ignorant customers, long lines, and a power hungry manager who seems to care little about his employees."
bad,"I thought it would be nice to work in an environment that appreciated gaming. It was nice to talk with customers about games and new releases they were looking forward to. Aside from that, everything was awful. Management (or lack thereof) incentivized lying and taking advantage of customers. Your hours here were based solely on pre-orders and warranties sold; it was very inconsistent."
bad,"It can be a fun place to work if it's just for the extra scratch and not your main source of income. I was a key-holder which is basically a team leader. I do not believe that i was paid well enough for the responsibility and trust that goes with that kind of position. However, the environment can be fun for those who enjoy being around games and trying to sell games especially since the customer base happens to be more grateful  than disappointed."
bad,The managers get all the glory someone new will come take your promotion they don’t care for lower rank employees no raises you only get a raise when minimum goes up and that’s not enough to live off of I have seen someone take my promotion with Gavin less time in than me as well as less sales and then take a superiors promotion just for the heck of it and the managers don’t care employees are the only thing you tend to work for eventually just friends and discounts
bad,"Working at Gamestop is a test in humility and patience. If you're looking for a job where you have fun selling video games, I'm sorry to say that that's not what you'll get. You'll get a job where they push you and stress to you the importance of pushing products in order to hit your ""Percentages"", with absolutely no compensation for doing so other than a pat on the head and your minimum wage paycheck every two weeks. It is a soul-sucking, dying company that has already been bought in part by ThinkGeek. Do your research before you apply!"
bad,"It's a fun place to work depending heavily on your store's team and the district, both team and leader. Some districts are too numbers oriented, to the point where they push the idea that every customer is just numbers."
bad,"GameStop is very quickly running itself into the ground. Having a job around video games is fun, but this company does not care for it's employees, and frankly, for itself. There are so many inside issues with GameStop, I don't have enough space in this review to account for all of them."
bad,"More stressful than the average retail job, with small pay. Advancement is limited and doesn't pay off. Seasonal positions are the primary way in, and happen in the most hectic period."
bad,"While it can be a fun place to work with the right crew, The idea of GameStop is recurring customers, and they do this with the circle of life. and if you'er not preforming the behaviors of said circle you can be terminated after a certain number of coaching."
bad,In a day to day it was cool to know what was coming up and what was new and cool but honestly there wasn't enough pay for anyone and they didn't give us enough hours to function as a store. It became stressful to a point that I just wanted to give up most days. Really the only this I really miss are my customers and the insider knowledge we received.
bad,it's not a company that cares about the employees and upper management never supports their team leaders. The hardest part of my job was trying to get other employees to be team members. The most enjoyable part the day was doing releases. A typical day at work was that it was slow and non challenging.
bad,"Job can be pretty stressful for the store leaders and assistant store leaders, not enough pay to compensate. Tons of freebies and perks. Corporate has no idea what they're doing anymore."
bad,"The pay isn’t great, the work is menial and there are constant issues with customers that you have no control to resolve. The district leadership expects employees to work like they’re professional salespeople without paying a cent over minimum wage. It doesn’t feel like hard work is rewarded and it doesn’t feel like you are appreciated by the district leadership and above. The managers are usually decent human beings and deserve to be treated well (but usually aren’t (by the district leadership))"
bad,Loved my team at GameStop but I needed to branch off and do my thing because the company was getting too strict for a company whose stocks are plummeting
bad,"Upper management would rather you con a customer into buying a pre owned item versus a new one, even if the new one has a better deal or bundle. They are much quicker to hire a new person in a higher position than ask in their own stores about promotion."
bad,"Not enough pay offered for what you are doing."
bad,I enjoyed working there for the most part but I didn't know much and even though I'm a gamer myself not everyone knows everything about all games and shouldn't be scolded for it. I was even accused of not providing people with games in the cases even though i did and if they would have just checked security footage they would see I always made sure but no one listened to me because the gamestop i worked people who worked seasonal were treated like they were lesser than the other employee's.
bad,Gamestop does not invest in employee training. The company will fire you after one mistake without warning. Dont expect any loyalty from them if you are an veteran employee.
bad,"Gamestop can be a great place to work, however what is ""important"" varies week to week."
bad,"This job is fun at first, but it will literally take everything from you- your free time, your energy, your spirit, just everything. As a teenager or young adult, it's very fun because you are working with people your age, but your employees are teenagers and they (most of the time) don't have a good work ethic. The benefits are pretty amazing, but you have to be ASM or SM to receive them. For someone running a store/business, the pay is way too low for the amount of stress you go through. Everything falls on you. Someone calls out? You have to cover or work a double. Day was busy and couldn't do something that has a deadline? Come in on your day off to finish. A lot of the pressure has to do with management, like the RM wants everything done immediately and has completely unrealistic expectations. Once you reach SM, the next level is DM, which is incredibly hard to get, or go into corporate, which you have to move to Texas for. If you have other job options, I'd go with them instead."
bad,"I loved my job, and my position in as a key-holder. I didn't like how when we were under new management things went south with our location. I was the only African-american working in that facility, and the only thing that made me comfortable working were formal employees and customers. I loved interacting with the community, weighing in on video gaming, but I didn't like that I was a target and a threat due to my skin color."
bad,"The job itself isn't hard at all.  It's many small things that need to be managed."
bad,Good place to get   Started. Work lots of hours with little compensation. Promises broken by upper management. No real room for advancement. Only benefit was discount.
bad,"The company itself has a bad habit of micromanaging every little thing that you do. As of late, they have also been hiring management from outside, rather than promoting worthwhile candidates from within, at least in my own district. The stress of the 'Circle of Life' Program is always looming, leading to write-ups for things you can't control. Overall, the discount is good, and you will meet some great people, but the company itself is not the best if you are looking for advancement or a stress-free job."
bad,"I was so excited to work for GameStop! Who wouldn't be? Unfortunately, it wasn't that great. "
bad,GameStop now seems like a company that is lost in terms of its place in the world.  Lots of micromanaging going on as they try and scrape every last dollar from each customer to stay afloat
bad,"Working at GameStop was a lot harder than a lot of people would think since it's specialty is video games.  I've had great managers and coworkers, but I have also had really bad ones which made working there really frustrating."
bad,"It's incredibly corporate. Sure, for minimum wage you get to shoot the breeze about video games and occasionally get some sweet swag, but eventually the lack of actual benefits provided from the company start to become apparent. Hours are only guaranteed to store managers and assistant managers. All they care is about who can get numbers. Numbers, numbers, numbers. Sell, sell, sell. Push, push, push. Then you get to clean up some soda spilled on the ground and clean the crackers smooshed into the carpet by a herd of beast children. Then you get to take trades all day from people who yell in your face over the price we are giving them for their dusty, forgotten and barely functioning systems and cracked games. But hey, enjoy that sweet 15% discount on over-priced games."
bad,"I would not really recommend this job to anyone.  The job is fun if you love games, however, the pay is very low.  You will only make minimum wage and the company expects a lot of work from you.  They really push you to make sales and promote products on customers.  If your numbers are low, they keep on you about it and tell you that you have to do better with getting customers to spend more money and buy more products.  I don't like pushy salespeople and honestly I don't know who does.  You get a 15% discount as an employee and can stack that on top of your loyalty card if you have one."
bad,"Working here started out fine but then after a few months I felt my hours were getting shorter and shorter, despite me fully meeting the quotas given to me each week."
bad,"As a Sales Associate, you have to do nearly everything: greet the customer when they walk in, assess their needs and assist in their shopping experience, checkout, restock the floor, inventory, maintain an orderly appearance, clean (if you're the closing shift), etc., etc. You do all of this and are paid minimum wage and get about twenty hours per week. Oh! And be sure to clean up while the store is open because GameStop doesn't like to pay overtime. "
bad,"Don't bother unless you're working season and you're looking to advance in Game Stop. Pay is terrible, was making minimum wage. Management was okay but lied about giving raises and lied about giving me a promotion on two occasions. was working 4.5-14 hours a week. The only good thing was the benefit and even that was not great."
bad,I had a love hate relationship with game stop. I worked there for a year sometimes only 3 hours a week. The hours i would say was the worst. You cant do anything with $30 a week. Customers come and go and the expectations are there.
bad,"there are no benefits if you aren't full time, too much for barely any pay, too much pressure on metrics, not enough pressure on customer satisfaction, coworkers friendly, leadership was lacking"
bad,"Gamestop is just like any regular retail job, except you are selling video games.  You get to rent out video games as an employee, which is a good perk of working there."
bad,Constantly on the verge of losing your job over something silly. Never trust upper management when they say they would get something done. 95% of the time it does not and you pay the consequnces.
bad,"Worked for the company for many years. Company's vision of the future requires more payroll and less tasking, but unfortunately, that is the exact opposite of what is happening. There are too many responsibilities and no reward. Getting to Store Manager can be easy, but moving up after this is an butt-kissing affair."
bad,"Working here is not as you'd expect. A lot of people think working here is cool because you're working with video games but in reality, its a pain    ."
bad,"Gamestop has the kind of working environment that you would expect in a retail job, that is to say, business varies. The discounts were fair, and the workload is understandable. Take care to understand that this may not be a full-time choice for you, especially during the holiday season. Gamestop hires temps during the end of the year around November for the Black Friday and Christmas rushes. After that point in time, and the new year starts, your hours will plummet. I remember resigning after receiving a paycheck with only 8 hours recorded on it."
bad,"As a gamer it was a wonderful store to work at, my store manager was the one who taught me to be an effective employee, not just there but any job I happen to work."
bad,"All of the blood, sweat, and tears... but none of the glory. I worked with the company for 6 years and the only thing that I could say was enjoyable about that experience are the coworkers I met in my time there."
bad,"Working at Game Stop is not the best place to work unless your looking for chump change. It has bad hours and pay matches the hours they offer. You must be highly knowledgeable of the technology and upcoming games, consoles, etc. to move up in the industry. The job is very laid back and easy. Management was slightly the same as the job environment, very laid back and relaxed. In my opinion, the hardest part of the job was how to find the game dic in an unorganized work place.The most enjoyable part of the job, at the time was probably getting games and consoles at a higher discount than customers as well as being able to get certain items before customers."
bad,"The managers were unprofessional, the employees were unprofessional. The pay was minimum wage and after working there for years they trained me as a manager and only increased my pay .15 cents."
bad,The gaming industry is still very sexist and even at GameStop it is very difficult for a woman to advance. I had to fight for every raise and promotion I got but the higher I climbed up the corporate ladder the more I saw the internal politics and the less I wanted to work there. This job is a great job for high school kids or a side gig for college kids. This isn't really a place for women or people who don't want to play office politics.
bad,"The job was great back when it was Electronics Boutique (EB Games after the rebranding) but once GameStop bought them out, it all changed. Taking care of the customer went out the window and it became all about getting pre-sales deposit on games and selling magazine subscriptions"
bad,"The best thing about working for Game Stop is the product knowledge you're privy to and the opportunity to talk about something you love. The management you're under and the clientele for each particular location can definitely influence the quality of the position. The worst part of Game Stop would be the constantly fluctuating expectations. Standards seem to be set by corporate suits who know nothing about how things work in an actual store. It is a near miracle to be promoted within; company loyalty isn't adequately rewarded. More is expected from a store manager at Game Stop when compared to other companies. Payroll is a joke. If you aren't at least an assistant manager, don't expect many shifts or hours. If you are a store manager, expect to work alone a lot to make up for not having enough hours to have the appropriate number of workers to sufficiently man your store."
bad,"Endless conference calls , minimal hours for maximum work load. High turnover at all store levels. Never good job, just what else could have done to be better. No upward mobility after reaching store manager."
bad,"The company seems attractive to a lot of video game fans; why wouldn't it? You get to hang out in a store an sell a product you're passionate about, and meet some great coworkers as well as customers. Unfortunately that's where the fun ends. GameStop's company culture is one that puts the bottom dollar ahead of everything else, even customers and their own employees.   "
bad,I like the workers. Some are great and make good friends. I still go and remain a loyal customer. Just wish everyone would be valued and not mistreated for things cooperate is note doing themselves.
bad,"Responsible for training other district managers, and the development of help   Additional responsibility with ZERO additional pay. "
bad,"12 to 14 hour days with most weekends working in some capacity. "
bad,"When I first started working for this company it was simple and some what fun. However, once you get into management it gets highly stressful. Everyday there is more tasks added on to ones they gave you the day before and they want all of it done by weeks end. You have to do marketing, shipments, and merchandising with a small team and little hours. I don't mind doing all of those if I had the appropriate amount of hours to distribute among my workforce to complete them in a timely manner. Honestly, Store Managers and Assistant Store Managers do not get paid enough for all the stress and work they have to deal with and every year the company continues to add more and more tasks to be done. Those in upper management can't make up their mind on what they want and with the decisions they make I can't see this xompany lasting another 50 years."
bad,"if management isn't with you then your going to be gone soon."
bad,"Would get about 5-10 hours of work a week at best. Worked at a location that was known for high numbers, so always tried to sell lots and it made me and some customers uncomfortable."
bad,The difference on how work will be is primarily dependent on the management. There are daily supplies of inventory that comes in that has to be processed. You need to meet the daily quotas and help the customers as they arrive in the store. The staff is as good as the manager makes them but they can be the most enjoyable part of it.
bad,"Things changed constantly and there was never any stability or reliability within the staff, including assistant store manager and store manager as well."
bad,"They hired me for seasonal help, after I had submitted my resume months before. The manager admitted that he had lost my resume only to find it again months later. They constantly took hours away, or cancelled my hours at the last minute, and I was never even put into their computer system because it was constantly down"
bad,"At GameStop, you aren't just the store manager. You are a glorified cashier who typically works alone for many hours of the day. You are the customer service specialist, visual merchandiser, inventory specialist, hiring manager, custodian, amongst many other things. "
bad,"The training is horrid. Management is awful. The store isn't even sanitary for workers or customers for that matter. Everything is all over the place, it's disorganized. Things go missing all the time. It's just a place that needs to get its stuff in order. The pay is not worth it, and the hours are even worse."
bad,"Typical day would be inventory/ counts, followed by morning phone calls in-regard to payroll, and placing new product out. Learned to be a better manager and work as a team leader. Hardest part of the Job were the customers who were at times extremely unfriendly and sometimes the Management indecisive nature."
bad,"Barely gave hours to co-workers and I really can't give you a description because I barely worked there, but the environment was decent at the least."
bad,Game stop management will constantly change how the store looks and functions. During the day there will be conference calls everyday. Good work environment. Horrible management.
bad,After working hard and doing my job as told the head manager decides who he likes and who he doesn't and talks bad about them behind their back. Unfortunately I was not liked so I had to experience it in the bad.
bad,"Unless you're young, don't have any form of higher education, and have zero commitments outside of work, this isn't the job for you."
bad,This place is a joke. The stores are not maintained the upper management play favoritism and the company is on its last leg.
bad,This job was an ok job not something id be proud of much though. It's a job that was a filler job. The biggest thing here is upselling and selling used games. That is not really a game thing cause the company profits from used games while the company who made it see no money from the used game sell.
bad,"Coworkers I had were good, pay and hours were not.  Pushing things onto customers was not something I had a great deal of success with.  It was enjoyable to explain about the video games to customers, especially parents or grandparents who had no idea what they were getting into.  My manager was good, but the management above him was not."
bad,"A typical day at work would be handling customers and helping them find what they need."
bad,"Gamestop is a great place to work as a young adult, yo have discounts, and game rentals.  But as an adult, once you're hiring up on the management totem, you essentially fall victim to: Get these numbers, or you're fired."
bad,"Gamestop offers no benefits to the bottom rung employee except 15% off games. You pretty much do everything right off the bat with little training. Everything including running register, cleaning the store, interacting with customers as well as stocking. I worked maybe once a week for 5 hours and that is considered good. Customers will yell at you because they do not understand something and it will be your fault; whether it is your fault or not. I was denied a raise because I had only worked there 8 and a half months when the minimum is 9 months and had to wait until next year around the same time to get a raise. "
bad,"While it's fun to be able to work in the video game retail industry, the company overworks its managers. Store managers get paid very little with respect to the amount of work they put into their stores. The benefits are okay, but pale in comparison to most other retail companies."
bad,I thought my extensive knowledge of games and good customers services skils would be utilized at this company. What i quickly learned is that if you know something don't let it be shown.
bad,"When I first began working at GameStop, I really enjoyed my job, because I got to work with my favorite hobby. I started out as a seasonal, and eventually was promoted to a permanent employee. The job was pretty laid back after holiday. Unfortunately, during my time as an employee, I went through many management shifts that were hard to adjust to. There were so many changes constantly, and it left all my coworkers and I very confused. We were constantly left in the dark. A lot of hush hush talk, and it was frustrating. I really don't recommend anyone working for GameStop if you are a student. I got managers that never put my school schedule into consideration, and because my job, I had to miss days of school. Sometimes, I would be too tired to show up for school the next day, because I was always working the midnight releases. After being promoted to a manager, my life became so stressful. I was thrown into the position with no background training. It ultimately lead me to having anxiety and panic attacks. Our store manager, and assistant store manager never had good communication skills. GameStop made me become an outgoing person, but also gave me the most stress in my life. The amount of stress you will have to put up with, is not worth the pay."
bad,"Working for GameStop is a differing experience for many that can be broken down to a single sentence, ""What kind of person is your District Manager?"". A typical day is not very bad, but their quota system of Reservations and Subscriptions was harsh to say the least. If quotas weren't being met, you were told, in not so many words, to meet them or they would find someone who could. Long nights working off-the-clock were the norm, sometimes even having to come in on Christmas Day to finish putting up marketing or clean the store from the Christmas Eve scramble the night before. Now the same is not true for all GameStops, this has been known to happen and all depends on the people you work with."
bad,"I thoroughly enjoy my job. Meeting new people every day and helping customers with their issues is fulfilling. However, there is no room for advancement, and company policy is lacking in logic."
bad,This was a cut and dry sales job. Many people think it is all about fun playing videogames but that is not the job at all.
bad,"This has become the one gaming store in most towns, now that they have bought every other business except for the ""Mom and Pop"" stores. So, they lower the trade-in values for games so that the parents of these gamers are being ripped off and it's only going to get worse. Numbers are the focus for all employees and not customer service or taking care of their needs. I learned that I love gaming but hate what GameStop stands for. The hardest part of the job was the need to sell and pressure everyone that walks in the door, ie. Radio Shack, which I never shop in because of the pressure. The most enjoyable part was seeing the new announcements of games and helping kids find the perfect games."
bad,"Hours are hard to come"
bad,"My day consisted of counting systems and games daily. Receiving shipment in while also shipping inventory out. Providing excellent customer service."
bad,"Typical day at GameStop, starts with the manager or Manager on duty, telling you what the current sales are happening, what good things have happened and what bad things have happened, and assessing damage control to fix the bad."
bad,"Long hours, no over time. Lots of ""stolen"" property coming into store. Lot of upset parents for LOW, trade in credit for games."
bad,"The job is a challenge.It is a company that does not want you tyo have a family,as it gets in the way.GameStop is your family,you live for them,everything you do is for them at all times.I work very hard to prove myself and am proud of the work I do.I enjoy the amount of co workers I have recruited and have been promoted to store  managers."
bad,"A typical day at Gamestop consisted of checking in a lot of boxes, helping customers, processing trades and shipments, and organizing the store. Most of the customers were actually pretty cool, others, not so much. Management was okay there, at the store level. The District Manager had a power complex since he was new to it all. Never met the Regional Director, but anytime the big dogs were in town they liked to intimidate every employee in the district to the point where we were all afraid if everything wasn't perfect, that would be the end of our job. The pay at Gamestop is just pathetic if you're not at the Store Manager level. Even as Assistant Store Manager, I hardly made enough to live on, especially for the amount of stuff they expect from you. Gamestop started getting a little ridiculous with how much they want us to pressure customers into stuff. Most of the time, at the management of the store level, you spend most of your shift alone, as they hardly give any hours. Then they expect you to greet every customer on the floor, hand them a flyer and discuss the value of buying pre-owned. Then anytime the customer is checking out, tell them about the big titles coming out and try to get them to reserve it. After that, try to get the customer to purchase a powerup rewards card. If they're buying anything new, try to get them to buy pre-owned. At the end of the transaction tell the customer to bring in all of their old stuff to trade in and hand them a big empty bag and say to fill it up and bring it back full of stuff to trade. By this point, the customers just wanted to"
bad,"A typical day as a SM at GameStop can be slightly unpredictable. Most days that you work you typically work six and half to seven hours by yourself without a break (because the payroll that they give to stores is rarely enough to meet the store's needs). During this time you will be expected to run your business 100% as if you aren't by yourself. You will have to assist every customer yourself and answer the telephone while also doing the all of operational tasks. The operational tasks usually consists of daily inventory counts of all hardware (consoles new/used, tablets new/used, and smart phones), inventory counts of the top 25 hot titles that are commonly lost or stolen, title on hand reports (which requires you to scan an entire software section(s) to verify correct pricing and to make sure all product is represented), and checking in/processing shipments. On top of that you are also required to do inventory counts for three to four assigned sections per week and ship out large quantities of over stock product to other stores who ""need"" it. This process is widely viewed company wide as unnecessary because the products that you typically ship to other stores ends up getting a shipped back to you within a couple weeks and sometimes that week. It is also common to have random projects with short deadlines thrown at you mid-week without warning. "
bad,"The only thing good about this job, was that I was able to work with some incredible people. The company has no idea how to take care of employees though. The thing that makes this so, is that because Gamestop has such a following of people who think the job is about playing games all day, they have a lot of people who apply. So the company has no incentive to keep you working, especially when they can walk outside and pick up anyone to replace you."
bad,"Gamestop is by far one of the worst places to work. Game Advisors are paid minimun wage to be the Cashier, Sales Floor Rep, Customer Service and Janitor. At the same time you must also hit percentage marks each week or you are fired. As for management I got lucky and had very nice people. I would never recommend anyone to work for a terrible business."
bad,"I worked at GameStop in their hay days.  It was great I sold games, took reservation and sold discount cards.  I never  had to be pushy about it and my store was profitable. Some time in about 2004 they went crazy. They had an annual manager conference where they flew all the store managers down to L.A. it was kind of like a mini E3.  Well I noticed that just before these conferences they would fire 2-5 managers in my district and hire new Managers. When the conference was over and pay them dirt. Regular employees almost never got fired, they go threw management like candy though. Around the same time trade in values dropped and the 7 day return policy vanished.  Almost everything that made the company great went away to pad the corp pockets. The job itself was fun and customer base was always a blast. I'm surprised they are still in business I went to trade in a brand new game the other day. I paid 60 for it when it came a week ago.  They'll give me 18 for it today."
bad,"To be blunt, GameStop is not a friendly place to work. You will find yourself constantly being asked to give your best and then some without much to show for it."
bad,"I worked at gamestop for about 14 months. I personally enjoyed the job, I had a good store manager and a good district manager and had made a few friends at the other gamestops. I left due to me having no time with my family. The job is easy and good if you are willing to work on very short notice. "
bad,"This job was simple, but also forced the employees to blatantly ask customers to spend their money. GameStop's revenue tactics are invasive. I can imagine the only person that loves this job would be the person who has no problem harassing people every day. Employees are rated by how many reserves they get each given week, this forces them to compete with each other as well as try their hardest to convince customers that they want to buy a game that they're not interested in. It isn't hard to notice that most customers hate going into the store, and most go in for easy trade-in cash, that's only if it were easy to begin with. The trade-in value for each game is so low that someone would be practically giving away their property to the store. This gives root to bad employee morale as well as forced customer service and an over-all disdainful customer-base. "
bad,"The job was filled with employees that were out to make one another fail. It made no sense what they were doing and if i wasnt a fast learner id of never been able to take advantage of the format of game stop, I say all this cause i worked at three different stores as i was floated around as a 3rd key for a year or so."
bad,"Awesome place to work if you like video games, but like making little money. I was a supervisor and shift leader, but made little of minimum wage."
bad,At Gamestop multitasking is key. From the moment you walk in until the moment you leave you are moving sometimes juggling 7 tasks on your own at once. Fun enviroment engaging in Conversations with customers and co-workers.
bad,GameStop is a fine company to work for if you don't mind the low wage and almost non existent hours.
bad,"I open and close stores, I train new employees and I manage and run the operations of the daily activity that a manager must oversee. I handle all customer complaints and oversee merchandise and shrinkage. I love challenges and I love learning new skills and using what I have learned to improve myself and the company I am working for."
bad,"Absolutely the worse place I have ever worked, I was blackmailed, constantly put to work for sometime 62 hours a week with only pay off 12 of the hours, very late work hours of upwards to 3 in the morning. This job entails lots and lots and tedious task with very little staff to properly handle all of it nor with the hours for it either. There's still 10,000 dollars I haven't been paid for. I could go on for days about the wrong doings and shadiness of this company."
bad,"It was fun in the beginning. It's a lot of information you have to learn, but it comes easily. As a GA you do a lot of the grunt work like alphabetizing the walls, fixing displays, pretty much doing everything the manangers don't want to do. You have to pester customers constantly about reserving upsoming games and signing up for membership cards. It's a sales job and you have to keep up your numbers or you'll be canned. Honestly it's a fun place especially if you like being around games all day."
bad,"The people and my co-worers where awsome. I had a great time with them. However, the company itself is another story. The people in higher managment, treat the employees like dirt. They look for reasons to fire you, or lay you off. From my exsperiance, the people who work in the stores are friendly, and cool people. The upper managment... I have nothing nice to say. I work for them for 2 years, and the manager for my districted got my whole store fired or laid off. Why? Good question. We were number 1 in sales in the districte. Nothing made any common sense."
bad,"I enjoyed talking about video games to the guests in the store. Constantly under pressure to achieve goals, PUR cards, Reserves, PRPs GPGs and Tech Trades. The company pushes the employees to sell sell sell. As long as you are doing well in the “Key Performance Indicators” you will be fine."
bad,"You will not be promoted in many cases even if you work hard they will never pay you a decent wage for the work you do , do not work here unless you just want to be in a gaming environment"
bad,"This job was by far the funniest job I’ve ever had, but unfortunately management isn’t the best and the stores aren’t always run the best. But I would say if you’re really passionate about video games and talking about them all day, this is the job for you."
bad,"Enjoyed interacting with customers, as they shared many of my interests, but not much else was positive about it. Coworkers were distant, had to frequently request schedule, mediocre pay."
bad,"A typical workday is mundane and easy: You clock in, set a goal for warranties and memberships to sell, and help people find what they're looking for. You meet a lot of people who love video games, and it's easy to make friends with your coworkers. They're probably the best part about working here. The pay is abysmal at minimum wage with almost no benefits unless you're management. There are not a lot of opportunities to move up unless you stay there long enough. Can't recommend working here"
bad,Great job when you're a gamer and turned 18. I got paid 7.50 per hour so that was an terrible wage. You get weird customers coming in doing trade-ins. There are company policy that do not agree with. I became a third keyholder when I quit the job.
bad,This job is good for temporary employment. Holiday/seasonal employment and teens are the best type of employees they look for due to high stress and lack of longevity in employment.
bad,"I was lucky, had a great store leader and a great team. I loved my job. The pay was not worth it, and there was a lot of stress over numbers, but my team and the fact that i got to match people with games and merchandise they liked was amazing. There's a lot more to it than you'd think if you get to be SGA or higher though and if your team isn't completely in sync and getting along, it can be horrible. Plus, the company as a whole has been through multiple CEOs lately,made a lot of false promises to employees, and closing stores left and right. I can't recommend this place for anything more than a temporary job. District leader told us our store was closing with about 11 days notice, didnt tell us til after the store was packed up and shipped out that we didnt have jobs. Promised to give us letters of recommendation for our future endeavors, as well as told us to keep in touch so we could be considered for any openings in the district. Then never answered emails or texts again, and we found out by calling corporate that gamestop doesnt do letters of recommendation. She could have told us herself. She could have answered at least one politely professionally worded email or text. But no. We did get fair severance pay."
bad,"I worked at Gamestop for over a year; being the top store in my district with sales over the course of the 5 sale quarters I worked, "
bad,"Gamestop isn’t a bad company to work for if you have two jobs or if this is your first job.  Retail experience is extremely valuable and there is a lot of upward mobility to manager with the company. The in store culture is definitely better and more welcoming than the company culture and many managers, such as myself, take customer service and our Prestige ratings very seriously. The unfortunate reality is that we don’t get paid enough. Simple as that."
bad,"GameStop may be one of my favorite places to work probably because I'm an avid gamer myself. I get along with all of my coworkers, and most customers are nice and just as enthusiastic about gaming as we are. However, as a company that pays bare minimum wage, it's not an ideal job. Hours are given to stores that perform well and if they don't, they cut hours, which happens often, leaving employees with even fewer hour to work. Sometimes a workday is only 2.5 hour long. You may not do much, but $7.25 an hour is laughable. The environment surrounding the disdain for GameStop when it comes to it's practices and the hourly wage from both customers and employees makes it painfully obvious that GameStop needs to make drastic changes in the years to come."
bad,"The best part about Gamestop is the discount and coworkers. Everything else is pretty disappointing. Gamestop is all about your sales numbers, Loyalty cards and attachment rates, but does not offer commission. It is not worth the stress for the pay rate you are offered."
bad,"entry level positions: horrible hours (average shift is 3hrs)"
bad,"If you are a parent working for gamestop, it is hard to find that work/life balance. Also, it is hard to be in school and be anything other than a GA. SGA is supposed to be part time hours but you are given almost a full 40 hour work week. Many of the SL, store leaders, are incompetent and the ASL ends up doing all the work without the recognition or pay. This is a great job for anyone who is in high school just trying to earn a few bucks here and there but to try and make this a life choice will only bring you despair. Gamestop is not all fun and games like most people think. After doing research on salaries in my area, I have seen that an associate who can cut a pizza for little ceasers makes almost as much as an assistant manager for gamestop. That is insane and uncalled for."
bad,"The store I worked at received heavy customer traffic and was packed from open to close. I was on my feet nonstop. Overall, the work experience was enjoyable and I was able to hone my interpersonal/ communication skills."
bad,this place can suck the soul out of you and you get no where fast. the pay sucks unless your a teen then this can be a cool job for about a year tops. don't work there don't buy for there.
bad,"Selling video games is a awesome passion to be behind, but many people do not understand them. People either know what or beat around bush asking many or the same question, because they are buying for a child. Over the time i have spent shopping in the store, it is mostly very relaxed."
bad,I do enjoy my job because and I do providing good genuine customer service but when a company over looks you for so long and doesn't appreciate your hard work one can only take so much
bad,"GameStop can be a great place to work for, but only for the right type of person.  You need to have a very strong work ethic, but be sure to have some very thick skin."
bad,"In store it’s not so bad, but with the upper management that’s when it seems to be untrustworthy and unreliable. Company goals are always unrealistic."
bad,"Dealing with guests and employees is great, but the company is panicking over the future and makes bizarre marketing and business decisions on a regular basis that show a clear lack in leaderships ability to understand the market and its trends, which in turn makes for a stressful and sometimes down right hostile work-life. Pay is low, very low in comparison to other retailers and unless you are a manager the hours available are terrible."
bad,"I worked with this company as a seasonal position and worked only 2 or 3 days a week. Being female was never an issue with co workers. However, the customers were not always as welcoming. Questioning game knowledge, making comments about how a ""girl doesn't know anything about this type of game"". Gaming for years and having every console isn't enough. It was always a pleasure proving them wrong though."
bad,"A typical work day is doing inbound shipment, merchandising. Overworked and under paid.  High stress. Fun co-workers. What I have learned is you are expandable."
bad,"It's a very easy job, but you're pay is going to be very low and there will be a lot of dead period where you don't get enough hours to compensate.Gamestop likes to promote this ""family"" setting within the company as they will even call it the ""gamestop family"" but the reality of the situation is you are very replaceable and they won't hesitate to leave you out in the cold if they ever decide to. Generally, Gamestop doesn't fire people. Instead, they starve them of hours to that your paycheck ends up looking like the cruelest joke. They'd prefer you quit because that way they don't have to give you unemployment. I'd imagine this is a common practice in most retail, though."
bad,"Well, it would often be boring with long downtimes, and the only time it was really exciting was Black Friday. I honestly didn't learn anything that I already didn't know about video games or anything of the such in general. Management was lazy and had rampant nepotism. Everyone was a little anti social besides one or two folks, and sometimes the register system would freeze up on you. It would be fun to talk to the customers who would come in the store, though."
bad,Worked there for 3 years only reason i left was because my store closed and the people i worked with all left. we all agreed including the then district manager that the company sucks your life away.
bad,"It isn't all bad working at Gamestop if it is your first job or you are just looking for something on the side. The upper management will dangle promotions in front of your face and promise you things that they will most of the time never do. I was told i was going to get my own store soon for 2 years just to watch 2 different store leaders get transferred in instead. While i will say one of them was fantastic and an absolute blast to work with the other one never really did his job and i had to pick up after him and it made everything really stressful. Which is another thing it does get extremely stressful around the holidays. You have to do at least 7 different store setups in the span of about 5 weeks and anywhere from 500-700 price changes a week from the end of November up until Christmas eve.Every other Sunday we had a marketing kit to setup as well as our RSB shipments and our category counts, defective counts, title on hand, and perpetual count.A lot of the big releases would get midnight launches or in the case of the last year or so early launches of either 9pm or 11pm. It was fun getting paid to talk about my passion of gaming and turning people on to games they never would have thought of trying out. I built a lot of good friendships there and i am little sad that i wont get to have conversations with some of those people as often as i used to. But I needed a change."
bad,"Hassling and shoving product down customers' throats is a bad way to run a business. I can hardly have a decent conversation with a customer because I have XYZ and every color under the rainbow of questions I have to ask them. ""Do you want this for $15? No? How about this for $30? This for $3? I'm sure you want this for $5.... Yes, our chip reader works."""
bad,"The corporate office at this company has no idea how to run a retail store. My store does $3 million a year in business, and yet corporate hardly gives us enough hours to fill our hours of operation during the week. We are a high-volume store with hundreds of customers, and corporate management is not willing to invest in the labor necessary to keep this store running smoothly. That , combined with the fact that the starting wage is only $7.25, when the corporate office wants every employee to function as a salesman, a call center employee, and to ship out products as if they're coming from the warehouse, makes this company difficult to work for. The company would do well to remember that the people in the storefronts are the ones bringing in any profit, and to treat them as if they matter."
bad,even though i enjoyed my job at gamestop during the begining there is always a threat of losing your job if you dont sell as much as corp wants you to. then on top of trying to do that they expect you do the job of three people and your always behind but wont give the store enough hours to make it simpler. but then they pay you so low no one cares to do there job.
bad,"I tell people, if you want an interesting first time job that this is an OK place to start. But it was always Corporate GameStop vs. Employees. Hours were awful. Some people are lucky to get 4 hours a week (not even high school students). Most of my managers seemed to care about their employee's, but after a while everyone seemed jaded."
bad,"more quality people should be hired, also the managers should be screened better, and rewards should be give out to people who have higher performance in the store"
bad,Gamestop is quite a great place to work. Im personally a gamer so I was able to learn and talk to like minded people. But upper management gave out tasks and goals that dont concide with todays market and punishes us for lack of results. The amount of work given compared to pay is very unbalanced.
bad,"Check customers out, Stock shelves, Help customers with any questions or concerns they may have, Clean work space and environment to company standards."
bad,"I know a lot of people look at gamestop as an ideal job, especially if you're a gamer. Don't do it. The pay is bare minimum. Shoot, even as a store manager you're only going to be making like $12 a hour. Depending on how big your staffing is, your hours will suffer. It's great as a part-time job if you're in school or something but outside of that, just no."
bad,"You'll spend your days trying to get customers to buy things they don't want or need. Your value as an employ is based on the number of add ons you can fit into one transaction (pro-orders, subscriptions, accessories, etc.) This becomes very forced during the holiday season."
bad,"This job rerquires long hours of standing with low pay, & bad benefits if i say so. Management does not care for their employees and pressure associate to meet quotas that are hard to reach in the store location area"
bad,There is very little reward and unrealistic expectations with this company.  With the gaming going digital it growing harder for Gamestop to stay relevant in the gaming retail space. The benefits were not very good.
bad,"GameStop Corporate is all about the money. Its all they care about. You ask them for some help or a little bit of leeway with all the stupid stuff they make you do, and they come back with ""sales are important"" ""we need the sales."" The only reason I still work there is because my store has the BEST employees to work with. No one is selfish, and we all work together. You have to meet strict quotas and numbers every day, week, and month. To reward you if you do good, you dont get any bonuses, they cancelled them without notifying anyone, you get a pizza party. How lovely! Instead of getting a good reward of a nice bonus for all the hard work and stuff you put up with, that most employees from most stores were expecting and in need of, we get food. Isnt that nice of them? Again Corporate is all about the money. I do have a lot of fun with my coworkers, and the job can be a great learning experience. If you find a good store to work at then its up to you to see if you can handle the stuff CEOs throw at you."
bad,I enjoyed my time at Gamestop and customer interaction was always fun but with higher ups constantly nagging us about things that couldn't have gotten completed things like quotas not being met they would resort to fear tactics (ex. layoffs) to try and get numbers up instead of helping staff personally.
bad,"la posizione di stagista ricopre un ruolo molto faticoso, in quanto, impiegato negli orari di maggiore affluenza; stipendi di 3,00 € ad ora circa; nessuna pausa caffè; si lavora anche nei festivi  e feriali senza una maggiore retribuzione."
bad,"Just look up the whole GameStop ""Cycle of Life"" business practice controversy.  You'll understand.  There's quotas on selling used games and taking in trades that get higher as you sell new games and consoles.  Any month with multiple popular new game releases will actually start to put your store IN THE RED because each new game sold costs the company more money than they earn.  So, you're pressured to sell more used games, which doesn't seem too bad at first, but when your store starts to suffer because of new game releases leading to less used games sold, your manager gets stressed.  Your manager gets stressed, you get stressed."
bad,Typical day at work just selling games to costumers and explaining what they are purchasing. Hardest part is to find something to do. Management was awful.
bad,Not a place anyone should work. At a store level I absolutely loved my crew. Both of my bosses were fantastic. We are all still friends to this day. Yet once you get to a corporate level (district manager) and higher. They are all pathetic excuses for managers. GameStop only cares about money and nothing about their employees.
bad,"Job Work/Life Balance:"
bad,"Alphabetize game cases on shelves, process trades and returns, sell games and game accessories to customers and provide customer service."
bad,This is a fun job! The pay is not the greatest. I do wish there were more room to advance but hours and positions are very limited.
bad,"The work is not the problem, its very doable and very simple. The problem is the mental stress you get put through by upper management on a district and regional level. To push sales, and up selling to customer product that they do not need or would not want with your job suggested on the line at all times. As well as the bad scheduling hours giving to stores store to run with a skeleton crew resulting a fair amount of theft (depending on your stores location)."
bad,Company changing quickly but leaving core business behind and only go through the motions of recognizing performance anymore.  They look negatively on those who built the company and have been around for years.
bad,Gamestop can either be a great place to work or a terrible place due to management. My advice for anybody working there is to be aware of the what situation the store is in and don't be afraid to speak up if you feel something is wrong otherwise cause you might make the difference between everybody keeping their jobs.
bad,"I fixed Xbox 360 game consoles and, just when I was comfortable with that, they switched me to PS2 consoles, which are totally different.  My life became very stressful and work was difficult.  The pay was okay."
bad,"Fast paced pawn shop environment. The company expects outstanding customer service every time, and to reach upwards of 50% goals and attach rate each day, 20% minimum. Not reaching goals consistently will result in coaching, or a cut in hours. Staff, management, and upper management can be a revolving door between stores in the area, which leads to quick promotions and turnaround."
bad,"Typical work day as any employee begins with placing product on the shelves.  This task includes labeling and pricing of products, and organizing a wall of games/products.  The largest part of the work load comes from putting Trade Hold items into the normal stock.  This task is the most strenuous and tedious task, as it involves labeling/pricing of the Trade Hold items, and then the added task of trying to make room for the items in the already overflowing storage spaces.  Fielding phone calls from customers is a constant interruption to tasks because most of the time the Manager is too busy to answer the phone themselves, unless they are the only person there (which happens a lot).  Breaks were an off chance occurrence, and most people were lucky to get one; especially if you are a part-time employee.  Management can be fun, and comes with some rewards for store performance, and every employee gets a 20% discount.  The most enjoyable portion of the job is working with people that typically have a love for games, and are willing to share stories and experiences with anyone.  Customers too are generally gamers and love to share their experiences with the staff."
bad,"I'm not here to bad mouth the company, because honestly, I enjoyed my job. It's mostly a fun and enjoyable/ laid back work environment. They shower you in free video games if you're in upper management and set up guidelines to make your job easier. On the other hand, after 8 years of working for the company I was let go so that the company could keep my district manager that was forced to step down and lived in my area. I will never say that I hated my job because I didn't. I was just blind sided by two district managers and our regional one day to tell me that my work was no longer needed."
bad,"Work was generally the same, and was not demanding or stressful by any means. I learned that sometimes no matter how hard you work or how many times you come in early and give it your all; sometimes you just can't better your situation. It was a seasonal position where I was promised a position after Christmas, however people that left before me wanted their jobs back, and I was removed from the schedule. After showing up 3 weeks in a row to see me not on the schedule, I tried contacting the store manger and the owner. I even left messages with my coworkers and the assistant manager, and I never was able to get anywhere. My calls to the manager always went to voicemail, and I never heard back. One month later I was sent a letter saying that my services were no longer needed and that my employment contract was terminated to no fault of my own. Great people, easy job, horrible management, and a dead end in terms of advancement opportunities."
bad,"Zero room for advancement. Corporate is out of touch and rules with an iron fist. Customer relations at my particular store were great, though."
bad,"Most days opened easily enough, with light traffic on days when nothing new was released. Processing shipments was never difficult once you knew how to staff your store. I learned how to be a leader not through training by the company, but rather a series of trial and error along with learning from mistakes. "
bad,"I learned a good deal about business and profitability while working at Gamestop and I also learned how to manage people as well. For this, I am thankful! My co-workers could be hit or miss. Many people that work there are very young and many are not motivated so it can be difficult to mold them into an effective employee sometimes. I found the hardest part of the job to be the overly aggressive stance the company would take on selling specific products and attaining certain goals. The most enjoyable part of my experience would always definitely be when I was able to legitimately help people and help make someone's day in some way."
bad,"I didn't dislike working here, although the actual business model seemed pretty skeezy. Lets buy this stack of games, give this guy ten cents for most of them and sell them for ten bucks. Or when people would come in with games that they had obviously stolen, which came out the day before, we would have to take them because of management. But the people were nice, and customers were passionate. Not bad for middle men."
bad,unless you hate yourself and self loathing is what you want to be apart of your immediate country then do not work here...ever....this company hates itself and it hates you even more.
bad,At first I loved being a manager at Game Stop. Then they started scheduling me every single weekend for two months straight and weekends are the only times that I would be able to spend time with my husband since he is in the Marine Corps. Then I worked 2 weeks straight with no days off and when I brought this up to the store manager she didn't care at all. As much as I loved the job it simply burnt me out and I ended up having to quit.
bad,"This job used to be fun, I would look forward to going into work to talk about games.  But as the years went on, it become less about the games and the relationships you would cultivate with your customers, and more about the bottom line and how you could get more and more money out of our customers. "
bad,Was the fastest driver they had and everyday it was drama like back in high school
bad,"I love my job working for Gamestop. When I started I really thought I could make this into a career. As the years went the culture changed as well as what was demanded from the store managers. What was required of us was basically to work 50-60 hours and most of them being alone do to the lack of hours the would give the individual stores. A normal shift consisted of inventory counts, process shipment, inventory scans, price verification of products, sending out shipment, executing marketing initiatives, cleaning, customer calls, marketing the brand outside the store and of course maintaining the highest customer service levels. I am no stranger to hard work but then they would also surprise you with meetings, midnight launches, job fairs, helping other stores and inventories which all had to be weaved into the schedule with no extra hours or help."
bad,"During my three years at GameStop I witnessed that the company puts very demanding quotas on its employees with no payoff. The only incentive for completing said quotas was that you would be allowed to keep your job. The company demands that you treat your quotas as if you were making commission, For example, I was literally told to imagine that I was making commission by the regional manager and work as if I was making that commission. GameStop also has an extraordinarily high turnover rate. I would estimate that the average amount of time an employee stayed with the company was roughly three months. One of the only positive aspects of the company is that you get to work with people with similar interests as you. However, minimum wage compensation as well as demanding sales quotas with no commission makes this a poor place to work. I would not recommend this job to others."
bad,"Company is constantly pushing sales & reserves"
bad,"I liked my job and what it was about, but the lack of hours they give to the stores always made my have to work a minimum of 50 to 55 hours a week, sometimes 60 and I only get paid for 45. The hours they give out don't mach the amount of work that needs to be done so your always under staff. "
bad,A typical day at work is talking with customers and convincing them to buy a membership with their video games.
bad,Hours include sorting and shelving inventory while assisting customers on the sales floor.
bad,Want a lot for a little. Learned that customers should be pressured into buying what they don't want. Management was respectful and in the same boat. My team was fun and was a big part of enduring employment for this company. The hardest part of the job was list of scripted conversations you had to have in different frames. Most enjoyable part of the job was that it centered around video games.
bad,"The job, depending on management or otherwise, involves alphabetising and maintaining a clean store. Now personally, I did not find this troublesome, but children and customers in general tend to destroy your store in a matter of seconds, be prepared to be constantly on the move. You, regardless of position are pressured constantly to acquire numbers, which as an employee myself, I gained no credit for and was instead given to my manager, who yielded no such results...on the assumption that they had taught me so well and were constantly helping out...which was not the case. The environment can be wonderfully exciting when getting frequent customers who are fun and sociable gamers, but for the most part, people will come in with stolen goods, and criticize you for offering so low for a product they brought in only just yesterday and said the same thing..."
bad,"The Store Manager is a thankless position within GameStop. Stores are not given the proper tools by corporate (VP's, RM, DM) to run the location. Tasks are piled on while hours remain at the state minimum. Employees are alone in the store for a whole shift sometimes. And most locations have high customer traffic due to trade ins. Many Store Managers are blinded by free games to realize they are being taken advantage of. "
bad,"If you are looking for hours or growth, this is not the company. All they want you to do is get people to reserve games and subscribe to the GAME INFORMER magazine. And even if you do this the manger will not promote you in fear of his job. Sad : ("
bad,"Where to start? I've been with the company for over three years and the pay does not compensate for the workload. The benefits are great (401K, dental, vision and medical). Store managers do not get holiday pay. Bonus' are pathetic. You have to balance working the registers, managing and training your staff is constant, making schedules dealing with customers, keeping up with ungodly amounts of paperwork, sending and receiving shipments, counting certain categories every day in the store, 30 minute lunch breaks, marketing and planogram set ups, and you may do all of this in one day alone. They are skimpy on the payroll and (at least in my staff) severely underpaid, my assistant, senior game advisors and game advisors. The constant annoyance of selling the Power Up Card which is a $15 membership card and if you do not meet or exceed selling those in a day you can bet your butt your distract manager will be making calls or stopping in to figure out the ""problem."" Also, selling reservations on upcoming games and trying to get people to put $5 down on a game. At this point, it doesn't even feel like I'm selling the games but selling membership cards and reserves. Stay away."
bad,"The constant pressure of selling pre-orders and gameinformer subscriptions is sometimes overwhelming, constant change of stock in store makes it difficult to keep track of what is and isnt available. VERY busy environment, management expectations was too much for the pay recieved."
bad,"Gamestop was a relaxed job where you just stand around and get work done. Either organizing game cases on the shelves or helping customers with purchaces. I learned closing procedures, opening, performing under quota based work days and seasonal shopping rush. Co workers were a very laid back group some more uptight then others but overall a nice group of people to work with. Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to take games home and play them to learn merchandise knowledge. The hardest part was not knowing if we were going to get hours to work the following week."
bad,"In the trenches of the work, the lower tier of the company, many are under compensated while being over worked. There too many executives and not enough non-execs. Benefits are decent, health, dental, and vision. But compensation i feel is a bit on the low end. They seem to forget about you until something goes wrong, then they wonder why you let it happen when you don't control the process. There is no organization, and when someone is let go or moves on, the entire position is handed to 1 person instead of distributed."
bad,This is your standard teen job.
bad,50+ Work weeks are an expectation for a store manager no OT they take full advantage of there salaried employees.
bad,"Game Stop is a decent company to work for. Do not look for this job if you want to work a 40 hour week. The hours are always low for the stores (70-90 hours given to most stores). The expectations of the work load are insane from doing 10-20 boxes of shipment a day to working Sundays from 10-9pm without any real break away from work. The company would get mad at you for not following their own policies on returns or trade ins, but when you do not break their own policies, they still get mad at you for not helping the customer fully. They are unclear on how their own policies are."
bad,"This is a company that changes the goal posts constantly."
bad,"To put simply, i believe not even some of the managers like working there, i could see the pain on their faces. Also i dislike how the company would take hours of people and now we could not work because we have no hours."
bad,"Typical Day"
bad,"If you're working the store front, it can be a good or bad thing. If you're store manager is bad, you're going to have a bad time, but if they are good then prepare for fun."
bad,"This is a much more high pressure job than one would think upon applying. The job culture is weak and one feels as if they are no more important than the products they are selling. Management cares more about the sales report and numbers than the happiness of their employees. Rather than focus on providing good customer service, employees are trained to treat customers like opponents in a basketball game."
bad,"Gamestop is a ok first job as itll teach you to work with others and able to work alone towards goals, there is room to move up most of the time. You do get to learn to be a sales person, merchandise and receiving at this job level. But job security is sometimes questionable and depending on your higher ups based on there goals they may have you try to sale things down customers throat. Also the company is not well connected to its customer base and is always trying new ideas that at the store level seems dumb and a waste of time. But the customers can make and break your time there. You can get a really good client base that are fun to talk to and engage."
bad,"I was hired for a position higher than what I applied for. I made it extremely clear that I had no management or gaming console experience, but was only trained for less than a week before I was left on my own to close. I was set up to fail by a lack to training and then given the choice of stepping down and taking a pay and hours cut to continue training, or quitting (fired). Once I stepped down, my hours were cut so drastically  that I can't even be properly  trained. The atmosphere  is great, but even McDonald's  pays more. Thankfully  this was only a job to gain experience  and  I wasn't  living off it, or I would have been  screwed."
bad,Good place to work if you're starting off as a first job high school college you need flexible work hours however after the holidays if you're not an assistant manager or something like that your hours will be cut dramatically. No room for advancement at poor pay
bad,"Definitely would not recommend working here, especially if you need to pay rent and bills. You will never have enough money to afford those and groceries, which are kind of needed. Unless you still live with your parents, definitely look elsewhere for work."
bad,"Gamestop is the place to work if you are skilled at talking with people and love video games.  It can be a great place to interact with other people who share your passion.  The main downside is that the company will never pay you more than what is minimum required by law.  Some cities have minimum wage laws that give you a fair wage for your work but many do not.  Gamestop will only ever pay the federal minimum which is not enough to live off of.  If you do not have a lot of expenses, then I would recommend Gamestop as employment for gamers.  If you have real bills to pay or a family to support, do not work here."
bad,"This was a nice job, but there are a lot of issues within the company. My store by itself was very nice. My manager was friendly, fair, a good leader and I got along with all of my peers. Heck, even my district leader was experienced and nice. Beyond that, there isn't too much to say in the way of positive experiences. Corporate seems to be out of touch with their brick and mortar stores as well as with their customers. Corporate has too many stores open and because of that can't afford to pay people enough to keep them. I'm not ashamed to admit that I was making $9/hr in the Philly area. $9/hr definitely isn't enough to pay someone for all the work you have to do. My typical workload was: key holding, in/out shipments (from our warehouse, other stores, people ordering things online, etc), processing transactions and trades, organizing/cleaning the store, doing inventory counts. It's not abnormal to do all of those within an 8-hour shift. The work wasn't stressful necessarily, but I was also in a very slow store. If I was anywhere close to Philly like the other stores I would lose my mind trying to juggle fresh employees while dealing with customer theft and somehow finishing task AND meeting ridiculous metrics. The metrics are obtainable but don't make the company money, it just forces people to sell cards/warranties and that's how we get that negative public image. "
bad,"Hier findet man Freundschaften fürs Leben bei Kollegen und Kunden."
bad,"Went from being told everyday how awesome of an employee I was, only to not be kept on because the assistant manager wanted to keep on her good friend who was also employed, and another coworker because she was a female(not to mention they were coincidentally the only ones given register training before the last week of the season). Was told on my last day “I wanted to keep you on but just didn’t have the openings” and “You’ll be my first choice of returning seasonals for the summer season” which would infer to most people that there was more than just you not being kept on, fast forward 2 months I find out from a buddy who still worked there that I was the only seasonal not kept on. Had ZERO issue not being retained. Have a massive issue with being lied to and led on about my performance and retaining status."
bad,"I reported to five different directors in less than 10 months. The entire place is a career graveyard. Directors and up have a boys club, that needs to be broken up and someone really needs to take the reigns. They need someone with vision, not just someone to recreate the magic GME saw when game buybacks were a thing."
bad,my Store manager and assistant manager were fantastic. upper management was terrible. wrongfully fired 2 store managers who had been working there for years and were arguably the only good thing about their stores. This company is unbelievably competitive when it comes to sales. if someone beats you out in sales/preorders for reasons that are complexly out of your control you lose hours and they may bring you to about 10 hours or less of work a week. my suggestion to the company; Ditch circle of life and start being customer oriented again vs numbers oriented before your business tanks with the digital era. also pay your employees more? i worked there over 3 years without a raise.
bad,"Vengono costantemente controllate le tue vendite e il fatturato che procuri all’azienda. Se non rispetti determinate soglie di fatturato rischi che il tuo contratto non venga rinnovato. Inoltre l’azienda fa in modo di rendere il lavoro competitivo anche tra colleghi, minandone quindi il rapporto umano e lavorativo."
bad,I loved working with the customers but everything else about the corporate atmosphere at Gamestop behind the scenes is horrible. I would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"I love the industry. Video games have always been a positive way to connect with new people. As far the job, it was stressful. My team was filled of 8 people. Typically, the 4 managers would work based on our bare minimum payroll. Many would agree that we were overworked and underpaid for our work load."
bad,"don't do it haha. they are probably going to go under in the next 5. Stores keep closing and management is getting more and more strict about every thing you do. Get those pre-orders, sell those cards. Don't. unless you want 3 hours a week to work on minimum wage"
bad,Its okay but everyone is only focused on themselves so you have to stick up for yourself or get thrown under the bus. Would not suggest it to people looking for a long term company
bad,I really enjoyed my time at Gamestop until recently. All my previous bosses were amazing and we got along great. My newest manager has made me hate the job. Nit picks a lot of things that definitely do not matter. And just recently I caught him lying directly to me.
bad,I would not say that this place would be a great place to make a career unless you enjoyed being to forced to sell services and goods that people don't need and have your job threatened in you don't meet the sales goals.  All this with our extra incentives or commissions for selling the services or products.
bad,I work about 3 days in total around thanks giving and then was completely taken off of the schedule. I assumed I got laid off and then Christmas Eve I get a call saying I saw supposed to work. Never work there.
bad,"It's GameStop. Working in the store is generally awful unless you have a great team because corporate is so disconnected with the stores. Working at corporate isn't as bad, but there is still disconnect between departments that cause issues."
bad,"Great environment and a fun store to work for, but since gaming retailers and used game retail is in a downward spiral, there is not much to go on as far as hours and employment goes. Was never given sufficient hours to get familiar with the systems and work life so often my time working would suffer."
bad,"If you like games - it's a fun place to work, IF  you can get a good team in place.  District/Regional management likes rotating managers to ""give them more experience"", but in reality it simply prevents good team cohesion."
bad,"I worked here for about a year and a half and it was honestly a blast. It was easy to climb the ranks if you knew what you were doing and had a good team. Talking to customers about the games they were buying and helping them decide made me feel great. Seeing regulars come in to talk about the game you had sold them was honestly one of my favorite parts."
bad,Gamestop was a decent place to work if you like dealing with the video game industry. You need to be knowledgeable with what is currently going on in the industry. as a manager you work alot of hours and dont have a social life to much. They do under pay their managers for what they do.
bad,"Each Gamestop varies by management.  The culture inside of a gamestop can be quite fun as a low level employee, but as you climb up the ladder things get exceedingly awful.  Many times, employees are called upon to do work outside of their position's job duties. This is usually due to GameStop's inability to supply a store with the necessary amount of payroll."
bad,"You are expected to make people pay for things they really don't want to because your store wants to keep their numbers up. As an employer if your store is struggling with pre-owned sales your store leader will most likely not let you pick up new items you already pre-ordered, making you wait another day or even week to pick them up. If your numbers are down you are chewed to the bone by your store leader."
bad,The business is struggling and the leadership team needs a refresh. The leadership needs more diversity and talent that represents the markets being served.
bad,"A typical day at this job would involve nonstop alphabetizing of game cases. I would converse and influence customers to make purchases, though they had no initial intention of buying anything. the job seemed to have potential. Eventually, I would realize that it was a dead end. Managers and assistant managers would take all of the available hours, even taking my scheduled hours from me to maximize their own weeks, hence my resignation."
bad,The last couple of years there have gotten progressively unbearable. The oppressive micromanagement in every aspect of the business makes genuine guest interaction impossible.
bad,"Typical day at work is checking daily numbers to ensure we are hitting our goals. Making sure all scheduled staff showed up on time for their shifts. Processing daily shipments ranging from 3 to up to 40 boxes per day. Providing excellent customer service every day. Making sure staff was up to date on all required training modules which is called Level UP. Most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with my guests everyday, talking about our love of video games and collectibles."
bad,The job as a whole should be a ton easier than it turns out to be. Most of the company doesn't know how anything at the store level works. They always desire more and more out of employees but give less and less hours weekly. Advancement is only possible if someone gets fired and pay scale isn't great even if you spend a large amount of time working for them.
bad,Best parts of this job are the staff you work with. Its fairly straight forward and easy mostly talk to customers and get a sale. other than that everything else is ehh
bad,"It really deepened on the day, when i worked at that company, i wasn't guaranteed hours to work. Management can also be real bad, depending on the store."
bad,"Contrary to popular belief, most of the quotas set by GameStop are not too unreasonable. These being the quotas for game protection, memberships, and reservations. Which logically all drive the business along with us being sales men and women. However, one of the problems arises with the addition of adding the surveys that are on the receipt  that guests have the option to do to their discretion. This seems unreasonable as sales associates are now being pressured by something that is ultimately out of their control. This also added on top of the fact that the surveys allow customers to say anything, including complaints towards an associate's natural speaking voice (this happening to myself before.) This is not to say that the surveys can't be helpful or encouraging with some guests.  Another problem that the company has is it's constant changing management and practices. As far as lower level management is concerned, store managers and assistant store managers are not only competent but do their absolute best to drive sales given the restricting timelines that are given all while coaching and motivating lower associates. Management above these levels, however seems to have a disconnect with those that actually work in the stores. From excess micromanagement to over reacting to simple mistakes, higher management's decisions often add to the level of stress that sales associates already face with trying to get certain tasks with deadlines done in a timely manner that seem to be placed on one person consistently, yet should be evenly distributed throughout all that qualify to"
bad,"An average day at GameStop is pretty slow. It's not until 5 or 6 o'clock that people will actually start coming in regularly. You have sales goals that need to be met, but it's not a quota. If you meet your sales goals consistently, you MIGHT see a raise in a year, but even if you do, don't expect more than a 10 cent raise. Worked there for about 7 years and I went from $7.25/hr to just over $8. "
bad,"My daily duties included breaking down the load, making sure the safe and drawers were counted and helping customers."
bad,"I enjoyed working with games and gamers alike, but corporate micro manages like crazy. They make their employees ""say"" certain things when guests walked in the door or called that felt very unnatural. I quit because i was up for a review and i was a top seller in my store, but i did not receive a raise, but a man who did not perform as well as i did got a raise."
bad,"It is a place where you do nothing but talk about games all day and it can be the best or worst thing for anyone.  It is hard work to help people and still run the business side of things. Management has been terrible over the years and as a result they have closed a lot of stores (especially since downloading games is easier). The people in this environment are great and always want to help.  The best thing about this job is the people which is in total contrast to how the management has switched the view from customer service, to customer sales."
bad,"Always had a great time with fellow employees. The problem here lies with upper management. They are extremely out of touch with their employees and customers. Their set sales and trade in goals are ridiculous and are the bases for not only how many hours the store has to schedule employees, but also for the individual employee as well. You'll be ""punished"" for being in a bad economic area."
bad,At first GameStop was a dream job come true for a gamer such as myself but in recent months the focus was turned from helping the customer to focusing purely on sales and goals with no real consideration to the employees. With a uncomfortable/lack luster work environment this affects employee morale which in turn affected the customers.
bad,"I did not stay long enough to be pulled into a lot of the stressful situations a GameStop employee would be pulled into since I saw the signs early enough. They do not care about their employees nor their customers. They will constantly harp on you to sell credit cards or other items like a commission job. With all this pushing, you annoy the customer to no end, to the point they don't want to return. You want them to feel comfortable and not pressured to do more. I've heard one too many horror stories."
bad,"Gamestop is an interesting place. Depending on which location you work at, you could be faced with non stop lines of customers or maybe 10 customers a day. You meet a lot of interesting people, some with interesting stories, but most are 5 year olds that moms drop off because they think we're a free babysitting service."
bad,"I spent many years at this establishment, gaining better skills in customer service. I was once awarded top salesmen in the region eight weeks in a row for my employment level. People have this idea that this is a dream job, when in actuality, it isn't. Dealing with rude customers who don't always appreciate you going above and beyond to help them out. Working for Gamestop has a stigma that you're just there to rip people off of their items. Gamestop has a policy known as the Circle of Life. They follow this plan so closely that they scrutinize you if you don't make goal. It may affect your customer support, but they want to see the numbers."
bad,"If you're only looking to work 4 hours a week for minimum wage and only on weekends during closing shifts, then apply to gamestop, because they will only hire you for the season, and then let you go once its done because they only need 1-2 employees per store at maximum"
bad,"Very seemingly reactive, rather than proactive, company. Corporate does not seem to care about employees, other than whether we are achieving their seemingly arbitrary plans. Was phenomenal to work for when corporate was customer service oriented."
bad,Overall the coworkers were great. There were some rude customers and the pay isn't worth all the work there. You are able to get discounts on certain items in the store with the exception of new systems.
bad,"I was offered and accepted an assistant manager position. I went in to get the paperwork for drug testing and they gave me an incomplete packet (no authorization form) and the wrong address. I even verified both the address and the paperwork before leaving and according to the store manager both were correct and complete. They were not. No apologies either after wasting over 2 hours of my day off due to her incompetence. I was then told she would have to look into it and get back to me later that day. No call. I then received a call from the district manager who said there was a question about my job history. I called back and left a message, no call back. I then call the Store manager who tells me that my social came up as non rehire. I asked how that could be if this is the first time I've been hired. She said they would have to look into it, but if it isn't resolved soon they'd have to look at other applicants. I have since left a message with the district manager who still hasn't called me back. I have also not been called back by the manager. Good thing I was able to stay with my former employer or I would be unemployed, not that they cared at all."
bad,"I had a blast working here. The atmosphere was fun, the daily work was simple but kept you busy. The company is very customer oriented (as it should be) and it was a high requirement to make them feel as welcomed as possible, which i really loved. I really wanted to stay, but I was just not getting enough hours a week. (I was only getting around 4-8 hours) A lot of it had to do with it being a slow time for the company but I stuck it out as long as I could waiting to get my hours bumped up but it never happened. I was originally promise 15-20 hours a week so it was ridiculous only getting 3 some weeks."
bad,"I would greet customers as they walked in and assist them with what they wanted. Whether it be buying, selling, trading, or answering questions they had. I learned to deal with all types of customers such as the nice ones and the very rude ones. I also learned how to run a register. Management was decent enough. They didn't expect you to know everything or be the number one associate. Co-workers were also decent. They were nice people that I ended up becoming friends with. The hardest part was trying to sell games and accessories to customers when I had no idea what i was talking about. Most enjoyable part was working the midnight releases. The downside is you don't get very many hours. So its not great for trying to pay bills but it's good if you just want a little extra cash."
bad,I've wanted to work for Gamestop for a long time due to my passion for video games and the community. The company does not care about the gaming community at all. The management staff locally are great but the corporation is too focused on the bottom line and could really use a total overhaul. I would say the hardest part of the job is knowing that people are not valued and viewed as dollar signs nothing more. The most enjoyable part of the job is by far the customers. A typical day at work consists of taking a lot of trades and basic clean-up and other duties. I learned that corporations regardless of  what company it is at a certain point lose sight of the community that keeps them in buisness.
bad,"If you like video games, do not work there."
bad,"This job was my least favorite. The atmosphere is what you would expect at Christmas time, old grouchy people who don't know anything about video games. Trying to explain video games in a nutshell was worth pulling a few hairs out. I learned that personally Gamestop was not the job for me. when your having to multitask five things for minimum wage its very difficult not to have a mental breakdown. The one part about Gamestop that i liked was the Store manager. Who isn't there anymore. He helped me learn the system more than my co workers did. I didn't really like any of the coworkers in general. Hardest part was the terrible system that ran the Cash register. It was fairly expansive for a 16 year old to learn."
bad,gamestop only cares for money and there tactics show it forsing custamers to buy used games instead ogf new ones cus they make more money
bad,game stop is a corporation. they are motivated by the equity to their share holders. employees are a dime a dozen.. but its a good place to learn some basic skills that will come in handy as you develop your career. just like most retail chains. most people hate working there but its a paycheck. If your smart and learn the business you can advance quite a bit. but it doesn't get easier.
bad,"A typical day at work was overly promoting magazine subscriptions or GameStop credit card. I learned that you should probably know every video game in existence before working here because the customers will expect you to know everything. My management was very rude with customers, thus leaving negativity on our other staff members when the customers returned. My co-workers were very kind and very helpful. The hardest part of the job was during the rush when they only scheduled two people to work, which would include one associate and one manager and most of the time the manager would be sitting in the back eating or staring at the security cameras."
bad,Overall it was a decent experience working at game stop. The one large problem I had was the fact that there was little to no opportunity for advancement in the company. Although being able to surround myself with people that enjoy the same things as me was pretty fun.
bad,"If the manager was more competent and knew what  she was doing it would be a much better work environment. I have seen her fire people because they did a better job then her, I saw her push all of her work to her assistant manager who really should have had the job. Also to flirt around with your employees and have a husband does not look very good to the staff..."
bad,"Gamestop isn't a horrible job, but it is a job that one would not want to make a career. Unless you going straight into corporate. My co workers are amazing but there aren't enough hours for any to work more than one day a week and for only 3 to 4 hrs. To get more hours one must perform at an exceptional rate."
bad,"In a typical day, I help dozens of customers find and meet their gaming needs, as well as maintaining operations in the store, regarding inventory, proper display of materials, marketing, and stock balancing. I've learned how to run my own team with little to no help from a higher source, as well as proper time management, customer care, and productive self evaluation. Management is normally very out-of-touch and sporadic, providing little to no input on what is being changed, nor why, and often providing very little materials for our stores to meet the new standards. My co-workers are my family, effectively giving me a reason to come to work and enjoy what I do, as their job is only as easy and enjoyable as it is when we all work together. The hardest part of the job is having to constantly alter our sales methods, marketing, and general tactics with nothing more than a ""do it"" from higher ups. While certainly not impossible, it breaks down the trust that our level has in the leadership above the store level. The most enjoyable part is easily being able to help the customers in ways they didn't know they needed help with. When someone comes in saying they didn't know what they wanted, or were just browsing, and I get to talk to them, find out what they have in mind, and get them to leave happy, exclaiming their joy in the experience, there is nothing better."
bad,"We would mostly restock and keep the store clean all day. We'd have to help customers here and there but for the most part they seemed to know what they wanted. The one thing i can say i learned was a sales technique. Management was ok, i'd give them a 3 out of 5. co-workers were great and very competitive with the tasks at hand. the hardest part of the job was working suck long hours for such little pay. the best part of the job was being able to get your hands onn the newest games 1st."
bad,"On a daily basis I have the pleasure of conversing and advising a diverse customer base about up and coming gaming and technology as it applies to the field of the gaming industry. The potential for growth at Game Stop is minimal due to the structure of the company it self. However, the opportunities for advancement within the business it self could have the potential to exist due to the nature of the business."
bad,This job is for those who are looking for part time work. The compensation is minimum and you provide alot more work that what you are compensated for. The work environment is enjoyable depending on the associates you work with and the customers that arrive in the store.The work is fairly easy just an overabundance and tedious at times depending on activity of the store. Management is mediocre and can be vastly improved.
bad,"I worked their for the holiday season, and all during my shift all I would do is stand at the entrance and say ""Welcome to Gamestop!"" for hours on end.  When I tried to learn how to use a register my manager became mad at me, and I was later told that I was only hired because I am a girl and that would attract boys into the store, and that my manager had no interest when hiring me to keep my in the store past the holiday season. My co-workers were nice, we talked about video games when we had downtime. The best part of the job was that I could borrow any used video game for three days for free. The hardest part was standing in the same spot for hours."
bad,A typical day at work consisted of being constantly reminded to push sales of things that customers didn't need.
bad,"Being a manager requires that many job responsibilities be accepted and performed every day. This is more than apparent, to a fault. A manager needs to be able to have time to develop staff, plan for the future, generate fresh ideas, and be supported by larger roles. This idea of a manager is not understood, and leads to a glorified cashier, frequently. The lack of organization and snap, sometimes poorly thought out decisions, leads to a brand that wants to be uniform and impactful but ends up varied and inconsistent."
bad,"Work was fairly mind numbing. Organizing shelves and trying to get customers to sign up for memberships and reserve games.  If the extremely high expectation of reserves/subs were not met consistently, your job was at stake.  Felt like I was not valued at all at the company."
bad,"I did love my coworkers and my managers when I worked there. We were a family. My manager always had our backs no matter what and as co-workers we always helped each other out. Together we did an amazing job of helping our customers, keeping the store up  to date and clean, as well as making corporate happy. However the Company as a whole is nothing to brag about. You do not get any decent benefits until you get to full time status. After that, each location's marketing is beyond ridiculous considering the fact that every one of them has a different set up. Also, we got many customers who loved our location in particular because it was us who were there. We got many people who would tell of the horrible way they were treated at a different location and how they were talked down to or belittled. We always had to apologize and try to salvage the situation. They constantly teach ""Always help the customer"" but then when you do, you are either wrong or could have handled it better. They give hardly any time off for Assistant Managers and forget overtime. I personally went over by a half hour once, never will I do that again. I got slammed for it. Over time, they kept cutting our hours but giving both my manager and I more and more tasks that would require us to give up our social lives or customer service in order to achieve."
bad,"Gamestop was a fun job to work at for a while, but then it started becoming dull and the pay just wasn't worth the mental torture."
bad,"I learned alot from gamestop, how to sale and how to deal with costumers"
bad,Fun to work with gaming products. Co-workers are generally fun since everyone you work with has some form of nerd in them. Only problem is you have to put in a lot of effort for low pay. Even as a manager you don't get much compensation. Highly sales driven and are expected to get high numbers. No positive incentives to sale only get reprimanded or hours cut if you don't meet sales goals. You do get first dibs on products that come in and get to check out games for a few days. 
bad,"When I arrived I was thrown directly into the fray of phones & computers with basically no training. Other than that the job is pointless. Unless there is a constant flow of customers there is nothing to do, especially in a small store. Yet you are expected to always be moving & doing something. That left me wandering in circles fixing the same things & changing garbage just to have something to do."
bad,wow just wow...this job was a great one...the pay is bad but the experience was good
bad,Its a fun job to have on the side for extra spending money or just forbthe discounts on games and such but it will not be a company you can count on to pay your bills.
bad,This job is an excellent job for part time or a second job. Not a first go to for full time as the pay vs work to do isn't really fair depending on the position you work in. The discount is a great perk as well as some of the freebies that are given out. Managers at the corporate level don't seem to care much for you the lower you are at on the totem pole unfortunately though.
bad,"And then i saw the true face of the company. My store leader originally was great. She was nothing like the corporation first toad that followed. Originally we cared about the customer in my store, and then she got canned for that. Apparently even though we led the region in collectible sales that wasnt enough because we didn't harass our customers to buy a new system and 50 peripherals every time they came in. Her replacement was the worst kind of manager. Numbers only and she wanted everything ten times higher than target numbers, and god forbid you were honest with a customer or tried to help them for real. All she cared about was sales. I literally watched her basically push someone out of the store when it became apparebt they didnt want to preorder and were only buying a gift card. The encironment she created was oppressive and depressing and drained every bit of me for the nine months i worked under her. I loved that store, even before working there, and now i don't even shop with the company. Best advice stay off this sinking ship."
bad,"See review summary. 😂 This place will run you ragged and never reward you for it. The pay was minimum even as a third key manager. I always described working there like this: Imagine building an entire house with minimal tools and having maybe a moment to admire it before someone above you says ""Now burn it down and build it again with the ashes!"" "
bad,"The typical day at work is mainly retail sales, with a focus of upselling and trying to work with one's sale goals. Management depends extremely on the specific store one is in, and the workplace culture is one of focus on numbers and goals, despite the specific situations of any store. Perhaps the most difficult thing is dealing with corporate and their set goals."
bad,"Daily life at gamestop was busy, the stress from the higher ups to meet quotas made this job very stressful. If you didn't reach a certain goal set forward from the company you were let go. My store leader was great however and made the job more enjoyable and the heavy work load more bearable!"
bad,"Most weeks it was a day of work for about 4 to 6 hours and that was it. Those days consisted of working for an hour and then standing around with not much to do for the rest of the time. It was a relaxed environment, but the hours you did end up working that week (be it usually four or nine hours a week) felt painfully dragged out."
bad,"Recognition is made based on who you’re friends with. "
bad,"Work typically consisted of sending/receiving shipment, balancing registers and the safe, and assisting customers. I do thank my job for helping me develop valuable customer service skills and problem solving skills. The store I worked in was one of the top stores in the region for monthly quotas thanks to the manager. His drive and character motivated staff to perform their best. However, we had months where goals were not met. Each month the goals were getting higher which made it more difficult to obtain. It is due to these high monthly goals that made the job stressful for management which, in turn, made it stressful for senior associates."
bad,"Working at GameStop is terrible. Barely any hours, Pre-Orders are everything, and you are asked to do things that are not ethical at times. And above all else even if you manage to get up to one of the manager positions, the pay is so terrible it isn't worth it. There are other stores that pay higher in their entry level than their assistant managers get. Not worth it."
bad,"Something I've learned in my four years with this company is that the policies are inconsistent. They are to manager discretion and they can vary from store to store which confuses not only customers, but employees as well. Although the policies can be inconsistent, I've had wonderful experiences with the various store/district leaders. They have always given me and my coworkers opportunities to grow as employees and it's built a great trusting relationships between us."
bad,"My team is phenomenal overall and a very small store. Clientele is hit or miss but I still enjoy it until my store manager quit and did not want to promote the assistant manager due to BS reasons and basically dropped everyone’s hours due to a new manager."
bad,I would only work there if you have another part time job and already shop at game stop regularly so you can use the discount to it's fullest potential.
bad,"So where can I begin ... There are so many things wrong with this company, it's hard to pick a starting point."
bad,"After working here for a few years, I've come to realize that I went from ""oh GameStop would be a nice place for my first job"" to ""I can't wait to get out of here"". My store in particular isn't bad, but I can't wrap my head around most of the decisions made on a corporate level. They want us to give each guest the same conversation, when realistically each guest has different needs."
bad,Good place to gain retail experience and management experience. It's easy to move up but that's because employees are constantly leaving. The hardest part about the job is the customers you get (depending on the location) and the ethics of the company.
bad,Typical low pay retail job that isn't worth the stress or commitment. Only good thing was working with games but with a wide gap between knowledge needed for each customer also made that not matter in the end.
bad,I would tell anyone work their if you just need a part time something but not to looking in to it as a long term have your fun make some friends and enjoy life
bad,"Pay is terrible, higher ups make you pressure and sell things that most gamers do not want or care about. If a certain number of those things are not sold, you aren't doing your job correctly and they will fire you. Easy enough job otherwise. A lot of downtime if you're in a small/poor town and city. Can be fun with customers and fellow workers that are likeminded people that all have the same interests."
bad,This is retail job in which it is required that you hound every customer every time to educate them on the many different services and products that Gamestop offers.
bad,"The particular establishment I ""worked"" at was pathetic when it comes to the management.  I was hired seasonal and I worked a total of 4 hours the whole time I was an employee there.  The business is competitive as to who can sell more, and they hired too many people which made a few employees have no hours."
bad,"Fun place to work if you love games. Customers can range from friendly to evil at times. Management was great, but it turned quick when stores are given a manager with very low people skills and view an employee as a threat."
bad,"Abysmally small working hours per week makes this job worth less than a temporary position, there were less than 20 hours a week given to me and the management gives different answers for everything depending on who you talk to, this includes stuff such as promotions, training, and scheduling."
bad,the game stop i worked at the manager hired the guy she was sleeping with instead of someone qualified to work there. he showed up drunk and wrecked in the parking lot a few times. good on you.
bad,"Loved my coworkers but did not approve of coporate. Got very little hours. Got really decent discounts and exclusives. However, power is just an illusion."
bad,To be honest they expect you to have college level experience but pay employees high school level wages. Gamestop use to be more about customer service. Now they are more about sells and hitting goal for each employee. Lack of competitors has kind of let Gamestop monopolize the gaming market in the world or in the USA at least.
bad,"I was not the biggest fan of this company.  I worked for 4 years, I started as a Seasonal employee, I then, continued to be promoted to Senior Game Advisor.  I never was promoted past this point.  I always exceeded company/store goals, and made sure to do everything I could to help better the store.  I will leave this review here."
bad,"Major disconnect with upper management leads to lower compensation, ridiculous expectations, and high turnover. While the people in the store you work with are relatively fantastic."
bad,"I was hired on at this company as seasonal help before being promoted to Assistant Store Manager within 90 days. Once I entered management, the job went from enjoyable and straightforward to needlessly complex and stressful. I would not recommend this company to someone who is looking for full-time work. Especially for management positions; the pay is not enough for the amount of work expected from managers."
bad,gamestop is a fun place to work at but they provide little to almost no hours. even if your numbers are high they give all the best hours to the managers
bad,"Since it is every other kids' dream to work here, the corporate deems it more than welcome to plow through these teenagers offering them bare minimum in return. There are better retail jobs out there that students can work at."
bad,GameStop was a fun experience but it's quite difficult to balance out all of the goals they have. There quite a bit to do and the pay isn't all that great.
bad,"Work life balance is good. Your boss (doesn't matter what level) is on you for the COL score. There is EXTREME favoritism. Benefits are nice. Can check out games. Love the staff. However if your boss wants you gone.... Your gone. "
bad,"The job is a nice starting point but not made for a career choice."
bad,This job can be a fun part time job.  Most of the people that work there are good people and easy to get along with though the pay is minimal even in Management.
bad,"You come into work clock in and ask what they need you to do. Most of that consist of organizing, or putting away merchandise, and helping costumers as they come. The job isn't difficult and its good for teaching low level sales and it also helps you learn how to deal with various costumers tastes and issues. Management for me has been awesome no complaints about that whatsoever."
bad,Enjoyed the environment but pay was not enough. But i did enjoy the sales aspect and rapid growth within the company. I also had a wonderful mentor as well.
bad,"As store to store interactions are possitive, but when there are issues that involve upper management, there is no response nor job advancement opportunities."
bad,"A friendly environment, working at GameStop at first seemed to be a rather enjoyable experience. With relatively easy work, such as sorting the shelves, keeping track of inventory, assisting customers in finding the right items for them, processing sales, their was no problems during the work day. However, management seemed to be changing every week and with the inconsistencies of managers, seasonal workers like myself found it difficult to get any time at all to work."
bad,"Its your basic retail, except with Video Games! Good after school job."
bad,this company is fun for people who are interested in gaming products and systems. employees are very helpful. great customer service
bad,"Process all sales/returns/exchanges. Maintain store cleanliness and alphabetizing of merchandise. Stocking, loading/unloading."
bad,"My honeymoon phase with Gamestop lasted for about a year. Though my co-workers are enjoyable to work with and advancement and job security is fair, I am beginning to realize that I am not cut out for a career in retail. The hardest part of the job arrives when a customer persistently bullies an associate to bend a return policy in his or her favor. Fortunately, that does not happen with every transaction. I would say the most enjoyable part of the job is to constantly be aware of the video game market; especially if you are a gamer."
bad,"Gamestop could be one of the greatest places to work for as a gamer but due to the lack of hours that corporate will give your store, you will likely only be working there 1-2 days a week with 4 hour shifts."
bad,"It is a good first job, you learn customer service experience.. how to use a cashier and stock merchandise. This is a hard job to get, you only get in if you know someone or as seasonal. They make it look as a easy job but make you have goals every week, offer a hand load of things to the customers and pressure you to do them daily or they will fire you. It is not a secure job."
bad,"During my entire time working at GameStop I worked a collective 2 weeks, not even close to enough time to actually grasp the job and understand all aspects of it. I have always been a video game enthusiast, working here was great for the fact that I was surrounded by a lot of like-minded people. Hardest part of the job was getting my hours, they were not set in stone and would always be posted at the last minute. Management was very solid, aside from my work hours of course. I learned more about how to provide a good customer interaction and video game knowledge."
bad,A typical involves wearing many hats and running the show essentially. I learned how to create synergy with customers and making video games appealing to broader/newer audiences.
bad,"A standard work day involved taking care of customer needs and checking them out using a point of sale system. As we deal with pre-owned product we also must have knowledge of the products being brought in such as: video game systems, games, accessories, additional peripherals, tablet PC's and multimedia devices. We do a lot of informing parents and children and avid gamers of new product coming in and showing promotions involved. I enjoy my co-workers. They make it easy to come into work and get the job done."
bad,"Company has a high turn over constantly. Negative environment, treating most employees like little children and not adults. In every gathering usually pointing finger at someone or some people verbally which brings the moral down."
bad,Job was very boring. There’s never anything to do. I constantly just organized the video games in alphabetical order. And just waited for a Customer to come in.
bad,They used to be customer oriented which made the environment very welcoming but now they are penny pinching you have to sell so many of these memberships or they will find someone who will.
bad,"Mancanza di crescita, richieste assurde per crescere di livello."
bad,The environment of GameStop was extremely toxic to the point that they were cutting my hours and started making up lies about me not doing my job right. It sucks that my mother was in the store and her my manger telling his boss that he didn’t like me and needed some way to get rid of me. So I had to leave.
bad,Not the greatest work experience in my life barely had any hours I worked 1 to 2 days a week and that was not enough for me good environment though just hated not working enough.
bad,"Dopo anni all'interno non mi è stato riconosciuto nulla, quando gli faceva comodo mi fa forzatamente trasferito con l'inganno in un altro punto vendita per poi chiuderlo senza nessun preavviso, se volete fare carriera qui dentro non è possibile, ameno che non vogliate trattare i clienti come limoni; vi spingono a ""truffare"" il cliente e quando questo (giustamente) si lamenta, vi lascia senza rete e vi caccia fuori"
bad,"I was hired as a key holder. I was passionate about the work, had tons of experience, I was excited to do my very best! "
bad,"I worked with ThinkGeek. Loved the people I worked with. I left because of the pay. I miss my co workers, the job itself wasn’t bad. I was just expected to do way more then what I was paid to do."
bad,"Highly competitive, but no commissions for anything other than store managers. Low available hours but you work alone most of the time if you are a key holder. If you don't meet all of the criteria of expected weekly sales you will get written up and eventually fired."
bad,"Gamestop as a company under pays its employees and sets standards that feel impossible at times. Quotas need to be met, and higher ups don't understand what the employees in the trenches deal with. "
bad,"It's nice as a seasonal job or summer job, but not as a long term employment option. I was blessed with an amazing manager, but most of the time, upper management seems to be one of the key reasons why employees leave. "
bad,Fun and enjoyable outside of the holiday season.  its retail so your mental drained by the end of each shift.  holidays are long hours and constant standing.
bad,Was flexible with my college schedule. Company tries new initiatives it pushes on workers about every 6 months. The initial push is very hard but after a while they become more lax. Not a bad gig.
bad,"When I worked at gamestop's I started out part time learning about video games, the kore I was taught I eventually became senior sales associate for my store. My responsibility where doing all the counts for the store, stocking, ordering all supplies and doing bank runs at the end of each shift"
bad,"I barely got scheduled to work, it's a job that you might just work 3-4 hours a week. you barely do anything sometimes and sometimes you do too much grunt work"
bad,"It's nice and all, especially if you are into the pop-culture and gaming communities, but if you have bills to pay, Game Stop is not a good place to work. The only time it may work out like that is if you work as a manager, maybe an assistant manager."
bad,being able to sell something you enjoy is wonderful but the compensation at game stop was pretty bad. not only that the hours were few and far between unless you were in management. good work culture though just not enough given back to employees for time
bad,A place to be able to share your love for video games with other people and talk about new and upcoming games coming to the market. A very stressful fast-paced work environment.
bad,"You would be wasting your time if you think to work there, no appreciation, no increase in your salary whatever you work hard, promotion based on your relations with your supervisors"
bad,"Lack of advancement and full time options is really bad, but not a bad place to work. Just not a job I'd recommend people working in for the rest of their life."
bad,"I enjoyed working at GameStop, if only for the customers and helping them with what they needed. It was nice to be involved with the local gaming community in that way,  however the district managers were only interested in constantly pushing preorders and magazine subscriptions. The company as a whole never cares about gamers, which is depressing, but I suppose that is big business."
bad,"Gamestop is not a great place to work, always being pushed to move numbers and always push numbers even without a customers approval, and always being reminded that if you don't push numbers you are replaceable."
bad,"Now I love video games and the culture. The staff at my location is friendly the work is enjoyable if you know about video games. "
bad,"While I enjoyed working with the people I did, both coworkers and guests alike, the corporate management was not a good people to work for. They have way too high expectations while giving stores bare bone hours, just so that the higher ups could continue to make money for themselves. Pay is not good for store managers, and the higher ups blame the stores for every shortcoming that they have. It's hard to sell a preowned game or console when it just makes sense to buy brand new (ie 54.99 for a preowned game that's brand new at 59.99). Corporate management (ie Regional Managers) do not want to take the time to know their stores, whether it's location or staff. They just care about the numbers."
bad,"There isn't much to say about gamestop. The people that work there are great, But the company doesn't care about you or anything. All there is for gamestop is how can we make more money and pay our employees less."
bad,"They dont pay you enough for what they ask of you. You have to do a lot of work and dondt get compensate accordingly. Is fun but if you're looking for a stable job, this is not the one for you"
bad,"This is not a career, a great place to get your foot in the door with gaming. Do not become a lifer as GameStop will ALWAYS try to keep you. Pay was not good."
bad,Not an enjoyable job. Employees are paid low hourly wages and expected to do everything. Wouldn't recommend to a friend. Low room for growth within the company.
bad,Company does not care about employees. Staff overly pushed to do extra sales portions of a job and they are not given any bonuses for these actions. Very difficult customer base as well.
bad,At the end of the day through all the hours and personal sacrifices i made for my store my people and my company the hardest lesson learned was that it was a job.
bad,Constantly having someone on your back telling you sell more stuff when the customer doesn't want anything else is not fun. The work was slow paced  most of the time meaning no customers were in the store at certain points of the day.
bad,"Always went above and beyond for the company. They happened to offer decent compensation, however when it came to backing your employee they are without a doubt lacking in that area. Especially after working at three different stores in two different states and be held at gun point for the company three different times in the same one location. And then to be let go from the security department for a action that was approved from the stores MAIN manager blows my mind, and he admitted to doing it to the security team. Puzzling.  Especially after I always had amazing and top numbers!!!!"
bad,"Its sluggish and dull when there arent customers"
bad,I didn't get any hours and it felt like I wasn't even working at all sometimes. If u like games it's a great place for you. Some days it was good and relaxing.
bad,"You receive almost no hours, and the pay is minimal.  Really the only good thing about Gamestop is the customer base.  It's always nice to see regulars and get to chat.  There is a rewarding feeling when you recommend someone a game and they come back with positive feedback."
bad,"I learned great management skills working under my store manager. A typical work day for consisted for making schedules, data entry, as well as making phone calls and drafting emails. "
bad,"I enjoyed talking to guests, the work was not demanding but the corporate managers were very demanding of us hitting numbers, which they changed very often over the two years I worked their."
bad,"As a ""manager"", was only paid 9.21 per hour, no benefits, part time hours, job was threatened at every turn by district manager or regional. It was a very poor place for a seasoned employee to work."
bad,"working at gamestop is nothing more then a very short part time job. Every day working here was actually pretty fun, the hours where terrible though. Working here is only good for people looking for little income"
bad,"A day at GameStop begins with daily operations that must be completed prior to opening. This includes taking inventory on specific merchandise, reading daily e-mails to stay in the loop and preparing for the success of my team. Leading by example is big at GameStop since many opportunities to coach come from observing sales behaviors. We must model the behaviors in which we want to see from our people. Best part of my job was meeting regular guests and being able to be apart of their life when it came to video games. This was not a hard job for me."
bad,"While the job is great, being able to talk about video games. The stifling sales environment is rough, you are just a number and not meeting your weekly goals can be means for termination."
bad,The unique part of this job was the customers. Because of the product that you sell you get to deal with some very unique and interesting people that make this job a lot more enjoyable than it would typically be. GameStop as a company though isn't a very great one to work for. You're job is constantly threatened due to % and goals as a district and store. It's more of a sales job than anyone would assume considering it's a normal retail store.
bad,"Its a great job to get good work etiquette, but not for a long term source on income. They have a High turnover rate and if you dont get along with your store manager even having good customer service will not save you from their harsh words."
bad,"Store level interactions with upper management are rough. In a week you can be told to do something, undo it, and then redo it all while getting yelled at despite doing things as asked. As expected for retail, numbers are a big deal. If you don't produce, you don't get scheduled. The position is more on the sales side of retail than just straight retail. Hours are trimmed so you're working with a skeleton crew most of the time unless you're a busy mall store. Management expects all stores to produce equally, despite there being clear differences in demographics and population density, as well as other factors that drive foot traffic and sales. This can be a nice little supplemental part-time gig, but if you don't get in with the right people you're not going anywhere. Don't expect much. For many this seems like the dream job place, it's not."
bad,"I enjoyed it there since I am passionate about video games. Some of the customers I was able to connect with and help them find what they were looking for, which was a great feeling. My co-workers were nice but I felt they were putting me at a distance, to be honest. I was a seasonal hire but I put in effort to hopefully stay. Sadly I did not. The hardest part of the job was that I was not informed of specific information that were at times frequent questions of customers which left me to asking co-workers for help, I felt more like a messenger at that point."
bad,"i finally was able to experience what it was like to manage a team of 11 people, from scheduling to customer issues it all fell on me in a fast paced retail environment. i loved the challenge that day to day issues brought and the job was never stale."
bad,"Work didn't involve too much on most days. It would usually consist of ordering items on shelves alphabetically, greeting customers and occasionally helping them with any questions that pertain to video games or technology. The co-workers there were friendly and the management was very straight-forward. Small duties during closings such as cleaning or reordering shelves. The only issue was the low hours given. It was a part-time job but I was hoping to work longer hours and more days but none were provided."
bad,This company used to be a fun place to work but over the last 5 years it has gone down hill and continues to plummet.  Their business model thrived at one point but is know is outdated and needs to coexist with the digital times.  Adapt or sell cricket phones.
bad,"Doesn't pay livable wages; high turnover rate; primary focus on profit, leaving employees well behind marketing in terms of importance."
bad,"This was the job I held while I worked through University. While by no means is this the bottom of the retail barrel, I didn't bat an eye when I saw them listed on Forbes' list of worst employers. The work expectations were always higher than pay provided or the hours assigned to complete them in. The company never shied away from letting their employees know how expendable they were. On the bright side, I always had outstanding co-workers and the company was flexible with my ever-changing college schedule."
bad,"When I first started working at GameStop, it was a ton of fun!  I was working with a group of cool people who liked the same things I did!  It was great.  But working at GameStop as a seasonal employee, and working as a permanent employee are completely different experiences."
bad,"As someone who loves all types of games, working here was fun. I managed a register and provided customer services to all who walked in. At times it could become tedious, but keeping organized significantly helped my stay there."
bad,"In my experience, I was assigned very few hours and was passed up for a promotion to a decent position a number of times, despite working towards it the whole time I was working there."
bad,"- Sales person"
bad,"Couldn't pay me to work there again, Id rather be broke in the gutter somewhere."
bad,"You learn to sell the stupidest things to the smartest people. "
bad,"At first when I got the job I was so excited. It's centered around games and I love them. It seemed like a cool job where you talk to customers about games and sell them to them. Then you start being told you have to sell power up cards, getting reservations... ""But don't worry about it too much!"" My employer would say. So I did what I could but I could tell when the moms and grandparents didn't want to hear it. Most of the customers I dealt with were moms, grandparents or children that we're not going to buy extra things or reserve things... So I was told not to ""worry too much about the numbers"" so I didn't. I got a couple days a week and I liked it. Then the hours started being 3 hours every couple weeks. I'm living with my dad and in college and he wasn't mad about it and at first I didn't mind, I figured it would pick back up because it was just slow time. The only time it picked up as Christmas. After Christmas suddenly my boss was on me about numbers and everyone was talking to me about them as if they told me before it was important. I could easily see this is why my hours dwindled now... I started looking for a new job and finally just got one and now am about to finish up with gamestop. The only time the job was fun was when there were no customers and I could good off with one of the girls I worked with. Other than that, it was very boring and if my boss was there she'd bump herself into my transactions to sell stuff when I was in the process of just beginning to advertise our power up card. Not a fun game job like most younger teenagers think, like I did."
bad,"A typical day at Gamestop was to provide customer service and inform various customers about sales, new releases, and persuade them the benefits of buy a discount card."
bad,Working with others. And getting to know clients.Easy and relaxed.
bad,Overall a fun place to work. Management could be more friendly and give employees more incentives.
bad,"always changing environment, very high expectations, as a store manager I was in charge of everything; hiring, firing, training, loss prevention, customer service, etc."
bad,"would go early open the store, clean fix all our products. getting them ready for the currents customers that were on there way. once it was time to open and help customers. i would help them with their accounts find the games that they want. and ask them if they wanted to put any pre-orders. for future games or consles."
bad,New and used retail sales with heavy emphasis on used and pre-orders.  Strictly sales goal oriented with little to no opportunity for in-house promotion.
bad,"Working there had it's perks because I knew how to talk with customers.  When it came to talking with my co-workers (almost every former employee and customer has dealt with this) they seemed to better themselves and talk down to people. Even management had a very big problem with this as well. "
bad,"A typical manager day is 9 or more hours. Tasks include daily inventory counts, taking in shipment, sales, marketing, customer service and employee training. For most days there are more tasks that can be completed during the required number of hours requiring you to stay longer. However these tasks must get completed else it'll pile into the next day. Unfortunately it means sacrificing personal time in order to ""improve your business."" The upper management is very disconnected and is often just as disorganized but will still hold you to the rigid requirements."
bad,Management was always understanding and able to help. However the company itself strictly restricts hours for employees based on sales numbers-- if not already in a management position its near impossible to obtain hours that would reflect part-time requirements.
bad,"A typical day at Gamestop consisted of greeting and assisting customers, transactions, filing and displaying video games, and other clerical duties. Even though I started as a Game Adviser, there was always a chance to advance."
bad,"My job consists of putting games on the shelves and helped answer customer questions. My one manager is very relaxed, but the other is very impatient and pushy."
bad,Very hard to move ahead.
bad,"The only good thing about this place is that you get a discount at the store, 10%, but it is not worth it."
bad,fun job to have get to talke about games all day.
bad,"Seasonal work, not bad if you're a gamer. Didn't have a bad experience. store closed. Probably not the best place to try to have a career if current news about the company to be heard is true."
bad,You get 3 hours a week at most if you aren't a manager. Unless you really get along with manager there is no career advancement. I wouldn't really recommend working here if you depend on a consistent pay check to survive.
bad,"Honestly, they push numbers way too hard in off-season times and reprimand you for not fulfilling the numbers. This makes a semi-enjoyable job, far less rewarding than it should be. Try to find employment elsewhere"
bad,The company makes the most money off of preowned sales and they push you to meet those and other quotas or else your job is on the line. Managers and District Managers constantly micromanage each transaction and make certain that each employee recites a long and precise speech to every customer on the floor and at the register.
bad,it  was a great environment. i learned a lot about sales just from being on the sales floor and taking advice from some of my superiors. i enjoyed my time
bad,"The amount of time I worked here tought me a few things."
bad,"A typical day at work as a Store Leader or above requires one to wear many hats.  By many hats I mean we are responsible for every single facet of running a successful store; hiring, training, day to day sales, marketing sets, inventory counts, counting and depositing large sums of money, and problem solving for the guest and for the district as a whole."
bad,"If you just turned 17 or 18 its a pretty good job but I would get in and get the retail experience for a year or so and leave. The company gives minimal hours to employees (ie: 5hrs a week) unless you are some sort of manager. Pay is extremely low, even for management. Company has impossible sales goals refraining from allowing bonuses, etc. The employee discount is mediocre at best."
bad,This company provides good games and gaming systems to play on. They can sometimes help you on getting things discounted. The money there for a seasonal position is not good.
bad,"I stocked games and cleaned at closing time,,i also greeted clients"
bad,Went door to door explaining the benefits of alarms and would give presentations in peoples home
bad,"I stocked shelves and aided customers every day. I started my shift with alphabetizing, replacing, or restocking any merchandise on display. I would then do register until closing with a rare Keyholder opportunity. I learned alot about modern gaming: what games were out, the newest systems, and the jargon as well as how to excel in my duties as a Game Advisor (GA). The managers and fellow GA's were all friendly and always willing to help out and taught me everything I know by showing me first, then coaching me as I mastered it myself. The hardest part was trying to memorize all of the different games, dates, consoles, titles, releases, and jargon that accompanies a Gamestop job. Overall though, I enjoyed Gamestop: especially when I got to talk to awesome customers at the register. "
bad,"Up front, I had an amazing store manager and team that I am still close with. However, the corporate culture is very toxic and purely based on profit. They pulled every manager from a salaried position to an hourly wage; purely to save money. As well if you don't hit their absurd sales goals, you are treated like garbage and threatened with termination. If you have a strong store level team, it's bearable but outside of that, the environmen is toxic"
bad,"The people that I worked with, were amazing people. The only stuff that was really a problem was the things coming from the higher-ups like the Circle of Life and the pre order numbers and quotas. It was stressful. You felt like you had a good day at work but just because you didn't sell specific stuff, you really didn't. I would still work at a place LIKE GameStop, but maybe not GameStop themselves."
bad,My team and store leader were excellent. They were very easy to work with and were very welcoming to new employees. The job culture at GameStop is terrible though. Too much is expected out of us for too little.
bad,Game-stop is an okay entry level job you can progress in the company until you become a district manager but the would rather give the spot to people with experience from another company. On the other hand there is not true limit to how far you can progress up the ranks as long as you don't quit before the stress from constant number goals doesn't get to you first.
bad,"It was fun to work at GameStop. Great to have pocket change, discounted games, and consoles. What sucked was low pay, hours, and all the junk there is"
bad,"The company was wanted to push out too much product, but you can't blame them. They are a business and they can do what they like. however, i did not agree with it at all."
bad,"I don't want to say that GameStop is the worst company, because that is not true. But in my experience, the pay does not make up for the hours and interactions you deal with. The company always says that they are working helping their employees and will do anything or them, and that is true to a point. I have never felt like I would be in danger of losing my job, even when mistakes were made. That may be due to my personal management team, but overall the company does want to keep you. Unfortunately, the pay is pretty sad, and the benefits are basic."
bad,"After working for Gamestop for 6 years I've learned a lot about leadership, management and customer service. Many skills I've gained have been through hard work and perseverance. "
bad,"Enjoyable work space, being around all the modern games and consoles. Excellent customers, as well as the most enjoyable part being all the customer service and the happiness I received from helping others. Learned retail skills, cash register experience, and how to sell products. Least enjoyable part of the job would have to be the district management, and the higher management overall. The manager is an excellent person, and has done so much with so little to help everyone that works there."
bad,"A typical day at work would include  opening the store, inventory count, restocking shelves, selling products, customer service, sending and receiving shipments, counting money, and closing. I learned how to handle situations and make managerial decisions, depending on the circumstance. My management team worked hard and pushed focus toward customer satisfaction. My co-workers were laid back and fun to work with. They always followed directions and were well trained. The hardest part of the job was reaching the unobtainable goals set forth by the company in pre-orders, and power up rewards cards. The most enjoyable part would be the amazing team I've been blessed to work with."
bad,"Working for Game Stop was an interesting experience. I haven't worked for them no more than a couple of months and hardly had any work experience because i was their for only seasonal i did sort of learned a couple of a things or two of games and system game consoles, i also worked in our busy month for Christmas which was fun and received lots of hours. But when the slow season appeared they sadly had to stop giving me any hours so i decided to search for a better job in a better career field. The most enjoyable part was that you were able to rent games and take them home to play but then had to return the next day. The least i enjoy is the slow days when theirs hardly any customers.  "
bad,"Its a simple job, and the day to day work is fine but it struggles with its upper management being detached from how stores operate and they repeated ask for the impossible"
bad,Ummmm Like I thought it would Be fun working there It is Don’t Get me Wrong. But Man  That Circle Of life Stuff ain’t No joke They Basically feed People pro cards
bad,I'll only take a few sentences to sum it up. GameStop is full of very fun and awesome managers and coworkers who made it feel like family. My manager was awesome and I couldn't ask for better managers. Work environment wasn't bad either. Everyone worked hard but had fun. Customers liked us for the most part and it was fun interacting with the good customers. Overall my in store experience was cool. My problems with GameStop mostly stem from my job as s Seasonal. I didn't get the best pay and didn't get many hours so I didn't really make a lot of money.
bad,"Great company, but the managers, supervisors and leads  should appreciate employees hard work.  Try to solve problems instead of just firing people. Just so their CO thing that they're a good boss. How is it possibly for them to fire an employee from 10 years just because they weren't doing the production or fire an employee that has been working 8 years because they missplaced an remote. Good luck gamestop."
bad,"But being a store manager you have a lot more on your plate, numbers are a big deal I get that its always a companies big deal but when it takes the enjoyment of your job out of it, its no longer a comfortable environment, I enjoyed my employees and ""selling people fun"" and I truly am an avid gamer I loved talking to people about video games but, the pushy sales man, I am not. I love shopping and if someone was pushing me I wouldn't want to shop there anymore."
bad,"Corporate GameStop chews and spit out the help from the store managers down. The district management focus solely on whats wrong with your store never building up confidence on your job well done. They switch their business model every 3 months or so meaning you'll have to re-learn the way things are done (and you better learn fast or your out). Money is the only thing GS corporate cares about, to them employees are a dime a dozen, your expendable."
bad,I had fun. Loved my coworkers I actually learned a lot from everyone there. My manger was amazing. They gave us shirts for the grand opening of call of duty.
bad,"It is a complicated company to do this with. It can be hectic or extremely slow or just casually busy all day. You must meet expected numbers in certain sales, yet some are only achievable if you literally ask the customer for their info every 5-10 minutes. I don't have to mention the not so well thought-out ""Circle of Life"" as it is common knowledge now."
bad,Everyone I worked with was amazing. People are very willing to help you learn and grow. There are strong policies in place and controls around all aspects of the company. Pay is also very good. I was an intern but I would definitely recommend to anyone applying for a full-time position.
bad,"A typical day at work consist of me organizing the games in order of alphabet and If a customer is in need of assistance, I would help them with any questions."
bad,My manager was bad and so I had to take over without getting the pay raise. Also the company doesn't care about the people that aren't managers. But it is a really chill environment.
good,"The company doesn't care about customers, they just care about sales, subscription/memberships, and reservations no matter the cost. Harrassing and beligering customers into reservations and subs is not only practiced, but heavily encouraged by upper management. You as a person have no value to the company if your not pulling in subs or reserves. Delivering a great customer experience comes a far distant second to those goals. You can be a total dick to a customer, as long as they reserve a game or renew their membership, it's water under the bridge in the company's eyes."
good,"I received hours only when someone would cancel for a shift or when the holiday hours were released. Otherwise, hours are divided between the key holders and friends of management."
good,This was not a place or department you could advance in you are treated like a child. They did offer good benefits but that is pretty much all they did. Loss Prevention was not a good department to work under.
good,I was never properly trained to operate any sort of register. A typical day consisted of organizing shelves and nothing in particular. Horrible management. Corporation standards.
good,"This job was fun at times but the pay was minimum and raises were based on yearly average preorders power up cards, or pushing used products instead of new. So if you worked a day or 2 a week there was no way you would be able to live or get raises"
good,"Pay is low, management is all over the place, too many responsibilities for a single employee. Discounts are good, but not worth the low pay. Would not recommend."
good,"This is the job every gamer wants until they start working here. The hours are slim until you get a promotion, which could be anywhere from 6 months to a year. Then you go from working 3 or 4 hours a week to 20 - 30 hours a week if you are lucky. Co-workers are the best part about this job. Most are fun and love to talk about video games. However the higher management is where this job is lacking. The higher ups have no idea what its like to work in a store anymore and do nothing to help the little guys. To them its all about getting their numbers and their bonus at the end of the month."
good,Every day you were forced to try and push products that were not selling for a reason they weren't popular or needed. As well as that you couldn't do anything with out being micro managed and with the rapid decline of the gaming shop industry due to online buying game stop unfortunately is dying.
good,"A typical day at work for me as a keyholder meant running the store all alone, responsible for doing every task, answering every phone call and working myself ragged with endless lines of customers. The hardest part of the job is being told over and over to do MORE MORE MORE by management and getting absolutely NO rewards for your efforts and it just becomes and unrealistic daily expectation."
good,"Gamestop Inc is one of those places that make you think that the love for gaming will be beneficial in the job, and to a degree it is. The hard part comes when you have to push real hard for people to get the GameInformer magazine subscription and pre-orders of games (you have to real push since management is expecting for you to get a certain amount of subscriptions on a weekly basis), as well as overall maintenance of order and cleanliness of the store. Unless you are management, don't expect to make any real money whatsoever, since you will get minimum wage, and to top it off you basically hardly get any hours. When a hot item is about to be released, you will have to work late nights, and receiving a promotion is almost never. The good part of working at Gamestop is the opportunity to have access to all the games since they will let you ""borrow"" games for a couple of days so that you can have an idea of the content of said game and in turn help customers when deciding if the game is worth the purchase or not."
good,they told me hr hasnt cleared me i worked there over 2 months i never once was able to sign in or out or work on registers i got 8 hours a week everyone else could help customers and use the register. after other employees helped customers including the manager would make fun of the customers even the disabled. sexist jokes and remarks were made as well.
good,"if you like games perfect place to work, friendly and nice workers just not worth the pay for what you do. loved working their overall. thank you gamestop"
good,"When I first started working at GameStop I was 15 to 20 hours a week. I loved working with the customers and trying out all the new games and just hosting the mid night launchs. "
good,"Fun place but barely any hours, was laid off and never got a call back, only was allowed to work 2 days a week at less then 4 hours a day with no benefits or chances to gain hours."
good,"Shipment, customer care & check outs were typical days at work. Learned how to process products, email LP & managements, & stock. Workplace was generally enjoyable. Team members were generally outgoing & kind."
good,"The work and executions are fairly simple and can be done pretty quickly. It practically consists of opening the store, keeping marketing and current sales up to date, customer service and making sure you push the numbers that the company wants you to push and if you fail to make those numbers expect a disciplinary write up for ""failing to perform""."
good,"Very easy job, great place to talk about games as everyone who usually walks in likes them as well. A typical day involves keeping the store looking neat and organized, the games alphabetized, floors kept clean, etc. Having knowledge of the newest games helps a lot as often customers will want to know if a game is worth the $60 investment. They may ask about the story, game play mechanics or even the graphics."
good,"For those who know anything about gamestop, its nearly impossible to even get hired without being friends with someone and this is where all the problems start. It's a popularity contest with sales metrics and customer service reviews taking a backseat to how active you are in the people above you's social lives. This aspect of the job makes it suffocating at times with brief periods where you get to catch you breathe during District and Regional Managers visits when your peers feign professionalism.  I made a lot of great friends, but I struggled to pay bills for quite sometime."
good,Driving too much and endless constructions prevented me to continue to work. Opportunity to learn new programs and systems. Fun place to work.
good,"This job is super demanding, 50+ hour work weeks are the norm and possibly more come the holidays. I handeled everything from payroll, hiring/termination of employees, ordering of supplies to training of employees. Other duties included; customer service, cash handeling, monthly inventories, etc"
good,Depending on your management it could either be really good or really bad. You have management who looks out for the workers and give credit when its due and some who won't pay you for the entire time you were there. They tell you to get numbers even when no customers come in the store. Managers advise you to lie to customers. worse job i've had
good,"I worked at Gamestop for close to 3 years. I got promoted once in that time, with the promise of another promotion on the horizon, so as they trained me up I was willing to work more, harder, and change some behaviors for the new position. 4 months later, I still did not gain the position, and was continuously told I was 'not there yet,' even though I had been doing everything for the position possible. I also received very little benefits and a very small pay raise each year. I had fun pushing sales and meeting new people, but at the end of the day, it was not worth what i was paid to do what was expected. Gamestop is a company for lazy people to get by and not further their lives. Would not recommend working there."
good,"Working at Game Stop is boring, nothing to do. One feels like that the job is making it them hate to play video games and it the end the pay is not worth it."
good,"Good product and customer service, bad employee retention."
good,"It's a good job if you're just looking for a little side money, but it does not have much potential to make a living wage nor does it have regular opportunities to advance. Further more, a lot of the management and hours are extremely inconsistent and can change from day to day, let alone week to week. Though it can be relaxed, there are extensive goals to meet with no real incentive and a painful lack of job security. "
good,"GameStop always has this very energetic and uplifting environment at the start. It's after a few months afterwards where you're trained to stress customers out on preordering items and forcing them to buy items they don't need to because of a quote system, which doesn't benefit anyone other than the district manager."
good,"Yes its Gamestop, everyone want to work here. I would not recommend. Their policies are very contradictory. One day its ""We're going with plan A"" the next week they do plan B which was direct opposite of A.They sell softcore pron anime statues, but God forbid you're under 17 trying to buy a M rated game, because theres swearing in it. Just an awful place to work."
good,"If you love video games, work there. Other than that, it was not a great work environment at all. The job was boring, the upper management was not friendly at all"
good,I would not recommend working here. I have worked at other retail stores that have treated their employees better. I have worked in multiple Game Stops in different roles and for the most part they were great stores! The company needs a reform and to get rid of lazy corrupt store managers and district managers. I see what the company is trying to do with their customer service and I respect that but nothing will change with the managers who are stuck in their ways and can't change their process for the better and learn to grow with the company.
good,"it is a very decent job to work, most of the gamestop establiments do not have room for raise or advancement in your carrers nor do they supply the hours needed for the pay vs cost of living"
good,Not the worst company ever but they are very greedy and pay very little sga position like myself is considered management and we are payed 9 an hour while the company is 3 billion over their sales goal and we are open when all major stores are closed
good,"The job is what you expect from a retail store, however if you do not sell enough of the stores promotions, you will be penalized for it. The hours are very lackluster, and not a job to"
good,"Would tell you last minute that the hours would be prolonged, showed favoritism too much, poor communication between managers and leads to associates, one department would help others more than needed, breaks weren’t always set."
good,Seasonal work that was very sporadic the schedule was not offered very far in advance and when the season ended there was not even a notice. You just no longer were on the schedule.
good,This is not the environment anyone would want to work in unless it was their second job. Gamestop won't pay anyone that isn't management enough or give them enough hours to support themselves. To put it plainly you bust your backside to sell things you can't afford with your bi-weekly paycheck.
good,"GameStop disguises themselves as a company that requires good customer service, but this is a sales job with minimum wage and no commission. GameStop is a company that cares very little about the customer and the employee. They slam down massive projects and store overhauls with impossible time frames and no support. They provide a very small amount of hours per store and don't allow you to get more support, and criticize you when you're not able to do everything by yourself. I worked at  GameStop for 4 and a half years and in that time I found that GameStop changed. It used to be customer service oriented, but now its sales. A sales job that is minimum wage with no commission and no hours."
good,"not a great place to advance your career, job seems like a complete deadend and a waste of time at times, no hours and very low pay, would not recommend"
good,"My day starts alone and most of the day I remain alone.  When I do receive coverage, my day is full of tasking.  So much to do but very little hours for support."
good,I wasn't there very long because they ended up closing a few months after I started but they wanted us to focus on odd things rather than dollar amount of what we were selling. It was also very hard to sell games because the microsoft store and playstation plus store often has sales on their games and GamStop very rarely has sales on theirs.
good,"Pay isn't good, your co worker's might be very competitive. But the discounts are GREAT!!!!!. I got promoted but my pay is still the same. Growth in the company is very possible. I went from Holiday associate to perm. and then to key holder in 6 months."
good,"Would help customers with picking out electronics, and check them out. Would take calls, and help guide people. Stock shelves, and clean the store, during closing time."
good,Very little perks considering how much is expected of the employees. The company is constantly changing goals every week and threatening your job if you do not meet the company goals.
good,"Good place to work. Great training. Friendly and helpful co-workers. A good environment all though it is poor in security. Customers always have patience, helping a customer and they giving you feedback right away is the best part of the day. Hardest part of the job keeping track of inventory and sending inventory to different places like different stores and back to the company."
good,"Was barely scheduled 6+ hrs a week, and then was bumped down to less than 3 hrs a week. nothing to eventful happens. mostly cleaned and restocked the shelves, also worked register."
good,got told to lie to customers and if I didn't sell enough pro cards I would be fired. it's so hard to advance and when I did. I got to do stuff my manager didn't want/feel like was his responsibly
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is engaging, fun customers who love talking passionately about their interests in upcoming games! My co-workers are all fun loving guys who always get the job done, and do their jobs well. The job in itself is enjoyable. I've learned many things in my time at GameStop, such as valuable customer service experience, becoming a quick learner, and how to handle stressful situations! A typical day at work for me includes getting incoming inventory taken in, dealing with customers, cash handling, answering the phones, organizing, re-organizing, and dealing with solving customers' problems. The managers are pleasant to work with and do their jobs well. The district manager is a different story, he hinders our ability to do our jobs effectively and knows very little about the work we do. The toughest part of my job is keeping up with his demands of how our store must look, operate, and function in general. The Pros far outweigh the Cons the longer you stay at the company, and the benefits provided eventually lose their charm."
good,Gamestop as a company offers an enticing environment to learn a more intimate look into the gaming world but within my experience did not offer any support to associates below the managerial level.
good,"A typical day consisted of pushing Power-Up cards on people and organizing the game drawers behind the counter."
good,"just a basic customer service job, clean up, stocking, inventory, greetings, and helping the customers. The co workers are fun and energetic. This job requires a lot of energy."
good,"Not enough hours, bad management and no progression."
good,"I worked upwards of 80 hours a week December through April and an average of 60 hours a week the rest of the year. I was granted 3 weeks of vacation for the majority of my tenure and was only approved to take one full week once, in 2006. I would not recommend this company unless it is your last resort for employment."
good,Clock into work and get the day started whether it is fixing walls or processing shipment. Answering phone calls. Helping customers with any questions they may have. I have learned multi-tasking to the fullest. Management is ok could be better. The hardest part of the job is being blamed for things that you have no control over. The most enjoyable thing about my day is when I am about to clock out.
good,"My day consist of doing inventory counts, taking the nightly deposit to the bank, processing the trade bin, doing any price changes needed, and then opening the store for day to day operations."
good,"I was intimidated when I started at first. The store manager was more worried about herself rather than the store and her employees as a whole. She worked everyone to death and did not appreciate any of the work that we did. Once the Xbox One and PS4 came out and quit."
good,You don't have balance in life. Not enough hours for coverage. Too many changes in a short amount of time. There's no help from above management.
good,"Long hours, lower than expected pay and no personal time. Working up to 50-60 hours per week with very low compensation. No structured training program. Very sales performance driven company. Overnight hours sometimes expected during non-holidays."
good,"managements had favorites between employees. "
good,"The first two years I was with this company were great. I had awesome coworkers, my manager was friendly and treated everyone with respect. My last year was down right miserable given that everything about your job revolved around getting someone to reserve a game or sign up for what was then the ""Game Stop"" card. The less you sold the less money you made because you would get less hours."
good,Enjoyed being up to date with video game knowledge. Management was the roughest due to it rigidity with its employees and yet its over flexibility with customers.
good,"This is honestly a bad, dead end job. What makes this job a little more difficult to manage in addition to low wages tends to actually come from coworkers. Theft is a huge deal at all Gamestops, expect loss prevention investigations to be a regular occurance."
good,"I went on expecting full-time and got, at the most, 12 hours a week. Before I began to seek other employment I was getting none. It was fairly disorganized and the commute was not worth the hours I was given."
good,"they are never satisfied with what you do, alway ask for more with no pay raise or praise. You are told that if you dont do better, you are always replaceable- doesnt matter what your position is."
good,"40+ emails a day ,alot of phone calls,changes,employees not getting paid correctly, go time issues, IT problems..etc"
good,"I worked for EB Games / Babbage's for about a year before GameStop swooped in and brought their corporate agenda and competitive sales system to an otherwise perfectly functional business. They turned where i worked from a friendly customer based store into a joke full of bottom line savings and quotas, turning friendly co-workers into competitors for hours and the ""all-mighty managers'"" respect."
good,Nine years of my life for nothing. To upper management you are just a number. You can put blood sweat and tears into it for years and you will be always be 100% replaceable.
good,Company shifts goals too much. Lack of steady vision which translates to hiring then letting ho people because the vision changes. I had heard they were a rinky dink company but gave them a chance. First thing they did was HR changed me from hourly to salary which nixed any shift differential and OT. They later outsourced our department to India.
good,I do not feel safe working here. We have had a bomb threat and a shooting threat in the past 4 months and the supervisors tried to lie about it and cover it up. We don't even know if the people responsible were arrested for their threats. The communication is horrible.
good,"Overall, it became a very bad job, corrupt leadership and no work hours. Started out at 3 days a week and when I left I was working 1 day every 2 weeks. You can't survive on that."
good,"We went through a lot of managers like four or so in less than a year, I was always told that I'd get bumped up... It never happened. I could pretty much take off whenever I wanted but that meant sometimes going two weeks without pay, just the way it would end up. The hours aren't great, the pay isn't great, it's pretty lack luster on everything. Corporate is constantly up everyone's behind about everything that is unimportant to video game nerds. It was always SELL this and PUSH this and THEY DON'T NEED IT BUT MAKE THE CUSTOMER WANT IT! Which was very annoying. There's a big push for numbers to be high which is difficult to achieve when you only work maybe two nights in the whole week. You're expected to just put up with it and make those numbers, even if they're outrageous. Our store was in a smaller town that was empty most of the summer and was still expected to pull big numbers when I would work a four hour shift and see maybe four customers in two hours. Corporate sucks much like every other corporate job. Management always shifting and changing made consistency nonexistent. One manager would be super easy to get along with and super go with the flow, the next would push for numbers really hard, and then they'd leave, and then the next would just want everything organized, and then the next would come in and change everything that we did. It made morale low. I loved most of the customers, they were fun to talk to about nerdy stuff, and I loved the discount on games even though it wasn't that much, I LOVED helping parents, grandparents, and aunts/uncles shop for kids' birthday"
good,I started as a seasonal and became a store manager over the course of 3 years. Pay and work load is an issue here. The culture is very strong on salemenship but the competition between stores is either unhealthy or non-existent. We have great products for sale but the pushy nature that comes with great customer service is  draining. store managers typical work 44 hours which hinders work/life balance greatly. The job's income is also not enough to sustain a single person's cost of living. I love what we do and the products but i cannot condone working here until the business model or employee treatment changes
good,"This was a seasonal job I was really dissapointed for I would probably work 1 day a week, I just thought that if they did not need personal why did they hire me."
good,"All in all a great company to work for. However, if it’s not during a holiday season two jobs are required to make a living wage. Hours evaporator to almost nonexistent unless you’re the ASM or SM."
good,This company does not compensate well but will be highly demanding of your time and efforts. Expect the sales focus and direction from upper management to change frequently. The company is not generous with payroll so expect to be working by yourself often if you are in a keyholder position.
good,"We greet guest and are use a tablet on a daily basis to check their offers. There is always something to do such as: "
good,Sehr schlechte Bezahlung als Filialleiter. Wenig unterstützung Überstunden und alleine arbeiten war Normal.
good,"Decent managers that actually know what they are doing, and care about there team and customers don't last long. It seems the more you brown nose the farther you move up. And if you speak your mind on an issue high management doesn't like that."
good,"lack of hours, other employees will jump in your sales if you made the  pitch to take the numbers. Management only scheduled you if you met the numbers."
good,This is a job for a kid in high school or college. There is no career here. They are the epitome of corporate tropes. They only want you to push items that make money and don't really care about customer satisfaction. I had fun working there but even as a 17 year old kid I thought it was stupid that they punished kids younger than me for not getting enough magazine subscriptions.
good,"At its core the job isn't super demanding, but they will pile expectations and duties. Depending on management and your team the job can either be very relaxed or very high stress. The companies push for numbers and the tactics they employ can be a little shady even if they constantly insist over conference calls that all policies are to help guests."
good,They preach a culture of family and diversity but throws both out of the window above the store leader position because neither the regional leaders nor the market VP's truly believe it.
good,"Fun company to work for at the store level. Wish the company could figure out what it's goals are. If you like rapid change this is the place for you. Every six months they ""pivot"" to whatever they feel like."
good,"Love my job however the pay I receive does not reflect the amount of work I do. 3% standard raises. Even though I'm the only full-time employee in a department that should have 2 other full-time employees & a department lead. This is a chronic problem across the ""DC""  half of the distribution center."
good,"Gamestop was fun to work for at first, but once I was there for a while they started to create pressures that were not applicable to store volume or conducive to teamwork."
good,"I didn't mind game stop plenty of fun people would come in to buy games ect to talk to , manger wasn't the nicest to customers or most respectful to his employees"
good,"Great Office Environment, Awful Management is the best way to sum up working at GameStop's corporate office. They would rather hire outside talent instead of growing from within. Compensation is also just a fraction of what you would receive by doing the same job for a different company. They do not care about their employees."
good,the website is pretty horrible and i dont like how they treat their employees as some expendable pawns and how they basically force their employees to lie to your face in order to sell product
good,"Opened and closed the store and provided customer service. Some weeks there were many hours, others only a few hours. This job provided many opportunities to interact with many types of clientele for all walks of life."
good,Politics and favoritism run this company. Its not about the games anymore its about who likes you and if they like you enough you advance if they dont you wont.
good,"A typical day at work is to handle customers and keep the store organized and running smoothly. The job itself is fun and provides challenge, however, the company is a difficult one to work for, I'd say, the majority of the time. GameStop tries to be a versatile company with many different sales options and varieties of product and yet, does not put forth the effort to train their employees with something new(ex: Cricket) and then comes down on employees when sales do not meet the goals. I have a hard time talking about my job here because I love the store, and I love my co-workers, however, the company itself is hard to work for."
good,Very stressful environment. Constantly push for more and more sales with no true incentives for motivation. Essentially need to lie to customers while maintaining a smile.
good,"I've worked seasonally for Gamestop and I liked it for a time I've to work there, and I would have continued to put in either full time or part time if they gave a great reason to work there. "
good,"this place works you like a slave they don't care if you kill over dead as long as you do what they say before they say it plus most of the ""higher ups"" treat the people like they are robots who don't feel pain or anything."
good,There really isn't much I have to say about working at GameStop other than it was a pretty lackluster experience. They forced interactions with customers that just wanted to be left alone. They provided no benefits to employees to make us care about the job. Also the hours were often scarce so I sometimes went 3 weeks without any hours what so ever. If there is any saving grace the company has it's that it trained me in how to up sell customers.
good,Handle all customer service and focus on sales and add on for larger items per transaction and profit volume. Also answer any and all customer inquries
good,"Besides cashing out customers you were expected to stock the floors with merchandise as well as check in in coming deliveries. Your main concern throughout the day was securing a certain number of reserves for upcoming titles or gamer magazine subscriptions. there was no such thing as job security, if you fail to meet the quota for reserves or subscriptions you were fired."
good,"I worked at a very busy location, I'm sure if it were a slower area it would be fine. But if the area is a very popular thriving area be prepared to do the same thing over daily without making any real progress. Management sucks honestly, becuase they set really high unrealistic goals and if you don't reach these goals you will be punished for them. The best part of the job is checking out games, which has been altered since I've been there."
good,"The job was heavily relied on preorders and subscriptions, there is no job security as they will constantly remind you if you don't fulfill their quota."
good,"Gamestop restructured and changed to a ""Push everything we have and if you dont we will start writing everyone up for not having enough reservations for games or subscriptions for Game Informer"
good,"I really liked working for GameStop when I first started there, it was something I had wanted forever. However, I quickly learned that the company is only focused on the numbers and that's all. I lost a lot of great coworkers because they didn't agree with that mentality and they were fired or ""let go"" because of it."
good,Customer service and promoting sales. The most enjoyable part of my job is talking about games with the customer when I am working.
good,"The gaming experience here allowed me to exploit the products to get a better understanding for customers questions about the consoles and like products. As a 3rd key manager, i performed opening and closing duties, inventory, stocking, nightly numbers and deposits. As a gamer I learned much about the gaming world and more about my capabilities in sales and business organization."
good,"typical days is easy, learned about software and games;management was okay; no hard parts, getting game discounts."
good,"Work is Monday-Friday. Weekends off. Overtime is voluntary during the busy season. 1st shift is from 6am to 2:45. 2nd shift is from 3:30-11:45. Some departments don't get out until midnight. Some leads are knowledgeable, but most aren't. Supervisors play favorites. Very slow to move up the latter. Once you're in a department you can't move until you've been there six months. 30 minute lunch, two 15 minute breaks. Odds are you will be cleaning lots of somethings for a long time. The job is also very quota heavy. Pay starts at $8.50 in most areas. Phone repair techs make $12.  After your three months you can get up to a 50 cent raise if you haven't missed any days. Otherwise prepare for a  15 to 23 cent raise. Most people keep their head down and do their job. It's a pretty quiet place for a warehouse. The hardest part is not thinking about how boring the job is. Production bonuses look good on the paycheck when your area hits its quota. It's a good job if you just need a job."
good,"Most of my experience with Gamestop was very pleasant and successful. However there lack of higher management and there supervision is astonishing. My store manager was transferred to a low performing store. I was informed on his last day that, the store manager from that store would be coming here and I was to help her be successful. That however will be in 2 weeks so you are on your own till then. I was very busy and shorthanded now so feeling the pressure I was working a little more than I should have been and just recording my time as it was scheduled. I sent several emails and messages to my district manager for answers to several questions I had, to no avail. On my 11th day as acting store manager I sent an email to the regional manager to try to get some help with some questions I was receiving no help from my DM on. Well that got back to her and on my next shift I was called into the office and asked to defend every mark down or price change made on my shifts for the last 6 months then was told that 2 of my time punches were incorrect and since the company had been sued for that a couple years earlier they were terminating my employment. I had never been written up or verbally warned so I at least recieved my unemployment."
good,"Working at GameStop is really quite simple. they have a high turn out rate, so they are always looking to hire."
good,"I worked at Gamestop for almost 10 years and after being laid off with many others realized that there isn't much job security ."
good,"Sales and cashier. Poor management. Out-dated computer sales system. The best part is getting to talk to customers and give them your recommendation on products, however I think some people ask just to argue."
good,Enjoyed helping customers with any questions they had and helpful co-workers.
good,"Incoherentes es decir poco..."
good,"The last few years that I worked the new district manager cleaned house. He constantly was coming at me telling me if I can't do the job he wants that I could hand over my keys. I felt very intimidated and underestimated. "
good,Took customer calls for the GameInformer magazine as well as GameStop.com.  Helped with retention of customers and assisted with training new coworkers.  
good,"I've been working for Gamestop for 5 years now, and its only getting worse. The pay I get for my tenure at the company is abysmal. I am management so my hours used to be pretty good, but with recents changes I am lucky if i get 20 hours a week. But the job is extremely easy, except for the unrealistic number quotas that they have, which is pretty much what they base everything off of (e.g. raises, hours, actually keeping your job). If you're a highschool kid looking for a few bucks, go right ahead. But if you're an adult trying to make a living look elsewhere"
good,"Working at GameStop allowed me to sharpen my already established skills of Management, Marketing, and promotion."
good,"Great place to work part-time, don't try to make it a career. Not much room for advancement, too much favoritism and lack of formal training. Inconsistent policies from corporate vs district managers. There is a lot of pressure to up sell/unreasonable goals vs other stores (Po-dunk, NC can't compete with Big City, NY)"
good,GameStop can be a great job in most ways but i am looking for something new
good,They don't really treat there employees good and pay is bad. I didnt really like working there.
good,"Don't be fooled, the work is easy, and the job is uneventful, but the company doesn't give a rats rear about its employees."
good,Game Stop use to be a place that employees enjoyed producing and being in the store. Even though you didn't play games while working the company was based around our relationship with customers. Unfortunately Game Stop has turned into a company that is more worried about what type of numbers an employee can get then how well you serve your customers. If you can't force every customer to reserve a game or get a subscription no matter how good of an employee you are you aren't right for the company. The longer you have been with the company the more likely you are to be replaced. No job security at all turnover is very high unless you luck up into a District Manager or higher position. Don't let this company ruin video games for you.
good,"i need a a better paying job, i barely make ends meet, the pay is bi weekly and minimum wage and im trying to pay bills and eat on this pay check that lasts me 3 days. Bills are barely paid and money is beyond tight."
good,"So I have a huge love/hate relationship with GameStop. This was my first job and was wonderful for being that when I first entered the workforce. That being said, once I entered management, the whole world was turned upside down. The team I had was fantastic and our store was constantly being honored for customer service honors. We even had a considerable sized regular customer base. The problem with GameStop is that it should be a temporary thing. The job is enjoyable but the Corporate hierarchy is the issue. They have no direction as a company and are constantly blaming their downfall on the employees. There is no job security because they will fire you over barely missing metrics even though they say that the metrics aren't the primary goal. To sum it up, get in, get experience in sales, and get out."
good,"As the company started doing worse, they started punish employees for not reaching their daily goals. Pushing surveys and add-ons constantly! Co-workers were nice and manager was receptive."
good,"If you have seniority, you basically get to sit behind the counter while everyone does the work. They don't teach new employees how to handle trade-in transactions for a while."
good,"I have to say working at Gamestop was not what i hope it to be, the employee there was awesome and supportive and gave me pointers on how i can improve on my job, But there was little to no training at all, of course this was a seasonal job but does not give an excuses to what they are expected to provide to you to insure you work effectively at your job, it's clear it has something to do with the higher ups and may never be resolved but at least i know for anyone looking for a first time job and  are still in high school or need something simple it's for you. Just be prepared for little to no training and lackluster hours of work simply. I can at least say that the employees where encouraging and team player."
good,I use too love too work here higher ups are panicing and trying to cram cram cram. With that being said it becomes stressful for the lower end of the  totem pole.
good,The new boss was extremely disrespectful to all emplyees and called them names along with cursing at them.  All he cared about was his own job didnt care about the employees he had because the way he saw it he could just get more.
good,"You work with video games a lot so you'll never be behind on news."
good,"It's good for a casual place to work, But has lost sight of it's goal, Helping customers should ALWAYS be first, Not cramming products down their customers throats."
good,"I think the worse thing about working there is that there is no positive motivation...it's all on how bad u ate doing and need to improve or else..."
good,People everyday say how cool it must be working here. It is a fun job at times but you can’t live on this paycheck unless you’re management. GA’s and SGA’s at my location are now getting 2-3 hour shifts maybe twice a week if your lucky. The only ones getting hours are managers. This is all because of our recent DL making huge changes. I was suppose to be getting a promotion but it keeps getting delayed because he keeps bringing his people in. With the huge cut in hours a lot of people are quitting. So if you want to work here be sure to have another job to survive.
good,Working here at first is pretty fun. You learn about games yeah... but only to push them onto customers. The trade value of games is drastically lower than the sell price only because the company has to make some money.
good,"as a store manager you used to get free games not sure anymore. the payroll hours are low and you,as the only salaried employee are expected to stay and get the work done"
good,I worked as a store leader for gamestop. I was left short staffed with no assistant manager for 7 months then after I was finally able to hire someone i was let go because my store didn't look good in the back room. If you aren't in with your DL you won't last long.
good,"I have very bad tonsils so I often get sick, they didn't give me the day off when I called in sick so I was there with a fever and not feeling good. I also threw up on Thanksgiving and asked to leave early, my manager told me that she would fire me on the spot if I left. That is just wrong to treat your employees that way especially if they are sick, and legit threw up when another employee was next to them."
good,"Gamestop seasonal work is, not a great choice as a job, this is not a commentary on full or part time work for Gamestop because I haven't done that but I will tell you this, they will only ever call you in if they need you and they won't schedule you regularly at least in my experience, this makes it very hard to survive if this is the only job you have, and impossible to balance with an additional job to stay afloat, if you are a kid working a seasonal job because you want a little extra seasonal spending money and you can get hours that match that need then it's fine, but as an adult you cannot afford to work gamestop seasonal, so cross it off your list of prospects if it comes up. That said, my manager was great, he's a nice guy and if you're in the area definitely check out the store if you want to save some cash on games, just don't work there as a way of supporting yourself seasonally."
good,You definitely need to be young at heart and up to date with modern tech and speech. You got to be ready to be robbed and hated on. You must instantly be able to help persons with disabilities.
good,"Too much work and not enough pay for SGA. Fun sometimes, but gets old very quickly. Minimum wage for all entry level employees, and barely opportunities for advancement, let alone raises."
good,"GameStop has become a progressively worse place to work. Having worked at more successful retailers, it is easy to see the fickle nature of GameStop's higher management has caused a lot of problems throughout the company."
good,"I really enjoyed working there, but after a few months, I was starting to feel as if they didn't't want me there anymore. The job was fairly easy, but I didn't like how they always made me be at the front of the store, greeting everyone."
good,"Worked for the company for nearly 10 years. Most of the District leaders I had were great, until my most recent. She was the epitome of ""Boss VS Leader"" her being on the Boss end of the spectrum. It is hard to maintain a sense of passion or desire to perform for someone who is not versed in the culture of the business. She was darn good at reading planograms and reciting policies...but could not adapt to find solutions even on a basic level. And then there's personal stuff that I won't go into here :)"
good,"The first gamestop I worked at was great, the new gamestop I work at is trash and I hate my manager. He’s rude, narcissistic, and self absorbed. Thinks he knows everything."
good,"I've been going to Gamestop for literal years. I have always wanted to work there because of how much I love video games, so when I had a chance to work there, I jumped on the chance. Then working there, it wasn't what I thought it'd be. The numbers that have to be made every single day are so absurd, especially since we don't have control over the guest's money. We can suggest things, but they decide what they want to do. Also management is, uh, yeah..."
good,If you're looking for a job to get you started than this place is for you. Any higher than entry level and it's more stressful than what you're paid for. The company is very goal focused with five goals being the main ones. The issue is those goals will sometimes work against you. All stores have the same goals as well. Which means a small store that will get 5 customers within 4 hours will have the same goals as a mall store.
good,It was a good company to work for.  Lately they have not made employees feel like they are important to the company.  They have pushed employees to use sale pressure techniques.
good,quite a disorganized company with no intent to adapt and evolve. rarely do they care about employees. No room for growth and career advancement is not worth going the extra mile because the salary is really low and unkind.
good,"at the stores i worked at for gamestop it was clear that the customer didnt come first, gamestop did. Management wanted us to sell sell sell, even when it was clear people just wanted to browse games or pick up just a single itme. Our reward prigram had to be mentioned every transaction and if we did not meet goals after some warnings you could easly be let go."
good,"It gave me knowledge and experience to utilize my skills and abilities, for when I was ready to better myself in better job position,I did not work enough hours for the pay rate that I was looking for.The hardest part of the job was i did not work enough hours"
good,Working with Gamestop for over 20yrs was a fun and challenging experience at the same time. The best parts were the guest experience and selling fun. The worst part were the ever changing focuses and multiple merchandising changes.
good,Stressful to complete selling requirements. Good place to expand leadership skills. You can be responsible for people or tasks. The people you meet are fun.
good,"The DL team is ""ok"". Its hit and miss really. If there is something you are doing well, than you're rewarded with some praise. When help is needed or required its a no holds barred atmosphere. I have had some awesome DL's at GS, but there are a lot of ""floaters"" in the company also. Overall, I wish that there was more of a structure for advancement or our Brand Statement, other than the fire drills they perform daily/weekly/monthly/annually."
good,"Overall the job was fine, the worst thing about it was maybe the very quick days (I was a seasonal) like Black Friday or the day after Christmas but overall the general being a Sales Associate experience was fine. The only thing I had an issue with at the store I was at was the management. Often I was being scolded for things I was supposed to learn but was never taught and threatened to be terminated on the spot only because they didn't teach me a simple task. It may have just been the rush of it being the Holiday Season, but even then they do not do much for training to begin with. Manager often just went to the back and played on her phone amidst the rushes and then became upset if I had a question about a transaction process I wasn't accustomed with. Maybe it was just me, but I just know for a first time in retail, GameStop was a horrible experience."
good,I don't want to ever work there again the only thing good about that place is some people ive met and the pay. my job was fun and then they started mobbing me and everyone else around
good,"The work is fairly easy, and can sometimes be fun. However; if your superior is rude with no regard for his/her workers' feelings, it will be a dreadful job."
good,"It is such a top bottom work life. The manager just throws work at you and does nothing lazilly ""cleaning the back room"". I wonder if there's a magical app that is letting them do that because they are on their phone so often ""cleaning""."
good,"Though it is a fun place to work, career advancement is non-existent and they will often put individuals in charge of departments who have no idea how that department works or what is required"
good,"All i can say for this job is, if your a gamer at heart, this is the job for you. i really enjoyed myself when i worked at game stop. You get a chance to talk to really cool people, play great games, make ok money"
good,"I worked at Gamestop a long time ago, so the culture might have changed.  The managers was nice, but since it was a seasonal job, hours were sparse, and I never had enough hours to earn a respectable paycheck.  The employees were nice.  Since it was a seasonal job, there was no room for advancement or permanent employment, and I was not given the training needed to be a cashier and was relegated to a bottom of the totem pole role."
good,"Great place to work for if it wasn’t for all the favoritism from management, that bend the rules as they seem fit. Everyone from supervisor and above been working there for years and are kinda like a big family looking out for each other’s interests., they even have their wives working there and they do whatever they want because they can get away with it."
good,Work behind the counter and infront. When working behind the counter you take care of the register and help checkout customers. When working infront of the counter you have put empty game cases where they belong and help customers find what they are looking for also whether you are behind the counter or not you must keep up with current game trends so that you can help give reviews whether it is good or or bad about the game. It sometimes helps th me customer make a decision
good,"The staff is great everyone becomes very close, the company ask for unrealistic task to be done, they barely give hours most hours go to management. very little pay for the amount of work they want."
good,"Poor incentive/pay, slow and boring. If not for a great group of people I worked with, I would've left long before. Great as a first job and thats about it."
good,"Overall I do enjoy my job with GameStop. There are pros and cons to every job. The environment is fun and full of energy along with supportive coworkers, have made me enjoy coming into work."
good,"The job itself was fun and the atmosphere very relaxed even during the season rush. However, the store was constantly undermined by the managers' infighting and lack of ability to coordinate. Schedules wouldn't come out until the day of and employees would have to call the store to try and figure out what they were supposed to work and one manager took every seasonal aside and promised them a false full-time position after the season in order to make us work harder."
good,"store level is great, but corporate is out of touch. more communication is needed. build a good team in the store and the day to day will be okay, but don't expect to be valued unless you're RL or higher."
good,I think the most enjoyable part of the job was when I was first hired on as a part time employee. I was able to sit and talk games and products with the guests that were excited about them. Workplace culture was a little subpar honestly. Seemed like most of the stores were run with the mentality of highschool students with drama starting as their mission. Otherwise I would say the workplace was great.
good,"If you like games and keeping up with the upcoming games coming out, then this job is ok. The pay is bad, trying to move up in the company is hard, and it's bad when the CEO of the company has been on record talking about how it easy it is replace workers and why would they want to work for a company like this."
good,Too many requirements now. Not about gaming anymore. All about goals and pushing the companies product among consumers. Tasking is simple and basic game knowledge is a requirement
good,My short time with Gamestop I felt like it could be a fun work environment but they need to work on communicating with their management better and also not have such rash punishments for not getting reserves on future games with the state of our economy/income.
good,"Christmas season, fun busy and always full of people. The day after Christmas I went to work as scheduled but the store was closed. None of the managers answered their phones and in the end I went home. I checked out the store later and it was still closed. "
good,It was a fun place to work at but very difficult to move up in the company. I like video games so it was enjoyable to talk to customers about games and give my opinions.
good,"The company as a whole claims to ""protect the family"". However in practice numbers are the sole focus, even overshadowing employee safety in certain circumstances. The environment is a toxic one."
good,"Per gli amanti dei videogame è il posto ideale, specialmente quando bisogna dare consigli ai clienti su quale gioco può essere o meno adatto alle loro esigenze."
good,"Hard to obtain enough hours to sustain. better pay for production, sales were high, but no compensation for those sales"
good,In the 4 years that I was employed with GameStop I found it to be very tedious. Most of the time we were understaffed which caused to hectic work environment along with upset customers. Management was difficult to communicate with as very few complaints were ever actually met.
good,"è stata la mia prima esperienza di lavoro, nata dopo aver frequentato lo stage previsto dal Master in Management del capitale umano,"
good,I'm only typing this because I have I can not continue until twenty words are typed. Here are more words. Nothing to say. My opinion of Gamestop does not matter.
good,"The work days are smooth and easy. I learned management skills being a third key. There is just very little advancement opportunities in this job. The hardest part of this job is learning the week to week sales, since they only work us a few days a week. The most fun I have had in the job is working with the customers. They are all curious about videogames, so it is fun talking to them about what I spend my free time doing."
good,Flott miljø innad i butikken mellom ansatte men dårlig miljø og tone opp til ledelse og regionsledere.
good,"Average retail position with unknown potential upward growth.  Good as a side job but shouldn't be a full time position, the stress to benefit ratio is to far towards hyper stress."
good,"As a GA (Game Advisor, lowest rank) Most of your workday involves tending to customer needs and maintaining the store, however the day in its self is likely to be short. Gamestop has a tendency to request their stores to overhire, and this most of the lower ranking or new employees may not get more than a 3-4 hour shift once per week"
good,"Quickly evolving retail environment that requires a high amount of detailed attention in multiple areas. An environment that is quick to discipline failure but has no sufficient category of award or bonus for being successful. Growth within the company is slow and largely based on favoritism from your immediate supervisors. Very difficult to keep a reasonable work/life balance. The environment is full of opportunities for fun with diverse and interesting staff. Because it is required to understand business management to run a successful store, they do an extensive job training managers to a collegiate level of understanding managing a business. The experience is not measurable on a resume unfortunately."
good,Very fun place to work as a gamer but the hours where very shor and sometimes i would get checks in the double digits. works good as an after school job job but not much else
good,"the management at GameStop is horrible, they work you like a dog for such a small pay is beyond comprehension. I'm a gamer at heart but working at game stop makes one not even want to play video games anymore."
good,"I learned a lot but watched a lot too the company rarely hires from with in, your work day depends more on the mood of who you work with rather then your attitude. At the end of the day it was a fun experience meeting and talking to like minded shoppers."
good,"Although the work itself is great and the co-workers and customers are interesting and fun people, unorganized management leads to unfulfilled promises."
good,"Merchandising, security, opening store, assigning tasks to employees. leading people. Staff was good. Dealing with customers at times and making schedule fit within budget."
good,Company is no longer in business.  However during the time that this company was open the Work/Life Balance was not the Best!
good,"The work wasn't bad, learned some computer skills, management does not back employees. More worried about numbers than actual working product or look of product. Had to worry daily about keeping job."
good,"I worked here for near 10 years, under 4 district managers, 5 store managers,in every role back and forth again. Luckily when I moved from state to state they worked with me and even losing my position it only took 2 months to advance from part timer to Store manager twice. One thing that never changes is every SM and DM are out for themselves and will throw each other under the bus to save their skin. Blame Game seems to be the company wide theme, and the pay just isn't worth it. My true love for gaming kept me there and took me back after I made double at a company I didn't love. Employees are expendable and I watched people who had been there close to 15 years be let go for ridiculous reasons. "
good,It's a fun place to work until you get behind the counter. Behind the counter its high school all over again.
good,"Ive learned a lot in my 4 years at GameStop.  Ive become a better leader and have learned skills that I can take with me to future jobs.  Co-workers are nice and friendly for the most part, but upper management can be very difficult to work with.  I enjoyed the knowledge i earned here and the great people I've encountered over the past 4 years."
good,"A typical day at work involved making sales and selling subscriptions, and having to hear nothing but talk of the co-workers personal problems. I learned how much I really dislike the company and would not suggest working there. You will be able to work and have a life if you are a new hire, due to the fact that you will barely see any hours, your job performance is based on the pre-orders and subscriptions you sell, giving not much chance of advancement in the company. Co-workers are usually whiny about their personal problems and you will get a whole ear full from most of them. My manager was the same as my co workers. The hardest part of the job was actually getting on schedule to work a day. The most enjoyable part of a work day was leaving."
good,"The job itself is very relaxed and the focus is on promoting sales, however, from my experience management is lacking and advancement is based more specifically on who you know rather than performance."
good,"Of all the jobs I've had, being a sales associate for Game Stop had to be the worst. The schedule is arbitrary, with management picking and choosing who will work that week and therefore you are never guaranteed a paycheck and can even be fired without notice simply because the management did not pick you often to work."
good,Great place to work if you into games. Company focuses on sales and meeting quotas.
good,it was good at first but the work place is boring.after a year or so and its the same thing day in and day out. its a good place to work to pay some of the bills but its not good if you plan on doing something with your life.
good,"GameStop is a retailer. You might think it would be a fun, visionary place to work where new ideas are encouraged, new forms of revenue explored and advancement is possible."
good,GameStop is a fine company to work for if you don't mind the low wage and almost non existent hours.
good,Pricipal function: Customer Serivces satisfaction
good,"I love my job. I love the interactions will all the different people on a daily basis. I learned alot of new skills such as inventory specialist and product purchasing. I had a wonderful team of employees who I hired and trained to turn a bottom store into a top half performer. A typical day at work would consist of scheduling, product check in, inventory counts,payroll communication and top level customer service."
good,"I very much enjoy my time at Gamestop during the 11 years I was their. Meeting new recruits and training them as well. Learned from management staff how to do the proper sales behaviors, approach consumers out on the sales floor, recover store during busy business holidays, to be the best you must become the best was basically the motto during my time as a part timer,assistant manager and store manager."
good,"Gamestop is a good company, however management often uses favoritism when assigning hours for work. Culture SHOULD be about customer service, but as expected, it all comes down to money. Good reviews aren't rewarded, however bad reviews are harshly punished. Work is consistent only during the holiday season."
good,"I had a great time with the folks that worked there, even after management got replaced. However, the compensation was not up to par when it came to the work load and requirements set by corporate. There was no job stability and very little opportunity for advancement."
good,It's a good place to work. It's challenging but it gave me skills that i can use in other jobs.
good,It was a fun place to work. Your ideas were taken into consideration and the employees really vibe well together which help the customers feel better to.
good,"This would be an amazing place to work, if the company was in good standing. Since the company is not doing that well and I cannot give a good/bad reference about the company and ""the typical day at work."" When I first got here, I loved it! Everyone was friendly and it seemed like the best place to work. I still like my job, but there is not job security as much as it use to be. :("
good,"Coworkers and customers are friendly, this job is good for someone who is in high school and looking for a part time job. I would not recommend this job to someone who is in college and needs money."
good,"Gamestop is no longer competitive as a company. With multiple rebranding attempts with cellular devices, collectors merchandise, ect not driving more business. A big push has moved to digital and other competitors offering the same product at cost or better."
good,"Apertura e pulizia negozio con conseguente apertura cassa"
good,"Exciting new content and goals weekly, this is a very busy job to work for during the holidays. If you are not working management you may need a second job but the hours are flexible enough to do so."
good,"Very stressful work environment, with poor management at most of the time."
good,"Day to day, Gamestop is Statistic Hungry for their sales “culture” that is out dated and frankly failing. The company is going under and trying to many things at once to try and save itself from failure. Internally the management is grasping at straws and often punishing good employee behavior for not being enough to sustain the dying business. Example being one of my employees selling a customer a game system with some games and a warranty but not getting a preorder for a product unrelated to the customer’s interest, this is a punishable offense because the company already paid for so many copies of said game so everyone needs to sell it to everyone that walks in the door. The gamestop system is broken. The only thing that makes this job worthwhile is the regular customers that walk through the door, who generally enjoy games and the gaming industry but even that is tainted by the need for employees to up sell every single thing while being forced to act like a friend. As full time management I make $11.50 an hour with overtime not allowed which the company recently said I should be great full for."
good,It's going to be a hard on you to be dishonest by selling something to someone that they do not need. Pressure to sell a magazine in this day and age. Lol😅
good,"The company is a veritable mixed bag in its culture; some ideas are given full chances and managers are given space to grow, but many other ideas are shot down or ignored, only to be implemented literal years later when the opportune timing has passed. Management is also very quick to encourage turn over, to keep wages low. Higher management further ignored drastic human resources complaints until lawsuits were threatened."
good,"While the stay of my employment with gamestop was very informative and helped me grow much as a sales person and as a person in general, I am glad that I left when I had. The upper management at the company has a serious disconnect with the store level employees, and will only continue to pile on more and more responsibilities onto their store leaders and management teams without any real compensation for the amazing work their workers put into their stores."
good,"It really is hit or miss with GameStop and ultimately depends on your field leadership. My District managers were all fantastic people, but I've heard horror stories from other regions"
good,The company puts a lot of stress on their employees to succeed but pay them all minimum wage and their management gets paid what a regular cashier at wawa gets paid.
good,"Good environment of people that know the business and care about it and one another. They are aware of the need to change their business model and are working to do so. "
good,"As much as i enjoyed working at Gamestop, they are very behind the times when it comes to gaming. Upper management is only concerned about the bottom line and not about the customers"
good,As a young boy I always wanted to work for Gamestop. They get you in with promise of many hours and opportunities to advance from within. You can expect 15-20 hours per week on a good week and starting out at $8.50. I'm trying to start a family and save up for future events. Gamestop is not a place to make a career. Corporate has been lying to employee more and more about the state of our company and the security of our jobs. They have cut our benefits and now require us to work on all major holidays (except Christmas).
good,The store management were fine to work for but metrics rule all things at Gamestop. You were constantly pushed to get people signed up to purchase magazine subscriptions and other high profit items that most customers were not looking to purchase.
good,GameStop is a retail company that relies on variable data to schedule employees. This may hinder most employees from maintaining full or event part-time hours that make working at GameStop worth the hassle. The positive is it is a low-stress job that a monkey can do.
good,"It’s a place where it’s good as a first job. But eventually you start to realize that it’s not enough to live on. Growth from within is hardly achieved, and they would rather hire managers and district managers from the outside that don’t know anything about video games and what’s popular. They do ask a lot from you and if you don’t echieve certain goals, even if it’s a problem with the store location in itself, they’ll fire you. But they do train you how to treat customers and make sales."
good,"GameStop can be pretty fun. You get to talk to people about games, make suggestions, give advice, etc. You don't necessarily need video game experience to be able to do the job well. The experiences you'll have though vastly different from a store to store basis. A poor manager and set of coworkers can make working there miserable."
good,You will be responsible for making the store look presentable while running the register. You will also accept and process trade-ins of older games and are encouraged to sell a magazine subscription and reservation of an upcoming game every transaction.
good,It's a great place to work if you like to have fun conversations or don't have any real responsibilities. Not the place to go if you're looking for a healthy paycheck.
good,"As a gamer, you'll enjoy working here for a while. Aside from the occasional gaming elitist, irate parent, or misbehaving child/teenager, a lot of the coworkers and some of the managers I've met are great to talk and work with. Upper management, however, is completely terrible. After the 'honeymoon' period, you'll quickly come to realize that the expectations they're putting upon you and your team are highly unrealistic, despite the fact that they'll write you up for it just the same. Regardless of how much work you put in or how much time you sacrifice, career advancement depends highly on favoritism. This breeds spite, anger, and disillusionment within the workplace rather quickly."
good,"For the most part working for Gamestop is fun and exciting.  However, pay could be better.  Scheduling to allow for a personal life outside of work could be  A LOT better."
good,"Working at GameStop is a rough experience, you're more than likely going to work long hours and not get paid that well, benefits are slim and the discount is mediocre. However, it is nice to hear all of the upcoming news about games a little sooner."
good,"typical day is people buying games and asking the same questions."
good,"The best part of working at GameStop are your co-workers, because it's almost like one big dysfunctional family that all get along. The biggest downside is the disconnect between upper management and those on the store level because they expect so much without giving much in return."
good,"This is a fast paced company, with many cooks in the kitchen. Task oriented positions are clearly defined and rewarding if you have the right manager."
good,"My only issue with this job was how very little I got to work. My week of work was only one day for three or four hours a week. They did not seem to like having few employees work many hours like a normal company would, instead they would hire a group of people and give them very small shifts."
good,"I learned a lot while working for the company. I gained some work experience during my short time there. The schedules rotated, you worked with different manages on different days.  The store was very small and very cluttered at times. They have really good business coming in. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning how to scan items and introducing customers to  new game arrival and seeing their eyes light up when we have the item for them. I did not like the fact that some employee were sick and came to work that way. The work culture appears to be diverse. Getting used to diverse  customers and co-worker community."
good,Loved what I did at the job. Very high standards for sales without follow up on boarding process. Middle management lacks understanding and is not interested in your success as a person but rather you bringing success to them. Looks at people as a commodity to make money not money as a commodity to make people.
good,"I feel this job is mainly for people that starting out looking for jobs, I highly suggest that you have another job on the side because they will give you little hours and not much pay."
good,"Overall it was a decent workplace until I transferred to a new location. Hours became scarce to the point I had to find new employment. However, had I the chance to go back with more hours, I would do it in a heartbeat."
good,"It was temporary and at the moment it helped  I did learn good organization from straightening the games on the shelves, and built on good customer service."
good,district managers micro manager more then providing help support or caring about there employees. no opportunities to really shine or get promoted showing the company that you are there to provide and help customers. pushed to constantly bug customers about credit programs and extra services that most customers decline even before the transaction begins
good,"This is not a job for people who like video games.  The head of this company know next to nothing about video games or how to cater to their fans.  That being said, most of the employees are cool, and the store leaders are cool too, but just be ready for upper management to try and push a culture of pushing sales and member's club cards.  A larger and larger focus on toys and collectibles is being pushed recently, when the main focus should be making sure games are at the front and center.  Also, the in-store programming they have on the TVs is borderline insulting with how much it treats customers like brainless dollar signs."
good,"You'll learn a lot of good and usable skills, sales wise of course."
good,"A typical day at work is processing incoming products, outgoing products and helping the guest."
good,"My last boss and district manager were extremely unfair to employees. I was told that a month after I had been transferred to the store I would receive a promotion due to the other person who was leaving with in the next month. Instead of pressing for the other manager to leave when he had another job he was investing in and a long drive that took away from his life, I was not promoted.There was even another store desperate for another manager or store owner that was not brought to my attention from the upper management. Previously before I had transferred to this store I was trained past my job title to be prepared for further advancement. I was one of the top employees in that district. I felt very proud of myself, and yet due to these people I felt that I was under appreciated for my accomplishments and my work performance as a whole.I also believed that jealously played a big part in not being recognized and promoted as well. It was one of my many reasons to leave aside from poor management. "
good,"Easy job. Only amount of difficulty is the sales portion they require certain amount of sales for each category  such as pro cards, trades, reserves, pre-own. Which are set pretty high now. Another bad would be the management not professional set hours based on favorites not by work ethic or numbers."
good,"This was once a fun job to go to. Was excited to go in for all my shifts. However, it's only fun until you get into management. They promote friends over those who have been there longest or understand the company the best and then underpay their support employees. Though it is a relatively relaxed jobs, the forced quotas on sales and reserves are a huge stresser and in some areas, management encourages employees to use dishonest practices to achieve those numbers."
good,Die Erwartungen der Geschäftsführungen sind nicht S.M.A.R.T. .
good,"Everyone quits, and you're over pressured to to everything. Circle of Life is the worst concept. They expect you to reach outstanding levels of sales and if you don't you scolded like a child."
good,The job is fun. Its really not much to do but help guest and have fun doing it. You just have to have enough patients with the guest.you have to make sure that you perform to company standards at all times. You'll have some customers who are every day customers who would only come to you for advice on some products.
good,"Gamestop overall was a satisfying place to work, but for the hours you are expected to put in, the jobs you are required to do, and the things they add to your job description on a drop of a hat. Between being a Cricket employee, a gamestop employee, a clothes seller, a collectable salesman, if you work there, they always undercut your pay for what is expected of you."
good,It was a decent part time job for a kid who was in high school and needed extra cash for the weekend. I gained some good retail experience and customer servicing skills.
good,"It is like any other retail place, shove company services down peoples throats and get in trouble when people don't buy extra stuff. Unrealistic expectations from management and corporate. OK place for a part time or after school job."
good,"Game stop gives great job experience but it lacks on the career level. Advancement can be difficult. The work load is typically simple, the schedules can be kind of out there. But for Job experience it is absolutely great."
good,Huge separation from upper management and in-store management. The systems put in place by upper management create an unfriendly and sometimes hostile attitude between employees.
good,"It's a good seasonal job for some extra holiday money. I understand that it was a seasonal job , but never got a call back to go back to work. I called and they told me that they forgot to tell me that I am not needed anymore."
good,"Last manager I had said he regularly hired ""cute"" girls so they would flirt with customers and make up sales.  We had to compete for hours meaning the better pie dames the more hours we'd be scheduled.   You don't work on commission so you see no real benefits, but your manager does.  Back in 2012, trade ins were what we were trained to push,  also selling used games not new titles.  Up selling pre orders was paramount and more than expected, now that gamestop has their own credit card pushing sign ups is part of that as well.  People were hesitant about the rewards program and that was just discounts I can only imagine the saltiness regarding a credit card."
good,"If youre looking for something easy, with a lot of hours to make a quick buck, this is your place, it's grueling and a lot of work, but advancement is extremely achievable."
good,"Due to lack of support from upper management. More of a do what I say company. When problems arise you get told just to ""handle it"". Barley and upper management visits is rural areas."
good,"count money, collect games, transaction for customers stock gaming systems, restock shelves with games dust off shelves alphabetize games vaccum floors and clean restroom"
good,"Experiences can vary greatly depending on who your district manager is. My personal experience was not a pleasurable one and I often felt more like a number on a page than an actual person. However, if you do well, you will get a pat on the back."
good,"I've been with the company for several years now, with the same two managers. I know the system and how it works. Not once, not twice, but several times I have been passed over as an assistant manager because ""I already work a full time job"". They never spoke with me one on one about the position, nor asked my opinion on it. They would rather hire seasonal employees and make them managers and have ME train them, then just promoting me. I do A LOT of the ""managerial"" stuff only to be paid a little over minimum wage."
good,"Over my time at GameStop I have thoroughly enjoyed the people I have worked with, and the customers I have met. But when it comes to the job, it is upsettingly inconsistent. Management constantly ask for different, contradictory goals, and ask too much of the store and the workers. One week we were told to focus on sales, and told that helping the customer was less important. The next week, we were told just to focus on customers and not sales. In regards to hours, stores are given very little payroll, so that the only person who is full time is the Store Leader (General Manager). When late night events come around, stores aren't often given more hours, which forces us to cut shifts short elsewhere and leave people without coverage during shifts. I was specifically told by the District Manager that a 'livable wage' does not start until you are an Assistant Store Leader (Assistant General Manager)."
good,"Great work place, with fun employees. Work exceeded the pay, real sales came from game reservations and magazine subscriptions but no incentives to push sales or rewards."
good,There is no grace period for an “until” shift. I was let go for points but I was late one minute for the points I received. They hire and fire 90 employees every peak season from September to February. As the trainer I trained multiple people at a time also having a deadline on when I had to finish my line of boxes to be shipped that day. Checking employees errors on Integrated computer application. To ensure 99.8 percent accuracy of what we sent to our stores.
good,Hi pressure sales structure.  Performance paced on sales.  Threats if you didn't meet sales numbers.  One of the few jobs that you can stand around and talk about video games and not get in trouble for.
good,This company is at the forefront of gaming and all of its advancements. you will learn new things and meet new people with similar interest's that will expand your knowledge of the gaming industry.
good,"- Fun to work with guests, if you enjoy talking about video games."
good,"This job is fun and exciting for a gamer. However, as mainstream gaming moves more towards digital, this has forced GameStop into a numbers game. Where you are judged based on the number of reservations and membership sales. Good part-time job, that's about it."
good,"if you can make sure to be on top of your sales numbers and keep producing, you can learn a lot at the company.having to split your time between customers and daily tasks is the toughest part of the job, but must be done all of the time."
good,A very Stressful job where i pretty much got called in early everyday of on my days off. just because i was a good worked and got a 100% in sales the abused my work. they always said they would promote me but 3 new hires in and gone they cant even trust their best worker. discounts were on 15%and only worked to preowned products and circle of life had you meet unrealistic goals
good,"GameStop as a company may have been going through an identity crisis during my years there.  They dabbled in many different business ventures including phone trade-ins and digital content sales and always had a new way of judging each employee.  However, it was a great learning experience in sales and customer service.  The constantly changing environment helped mold a more robust mindset in today's competitive marketplace."
good,Gamestope is trying to remain relavent in the digital age and its hard. The pressure to create the extra sale points are becoming very pushy to meet these new standards
good,I can't really speak much about this job as it's been over 6 years since I worked there. It was okay at the time but the culture was shifting quite a bit.
good,"its a place where you are just a number to the hire ups, you aren't compensated for the work you do. if you like video games it a fun place to work but its not all it seems"
good,"The way that Gamestop is going is putting more pressure on the employees. They don't get the greatest pay, but does have a positive work environment. Of course that depends on management and store culture."
good,"Gamestop has been my main job for around 2 years, however now that I've moved out and have bills to pay, Gamestop's 16 hour work weeks on top of the less than $10 an hour just doesn't cut it. Not a bad job by any means, great co-workers and flexible hours and scheduling make it very work to life friendly place to be, on top of the support of the employees who might become your new best friends."
good,"Workplace was quality, but the management structure beyond the physical store held unrealistic expectations for sales that punished employees for not meeting these."
good,"My manager would leave to his son's baseball games, therefore leaving me alone at the store for the whole work day. Hectic yet somewhat rewarding and fun."
good,"There is a very high expectation to have sale quotas always met, and when they are below, there is a serious loss of hours. Customers are a nice blend of people."
good,"Overall, and ok place to work, depending on the day. Sales metrics were sometimes unrealistic, and upper management would sometimes ask for unethical behaviors to take place in order to hit these quotas."
good,Fun environment for the most part. Very small chance for advancement and low pay even if advanced into a better position. Once was a better place before all the sales goals became more important than the gaming environment and customer experience.
good,"It was an easy starter job as far as pressure but the management was ineffective, this was the main reason for my leaving. The customers made the work experience bearable."
good,"With the right team this is a great job, but can quickly devolve into a mess. Customers are great, if everything is taken care of properly 99% of customer issues are avoidable or easily resolved. Scheduling is horrible and holidays are a great way to get your foot in the door if you do well."
good,nothing special here. it consist of sales and merchandising. some reading may be required for customer inquiry. there is little micro management and expected to be efficient.
good,One of the worst places I have ever worked. The district I worked on was more worried about how attractive a employee was then about the job they did.
good,"Ultimately this company can be fun and very interactive with its customers. However on the corporate side of things it does not matter how friendly you are or how many customers you help or how hard you work. You are required to up sell 4 very specific things that many customers are not prone to buying. If these sales cannot be met, hours are cut and eventually termination. These things are also often in fact out of the employee's hands and up to the customer to decide if they want."
good,"Its retail. You are required to keep things tidy, know the products, engage with customers, and be lucky if you maintain your position for more than a few months. "
good,Gamestop had lots of requirements which meant if you missed even one of these requirements you would worry for your jobs safety
good,"Receive daily shipments, ship out product to stores and customers. Balance books at end of day. Train employees on new procedures."
good,"You will get very few hours unless holidays. Manager changes every few months to year because of high expectations on sales from corporation. You are pushed to go for subscriptions, trade ins, and preorders and hours will be determined based on how you do which is ridiculous  as a lower level employee so nearly impossible to move up. favoritism over actual skill takes place all the time. customers are rude most of the time and dont understand you are not in charge of prices. literally no one in the store is. has a very bad harassment policy"
good,this job is fun and has a very friendly environment. wages are fair but they cap out kinda low. i would not say its a good long term job though. good job for experience.
good,"Good for a first-time job or temporary retail job (to build work experience, mainly). Hours were finicky, with shifts being offered a day before or day of. Went days and even a week without any hours offered to me."
good,"Working with team makes things a lot easier, especially if you are new. Ask plenty of questions. Seems as if they like to throw people to the sharks right away."
good,at this company  you had make sure it was a clean work space also you had to make sells on games the pay and hours was horrible also  one minute they telling you to come next we don t need you now
good,"Game stop has it's moments. A lot to get done in a very limited amount of time. Hours are cut continuously, expectations are high and if your not up to it can be very overwhelming and stressful. It can be fun  dependent on the environment you as a store leader can create."
good,"Fun job, easy tasks to accomplish and plenty of customer service experience from this job. Giving information to individuals with little knowledge of electronic products. Its a good job with good supporting people and management but with few hours."
good,"Had a blast interacting with the customers and meeting new people, for the short span of each transaction. Wasn't a good fit for the company's overzealous and often intrusive sell culture, and ended up leaving due to my manager's inability to work around my college schedule. My co-workers were some of the nicest people I've worked with, most likely because they were either close in age or were in school like myself. The hardest part of my job I would say was constantly trying to shove extra product warranties down the customers' throats every transaction. It got old really quick. The most enjoyable part of the job I thought was working midnight launches for popular games. Easiest crowds to deal with, and lots of free energy drinks on deck."
good,"Working at GameStop is more than just a career decision, it is a lifestyle choice.  As a GameStop manager, you can expect to work extreme hours with insufficient compensation.  Like most retailers, payroll is the first cut always made and Store Managers are used to cover the missing hours.  Be prepared to be called on your days off and all hours of the day.  Remember, if there are employees in your store, you are always on call.  Thats 364 days a year 8:30a-10pm."
good,I have worked here more almost 9 years with very little advancement past Store Manager without relocating.  The amount of work put in vs. the compensation is no there
good,"Worked at the company for over 9 years and while I had a great time working with local store managers and associates, the district and regional managers did a terrible job providing adequate incentives for employees to stay with the company.  Pay is poor and employees are often given confusing and poorly planned sales goals/requirements.  Advancement within the company is also poor with little to no opportunity to move onto a higher position, or at worst dictated by the whims of the district manager and his attitudes towards you personally."
good,"Typical day was okay , could get a bit stressful and annoying during high traffic hours. management puts toomuch pressure and expectations on you."
good,Over all working for GameStop wasn't bad but for me was very demanding on ones own time they do tell you to not make plans as far as your own personal time.
good,"Not the worst company in the world to be honest, far from it. The ranks of staff are filled with lively employees with a passion and knowledge of gaming."
good,Environment was right with the right management. The district manager was never easily accessible for high priority concerns/needs. Customer base varied depending on location but is generally pretty busy.
good,"Working at Gamestop  was okay at first then, we started receiving some bogus mangers that didnt need the position. .. I have been with  the company or almost three years. and they will not advance me because the manager doesnt want too. .. I work hard and always the one to get called in when others don't come. I don't receive no recgnition"
good,GameStop is long hours with no real pay. I started off as as seasonal worker and I didn't get paid for 2 months straight. Days are long and the coworkers are not helpful.
good,"I have vowed to never work retail again. The management at the store specifically was a pleasure to work for. However, the district manager was terrible."
good,"working in gaming is fun, but poor decisions at the corporate level as well as shoddy managment hinders the experience."
good,"GameStop is a job you work if you want to have unrealistic expectations thrown at you every day, and be penalized for not being able to get those expectations accomplished. Customers are very rude, the pay is mediocre, and the hours are slim to none if you aren't in a manager position."
good,"Hardest part of the job is managing the holidays while under staffed and strapped for payroll.  Co-workers are typically enjoyable to be around, laid back environment."
good,"Worked for two+ years and as a job, it is fun and rewarding. However hours fluctuate a lot, there is little compensation if you are not part of management, and there's barely any room to move up in the job despite qualifications and experience. Low pay grade. Can be a fun experience with the right people, but with other people it can be frustrating and bothersome."
good,"I have to say working at gamestop is a drag. When you first get there it was fun and get to hang around with video games. However it  dies out after the first month, when you get bogged down with preorder and subscription qoutas. They drill this into you that if you don't perform well, you will get replaced or your hours go down. Also with inventory problems. There are vast amount of inventory of video games and it is very hard to keep account of when employees misplaced them or game cases get thrown around the store."
good,A typical day at work deals with being in a fast paced environment with customers walking every few minutes. We have to us up-selling skills to go above and beyond for our customers and to set us apart from our competitors.
good,"The company overworks the management, while failing to provide hours to the customer service reps to save any money they can on even providing a decent work environment to any employee."
good,"My typical day at work is usually fast paced, long, but fun. I learned that there was lot that goes into Gamestop than just games its self, you have to have knowledge about up coming games, systems, and how to sell. Management was bad, the managers never really did what their was suppose to do such as keeping up with the schedule, training new employees, and actually being at the store. I had no problem with my co- workers, everyone did what they was suppose to do. The hardest part of the job what pulling all the games back into place and midnight release. I think the most enjoyable part about work is having fun customers."
good,"Working at GameStop was fun but I feel like the management could have been a little bit better. My manager was almost always on break and pretty much left all of the work to the Assistant Manager and the Gaming Advisors. Also, the hours were pretty bad. They were constantly cut down. The most enjoyable part of the job were the games and being able to talk to the different customers that walked in. It was really fun working with my co-workers as well. I've learned a lot about retail while I was there. I learned if you engage customers in a conversation about the merchandise, that they are more likely to buy something. So basically I learned how to make sales."
good,Nice temp place to work. Fun people. Fast pace and not a job for people who don't want to work.
good,"Sold gaming systems and games to customers."
good,Overall rating was about a 3. Management was content and was able to take care of a lot.
good,"The hardest part of a day is dealing with the sometimes far fetched demands of upper  management. Not the store manager per say, but the district manager. I realize there is a benchmark for corporate performance, so when a person that doesn't deal with the brand of customers our location serves spoon feeds me garbage about the bottom line morale plummets. "
good,"While the customers and store staff are some of the best people I've ever worked with, the leadership of the company from the district level up is by far the worst.  Anything above the store level is only focused on numbers and don't care at all about the customer or the customers experience.  "
good,"I come in and receive whatever projects that I have for the day. I log into the register and help any customers that are currently in the store."
good,"* Long work days. A lot of midnights and 12 hour days. "
good,didnt no alot about gaming so it made it hard to work there and answer customer questions
good,"A typical day at work is stacking games, cleaning, and ringing up.i learned the difference between RPG and first person shooter. learning video games."
good,"It's retail, so you can't expect a ton of great things from customers.  The scheduling is very inconsistent with what days/hours you will work.  Unless you are a key holder (manager) your hours will be very minimal 6pm-9pm split amongst 2 or 3 people over the week."
good,"At Gamestop, you will be asked to do, inventory managing, customer service resolution(which there will be a lot of since many policies deter customers), have sales objectives, and manage your team plus their schedules all with the only incentive of actually keeping your job. They have prepared me to be very good with people and customer relations, and your customers end up being usually the highlight of my day. Many people are happy to just be in your store talking about your games. That being said, all other aspects of Gamestop are harder to deal with, with low information dissemnation, lack of care for employees, and a quick turn around of staff because of this make it a lot less of a dream job than many avid gamers may think."
good,The company asks for so much while offering so little. The easiest park of the job is doing the job. The hardest part of the job is cleaning up people's messes while trying to do your job as well.
good,"Your looking at a 9 to 10 hours workday."
good,"I honestly love the gaming industry and the people that I've met along the way because of this interest. I thought that it'd be great to work with people that had many of the same interests as I do. I was correct in this aspect of this job. A big part of the job is giving people who don't know anything about the products, and really have no interest to, a speedy lesson in what they are looking for as well as confirming or busting rumors flying around about each of the products. Many of the customers also asked for troubleshooting on any type of product. According to policy, we were supposed to just give people the service number for the product and send them away. We, typically, helped people out - plugging in their system and troubleshooting it ourselves with the customer present. This really helped us create a positive relationship with each customer, even if we couldn't figure out the problem in the end. "
good,Co-workers are nice and friendly and customers are a delight. Management can be a pain when your making a customer happy but not selling them specific game they tell you too. 
good,"Your typical work week is 5 days, 44 hours, but if your store has needs above and beyond this you'll be expected to pick up the slack and you won't be compensated for it then or later.  This can lead to 7 day, 80+ hour workweeks if you don't train and staff your store properly."
good,"A good place to work if your passionate about video games, but that's pretty much it. Management can be good or bad it all depends on the store, but all in all not to bad a place to work as long as your not planning a career out of it."
good,Work life is great. Management isn't so good at their job. Bi weekly pay. No advancement available. Job security is not so secured. Short breaks.
good,"On a typical day I clock in, count serialized inventory, count cash registers and safes, present marketing, execute required actions given via email from district management, train junior employees, and make lots of sales. My co-workers are friendly. Management is mostly unrewarding to exemplary performance, rather normally reacts to adverse performance. This job is not difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job is playing Mario Bros on break."
good,I have worked at Gamestop for 14 years and have had many ups and downs. Unfortunately the downs were exhausting. As far as retail goes it is probably one of the best companies to work for but there have been a few people in executive positions that make decisions but don't know how stores should opperate. We were required to hire many seasonal employees but weren't given hours to train people.
good,Dedication and work are important to the company. Sometimes more so then family. Limited possibility to advance. Prefer to hire from without.
good,I've always enjoyed the job but advancement is very tough and the pay is not excellent. Even after working for the company for six years with near perfect performance evaluations I still have not been offered any sort of a promotion despite expressing interest in the possibility.
good,"So here's the deal: I worked at GS for a month under five years, and the only reason I made it that long is because I followed the same manager around from store to store, and so did a few other employees. The job itself is not hard as long as you have good knees (you will be on them quite often, filing games) know the alphabet (for alphabetizing the games), and are fairly comfortable talking to people. Where the job get's frustrating is when you take District Managers into account. Their goals are completely unrealistic, and as a result, you will be forced to spam your customers with questions (pre-order these five things! Buy our card!) instead of simply interacting with them like normal human beings. This makes the customers pretty upset. If you don't believe me just search the internet or any message board for ""gamestop"", and you'll see I'm telling the truth."
good,"Work here started with coming in, and immediately cleaning up the store, This was ok. But I'd much rather have been talking to customers. My duties were informing customers about games, and I loved that to death. I would talk with people about games for as long as they were in the store. They were usually really happy for the help and often took my suggestions for games they would like. During busy times I had register duties and that was ok, but it's hard to remember all the things I was supposed to promote while trying to get through a line of 8 - 10 customers that just want to leave."
good,A typical day at work consist of Helping customers and making sure the store was clean.
good,"Working at GameStop can be fun for the most part if you enjoy interacting with customers. For the most part when you start you'll be either on the sales-floor fixing the shelves and fixtures, greeting customers, or you'll be behind the cash register checking out merchandise. The hard part will be handling trade-ins because they may take a while at first and you have to go through a system of checks to ensure it's the product is able to be traded in."
good,Not a job you'd want to support your way through any financials you may have. A job you'd want if you wanted to make a few extra bucks if you felt comfortable in the gaming community.
good,"Boss doesn't teach you everything, not only well you be treated like an idiot from your own boss, but you'll have angry customers, and you are left to blame for not trying hard enough with something that you have no knowledge of"
good,"Good job to get through High school or college with, but they dont have the hours or position to advance to keep most employees. Working their will teach all the tragedies of what retail life really is."
good,"For a ""part time job"" it's ok but not good enough if looking for a steady paying job  so I would say look for something better because gamestop is usually not the place to apply."
good,Working at the same company for 11yrs provides the opportunity to work with a large number of employees.  I saw a lot of different Supervisor and Management styles.
good,I’ve i had to describe working there 1 manager was try to be “considerate” to other workers and in the process upset me. I’ll never work there ever again
good,"The company is great, haven't had any problems with the company at all. With GameStop being my first job, I can't seem to find myself liking retail or even thinking it was a good job for me in the first place. Learning this about myself sets me up to find another job some where else."
good,"Not a lot of growth and motivation in a company that needs to build to the future. I was lucky to have a strong manager as others aren't so lucky, the chain of command from corporate and down could be a lot stronger."
good,It was my first job so I wasn't very sociable with my coworkers but I was constantly helping the customers. I was expected to work the register but i was barely taught how over 2 or 3 others.
good,It was decent but I needed more hours. I enjoyed the customers but the corporate I didnt enjoy.they seemed distant. Overall it was a good experience that shaped my future
good,"I can honestly say the culture was what kept me here for so long. I really liked working here, we got the same customers all the time. The customer honestly made it worth the pain."
good,"I enjoyed working for gamestop. I was part time and my hours were perfect for a student. The climate was relaxed and the job was easy. If you are part time, you dont get breaks. The only thing that ruined it for me was management. My manager was rude and she used innapropiate language towards all employees. Theres only so much one can take before you reach your limit."
good,"The district managers of this company only care about your sales even though you don’t get commission and you don’t get paid much anyways for the work you do. I absolutely love the atmosphere, but I also also a victim of a completely sexist boss who said my presence in the store was only to get sales since I was “pretty”. If you work here, make sure you have a good boss who respects you and doesn’t push sales too much."
good,"Ottimo ambiente di lavoro con i propri colleghi, ma è richiesta lavoro extra da casa"
good,"I have been with GameStop for nearly nine years and the company looks to be a very real part of the future. They are results-oriented and willing to try new things. That said, upper management fails to give adequate clarity or leadership when it comes to new directions they decide to take throughout each year and work/life balance is quite possibly their last concern."
good,"I was only there part time for some extra cash (and the discount) so I enjoyed the work I did there. Turnover is pretty high and I don't recommend it if you're looking for a full time job/living wage, but for a hobby/second job for me it was great."
good,"While the job was relatively easy, there is a lot of responsibility. No real room for promotion, or even raises. Despite being and employee of 5+ years."
good,"This company gives 0 help or care to their employees. They pretend to care and they pretend to try to help but in the end it all came down to money and the workplace. My father had a really bad help issue and almost died but they wouldn't let me go to see him in the hospital because i had to ""Open the store"" and refused to work with me and help me. Thats just the beginning of the issues i had with them."
good,For the most part the work environment was good talking to different types of people and learning a lot about the video game feild. Downside is management held people to different standards and seemed all too eager to let people who had the numbers get away with far too much.
good,"at gamestop, we were forced to try and get the most money out of a customer as possible, i didnt enjoy ripping people off. It was not a pleasant job for me, although i am good with sales, getting people to spend or lose more money than they wanted to was not enjoyable for me."
good,The company was good when it came to an hourly job but it isn’t great when it comes to a career. The company seems to pass over woman for promotional opportunities.
good,But not good for long term. Lots of pressure to make sales with little incentives. Very seasonal base. You will be fighting for hours in anyway you can
good,"The manager was very good at micro managing. He was a good guy though. The Circle of Life sucks and is followed so closely that you'll get written up if you can't get customers to buy certain things, even if they don't really want to. The district manager position had so much turnover that things were changed on you last minute. Other than that, the other employees were great. They're knowledgeable, nice, and truly caring. If you were having a rough time, they'd do what they could to help you. No benefits though. And even after a promotion I got $9 an hour."
good,"Working at Game Stop was a lot of fun. Until you become a keyholder. I haven't had a retail job before, and signing on as a seasonal employee over the Holidays gave me a crash course in how day-to-day operations work in a store. They also gave me the opportunity to become a part-time guest advisor. I was able to work through my 3 years of being there to become a senior guest advisor/keyholder. thought that's when you begin to hate everything about GameStop. The pay for GameStop as gotten much better at least in my state."
good,I was hired as Key holder. . .  But all the customer believed I was the store manager because I was there all the time and In was the only dealing with customer problems. When I started working at this store their was stuff everywhere it was like a jigsaw puzzle to find anything that including games! After 3 mo of the same old stuff I resign from my position.
good,L’ ambiente lavorativo è ultra stressante e si ricercano dei canoni che sono quasi impossibili da soddisfare
good,"GameStop is an amazing company that works very hard to provide it's customers with a mission statement that benefits them greatly. However, this is a job more suited for high school or part time college students. the pay is minimum wage and at $11.00 and hour is extremely difficult for an adult who is trying to provide for a family to succeed. Your promotions are based on sometimes unrealistic goals set by the company to get pre-orders on games or their gamestop pro membership program as well as getting customers to fill out surveys to give feedback about the company's policy's or promotions. based on these factors alone do they give their employee's the opportunities for advancement or pay raises. In my opinion this is at times unfair due to the fact that if you cannot get your customers to buy more or pay for memberships they consider you to be not doing your job to the best of your ability. Instead I believe they should focus less on what makes them money and on the drive of the employee. It is my belief that game stop is an excellent company who cares greatly for his customers and most of its employee's however the fact that starting level pay is extremely low and opportunity for promotion or advancement leaves much to be desired from its employee's."
good,"Gamestop is generally a numbers/performance based company. They set out daily tasks to compete against previous annual numbers. Most of the daily goals is to persuade customers to buy add on's such as warranties, pre-orders and subscriptions. In addition  you have the go against previous sales goals which can easily go against you since trying to beat a sales goal from the previous day/year can be unrealistic. This can really go against you since Gamestop employs a ""Circle of Life"" program which monitor's your individual performance and can effect an employment. This isn't the type of company to rely on for growth from the bottom up. Usually the company hires from the outside when looking for higher store positions. Management is somewhat questionable as well. Some store managers can be decent to work with, however most of the decisions isn't determined by a store manager but upper management and sometimes the direction of the store can be out of the manager's hands."
good,"Forced to meet high pre-order figures or you get less hours.  This leads to less opportunity to get pre-orders, thus granting you even less hours, over and over again.  The pay is minimum wage, and even managers get paid next to nothing and have to work over 40 hours per week, sometimes off the clock just to get things done."
good,The company has a lot going for it but it uses cheap tricks and dated business practices that are driving customers away.They need to compensate employees at a fair comparison to what is asked of them.
good,"Overall the job is demanding, but fun to deal with videogames. The guests of the store tend to be some of the worst parts of the place, as most of the time things are relaxed when just employees go about their day, but the overall disdain for GameStop and their ever growing hatred from many is beginning to take its toll. As a game designer and avid gamer, I enjoy the job compared to other retail because we all are there for games. Most staff I have worked with have been great but I know of instances where it is not so."
good,"its alright, the current assistant manager could be the best store manager sadly she isn't yet but I hope she does one day. it was fun but no support from the store manager at all."
good,"At the time when I was attending college, working for Gamestop was great. Unfortunately, very minimal to no job opportunities to advance and no benefits."
good,"This is a retail job. There is not much more to say. Holidays are hard on the staff, but there are some benefits. The people who perform the best get access to free things like video games. In addition, I like the management."
good,Game Stop seems like the dream job when you love games and play them all day. Well at Game Stop you'll get the advantage to know about games when they are coming out and take them home. However when in the store all you will ever do is organize the shelf of games over and over from A-Z and check people out as well as put prices on things and do returns. When you are not doing that you get to log in to the computer and take quizzes to earn you bragging points.
good,"There are a lot of good things about GameStop. Unfortunately, they have hit or missed good management. They should try to encourage and promote an employees talents. Even if that means they help the employee transfer to another department where they would thrive instead of die. Once they do want you around anymore they try the hostile approach to get you to quit instead of letting you go so that they don't have to pay unemployment."
good,"Though I put myself out there for my district and found constant success at a store level, I never had the opportunity for area manager or district manager."
good,"Gamestop is a very scatter brained company now. They are trying very hard to survive in a digital world. Running a store was very fun if you had the right people and hours. Unfortunately this company has cut so may hours that most shifts are done by yourself. Good entry level type job, not something you should put your whole life into."
good,This was years ago so I'm not sure if its still relevant but it was poorly Managed during my tenure. Hours were inconsistent and unfairly distributed.
good,"The coworkers at the store were very friendly and super nice my only problems were the lack of training from management and the lack of the teams overall spirit no one was interested in doing things the ""Gamestop"" way everyone wanted to sell the correct games to the customers making sure they left happy and enjoying their selection but then sales and goals hit hard and everyone had to tell people games were good or no one would pre order them or even buy them making the team look as if they didn't know what they were doing or seeming like rude salesmen for the games with weak fanbases."
good,"It was a great place to work if your managers are on top of things.  There are not a lot of benefits, but it's great if you want to save money on games.  The pay is low tho, and they normally pull people in for manager spots instead of hiring from within."
good,"decent work to life balance but more of a job than a career. Upper management is almost always outsourced. Fun environment, customer interaction is normally enjoyable, but management generally doesn't approve of customer interaction not directly involved in selling focus items"
good,"Gamestop is typical retail.  The horrid times are during the holidays, beyond that it tends to be pretty chill.  You get no perks to upsales beyond the promise of more hours / opportunities but ultimately will compete for hours."
good,"This is a company that really has moved back and forth on being good. There are times where we all love the company and times we feel less than happy with it. Just like a lot of retail, the workers are less than human. The company will side with customers 99% of the time even if the associate did nothing wrong. They cater to entitlement and customers who want to come in and throw a fit over nothing anyone in the store has done to them, and the company rewards them with free product. Protect the family is the inner motto. What ot really means is protect the families of the higher ups and hope you have enough money at the end of the week to feed your kids."
good,"The most fun parts about working at GameStop is building upon the relationship you have with your co-workers and your consistent regulars.  The more you get to know them, it makes you feel less awkward and you are able to help them to your best ability.  It does help force you to break out of your comfort zone especially if you are someone who is not great at talking to strangers.  "
good,"E' un'esperienza lavorativa in grado di formare una persona a 360 gradi, responsabilizzandola, migliorandola e fornendole skills di gestione magazzini ed interi punti vendita, essendo comunque venditori attivi. L'ossessione per il raggiungimento di target porta ad una pressione eccessiva sulla clientela."
good,"Not as bad as everyone says if you work with good people, or if you love the Video Game industry. But if it doesn't interest you than this is likely to be Torture"
good,"It is a solid job if you are looking for a good discount and building a strong team.  The company itself is not very personable, however it's all up to the manager.  A strong manager, makes a strong team, and makes a strong store and work environment."
good,"The workday is often dependent on the time of year, during the ""gift-giving"" season in the winter every day is busy, it dies down again until the summer begins. More often then not you will enjoy working with the people on your level, but generally speaking management, or the higher-ups, don't seem to realize what it is like to work retail. They often push you to drive more things, judge you based on those things, and I have feared for my job once or twice during my almost 3-year career here. The pay is not worth the stress, rules and regulations you must uphold."
good,"The job itself was fine even if you were extremely under paided and expected to know way more then you could possibly know for how little you worked. Staff were usually good people but horrible bosses. District manager was the worst he fired people for having an opion of their own or if he just didn't like them or if they stuck up for another employee, or did anything else that might upset him in anyway. As a result the store managers operated in an atmosphere of fear thinking any day could be their last if they didnt do everything he told them including blaming people/firing people for things they didn't do."
good,As a lower level employee working here was great if you don't care about having a full 40 hour week.  As a manager or higher though I wouldn't recommend it.  Corporate will continually push their sales programs on you and run you crazy trying to make the goals they set.  They will also continually reduce the number of hours you can give your employees but then question you on why sales are down.  When sales were up they offered little to no bonus or incentives.
good,"Gamestop is a great company who does what they can to accommodate their upper management team. The one drawback with my employment I noticed though was their constant desire to rebrand their business model, especially with their item buy-back program. Job security was always at risk because the company lacked the proper training procedures which resulted in employees mishandling transactions, ultimately hurting the companies bottom line."
good,Company is very competitive and very demanding on sales on small individual items. Can be stressful for part time students. No benefits for anything under part time.
good,"I enjoyed being in the element of games and video gaming culture, but at times it felt more like a machine with video games painted on it. I was never good at explaining things, but that seems to be the best way I can describe it."
good,"Dealing with customers, reorganizing the video game walls. I learned how to manage my time and deal with a variety of customers and their needs. Hardest part was selling a customer a product they clearly didn't want  and the most enjoyable part of the job is discussing video games with customer."
good,"The environment is very laid-back and casual. There's no required uniform - as long as what you're wearing isn't obscene. Usually worked in jeans and a t-shirt. Management is generally very relaxed, but definitely not push-overs. I respected my manager and could joke with him and hold casual conversations very easily."
good,"Depending on the volume of the location, you have a chance to interact with a lot of people.  Its really a lot of fun to build lasting relationships with your regulars and guests as a whole. It is a sales driven environment, so you have to be prepared to be competitive and to work hard.  Unfortunately, upper management can make working at store level very difficult."
good,"When you have a good manager everyday felt new and exciting. "
good,"The company was fun to work for, the customers are better than the average retail jobs -- gamers are generally more relaxed than other customers I've worked with in other retail jobs. Management tended to promote people without explanation and with no perceivable reason."
good,"I was thankful to get this job and put something on my resume that shows I has responsibility. You meet some fantastic and personable people when you work, but the pay is mediocre, the corporate ladder looms over you to hit your goals. After awhile, it just becomes taxing. Not a hard gig, but not something I’d like to deal with for years to come (I’ve worked here for 1.5 years and am about to leave my 2 weeks)."
good,Not a gamers dream job. You will get paid minimum pay so 7.25 and will have long hours and you won't get a full time job there unless you have worked from seasonal to your way up so in a couples of years. Very competitive as well
good,"There was very little room for advancement unless you already have management experience. A laid back environment for the most part. If you don't sell enough of their subscriptions they will cut your hours, and at the time I worked there the only incentive to sell their subscription was the fact that your hours were on the line if you didn't."
good,You will be the assistant to your store leader. Work with them constantly to help the business succeed. Be ready to work the opposite schedule of your store leader. Weekends and evenings will be common.
good,GameStop is a great company to work for is you are passionate about games and helping guests. You will work a hard and have an ever changing schedule. Be ready for pressure to hit numbers and pitching add ons.
good,easy day at work with great employers. Little hours was given during the season. I learned how to multitask while also prioritizing the guest in the little time I was there.
good,This isn't the worst job I've ever had. There aren't enough advancement chances. The management doesn't properly communicate with each other let alone their employees
good,"If you want to enjoy what you do, go for GamStop. This is the place where you will meet a lot of cool people and co-workers. It's a nice part-time job option."
good,"Working for GameStop is a great way to learn about the retail environment, develop multi-tasking, management, leadership, and customer service skill sets."
good,"Working for GameStop is a great way to learn about the retail environment, develop multi-tasking, management, leadership, and customer service skill sets."
good,"Your daily tasks include selling things, unpacking boxes of things to sell, learning about the things so you can sell them better, putting up posters; signs and other media devices to get people interested in what you're selling, using a tablet to show them what you're selling, sell things that haven't come out yet, providing as many additional items to the person, providing information on promotions, and making sure your storefront is clean so that people will enjoy being in your store so they are more likely to buy something."
good,"The job itself is fun around the right people, except it is a very number hungry company with no reward for reaching goals but big punishments for failing to"
good,"Fun company at times, but the digital migration is causing management to diversify, and react to conditions in a kneejerk way with flavor the month changes. Stay Away if you dislike micromanagement."
good,"I thought going to Gamestop would be the best job ever. After leaving a very stressful management position, i believed i would love selling video games and engaging with customers over our shared love of gaming culture. The customers, for the most part, were great. Management however, was less so. Gamestop is a company that, at the time i was there, was struggling to find an identity. Ridiculous metrics were used to judge employees. I came in as an Assistant Manager, yet i was left to figure things out on my own without any solid training. Worst of all, if i did something wrong or neglected to do something i was admonished, even if i had never been taught how to do, or event that i had to do the task. Circle Of Life, was the most useless measurement of job performance i have ever come across."
good,"Starting off working here was really smooth and straightforward, but then due to YTD sales projections not lining up company wide, the directions we were given from corporate each month began to eventually change & conflict. "
good,Well my opinion on the overall of the company is that it has a good structure resource to learn and get a great experience in the work field for new employees without experience
good,While working at Gamestop there where many times where I felt as if I was not learning any major skills. It was a constant one annoying thing after another. There was no synergy between me and the managers. Also employees who have been there for longer periods of time seemed to have a fast track to all the easier jobs. But also didn't help newer customers.
good,"A typical day of work consisted of either opening or closing the store, working the sales floor, and managing the inventory. That is the super simple cut of it. "
good,"While it was a good part time job, GameStop heavily pushed used sales numbers, paid membership subscriptions, and game reservations without looking at the type of foot traffic occurring inside a mall based store right off the interstate."
good,"Typical day revolved around what was assigned through GSO and what you decided to do.  A lot is required of each employee for day to day tasks."
good,"Working at GameStop was a great way for me to learn about management and planning. As they do not always provide us with the proper communications and tools to succeed, Leaders need to be adaptable and solve problems on the fly. I left the company due to a lack of forward advancement and some poor choices made by the Leaders above me."
good,Nichr sehr harte arbeit aber dafür auch der entsprechende Lohn.
good,a typical day in game stop goes form taking delivery's in and managing stock however the management in the head office seems to be un-organised and communication from them to a shop level seems like a one way street. the training provided isnt their other for a simple smile and mention 7 different items in a single conversation while keeping it shot and sweet but you cant do it with out rushing through everything. over all the tasks asked of me and others to do while being kept under time constraints are not doable
good,It was a fun job and probably could have been better if it wasn't seasonal. I got hired on before Blacl Friday and let go a little after New Years. It was very chaotic with the misnight releases but it was fun
good,"The job can be fun and very rewarding. Most of the customers come in to talk about games and ask questions before they buy, and it's fun to help them. But holiday seasons are awful and the corporate overlords are cold hearted monsters who only care for money. Being a pushy salesman was never my cup of tea, and you are expected to hit numbers for pre-orders, powerup cards, etc."
good,"My Store Manager is already given 44 hours a week, but would stay hours longer or come in early and take the hours of his employees. 3 hour shifts at $8.25 an hour trying to get a certain amount of sales is ridiculous."
good,"Demonstrate technical selling skills and product knowledge"
good,"Gamestop has its ups and downs, it currently appears to be going quite quickly. Overall it was a pretty typical retail experience, nothing really stood out as bad or good."
good,it is a amazing job for video game lovers. in long run they do not treat you as a person just a number. good place for a temporary job or first. discount on games is good.
good,"There is not much growth in the company, also it does not provide with any kind of benefits at all. Seasonal is fine for a few hours but not worth getting in full time."
good,"If you are lucky enough to find the right team (in store staff and competent managers at the District / Regional level), as a game enthusiast you might be in for an enjoyable work experience but not a career. "
good,"Working for GS is fun when you have an interest in games. Helping customers find the kind of game they would like is also a fun challenge. They keep employees up to date through small online courses that work like a mini game. When the team is customer focused, trust bonds are created and it developed an awesome culture that you would only find at themed conventions."
good,i love the gaming community but dislike the hours given and also it doesnt pay enough. The hardest part of the job is the balance in sales.Overall its a ok place to work
good,"Osa-aikainen työ, jossa oman toiveeni mukaan saisi olla enemmänkin tunteja tarjolla. Johtamiskulttuuri on melko näkymätön, vaikka toisin väitetään. Työympäristö vaikuttaa alkuun unelmapaikalta, mutta alkuhuuman hälvettyä jenkkityylinen asioiden läpivieminen alkaa paistaa selkeästi."
good,GameStop is a fun work environment but after holiday season don't expect to get many hours if you're not in a management position. You're looking at one or two days if you're lucky. Now a days they are really stressing the numbers so if you're not hitting your goals don't expect to get any hours. It can get a little strenuous knowing you only have one day to hit your goal.
good,"The environment is really nice and can be enjoyable but don't expect much for Game Stop. Unless you are management you will not matter. You will hardly get any hours and will be constantly bugged about meeting quotas. When you are ringing up a customer you will have to bother the customer with almost five different pitches all of which are very ""important"". If you want a job where you can move up in the positions look for another company."
good,"During my time at GameStop, I only worked about 4-5 hour days for one day every other week. My managers had to make the schedule this way due to the way that employees were hired. This particular GameStop was very low staffed and needed people very quickly. So, the managers at that store hired four people to fill two different jobs: a manager position and a store associate position. Two managers and two store associates were hired. As someone who was hired as a store associate, my work hours were a low priority due to the amount of hours needed to train the two new managers. However, my time actually on the job was extremely enjoyable. I have loved video games for many years of my life, so being hired to trade them was a dream come true. I worked very hard to learn about new games and systems while still keeping up with customer relations and making sure that the store was organized."
good,"Gamestop a fun place to work, however being a holiday hire isn't as much. Not many hours are available, and scheduling is a bit inconsistent. Other than that I loved working with them and wish I could work there fulltime"
good,"Advancement was simple for high potential individuals.  The at-times strenuous work environment is encouraging to newer hires eager to impress, but does become faded after a while without any consistent praise.  Stores are personal and can range from warm and welcoming to predatory.  It all depends on the people.  The most enjoyable part of the job was providing true solutions to my guests because it was genuinely the best solution, not the most profitable one."
good,"Who doesn't want to talk about video games and sell them all day? It was fun working my way up to ASM. However, there is a very strict sales quota one must hit unless they want management breathing down their neck every other week. When I was there, electronic devices were able to be sold for cash or credit to the company. Gamestop lacked to take responsibility for stolen merchandise that was being accepted in as 'trade', and then expected their own employees to check devices IMEI's or serial numbers to make sure they weren't selling stolen merchandise. Unfair to the employee"
good,"The DC has state of the art picking and packing systems.  The company offers good benefit. But if you do not fit into their ""Good ol boy"" management system, than you will never advance."
good,"Management has become suffocating at GameStop.  They constantly change their focus and philosophy, on one hand telling you that you're empowered to make decisions on things, while at the same time telling you to follow every single direction and remember every single changing vocabulary term or you'll be fired.  The job is self is standard retail except that upper management treats you like a sales job.....Except in pay/commission."
good,The customers were all we had to care about. Until we had goals to make that were more farfetched than the naked eye. With having the need to talk to every customer as much as possible it sometimes gets to you. We try to attend to every customers needs even if it seems rhey do not have any.
good,"The people that you work with in the actual store will likely become good friends, but upper management will likely leave a bad taste in your mouth. Since this is retail, expect some rude customers but there seems to be even more at Gamestop."
good,"Fun place to work though a lot is expected for the little amount of pay you receive."
good,Having the skills to talk to customers like family. Learning about the ins and outs of what people prefer in day to day gaming experience.
good,"I really enjoyed working with my whole team. Unfortunately my manager lacks communication skills that reflex on the entire team not just me. I loved doing what I was doing, but I wasn't growing in my position and felt like I was being held back. A typical day involved receiving in shipment, processing it, and putting them on the floor to be sold. After that we just assisted the customers doing things like helping them pick out a video game or a video game console, to taking the customers old games and consoles in as trades. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with the customers that come in there. The hardest part of my job is trying to keep all the games in alphabetical order all day because people just put them anywhere they please. I learned that I am strong and I can achieve anything I put my mind to."
good,"From my experience I worked with a lot of different people in different stores, I have not disliked or had problems with anybody I worked with because we all we're on the same page and enjoyed the work place. I learned a lot about store operations and how to run a business by myself. The hardest part about the job was the pressure and unrealistic goals your Regional and District Manager put on you when it wasn't something that was going to happen or if it was a slow day or week. The most enjoyable part was knowing about all the new videogames and sharing gaming moments and conversations with fellow gamers. When you love videogames it makes the job a lot easier. A typical day is keeping the store clean, daily tasks as far as receiving and sending shipment, counts, managing and teaching other employees and customer assistance. With all the stores closing and a lot of employees either being fired or quitting didn't give me a sense of job security."
good,"My managers were wonderful people to work with, the environment was friendly. While there were many unhappy customers with the trading prices and all, I was properly prepared and trained for it."
good,"A typical day is spent being a baby sitter. I work in a mall location so there is no shortage of unattended children tearing my store apart. Some parents won't even come inside &, instead, lurk outside the door so I would say the hardest part of the job is just keeping the store in order as well as keeping customers happy. I've learned to lean on my co-workers to help tackle that problem as well as joke along with customers about it to make them feel as at ease as I can which has turned into something I love about the job."
good,"not a very stable job, and they tend to let go of employess, including managers, just about every month... will never see a familiar face. they dont provide you with many work hours, and dont really careabout letting people go in a heart beat. the team you get is usually cool, but that it."
good,"If you aren't a manager, it's a waste of time. Right now it's off season and anyone not a manager is getting at least 3 weeks off. It's not all GameStop, all retail is getting worse and worse."
good,Good customer service and fun place to work. I didn't enjoy the fact that it felt like I constantly competed for work hours with other employees.
good,"Typical day at work included helping customers find games and telling them about said games, checking customers out and processing trade items. For my first job I learned a lot about the retail business, and even learned to how to better interact with people. Management was okay but flawed in that management created the hours and gave most hours to themselves/friend. Hardest part of the job of trading transactions you have to be very careful about the items you take. The most enjoyable part of the ""chill"" environment given off from my co-workers most of our down time was talking about games that we are or have been playing."
good,"- do a great customer service"
good,You got paid too little for the work they ask of you and the quotas you meet with no extra compensation. Managers don't always do their jobs and it falls onto the associate to do their job and the job of the manager while they're unavailable on the sales floor or from behind the counter.
good,"A typical day at GameStop start by putting away merchandise an attending to the customers. We also have make sure you meet your weekly quota, plus keeping up-to-date with the latest tech and gaming news."
good,"A typical day at Gamestop consist of working by yourself, because the company only gives the stores 83 Hours to divide amongst the employees. Yet your ASM takes forty of those hours and your third key Takes 20-25 of those hours. This leaves no room for entry level employees the most hours they get in a week may be six and this makes it very hard to keep good employees. "
good,"It was a fun place to work especially if your a gamer. I play videos games in my free time so it was a no brainer for me. I learned good sales techniques, management taught me most of this knowledge. And the hardest part was working non-stop christmas season. The most enjoyable time was playing the games, of course."
good,At the store level everything was great. Very fun job. Once in a multi unit capacity the amount of micro management and lack of any kind of work life balance took the fun right out of it.
good,Was once a great place to work but slowly turned into way too much work for way too little pay. The hardest part of this job was the upper management breathing down your neck constantly.
good,"It was a great place to interact with customers! You got to know them well and were able to provide great customer service they appreciated a lot. Also, feel this a great place for part time work for people of all ages and good starter job for a person to get a foot in the door to small box retail."
good,"GameStop is a wonderful place for the gamer to come to work."
good,"low pay"
good,Game Stop was a wonderful place to work at until they couldn't keep a manager. I got to meet new people but there was no room to move up and I only got 3 hours a week.
good,It is a fun environment but the higher ups are typically negative in reinforcement and reviews. They drive numbers and nothing else matters.
good,The pay was terrible given the experience that they require.  The other employees were really nice to work with though and my manager was a pretty decent guy.
good,ottimo per la posizione lavorativa e perche ti insegna un lavoro a 360 gradi
good,"Great Gig for College students, due to hours and flexible work environment. Very Laid back work Environment, not alot of stress."
good,"This job was one I had always wanted. When I finally got it, I was ecstatic. After a while that wore off. Occasionally only working 3 hours a week, I found myself having to get multiple jobs just to support myself. The wage was never great either. It wasn't until I worked my way up the ladder that the job truly became worth it. But then I was working 50-60 hours a week and my school and social life suffered. It wasn't worth the wage I was making. But they trap you because the perks are really strong, like free game check outs and a strong employee discount."
good,"the building was very small. with alot of people in them buying games kids would come in to play with the consoles, the manager wasnt a very good one always took breaks"
good,"A typical day at work would usually be, myself walking on the sales floor, greeting customers and always show the customers that i was willing to help them no matter what."
good,"I worked for Gamestop as an Assistant Manager for 2 years."
good,"Cooperate oversite is rife with problems in this company.  It seems like people at the top have no idea how to run the business effectively.  Employees are told to do things such as, ""Be on the floor assisting customers at all times,"" but stores are supplied with shoestring schedules mostly only having one employee at the store even during the busiest times."
good,"A typical day at GameStop does not require much. As long as the store is clean and merchandise is all up-to-date and set out, you kind of just stand there all day and wait for people to come in. GA's cannot do much because they do not have managerial duties. The managers have to take care of most things in the store & it does not feel like much of a job. It is a very relaxed environment, but you do not get nearly enough hours in a week, let alone a day."
good,Reasonable demands. No rewards. Good co-workers inside the store.
good,"A typical day at work consist of customer service, merchandising and cashier labor. Over the course of time working for this organization, I learned that the salesperson is an integral aspect of closing a successful sale; he/she must know about the product or service being sold and present the value of said substance to the customer or client. I now see that GameStop's business model is simple by design, crediting to its success over the years. Surprisingly, the organization structure of GameStop Corporation does not consist of many managerial tiers: The top tier being the board of directors followed by a second tier of executives, thirdly a tier of regional managers and lastly, a 4th tier of district managers. District managers oversee retail stores within a district where the store managers are responsible. I was privileged to work with numerous co-workers and managers over the course of my employment with this corporation. I worked with managers and co-workers aging between 18-32. I think the hardest part of my job is finding upward advancement. I think this difficulty is credited towards the size of my network and window of opportunity. The most enjoyable part of my job is finding more ways to exhibit value within our store's inventory to customers. I get a sense of achievement when a customer exits our store with the items requested and something new to their experience resulting from our expertise."
good,"La tipica giornata di lavoro prevede, pulizia, ricezione merce e smistamento, esposizione della stessa, vendita e supporto al cliente, continuo riordino del negozio e raggiungimento degli obiettivi di giornata"
good,"My time at GameStop was overall okay. The best part of the job was the customer service. Being able to help people out by finding what they need and having them leave happy was always the most enjoyable part of the job. Co-workers were unreliable, except for the store manager. It was difficult to find someone to cover a shift, or if we were given extra hours, it was hard to find someone to take them. Upper management would hound us for tasks that had strict  deadlines, but didn't give us sufficient time or hours to complete them in a manageable time frame, while still focusing on customer experience . I learned a lot from my time at GameStop, all from the great store managers I had; From cash management to making a schedule."
good,"Management expects work quality and attention to detail of a $50k+ salary job, while the pay is only minimum wage. Benefits are non existent."
good,"Gamestop is a great company to get some management experience with. At least within my district accomplishments were quickly noticed and promotions came very quickly up to store manager. The down side is once you get to store manager its very hard to go any further with the company. Payroll support (outside of Q4) is VERY minimal, while task keep getting piled on. Recruiting for Gamestop is very challenging with their low pay rates. It's tough to find highly motivated people to leave their jobs to come work for minimum wage and 5-10 hours a week, and be expected to maintain performance numbers to fight for that extra 5 hours on next weeks schedule. Overall Gamestop is not a terrible company to work for as far as being in management, but there are less stressful / higher paying options out there if you already have a management background."
good,"I was seasonal so I don't have much to tell, it was a fun job but most tasks other than sales were left for the long term employee's."
good,"Came in at 2pm. "
good,"Starting as management, I was probably a little naive that management would care about games the same way that customers would. I quickly learned that they cared more about subscriptions (even though most of our customer base were repeat customers) and pre-orders than they did about the actual products we sold. "
good,"GameStop is a great company to work for, and a fantastic employer as far as diversity goes, but the Quality of Life piece that is stressed on a regular basis goes overlooked when it comes down to achieving that sales goal or having the holidays well covered all the way around. Working on a holiday once a year would be one thing, but not being able to use your paid time off during the last three months of the year is ridiculous. Spending time with your family is a huge part of quality of life and without being to do that at the most important time of the year really defeats the purpose of the company saying they value it. Upper management is awesome though, my DM, AM, and MTSM are all very engaging and always wanting to do whatever they can to get you developed and promoted. It's just hard to keep top talent whenever you don't make enough to consider it being a career and then the time off piece comes in as well."
good,"As a manager at GameStop you have to be fully committed to the customer service aspect of the job as well as be willing to put in long hours. The more hours you work, the greater chance you have of finding the occasional gem of a trade in, but generally you have to deal with accusations of breaking or making bad games. You also have to be willing to explain, EVERY DAY, to some elderly couple what the difference between each console is and which is better for their grandchild which you have never met and they really know nothing about."
good,"Long hours, litte reward. No job security despite the years you have put in. Benefits are still expensive."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of price changes, counting stock, managing the registers and deposits, helping customers, processing traded in materials, cleaning, organizing product alphabetically throughout the sales floor and back room, and counting registers again to close."
good,"I worked for Gamestop for seven years and while I loved the the customers and the job itself the management was very poor.  The way that things came down the line was handled poorly, often in confusing emails and were given at the last minute."
good,"Much like any retail/department store, you're assisting customers with knowledge of video game hardware/software. For someone young into gaming, It can definitely be a fun environment. "
good,"Te typical day at work consists of tracking inventory and sales. I've learned that some people really have a true passion for games! As part, of the management team, we had to be knowledgeable of the games and game ratings. My co-workers were also gamers which made it easy for me at the time because I didnt know alot at first. The more I worked, the more I began to play. The hardest part of the job was getting the customer to understand the way our business and procedures work. The most enjoyable part was meeting the different types of people everyday. No day was the same."
good,"My duties would be keeping the store in order by acting as store manager when the titled store manager was not working. I helped customers to the best of my ability to find the product they were looking for and make suggestions when asked. I had never been late, in fact, I was frequently asked to come in early to help out and I agreed happily."
good,Good if your a teenager looking for part time. Terrible if you're looking for advancement & reliable hours.
good,"If you love games and think that GameStop is a great place to work, that you will be surrounded by games... Be prepared. Your workday will consist of people of varying levels of knowledge (of video games) asking questions that to you may seem laughable.  Your day wont be spent playing video games instead it will be picking up, reorganizing shelves, and answering phones. Not a terrible place to work; just don't go in with the idea that its going to be a great career."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is that customers that shop there are passionate about gaming and which makes it easy to discuss products.
good,"If you like videogames and a glass ceiling, this is your ""Stop""."
good,"This is one of those companies where you need a team of people who are fun to work with to make it through the day. The company pushes goals that are not even in the control of the employees. Not only that, but now they are requiring their employees to call customers about promotions and offers which in my experience has made very few of these customers happy. The work is fun, but as I said you need a top of the line team to make it past the stuff the company asks of you."
good,"Strictly a ""can't find another job"" job. Can't really get fired unless you steal, so long as you keep your numbers slightly good. Customers are usually friendly enough."
good,Would be alone in the store for most of the day. Not a lot of business outside of the holiday season. Management was very biased towards certain employees.
good,Small chance to move up after you've reached the Store Manager position.
good,"Good place to work if you're in the corporate sector. Other than that, it's pretty much a dead end."
good,Great Job for new Store Managers. Customers are what made working there so much fun. 
good,"depending on what game is being released it is hecktic. associates have to keep the place clean and properly set displays."
good,It seems like a fun place to work but its not all its cracked up to be. Our DM makes working there not work it.
good,"Typical day: Standard opening and closing procedures, counting tills, safe, deposits."
good,You are there to support and assist game players in choosing what's right for them. It's the co-workers and customers that make this place worth it
good,"Great first time job to learn about sales and customer service. Pressured to make goals daily even though there is no ""real"" incentive for you."
good,• Responsible for store with revenue of $4.7 million
good,"It's one of those companies where the more corporate leaves it's managers alone, the better the overall atmosphere is for the employees. There is a focus on 2-3 key ""bottom lines"" and a general uncaring attitude about any of the multitude of skills and traits that make employees valuable to the company."
good,The customers are the only thing that make my former gamestop a scary place to work. I had to intervene of conflicts BY THE HOUR and we had a security guard. Im actually surprised i made it out safely every night.My customer service skills were tested daily.
good,A typical day at work involves talking about and selling games to customers and helping them out with problems or concerns they may have. I learned how to talk to a wide range of people and also how to fix multiple problems that can come up with consoles and computers. The management is enjoyable to work with because they deal with a lot of the same stuff that employees deal with regularly. The co-workers are willing to help each other out whether they are new or run into any problems. The hardest part of the job is trying to help someone fix problems that come up. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I talk to people who enjoy playing video games.
good,Laid Back
good,"typical day would be to come in around 5 or 6 in the evening and stay till 930pm , assisting customers with their purchases , try to upsell pro-member cards , and get as many reservations for upcoming games . Management was ok . Most enjoyable part of working there was ofcourse the discount on certian items"
good,"I will have to start this off by saying overall I enjoyed my experience at Gamestop. It was an incredibly easy job and I genuinely liked all my coworkers. The reason I left is because the manager was so unreasonably creepy that he even drove customers away. This is a man who has had literally 16 calls to HR about him and he still hasn't been removed. No one really understands why. Other than him, the hours were good, I had a fixed schedule unless there was a midnight launch, plenty of hours, and relatively easy day to day tasks. Getting time off was almost never a problem and I lived very close to work. While I worked there, for just under a year, nine people quit because of the manager not including myself."
good,Great benefits. Fun work environment. Little to no advancement once you become a Store Manager.
good,"This was my first management position. I have learned a lot through the training program that they have implemented. However, room for advancement is limited. Once a person has reached store management position, there is little to no room for advancement."
good,A lot of responsibility and not paid well. It has pros and cons and ok starter job but you will want to find a better company eventually.
good,"There are various support groups at Gamestop, and each have their own challenges and opportunities. It's a great place to expand your knowledge or take your current knowledge to a higher level."
good,Good pay if it is your first job it's a nice introduction to the working world if you are still in high school and have little out of pocket expenses. If are someone living on your own and the bills just keep on coming then don't bother.
good,"horrible upper management, horrible communication with upper management. employees are viewed and told to be expendable."
good,A decent job that's somewhat gotten worse with time in certain areas. A lack of believable job security mixed with corporate greed has proved that this company doesn't care about its lower employees like they claim that they do.
good,Good place to work part time. Always something to do. Very relaxed environment most of the time. Pay is average. Not much progression within stores. .
good,Gamestop has its ups and downs but the main thing that will make or break your happiness here is the staff. I've been lucky enough to have hired some of the best people. I would absolutely be miserable if it wasn't for them. The culture is great if you're into gaming.
good,"The job culture could easily use some work. Some of the management is less than kind, be it managers or District Managers and upward. However, I understand many of them are working within the parameters of Gamestop itself, and doing their very best. Out of the four stores, only half were kind, understanding and decent managers. People I'd work with again, despite differences."
good,"Gamestop is a great company to work for as a part time job or second job for those looking to gain some insight into the gaming industry. It’s hard work, though!"
good,Working at Gamestop was fun but it did have its problems. they would rotate managers and employees out. i was there for 8 months and had 2 different managers and 3 different assistant managers
good,I gave 150% to my job! I put my job first and missed out on so much over the many years I gave them only to be someone they didn’t care about in the long run. It’s very disappointing when you love a company and love your customers so much. I still can’t get over that I was bullied out after transferring to The state of Indiana.
good,Have not worked here long but turnover since i've been here has been quite a few from CEO's to the employees due to massive layoffs.  Need a cultural mindset change and better business/financial practices.
good,Posizione lavorativa buona se non fosse per il contratto natalizio
good,We had to count all inventory everyday and at night to makes sure things were in the right place for the customer to find. We always had to push new promotion when there were new games coming out which i enjoy.
good,"On the fun side, they have board games, video games, foosball in one of the primary breakrooms, as a well as an onsite cafeteria.  But, the actual work space is windowless, dark, gray, pretty depressing work space."
good,"This job was fun and a good environment under the right management. Once my old manager got moved to a higher volume store, the replacement was less than satisfactory. I took on the majority of the work load and my digressions were ignored by my DM. Overall,  the company has good benefits and the customers/environment is friendly and you can learn a lot quickly. Like they say, people don't leave bad jobs; they leave bad management."
good,"If u need something to do that is fun, people oriented, demanding and spontaneous, well this the perfect job. Every day is a different challenging. Management makes or breaks this job."
good,"Gamestop is an okay place to work at but my biggest issue is with up selling everything. Gpgs, Prps, preorders and pro memberships. You must make your qouta or you will not be in a good position. Great for Part Time for a college student.and if you advance that's great but not much money from promoting."
good,I only have one negative to say and that was there wasn't a lot of hours to go around. The positives are the manager was vary nice the working environment was great and it was one job that I never had any issue with any of the staff members. I would go back and work in a heart beat if I could
good,"When I started my first and second managers were amazing. Very helpful and were constantly looking for ways to further their employees career. However, when I moved to a different location, I quickly found that not every manager is as awesome as the ones I had. My last manager was lazy and often took credit for things that I did while attempting to discredit me to the District Manager, after bringing my concerns to the DM he seemed to be unable to help to I felt it was my time to part with the company even though I loved working there."
good,"The company wishes for you to remain enthusiastic in the face of low pay. It's weird, but it's interesting. Sometimes they care, other times, not so much."
good,"This was a job with a great boss, who broke me out of my shell and made me the salesman I am today. Most of what I learned, I learned on this job. It was a good time."
good,It's a starting job. There are chances to move up but only when some one steps down or is let go.  Starting as a GA (game adviser) will only get you about 10-15 hrs depending on if your hired during the holidays other than that you will be placed on call. As an SGA (senior game adviser) you can expect at least 20 hrs minimum a week.
good,Retail is a difficult industry to be in and GameStop will need to change up its model in order to keep up with today's retail and digital giants. They do not have internal systems set up to hand growth.
good,"My employment at Gamestop was seasonal, and since this is a franchise company it's difficult to provide a rating to the corporation as a whole. The store I worked at was in Fairbanks, Alaska, and the NDA they had me under is very, very restrictive. I literally don't know what I can say without incurring legal action."
good,"Fast-paced, dynamic work environment.  Got to learn many new things as business needs progressed.  Great team environment, with skilled, helpful employees."
good,"How your experience working for GameStop goes really depends on the district you were in. My previous district in the northern states was amazing. I was the Store Leader and my staff and coworkers were great, but I was short staffed so that was stressful."
good,"Co workers were fun and engaging but top management was awful, Not a lot of room for growth, poor hours and a very broken reward system. I do not recommend working here."
good,il lavoro è del tutto incentrato sulla vendita che è registrata in ogni suo singolo aspetto. si impara subito una certa tecnica ma è anche molto stressante perchè una volta a casa è necessario seguire le vicende di marketing e aggiornamenti a qualsiasi livello della catena uno sia.
good,"If you have a passion for video games you can’t really speak on it here if you plan on working here. There is a lot of okay let’s make sure we mention sales, and numbers to the customer."
good,"A typical day of work at gamestop was a joke. "
good,"It's alright for a first job. There are certainly better places to work at if you are looking for money or even minor benefits, so it's really a ""passion job"" where you are willing to take minimum wage to do something you enjoy. In that though, your job is to sell, not hangout and talk about video games. Talking about video games and providing that insight will help sell, but selling is the job, so thats an expectation that is maintained and should be expected."
good,"Higher positions never listen to lower level employees, forced work during deplorable weather, fear-based incentives instead of rewards. Turnover rate is laughable but positions are clogged."
good,"Working at gamestop is fun, but one of the main things about the company is that they have a no resting type ideal. It doesn't sound like working in such a small store would be tiring, but you are not allowed to sit or even lean on the counter. ""There is always something to do."" Being on your feet for sometimes 7-8 hours with no break and not being able to even lean on the counter all for minimum wage begins to feel like a lot of work for those small couple hundred dollar paychecks. Other than that, management seemed nice and forgiving for missed shifts as long as there was a good excuse, and the workplace was overall fun. One other thing I was not expecting was that most of the customers weren't young gamers, they were older people buying games for their children or grandchildren, especially around the holidays. Most of the job becomes you giving advice, and the customer getting upset when they ask a question that you don't know the answer to, customers there were often less understanding than I expected."
good,Ho visto colleghi entrare alle 9.00 ed uscire da lavoro alle 23.00 per uno stipendio ridicolo.
good,"Gamestop was a helpful job for college or even high school students. However, the nature of Gamestop being competitive with its own providers has lead to a somewhat toxic climate. Constant pushes of both new and preowned causing a mix of signals for buyers and little interest in advancing long time employees , I cannot recommend it for anyone hoping to support a family."
good,"I understand the place is a business, but I have never worked for a more deceiving company in my life. Trying to force us to make people buy things they can't afford, giving squat for trades, overpricing items, not fully disclosing warranty stipulations."
good,"Resolve customer complaints regarding sales and service, monitor customers preference to determine focus of sales efforts. Compute sales, total purchases on what each customer’s needs. Open and close the store, train and help new employees. Inventory stock control and requisition new stock and maintain a clean and acceptable store."
good,"The job is really cool and the regular customers are super nice, but the pay is awful and is a big downside. You start at exactly minimum wage and less than ten hours a week and unless you just love the job that's gonna be a deal breaker."
good,"This is and always will be a fun job, but I have watched highly qualified individuals get passed over for promotions just because a person was likeable. The benefits are horrible but your work hours are flexible."
good,"I met some of my best friends through my job experience here, especially back when I originally worked in the NJ store. However, when things changed and I moved cross country, the emphasis on sales really amped up. If you don't reach the ridiculous amount of sales required by corporate, your hours get shafted, even if they gave us any hours to work with. Having 4 hours a week at minimum wage doesn't pay rent, or food, or really anything to survive by. It's a fine job if you have something on the side already, but this is absolutely not the first job you want."
good,"As most well say, working for a video game store is great. Yet It does have a lot of daily little things you have to do that are important. Counts, E-mails, pricing, cleaning and sorting. Funny as selling video games has been less of a priority and now its all about the extra's to a video game like pre-orders or add-ons. If you can muster your morals enough to constantly pitch that, then you will do fine. If your not a fan of selling something that is not up your ally getting numbers may be hard for you."
good,"Regular's were great staff was great Oversaw of all day-to-day processes, Scheduling, Cash Handling, deposits, Inventory, Sales palnnning, Set-up/Take down of ad and promos, planograms, overnight promo launches, shipping, receiving, pawn/trade in, resolving customer complaints, trained, coached and mentored team members. Taking interest in their long-term career growth, holding and attending all company meetings."
good,"I worked here for 4 years and even though I enjoyed working in such a cool place, I found myself wanting more. It's a good place to get started if you plan on making a career out of retail. Just keep in mind that it demands a lot out of you, doesn't pay the best and has irregular hours."
good,Management was terrible. Hours were terrible. No benefits for keyholders because they couldn't afford to give us full time hours. Boss was sexist and the women who ultimately ended up working there ended up quitting or being fired.
good,"Lack of hours for part time employees, but fun environment and an enjoyable experience. Would love to work there again if advancement can be made for all."
good,"Most work days consisted of dealing with sometimes hostile customers. With a great staff it was easy to out-weigh the bad days but when but under constant switching of stores, it was very difficult to maintain any sense of security."
good,"Gamestop is a fun place to improve as a business professional, with many promotion opportunities if you work hard. Leadership can be hit or miss, leading to inconsistent quality of life and job security across the board."
good,Game Stop has a sales approach that is uncomfortable and at times confusing. I had asked to transfer and coached correctly. This company  did not provide proper weaponry for success and advancement.as claimed during my interview.
good,The people that work their are great. But the way management set the work schedule was very poor. Out of the 3 months that i worked their i only got to work once a month.
good,"Easy job nothing difficult about the job . just like any other retail job, but it helps learning about new games coming out. hardest time is the holidays,  very busy and hectic."
good,I had only worked for for a short time.  I did not get as many hours as I had hoped for.  I was not trained very well and I made many mistakes because of it.
good,Most of the problems that happened at Gamestop came from upper management. Requiring far to much of the employee without allowing for overtime. Not giving the hours to schedule more employees.
good,Yes this job sounds like it is very fun but it isn't. Goals have to be made or you are fired. Plus making sure people buy preowned more than New products because mainly that's how Gamestop makes money.
good,"They are a fun place to work for, but they don't pay well or give out many hours. I enjoyed the people I worked with and the customers alot though. Okay."
good,"I'm gonna say all of my co-workers were really great, the environment was great! The biggest downside was pay I only made $7.00 an hour (which is minimal wage where I live), also, during the time I worked there a lot of games were getting stolen so they stopped letting everyone borrow games, and I was only getting about 3-6hrs a week and in the end I did get laid off because I wasn't making enough pre-order sales."
good,"Ask anyone who has worked at GameStop and they'll tell you the expectations for sales for the minimum wage workers is ridiculous. While I was working there, they also escalated drastically. You're expected to memorize and recite what is basically a script for selling store memberships and encouraged to be as ""persuasive"" as you possibly can. And encouraged is a very nice way of putting it.  I can't speak for everyone but the management at my specific location was very intense.  There were a couple of coworkers there who had been working 1/2 years by the time I got there but by the time I left 3 other people had quit before their first year was up. I was disappointed when I left, I really enjoyed talking to customers on the job and my coworkers for the most part were great and friendly."
good,"Gamestop is a good company that has its heart in the right place. Employees you work with are hit or miss, it depends on how well you can get along with people. I just wish that for the amount of work we do we'd get paid more than $8.25/hr. Most other companies out there are starting their people at $12 or more. It just helps to give people the incentive to work more."
good,The future of purchasing games are now online so Gamestop's revenue swings up and down depending on game and hardware releases. The bonuses for purchasing games at Gamestop have disappeared.
good,If you work part-time it is definitely not worth it. You will basically be cheap labor while your higher-ups cut your hours due to store performance. If you do not mind that then by all means apply.
good,"Company should show more support to its employees rather than just showing support to the Store Leaders. The store leaders get a lot of stuff for free, but the other employees are doing a lot more work than they are."
good,"Really GameStop isn't a bad job, and wasn't that bad when I started, but over the years it got progressively worse. Hours are very limited at times and you will be fighting with others who aren't managers to be put on the scheduel more. Coupled with quotas you have to meet, it can just be pretty stressful depending which store that you work at."
good,Game stop was always interesting to me and I wanted to work there beacuse my interest in video games but the new manager we got ended up cutting so many hours from everyone and no one was happy people were leaving left and right till the new manager was fired
good,"a typical day can be easy and fun. Fun interactions with guests and coworkers. "
good,The workplace environment is great with people who are interested in the same things as you are whether it’s the customers or employees some people you’ll meet are great but it’s also a lot of hard work for very little hours.
good,"Company doesn't really care about employees, minimum wage, it's okay if you're working seasonal, but once you hit management it gets pretty awful. responsibilities skyrocket with minimal pay increase. not super worth it in the long run."
good,"It's either very busy or very slow, making completing all the tasks sent down by corporate a bit of a pain. You also have to put in a lot of work with each customer and really have a good understanding of a wide variety of games to ensure that customers go home with something that will make them happy."
good,Gamestop had a nice welcoming environment for guest and created a fun place to talk to people about games. The District Leaders created high stress environments to work in and the lack of appreciation for doing anything made the work unfulfilling. I would say I came out with a lot from the workplace. I now know how to effectively manage and lead a team as well as break down profit and sales reports. I also know the ins and out of sales and know what behaviors to look for when hiring and what ones to instill in to a team. I would say my time at Gamestop was well spent gaining knowledge and skill.
good,Gamestop is a company that only cares about money. They claim to do whatever it takes to make their staff happy and feel accommodated but the company is dying due to digital sales and they only care about whether or not we make them money. The evaluation of day to day numbers and goals is not handled well and one small mistake can hinder your entire performance for the year. It is not a company I would recommend when looking for a career.
good,"It is hard to get a job at Gamestop.  Once you get a job it is hard to get hours.  When I first started working I would only get five to ten hours a week.  Once I was with the company for five months I started getting around 15 plus hours a week.  After I got my promotion to key holder I was improperly trained and under constant pressure to perform better.  Every day you are pressured to sell membership cards, new merchandise, and pre owned games and systems.  If you under perform for more then a single day in a row you are scolded."
good,"In a matter of a month I managed to grow within the company from a regular sales associate to a key holder. I was pronounced when I came into my home store to be my Store Leaders ""protege"" and the one to take over the Assistant Store Leaders position as soon as he advanced to a Stop Leader position himself.  I was leading in sales along side another fellow employee and I spoke two languages which brought more customers in once the word got out. We became the Number 1 store in MA.  By December 13th the position for an Assistant Store Leader position became available and it when brought to my attention, it had rather been given to a former ASL who quit instead of someone who brought the store sales up. I quit the next day. So if your looking for seasonal work,  this is the place for you. As far as a career. One can only hope."
good,Corporate expects you to do the work of two people for the price of one. Everyone on the totem pole is expendable so if you don’t meet their goals they’ll replace you quickly and find someone new.
good,Expect to see the guy who has no one to talk to in your store to talk about a game you've never played and why his/her opinion is better or more important then anyone else.
good,"I could not stay here because I was missing too much time at home, the money I made was not enough to live off, and the hours I worked were too inconsistent. Being a store manager at Gamestop is only possible if you live with family, roommates, or you have a spouse that can make up the difference in their paycheck. "
good,"I loved the customers, and the people I worked with at my store. The management got along well, and our employees were like little brothers and sisters. That being said, upper management was aweful. We were pushed on the daily to meet mostly unrealistic standards, the company policies were ill informed and frankly idiotic."
good,"I enjoyed the basic aspect of the job, talking to people about games and gamer culture. It encouraged me to get comfortable with people,(especially their opinions). "
good,I applied here because i love gaming. you think you are going to work with gaming your not. Gamestop is a salesman job. they make you push 5 promos at once and if you don't you get a talking to. They also keep track of your reviews and how many power up rewards cards you sale. If you do not meet the numbers your either written up or let go after a while. I was not a fan of pushing unnecessary  promos and power up rewards on to consumers that obviously did not want them or didn't understand what each thing did.
good,I love working at Gamestop and the challenges that it provides. I love working with my associates and building them up professionally and personally..
good,"Managed a team of eight employees, coordinated marketing events monthly, including inventory orders and store displays. "
good,"Too many unreasonable sales goals that constantly change and shift, for a low wage. They are always adding new things for us to sell and goals for us to maintain on a week to week basis."
good,"Working at GameStop has been like most other retail, except here, I get to talk about more things that I enjoy. Such as video games. All of my coworkers have been fun and relaxed, along with most of my customers. There aren't usually a lot of workers in a store, so you all get decently close and almost turn into a weird, dysfunctional, supportive family. Depending on your position, it will only be minimum wage and only about 6-20hrs a week, but I have fun there."
good,I love my Store manager we worked great together and I genuinely enjoy working here but poor upper management and lack of employee appreciation will be their downfall.  I wouldn't recommend working here if you're not management otherwise it would be a great second job with average of 20-15 hours a week for non mangers its not a livable wage.
good,"If you are looking for a career starter or next step, this is a good company to start at but not to advance at. Be expected to work very long hours and to do multiple jobs."
good,"Normal retail job, small store revolved around games and consoles. Didn't see manager much, appropriate pay. Mostly cashier and helped customers on knowledge of games."
good,"Expect to work around a lot of people who feel they know more than you always. Very poor management through out the entire company, would not suggest working there."
good,"It is difficult to give a truly positive review for me. It is very typical of the retail industry though, long hours, sales are the primary focus always. The work-life balance isn't great especially if you are in a Store Lead position but that is the nature of the industry. I do enjoy talking to customers all day about games."
good,"With the right people it could be really fun to work here, the customers are funny, and would have what we called ""the battle of the games"" in the store, but watch out for management they dont play, and if a customer don't buy anything they will kick them out"
good,"Compensation is lacking. Both in pay scale for associates under store leader and in hours offered to acheive tasks. Customer service is the focus, but operations are expected to be done while assisting guests so there is a difficulty acheiving balance."
good,Each day has its requirements on numbers from customers and tasking for the store. You'll always have to make the decision to figure out what is more important for yourself as a manager to do and then leading the team to handle less stressful tasks while keeping customers happy.
good,The only complaint I have is that there were times where the store was cleaned and the game walls were faced and the manager would still be pushing to have the GAs to do SOMETHING when there are no customers in the store.
good,"I truly enjoyed working at GameStop."
good,"GameStop was an enjoyable place to work because I liked my coworkers and managers. The pay was low, and they often gave me too few hours. Working retail in the mall during the holiday season was a great lesson in patience and resilience. This job no longer exists, because the GameStop in the mall closed several years ago."
good,"Cutthroat sales oriented company with no commission. If you're a parttime worker sales = hours. Pay was minimal for the workload. Hours were unpredictable and not guaranteed even with a good sales record. Raises were pennied out. However, coworkers were friendly and employees got decent discounts on games as well as game rentals."
good,"The staff can customers here have been great. "
good,"Lavorando da GameStop impari a sopportare situazioni di forte pressione, soprattutto nei momenti di rush. "
good,GameStop was an interesting place to work.  Young people will likely find the environment fun and interesting.  Older individuals will not likely enjoy the work as it revolves around youth gaming and pop culture.  Advancement opportunities can be very limited.
good,"I had fun working at GameStop, but the only things that I didn't enjoy were the lack of hours and the fact that at the corporate level whoever was making some of the primary decisions needs to stop and think about what people would want to actually see when they go into their local GameStop and not be hounded by a random employee trying to keep their numbers up and not have to be coached or have a fear of it hurting their overall team effort for the store."
good,"Great place as an entry level  job and for part-time for all positions except ASM and SM positions. Pay is low for all positions as well with 20k being average for ASM. While tasks are simple at the GA and SGA level, ASM and SM are constantly put under pressure to meet various sales number goals. Depending on the location of the store will depend on how challenging that could be (small town means more regular customers who already signed up for all the sales gimmicks the store has to offer), yet every store is held to the same standard of numbers. This can mean angering and annoying customers by constantly pushing them for sale add-ons These customers are more likely to give negative reviews on surveys and survey averages are also monitored closely. The no overtime rule for most positions, and the strictly allocated hours for each store also means SM's must work extra hard to meet demands due to the fact that they are salaried and expected to be the ones to work overtime. They work under a lot of stress for pay that does not meet all the things they are responsible for and do. SGA and GA positions are often given very low hours (20 or less) to work every week. These positions also seemed to have a very high turn-over rate. For me, it was the team that made it great to work and not exactly the company itself and overall the experience was okay for what it is."
good,Molte pressioni per la vendita e un ambiente lavorativo molto opprimente
good,keep the merchandise organized for viewing and possible purchase as well as well the consumer pick there game accordingly. also having to keep the store clean.
good,Under changes of the company all new managers were laid off causing me to lose my job fairly quickly. Lacked proper trainers from the vets of the company
good,"GameStop is an fun place to work, because you get to meet and assist lots of interesting customers. There is an air of friendly competition between the teammates."
good,We would open the store and people would file in sometimes and other times there would be no one there all day. Sometimes it would get busy and it would be overwhelming but most of the time it wasn't very busy.
good,"Through the years, Gamestop has stripped more and more resources from stores, making it difficult to accomplish anything.  Hours are cut more and more every year, and more tasks are added.  Where most retail stores have 2-3 people working during the day at a minimum, Gamestop keeps only 1 person per shift a majority of the time.  The environment depends largely on your district manager, but the corporate culture does not care about anyone at the store level.  Internal help desk support is also severely cut back and under trained every year, so good luck operating properly if you encounter a technical issue.  You will get hounded week to week about how your sales numbers and customers are more important than tasks, but reprimanded for not completing tasks when a district manager actually comes to your store."
good,"There's always a lot to do, but I feel like I am given more to do than what I get paid for. It's good job, but it doesn't do me any favors. I love the environment, the people, and the company, but I just don't see myself staying at this company"
good,"If you've ever worked in retail before you'll probably already be able to guess what it's like to work at Gamestop. "
good,Decent place to work and get early level management experience. The hours as a Store Leader can be tough both because you have no free time and yet somehow never have enough time to get everything done.
good,"A typical day would be to come in and make sure inventory was checked and that everything was where it belonged. I have learned marketing, inventory, customer service, and how to handle a drawer. The management was very laid back and extremely understanding and did everything they could to help out employees. The hardest part about working at Gamestop was dealing with changes every week from corporate. The most enjoyable part was that I got to talk about video games and relate to my customers and make sure they were happy with their purchases."
good,"The work environment is entirely dependent on the location and associates; can be fast paced, summers are often slow. Lots of personal interaction with guests in store. Performance metrics are heavily stressed, with many tracked categories. Knowledge and enthusiasm for gaming and geek culture is helpful, since you spend all day talking about geek stuff and games. Passion is not enough to get you through the job; self motivation, ability to adapt and learn quickly, and willingness to work alone for the majority of your shift are necessary to succeed. You may not play video games while on the clock."
good,It is not about games.  It is all sales. customers always want a deal.  There are always drug addicts stealing from Walmart and trading in games.  Must put on a show.
good,I worked here for 2 years now and they give me 10 hours average a week. Metric driven and only that. Do not work here.just gives you retail expereince
good,"I had the fortune of working with a great team. In retrospect, the GameStop culture is to force products down guests' throats in order to meet a minimum sales requirement."
good,"I spent the majority of my adult life working for this company. I started out making 6.15 an hour as a PT sales associate and worked all the way up to District Leader Mentor. There are great people that work for the company and excellent leaders. It is a very time consuming job but if you are willing to put in the effort, there is a lot of room for growth."
good,"I work there seasonal , good environment, good staff but they give to little hours , and pay always the minimum and don't have a lot space to grow in that industry, basically you are always going to be a cashier or game advisor  or manager and that's it . but they are good people and they give free trials on games for about 1 week and get discounts."
good,"Gamestop doesn't move people forward as well as they should. I have beaten sales goals and led management, yet wasn't promoted, I was given a raise of 15 cents though. I say that sarcastically. If you are looking for a job to live on, this isn't the one. A great place to work over the summer."
good,"I only worked holiday, but as a first job you learn so much about customer service. Management was lacking. And the benefits weren't good either. Glad I only stayed for the holiday."
good,"My day would start with opening the store just like any retail management. My first how was on the phone with the district learning the current trade deals and pre order goals. I would find out at this point where my store was on the ladder for district goals with power up rewards."
good,"This was my first job and overall was a great first job stocked shelves a-z game order with numbers in front,cashier the usual game stop things answer questions for customers and help them find games."
good,The company has been a great chance to showcase my skills and progress my career. Unfortunately the company is on the decline and the cuts are falling on the managers demanding more while paying less and cutting hours.
good,"overall it wasn't a bad place to work, I was quickly promoted to a position I loved, that was the pc download support technician. I ended up being the lead for that team. the downside is when they decided to fire over half the staff of the department and use the remaining staff to train our replacements since our jobs were outsourced to costa rico"
good,"Expect employees to acquire certain sales numbers in order to maintain jobs. An article was released saying that in order to keep their jobs some of the lower performance stores were lying to customers. If you can't get employed by a military store and make a decent wage, don't work for GameStop."
good,"The job doesn't meet the expectations of persons wanting to work here. The hours and pay weren't bad for a part time, but there is a lack of benefits and terrible management. The management is lazy and incompetent."
good,"this is a tough Job as far as customer service and retail Service go. the tasks are simple and the job itself is manageable but the problem comes from management. the expectations laid on you border on the ridiculous and the benefits and rewards provide an extremely poor Return on investment, especially the further up the management ladder you go."
good,"The company has a constant change in focus which leads to many different metrics being required. The staff is extremely friendly, but often times are underpaid for what is required of them. It is essential that you have a great attitude and make sure to remember that at the end of the day you are selling fun to guests. It is important that you find the joy in your job otherwise you will feel extremely underappreciated and underpaid.."
good,"Gamestop is every gamers dream job, but unless you have another job currently, or don't depend on a job to live comfortably, I would not recommend it. The environment is fun and overall the job is fairly easy, but if you want to work there as a sales associate expect to only get paid minim wage and only work 4 hours every week or so. From my experience I was scheduled just enough hours to make it seem like it was worth the drive there, but not enough to get a 30 minute lunch break. If you love video games and have another job, this is might be the job for you."
good,"typical day at work is great! talk to guests about games, gaming systems, merchandise, among other things. Pay is not great, there is room for advancement however pay does not increase much. i have learned a great many things about the different gaming consoles. Management can be decent most of the time however game stop is not very willing to work with you on hours if you have a secondary job and frequently calls you in and expects you to put game stop above everything else and drop what you are doing and come in at the last minute and if you do not the consider you unreliable. the most enjoyable thing is talking about games and nerding out"
good,"As a member of the brief seasonal team, the average day was always busy. As a temp, there was a lot to learn to be adequately prepared for the customers but a very short time to do it. The best part of the job was both learning and discussing games with likeminded individuals."
good,"the job was fun at first but there was never any change or challenge, the customers were great but the management was lacking force. the company does not offer enough hours or pay to support even a single adult. This job is great for someone in highschool but not an adult."
good,"As an environment, the stores are fun and engaging.  People come in looking for conversation and guidance on the latest video games, consoles, and accessories."
good,Game stop is a good place to work as long as you are willing to work at a job that won't have steady hours for anyone lower than an assistant manager. (Key-holder)
good,"A typical work day at Gamestop is opening the store and the registers. Greeting guests as they walk in and providing answers to their questions. The inner store management are awesome, although the corporate side of it; tends to look at the dollar amount rather than the employees concerns. At my store it is as if we were all a team, we work together to bring each other up and to help each other accomplish goals. The hardest part of the job is having to work on certain holidays, the best is helping customers and making their days better just by treating them like people."
good,"Managers and co-workers are really easy to get along with."
good,"Typical day involves helping customers, receiving shipment and keeping the store clean."
good,The hours are too sparse to have a decent paycheck every week. You will get some customer service experience but dont expect to learn a useful skill while working there.
good,"The staff is always great to work with, but upper management could do with some practice on positive reinforcement. Constant feeling of not doing well enough brings the morale of the store down."
good,"Store was slow most of the time, organizing shelves only took about 30 minutes after which you would be on your phone or play the demo games that were available there. Even manager would be on their phone."
good,"The gamestop I have been at has always had fantastic workers. Mostly due to the fact our store was one of the two busiest in the district. Everyone is trained to be key holder level due to the heavy flow of tasks. Most days are fun just due to working with something I'm passionate about. Always nice to help out a fellow gamer as well, or even help someone new get into playing, or helping someone branch out into a new genre. Hardest part of the job I would have to say is the holiday season. Consistent flow of guests, ontop of getting extremely heavy freight with only 2 people on clock. normal freight is usually around 10-14 boxes. During holidays we'll have times where we'll get 40-50 boxes that have to be done that day. Overall I don't hate gamestop, and i will be sad to leave the work environment."
good,"*typical day at work would require the receiving alone of up to 30 boxes and shifts were often worked alone for lack of hours to give to employments supplemented by salary management working upwards of 60 hours a week."
good,"Work life/Life balance is not something you have in retail, especially as a district manager.  I was always told to take my laptop on vacation to make sure I was available."
good,It's great if you love talking about video games with customers. But the district managers doesn't care about the training. So after your first day you're kind of on your own with no help unless someone decides to help you
good,"I was hired as seasonal, and while I was told that i would be working as needed, I was never given any hours. over 3 months I worked a total of 3 days."
good,Good environment if you love gaming. Don't get you hopes up if you're looking for a career in this business. The trudge to climb the corporate ladder in the company isn't worth the stress.
good,"Although only seasonal, I had a great time with the staff and the customers. The job was easy and was fun while it lasted. Wish it wasn't only for the holiday season."
good,Fun place to work. Free games to try out. Meet all sorts of fun and cool people. See new games and interesting gadgets and figurines first.
good,If you love video games? It's great and for the most part? You can chat with the customers and have a great time. But it's EXTREMELY hard to advance in the company. This job is more one to just help you get sales experience.
good,"preferisco non esprimere molte opinioni in merito. "
good,"I gamestop they make you work too much for the pay, i had to be doing somethimes shift of up to 16 hours just to get my hours cut up so i dont get the overtime pay. Do not recommend the place unless you are only trying to gatter expierence."
good,Was fun for a while but got frustrating when the CEO and management want to do some major changes.  Now there is a credit card that we need to push along side game reservation.
good,"Gamestop can be a great environment to work in, but the lack of a consistent long term plan or focus around business strategy makes this a scary career choice."
good,"My original manager, was quite fair and decent with work hours and balancing it among employees. He made sure that each person was able to get off on a specific day and aided with duties to get them done quickly. You can work there with no pay raises, making it a good starting job for entry level workers, but not a good permanent job."
good,I learned at gamestop it was all about the numbers with management . hours were scarce and the higher you got in the company the faster it was for you to get fired. the management i had poorly trained me and just pushed me in a position I wasn't ready for. my co-workers were amazing and they were in their teens. Hardest part of the job was dealing with the politics of corporate not helping out when needed. the most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers find what they were looking for.
good,"While working on the floor with people with similar interests was fun, and we could be creative here and there with advertising, management had set highly unrealistic goals. "
good,"Being my true passion for the Gaming Industry, I thought that Gamestop would be the best foot in the door to gain knowledge and be involved in something I truly care about. My initial GA position was perfect and my management could not have been more understanding and hardworking to suite my needs. But as time went on, Gamestop was taking more oppurtunites to keep up with the industry and Management became too overpowering and and customer service dissipated. My boss was not interested in learning about his employees not the boss above him. It became cold, and the once proud member of Gamestop that I was disappeared along with my motivation to work. I understand the hardships of the company, butit is failing due to being company focused rather than customer focused."
good,"I learned a lot working at Gamestop. Some things I will never forget and will use the rest of my life. Great people work there, who genuinely care about the customer. The hardest part of the job was the lack of direction or inspiration. I never had the same manager for more than a year. Just as one was starting to get his groove, another would be brought in. But all in all, no hard feelings."
good,"A typical work day was usually 7 hours. As a manager I had to deal with customers while simultaneously receiving and sending shipment, answering phone calls, reading emails,cleaning the store, keeping up with daily goals, setting up any required marketing and keeping everything organized. I would prepare the store to open, which included doing inventory and price changes. Or close down the store, which would include cleaning, setting up after hours marketing and counting the money. I learned what my limits were, and to always work hard. I also learned I could multi task very well. The management was OK. The direct manager was always personable and nice. But the higher up management could be belittling and over work their employees with unrealistic expectations. My co-workers were almost always amazing. The hardest part was getting everything done in a short amount of time, especially when it was busy and we were short staffed or didn't have the hours to appropriately staff. The most enjoyable part was speaking with co-workers and customers about something that i thoroughly enjoyed and could make recommendations to every single person."
good,"I loved working at my store in New York ! I had a very fun manager who personally cared about all of his employees well being but I've been borrowed at other stores enough to know that I got lucky at the store I was in! As a game advisor, you get really wack hours unless its holiday season. The managers care about their associates but the company overall can care less. It's a great first job/part time job for those in high school and a great experience for those into gaming but as for room for growth? Forget about it ."
good,"After 2 years, get out and find a real job, but while your there get plenty of free games and swag, while using your creative side.  The GameStop name itself is great for your Resume.  Don't get stuck."
good,I had this job in high school. i was really there just to organize the shelves in alphabetical order and ring up customers if the mod was busy.
good,"gamestop is a place for people who know what they are selling and what the game industry is about. i do not like that fact they hire people who know nothing of games, but because of the looks."
good,"Anything under management level is easy, but gets more difficult as you climb the rank. The pay is low, especially compared to similar positions at other companies."
good,"A typical day at work would be greeting all customers as they walk in and tending to helping them find what they came in looking for and reaching daily sales goals by percentage of game preorders you reach versus how many customers you ring up. I really enjoyed working for this company, the only problem is they didn't have many hours to offer as a game advisor. the co workers and management were the best."
good,Il posto di lavoro era molto bello e stimolante ma la dirigenza e i responsabili poco seri e motivati
good,"open the store set a change order for the bank , start the registers make sure that closing the night before was done proper and interact with customers."
good,I enjoyed working for the company.  The store works almost like a family.  I will miss working there and the people i have come to know.
good,Been working there for almost two years without a raise nor promotion. Hours fluctuate due to sales. Pay isn't enough to take care of yourself.
good,"GameStop è un azienda solida e ben strutturata."
good,"While I enjoyed my time with the company, GameStop was not the place for me. Work days were easy, skills were simple enough to pick up, and my co-workers were the best. The hardest part of the job for me, though, was the pay. Hard to get over, that is. While I enjoyed being surrounded by what I loved, the low pay was not worth it in the long run."
good,Workplace and coworkers make this job worthwhile. Climbing the corporate ladder takes awhile and is not worth the pay.
good,"GameStop has taught me a lot in the two years I've been with them! Customer service plays a big role dealing with people and my customers are fabulous. When families come in to shop, its almost as if you are shopping with them because you want to give them a very enjoyable experience. That's why they come back! Most of them are regulars and I love for them to shop with me.  I am in a management position and love my staff as well.  If it was not for them, our store would not be where it is today in meeting and exceeding company goals."
good,Co-workers are professional and fun to be around. Just got new management and could not be happier with her. It's a great place to go everyday and make some extra money.
good,Was my first job I had and was a learning experience in dealing with customers. Learned how to use a cash register for the first time. Hardest part was cleaning up the store everyday after hours because of heavy traffic. I liked talking about games with customers that have the same passion as I do.
good,I didn't work there long enough to give a review. All I did was file a few returns and worked a little on the use tax matrix. I mostly made copies of the returns and scanned them in there system.
good,"The job alone is good if you are in school , but if you are looking for something more solid with advancement this is not it."
good,Gamestop is a good place to work at if your just starting your career off in the corporate world. but the pay is very low overall and hors are hard to come by if you need them.
good,"I work in database development and administration at the corporate office.  I've worked in worse places/situations but I've also worked in better.  Pay is decent but have to fight for what you want up front as they have the typical corporate raise structure of a minimal percentage for everyone that is not managerial.  somewhat top heavy as the HR dept uses titles to give better raises/bonuses.  the managers/directors/etc apparently get nice bonuses based more on documented, metrics oriented results than actual good work.  too much development goes out poorly tested/QA'd but it helps the directors/VPs meet their goals in X number of ""improvements"" deployed via the twisted agile methodology being used.  Also, the corporation is stuck in old-school ideology of having to be in the office to be effective."
good,I worked at GameStop for over 7 years. The first few years were great. When the new CEO came in and the hours and policies changed it became very hard to work.
good,"The work load is very typical of a retail setting; there is nothing unusual to expect there. I love my coworkers and the managers that I work with on a regular basis. The customer base is wonderful too. I love the regulars. Truly, I am lucky to work in the location that I do. Where I have a problem with the company is at the district level and above. Any chances for advancement has to be approved by district managers, and favoritism is rampant. Any complaints within stores or even about district managers themselves are fielded by district managers before going through HR, so of course, retaliation is rampant as well. Very rarely are problems between management and employees handled fairly, and often employees who try to stand up for themselves are found without jobs and replaced by yes-men. Another problem is the disconnect that the higher-ups seem to have with the public and how they handle this when their plans fall through. When their marketing campaigns fail, very often it is store managers and lower level employees who are blamed for the mistake, rather than a miscalculation in what the public wants. More often than not, a mix of both is true, but trying to convince superiors of this is impossible. We are often lectured, retrained, and shouldered with even more responsibility and marketing as our superiors insist that they're right and we're wrong, even when we tell them that we're part of their target demographic and that this isn't a very good strategy. It all falls on deaf ears. To them, it's always the employees' fault and we're not trying hard enough, and too many"
good,"Gamestop is a typical retail establishment. Its all about making money for the company, and keeping customers returning. I learned a lot about leading a team, and keeping them inspired and energized. It was a fun job to have, and had some great perks. A typical day would be to come in, make sure everything was set up for the day. Take the deposit to the bank, and open up the store. The hardest part was dealing with unruly customers, and even that was never really anything too difficult."
good,Gamestop is a fun place to work. I have enjoyed my time with the company but it is to far away from my home to continue working at my location. There are currently no other locations available nearer to me so that is primarily the reason why I am looking for other employment.
good,"Being my first job at age 16, I think this was a good place to start. I learned how to keep track and store inventory. And I was even exposed to sales since we wanted to keep our numbers up. The management needed to learn to schedule better because not everyone was getting hours to work. I learned to pay attention to detail and make sure that nothing gets missed. It was an exciting job to begin at and learn some basic work etiquette's."
good,"While the discounts, free stuff, and early release knowledge is great, it was a very stressful place to work.  We were expected to get a lot done in a very short amount of time, and every transaction (or at least the average at the end of the day) was to have a certain number of items sold at a certain price including warranties, loyalty cards, and reservations with about a page and half's worth of scripted information to tell the customers.  Not including the time it would take to find the games the customers wanted (if we had them), or find them in another store to be shipped to us so we could call the customers to come pick it up in a few days when it arrives, or find it on our online store to ship straight to their house.  And even then, the quality of the product wasn't guaranteed.  Because of all the time it took to give the information and game finding/locating/shipping, the customers would all have to wait in line, hearing every employee give the same information, becoming agitated and wanting nothing more than for us to speed through a normal transaction without any spiel."
good,"A average day of work in doing inventory counts, looking at my planograms, p&l reports, and also leading the team into accomplishing sales goals."
good,"Fast paced"
good,The people are great. Benefits are more expensive and are not very good.
good,Typical day is mainly just doing what corporate wants us to do and to help out with what customers want.
good,"Great immediate co-workers, retail experience, customer satisfaction experience, zero career opportunity"
good,"Go in and talk customers about new games, consoles while selling related games to customers. Higher management is still pretty..off, especially with their focus now shifting towards mobile and tablet products."
good,"Ensured the highest levels of customer service and satisfaction."
good,"Like most retail jobs, the team, location and management are the biggest factors. Some customers are wonderful, others make working a nightmare. The first store I worked in was with a great team, when offered a chance at promotion at another location was put under new employees who did not understand the system and day to day tasks managers were required to perform. When offered a chance to relocate again, these problems were multiplied by having an even less organized team and manager."
good,"If you like video games then this is the place for you to be. Its only really bad around the holiday season but then what retail job isn't. Moving up can be difficult since there are not many vacancies. "
good,"Would come into work to do a number of tasks, such as counts, cleaning, and other daily duties that would spread out throughout the whole shift. I learned how to do inventory counts, and use a different POS system i have never used before. The management at the company was fair and shared part of the duties with the other employees as well. When i was working i only worked with 1 other employee at a time, the employees were respectful and did the tasks they knew needed to be done.The hardest part about the job was making sure everything on the walls were in alphabetical order all the time. The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to communicate with customers on a regular basis."
good,"Typical Day was engaging conversation with customers about the latest video game or consoles. "
good,"Usually a really nice atmosphere, but unless you're an assistant store manager or the store manager, good luck getting hours, seasonal or not. My manager was amazing and taught me a lot but the higher ups made them hire 10 people for seasonal and then cut their hours terribly so I was never able to be there. The co-workers were the most enjoyable part. Unless you want a few hours a week, don't do it."
good,"My typical day at work was spent mainly in customer service.  I would usually open the store.  I learned a lot of things about gaming in general, not really something I can use outside of that environment.  My co-workers were great, I couldn't have asked for a better crew.  The most difficult part of the job was some of the customers and dealing with corporate."
good,"I would open the store at 10.  I wouldn't have ant customer come for about an hour.  As they came in I would greet them and help locate an item that they had interest in.  That would continue all day.  I learned to be patience with people, and understand them a little better.  The management was okay.  The hardest part was trying to get reservation and subscriptions.  Enjoyable part was have regular customer come in and chat with you."
good,"There really isn't a typical work day with Gamestop. It is a constant struggle to create a typical work day, but the reality is that retail is a constantly changing environment that requires quick and decisive action that can often shift your day to day priorities."
good,"the typical day was fun, hectic at times but nothing impossible to handle. management is very bad, they give you very little payroll to work with and expect wonders. the most enjoyable part of the job was the customer base."
good,If you don't like to game don't work for this company. its all that is on their minds and rightfully so.
good,"job duties included pushing pre-owned games, Gamestop membership and pre-orders."
good,"I have been with Gamestop almost 10 years. As far as what I have learned is the customers are what drives a business.  With the customers a company can not survive.The most enjoyable part of my job is making customers leave with a smile on their face.  That's when I know I have done my job. As far as co-workers its like any other job you have your good and bad, its all on how you work with them.  There is no such thing as a typical day, and the reason why i say this is because its all ways changing."
good,"If you are lucky enough to get a good store manager, GameStop can be a great place to work.  It's also a great place for younger people to get great management experience.  If you work hard and keep up your performance you might be able to move up.  Having said that, there aren't a lot of positions to move up into.  Personally my favorite part of my job at GameStop was training my new employees and talking to customers about the new stuff that was coming out and the recent releases that I enjoyed."
good,"A very fun work experience for video game lovers. Benefits and hours were very minimal however, and there was little room for advancement."
good,"A typical day is clocking in, file and shelf games away, talk to gamers with no life(other than the one in the next game), ring up customers, close store, vacuum, organize the walls, clock out, lock up, go home and wait a whole week before doing it again. "
good,Typical day was very routine.  The co-workers were great. Completed counts daily. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with my customers.
good,"- A typical day at work(if the manager did the scheduled on time) : Their will be a stack of games that need to be stocked on the shelf alphabetically. Every now and then a customer will ask for help searching or  advice on video game. My manager was usually busy so he didn't have time to help me with the cash register so i wasn't able to work the register selling games. But i was able to help look up games to see if we had it in out inventory."
good,Sometimes they would be EXTREMELY busy or EXTREMELY slow. There was really never any in between.
good,I was not treated very fairly and there was absolutely no way I could schedule anything around gamestop. They are very unpredictable and their morals can be questioned.
good,"Once you hit management, you're usually going to work a micromanaged schedule with a lot of hours, and a lot of high expectations for a pay rate that does not meet the work demand. While they would never personally say so, Gamestop prioritizes sales and add ons over their customer service, so cut throat sales technique is a must. You'll work every friday/saturday, and most holidays. (Some are reimbursed later as comp days.)"
good,"Stock shelves, manage register, help customer, good management (for the most part), corporate drama was worst part of job, most enjoyable was interacting with customers and talking about video games all day."
good,"I found GameStop to be decent place to work. On a day to day basis I worked a very simple register system selling games and managing store inventory. My expertise would often be requested by customers as they have to choose a game or research the difference between consoles.My only issue with the compnay was their tight rationing of alotted hours to the stores. I found it often put unnecessary stress on management to complete weekly tasks, train new workers and provide adequate coverage during peak hours. Stress on Management always has a trickle down effect."
good,A typical day at work involved stocking shelves greeting customers and processing trade-ins and getting them back out on the shelves.
good,Rent accounting evaluates current invoices of reoccurring monthly charges for store account. Ensure Land Lord is billing according to the terms of the lease contracts. Ensure that vendor and contact information for Land Lords is updated in rent accounting system. Answer and initiate telephone calls in a professional manner. Communicate effectively with management and coworkers.
good,"Typical day is, customer service, selling add on sales, shipment, and transfer outs. Weekends are just about selling."
good,"Full-time (ASM and up) positions typically work 8-9 hours a day with two days off a week. Teaches customer interaction and communication skills. Upper management doesn't typically have in-store experience and often makes poorly coordinated decisions, such as Marketing kits, sales, and other time-consuming tasks coupled with payroll cuts and mandatory meetings (which take time away from the store.)"
good,"The idea is great, but over the last few years the focus has not been on customer service, but more focused on getting reservations and subscriptions which takes away from the time put into helping the customer meet their needs. I was assistant manager and put 110% into my job everyday. This continuously went over looked because I was not pressuring my customers into reserving games they were not going to later purchase."
good,"It was my dream job untill i actually got it. Most days consist of customers yelling at you for the company's miserable trade-in values, checking large amounts of trade-in items, stickering game cases and placing them on the shelves. As an assistant manager I had to do any and everything expected of everyone else."
good,"GameStop will always appear to have their associates best interest at heart. The unfortunate truth is that they have very little concern with the lives/issues/concerns of their employees. If you're lucky you will find an excellent set of co-workers, but more often times than not you will land in a very unhappy place with people who hate their jobs more than DMV workers."
good,"Fun to talk about video games with customers, but can be very slow at times. Typical retail job, must stand at all times, keep store clean, help customers, work register."
good,* The Benefits are some of the best around
good,"A typical day at Gamestop involves progressive inventory counts, recieving and putting away shipment, signing and advertising, and first and foremost, helping customers find the right product for their needs. I definitely learned that spending the right amount of time with a customer is key as the store is often busy and there are very few empoyees scheduled at any given time. Management was not very helpful in guiding their employees towards the expected proceedures and it seemed, more often than not, like trial and error. The hardest part about the job is task management versus customer service. failure to multitask and provide excellent customer care and complete duties such as tagging and putting away trades, clean up, inventory, etc.....can result in an excessive amount of work to complete prior to close. However, it is enjoyable to be able to sell and talk about something that is very enjoyable to myself and knowing that you gave someone sound advise and sent them home with a product that you know they will love is very gratifying."
good,"GameStop overall has been a great experience for me. A typical day involves the number one priority which is assisting to what customer wants or needs along with other multiple tasks involving clerical assistance, organization and cashiering. I've learned alot from my experience here. Learned how to multitask and expand on working on pressure. Learned also to work greatly with a team (co-workers) and overall, improved immensely with my communication skills which play a key role in my position and in general. My co-workers were easy to get along with which made work more enjoyable and beneficial towards our daily tasks, Hardest part of the job is reaching the goal for the day such as a certain amount of reservations or sales but we find ways to help each other to thrive as a team and for the company as well. Most enjoyable part is helping customers with their needs involving our merchandise."
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company. Its a fun work environment, just don't expect much pay. loved the relationship you can have with the customers and the way you interact with them. if you have a passion for video games definitely give GameStop a try."
good,GameStop Inc. was a very fun work environment. Constantly working with people and helping those who need it.
good,"So I got this job at Gamestop as a seasonal job and it became a full time job for 2 years. I will say the job wasn't so bad but the actual company of Gamestop was. Most of the policies that were made in that time were shady. I will say though that the actual job was not too hard to do. Aside from learning their overly complex register system, anyone could do this job. Most of the time it involves, putting games on the shelves, alphabetizing the game sections, dusting the store, helping customers find games, and every so often reorganizing the store layout. Not that bad, just wished the company cared more for its employees."
good,"Gamestop isn't necessarily a bad company, it is definitely one of the jobs I have enjoyed the most through out my years working, its a great stepping stone if you aspire to move onto another game/tech based job but from what I've seen this is not something you can expect to see a lot of advancement from."
good,Working at Gamestop i enjoyed talking and comparing with my fellow nerds about our favorite games and leaning about new and upcoming titles. The flexibility was nice for being in college at the time but in doing so i lost some of my allotted hours.
good,"Tendenza ad un ambiente piuttosto competitivo e carico di responsabilità, tuttavia molto variegato e dunque piuttosto interessante."
good,"The policy they have are really not that good and they are just trying to change to save there company from closing. Everybody I work with is super nice and compassionate, but then at the same time you work alot through the week and the pay is terrible"
good,"GameStop is a fun work environment that is still a business, It is a place where you can help people who are interested in video games and other items of pop culture."
good,I can easily say that this is best job I've worked in terms of getting to talk to people about gaming. Coworkers are awesome and like minded. Corporate is so far removed and clueless that it makes working here stressful. They couldn't care less about employees. Extremely out of touch and havent a clue about gaming
good,The job it self wasn’t all that bad just management needs to change along with the corporation needs to take better care of its employees. I feel like I should of also moved up a little faster in the company with how I did my job.
good,Depending on what location you work at and what kind of Manager you work with will make or break your experience for you at GameStop. The company pushes 4 items on every sales associate that is essentially mouth vomit to push customers to buy their products.
good,GameStop is your go to job when you want a quick retail job that will satisfy your shopping needs in the same setting. Downfall of this job is the lack of compensation in comparison to the amount of items you have to try to push and sell with no sort of reqard.
good,"I don't mind working for the company, but direct management made enjoying the larger company more difficult. Granting independence and encouraging free thought do not go hand-in-hand with the level of micromanaging rampant throughout the different levels of leadership. This was my biggest and remains my chief--and frankly only--concern: that management is instructed to encourage independence yet also seeks to keep the shortest leash possible."
good,"If you think this job is going to be the fun filled dream you thought. It isn't. Thats just the truth, its a job in retail and they will. be relentlessly pushing their newest thing to do. Ever wonder why a sales associate there may be asking you add so many things onto the one game you came to purchase?"
good,"GameStop taught me that retail work can be fun, however under certain management, it can be driven to shambles.  The district manager of my store was never up to par on anything my store had accomplished even though we were one of the top-rated stores in my district."
good,"GameStop is a business that makes money, and sometimes that comes at the expense of the employees and guests. The work is easy, until you get rushed by a huge crowd and there’s only you or one other person, because they are extremely stingy with hours. And they’re not very understanding of the fact that you were just rushed by large crowds by yourself or with one other person, and still demand that you complete the workload of 3 to 4 people before they’re regularly scheduled closing."
good,Worked in the KYDC for 2 years. Very friendly and hard working mid-shift team. Management makes very poor and unreasonable decisions. Work is fairly easy with a lot of unannounced overtime during the seasonal months.
good,"Working at Gamestop, I've been kept busy keeping with people (Customers) and recommending games to players who are looking for something similar or wants to explore something different."
good,Job was okay and had it's ups and downs. Boss and coworkers were cool people and enjoyed gaming as much as the next guy. Would be good for holiday work.
good,"Overall, working here was mostly pleasant. The staff is friendly, and it's a very relaxed work environment. However, most new hires are only given 3-9 hours a week, and the only people who get to work full time are the manager and assistant manager. If you have a second job or are a student, it's a pretty decent place to work at."
good,If you wanted to work part time I would recommend it.  Full time they treat you horribly.  They threatened to fire if I didn’t sell cricket wireless while I was there.  Store leaders and assistant store leaders were told to lie to customers when they wanted a new game and say we only have preowned. Management treats us like used car salesmen trying to do what ever it took to sell preowned games and reserves.
good,"My overall experience at GameStop has been informative and mostly positive. With the exception of a few but constant hiccups in regards to constant upper level management changes and extreme turnover at different locations has left me wanting to step into a different profession."
good,"A typical day at work included logging in to our profile on the computer to find out what our daily tasks were, and completing them as soon as possible.  We also got distribution (inventory restock) in every day.  Other tasks were cleaning, restocking, and buying/selling merchandise."
good,They didn't give hours. The manger was always late. They were not fully prepared for events. But the works made it all fun. Learned Alot of different things on games.
good,"Like what the title said. The mangement got back and sadly that was the reason for my departure and the store clsoed down. If you're working for game stop too as a seasonal, its better for you to find another job. You're probably gonna be losing money working at gamestop as a seasonal then working part-time anywhere else."
good,Spent a lot of time very bored. Not terribly hard. Some managers were terrible. Typical retail stuff. Very Video Game oriented obviously. Need knowledge of game systems and video games. As well as initiative to find out things that aren't directly told to you. Coaching only helps for so long till management goes wonky.
good,"Good chance you'll have fun and easy to work with coworkers but pray you get an experienced manager. Policy changes tend be for the worse instead of better.  Depending on who your manager is, it'll be ""do this or else"" or he/she will act like a proper store leader instead of treating you like an underling.  Don't make this job you're life, you'll get nothing in return.  And if you apply to be a normal Guest Advisor, make sure to have another job with it cause your hours will be awful."
good,"great work environment, great team work and leadership building, lots of interesting people and challenges to meet and over come,but the pay wasn't great."
good,Not a place to work if looking to advance in life. Fun environment if you enjoy the gaming culture and selling to like minded individuals. Great team building experience if you like small teams.
good,"My time at GameStop would rank a 6.5 if IGN reviewed it. It's fun selling and talking about video games and related fandoms and meeting sales goals, but consistently shifting or otherwise unclear goals from higher up made things difficult during promotions or big launches."
good,"GameStop è l'azienda furba che vuole fatturare sulle spalle dei clienti. C'è poco da fare. I primi mesi sono stati tosti per accettare questa mentalità, devi lavorare sui KPI, cosa buona, ma a discapito del cliente, cosa grave, usando modi di fare o di dire ambigui."
good,"Anyone who thinks GameStop employees can just play lots of Games is wrong.  There's a lot of work that goes into being an employee there.  Maintaining the cases on the walls, distro, making sure people aren't stealing.  Thats just monday.  Counts and everything else happen all the time.  Its fun if you and your co workers MAKE it fun.  I was lucky I had great co workers and great manager."
good,"Overall atmosphere is good here but pay is low. There isnt always something to di so most of the time you are waiting for someone to walk in. I would recommend this job for an 18 year old trying to learn customer service. Gamestops main focus is making money, you have weekly goal that you must meet, which half the time are impossible to meet."
good,"GameStop is a great place to work if you love games, are great at selling and do not have any expenses whatsoever. The sales goals while I was there were frankly unrealistic with the changing market, but I did not feel chastised when there was a week we did not hit a sales goal, the store manager tried to motivate instead. This is hearsay but I heard other places were not as lucky as I. The pay was abysmal as an assistant store manager, it is tough to make end meet if you just want a car and want to pay rent. It is because of this that I left, and many other talented sales associates left, because other companies offered more competitive pay."
good,"Unfortunately the business model has been steadily declining as the industry moves to digital distribution and the sales have been sharply declining. This caused the CEO (before he passed away) to try and diversify the company portfolio so all their eggs weren't in one basket. Unfortunately that has not proved to be successful and the tech brand/mobile phone division was sold off which resulted in my unemployment. They have not been able to find a new CEO to take over, have been unable to sell the company, they underpay their corporate workers, and as the future is grim I would not recommend taking a job at this company."
good,Work wasn't tough but there was a lot of busy work to do. I was always told to not stand around but there was nothing to do so I had to do a lot of wall counts to do.
good,"There is not much that is valued in your job they just expect you to work and make sales, memberships,game warranty that don't cover much and you are encouraged to smoother the customer until they get annoyed."
good,It is a game store that really drives metrics with-out further rewarding you for meeting their goals. It is not hard work and can be fun but as any retail job can be stressful.
good,"Work was very fast-paced so there was very little downtime. Low staff during peak hours was a tiny bit stressful. Hours were hard to come by if you were looking for more than 10-15 a week. Like most places, some of the staff were great people, others less so. "
good,"It a fun place to work with great coworkers, but there are very few chances to get promoted and the most positions don't get enough benefits for the worth of it. We are supposed to hit expected numbers yet we don't earn compensation so there is only punishment for not doing our job."
good,"Exactly what you would expect from a job here. They have a large focus as a company on numbers and percentages, and getting customers to come back. The coworkers are the best part of this job."
good,"I love video games so getting to work at Gamestop was a dream. My only complaint was there was a pressure to get pre order sales and subscriptions for Game Informer magazine, and  while you were judged by your number of sales there was no incentive to get more. Though this was years ago and the management may have changed since then."
good,"So this was a job that I held and advanced through when I was young with almost 0 responsibilities. That worked great for me, but ultimately it wouldn't have been able to keep me for long. Store Managers are salary and on more than one occasion myself and others worked 70+ hour weeks due to under-staffing. The job itself isn't difficult, with few things to complain about outside of the customer or lack of advancement. Over the years since I've left, staffing has diminished even further."
good,"There weren’t enough hours being provided, there was a huge lack. If I was offered more hours then I would’ve continued work there there but due to the lack, it failed."
good,Learn to communicate with both co-workers and customers very well. Hardest part at first is to learn how to be very open to others all around. Being able to talk to people is a very keen way to learn different skills on how to approach people.
good,"This company has good medical benefits. Compensation is not that great.  The work/life balance is not good. Off days change from week to week and hardly ever receive weekends off. Company makes most of profit from preowned products. Staff is required to recommend preowned over new games, even if new games are on sale for a lower price,"
good,"- Lots of customer interactions"
good,nice spot to work if your in school not so much if your looking for a career flexible hours for school and second job if that applies to you the hardest part is when the holdiday is near it seems though your not moving fast enough and you start to feel overwhelmed
good,"Gamestop can be a fun and eventful place to work as long as the management team is right for the job. This job takes strong management backing and if it is not provided, the whole team will fail and workers will start leaving. This is why GameStop has a high turnover rate."
good,You love it one minute then hate it the next in all honesty. I need a fixed up schedule and the reassurance Im going to have enough money to pay my bills I can't have someone goofing around with the schedule all the time.
good,"very boring as I stand around all day stacking the same shelves that don't need stacking"
good,"Over the years I worked on and off for Gamestop usually as a seasonal or part time supplemental income. I always had great relationships with co workers and customers. The work was enjoyable for me, be it very busy and fast paced during the season. Unfortunately pay was not competitive and advancement was rare."
good,"Gamestop is a fun to place to work as a second job or if you're in high school or college. A typical day is like any other retail job; stock the shelves, ring up customers, ETC. If you get to be a manager or ""key holder"" you have to do a lot of paperwork and inventory. The upper management is really a roll of the dice depending on your area. The hardest part of the job is the demand of pre-orders they require you to get on a day to day basis. It's been a while since I left the company so that workplace culture may have changed. That being said, it was a fun place to work and my store managers were always fantastic."
good,"Boring most of the time. Very easy and laid-back work. The interview process involved meeting with the store manager, and him saying ""well you seem like a pretty cool guy to hang out with. You got the job."""
good,If your a full time college student and need part-time work gamestop has great flexible. I was fortunate enough to have Great store management at my location.
good,The focus was so great on production that the stress on the employees was very high. Managers would tell supervisors to coach employees who would tell leads to warn them. After three coachings you were let go.
good,I had fun at GameStop but I got less than 15 hours a week and my shifts were 4 hours each. Unless you come in as a keyholder this job is not worth the headache
good,Not a bad company to work for. They just need to be more transparent about what is going on and they need to compensate employees better. For example if you speak multiple languages you would think you’re more valuable but they don’t see that as something all that valuable.
good,the jobs has it up and downs. The real part of the job comes in with their Circle of Life goals and plans which are very unrealistic and doesn't count for the area you are working in.
good,"There's a competitive pace for earning a better position while working here, but the competition is stiff. The pay rate is not worth it, the amount of hours as a full time employee don't equal part time hours."
good,The store was a lot of fun at first. Except upper management wants you to jam credit cards and dlc down the customers throats. It became quite a toxic environment.
good,I loved GameStop. The midnight launches were fun but now GameStop is treating there employees bad.  The district manager that I had was bad. GameStop wanted employees to basically make customers feel uncomfortable as soon as they want in that door. The rules were that as soon as someone walks in that door. We have to greet them and ask them about 100 questions to make them sign up for the membership card. If you don’t like pushing things to customers like credit cards or membership then this job is not for you and it’s not worth the pay either. If we don’t mention about the “Circe of life” then we could get fired for not doing it. The circle of life is basically a list that you have to tell the customers. We have to tell them about trades and the membership and pre owned stuff and I forgot the last thing but if we don’t mention all that to the customers then you would have to work less hours or you would get written up or fired if they don’t like you. GameStop was fun until they starting making there employees push customers into the circle of life. Oh btw you get 15% off of everything in GameStop but not on new systems
good,"Very fun job to work, lots of good people who work with you who are also interested in the same types of things. Easy to get along with people and make friends with customers and employees. Corporate is a pain to deal with though. Once they come in they will make sure your life is rough. Only problem with the company is that."
good,The job felt like it was just checking off things on a check list. Had a daily conference call which made sure that we stayed on the robotic sales methods that they applied. Shipment was expected to be done where customers could not see you while greeting every customer that walked into the store. You were expected to be theft prevention in the store.
good,"I enjoy working here as a student, but I have found that there is no real place for advancement. Very much numbers based with a huge emphasis on reaching specific goals, some of which I disagree with."
good,Both upper management and customer base tend to be incredibly sexist. It is made clear the your hire is to fill a female employment quota. Was offered promotions that were then given to male counterparts.
good,"I worked for GameStop three different times. My first tenure was in high school, and it was my first job. For what I needed at the time, i couldn't have asked for more. Later, after college, I returned for a year as an Assistant Manager. In the higher ranks, frustration mounts. GameStop is a retail location specializing in a product that, even at the time of my employment, was diminishing as a categories. The advent of media streaming and digital game purchases threatened the business, and as such there was often a frantic feeling of the company trying to salvage their brand and business."
good,"Very fast pace with low payroll. More cut due to the industry changing but the demand was still there. Product knowledge is very important, won’t be successful if you don’t know simple  terminology of the gaming or tech industry."
good,Not much room for advancement. Good environment for someone young without much need of a steady income. Perfect for someone in high school or straight out of school looking for part time work.
good,"GameStop is a fun company to work for, especially if you love gaming. The are some great perks such as free games, discounts and opportunity for advancement. However, compensation is low and goals are sometimes extremely difficult to achieve."
good,"This was a fun place to work.  But there was little opportunity to make the full time or year round staff.  Manager was awesome, but hours were few.  Discounts were cool."
good,"While it was fun to work here, the trouble is getting enough hours to pay the bills. This is a good part time job for fluff money but don't expect to stay long for advancement."
good,"My first store was the better of the two I've worked at. Coworkers became good friends and my manager was one of the most caring mentors I can imagine any workplace to have. He gave me many words of encouragement and advice that I could apply to any future job, and he did it for that very purpose too. A real people person."
good,"I worked at GameStop for about 3 years and honestly haven't had a more fun, energetic and all around great group of co-workers that I was pained to leave. However, the Upper Management was very strict and left no room for human error or changing trends. Because of this I was forced to leave before they tried to compile a reason to fire me over something trivial. If you love games it is an amazing place to pick up a quick seasonal and check out some amazing individuals."
good,I'd really rather not share anymore than I have. I think others reading this can get the idea from how I rated them . It wasn't for me and lets just leave it at that.
good,The biggest thing I didn't like was the hours that I got on a weekly basis. The biggest thing I did like was the discount given to employees even though it was only on pre-owned items.
good,"This job is good for those who enjoy video games and people friendly."
good,"You go in get situated, then start working. learned how to systemically move and place things where they belong. management is good sometimes not really understanding but debatable. lots of wonderful people, lots of culture. the people and the culture is the best parts."
good,"Most customers are particular and demanding no matter where the Gamestop is located, and the management is not able to see how the stores are run in a usual setting so their decisions are subpar when it comes to knowing what is best as far as customer satisfaction which leaves the managers of particular stores left to explain these decisions and take the brunt of the frustrated consumers. A lot of free stuff is given however and the employees are usually fun"
good,I enjoyed the customer service end of this job but felt the management was poor. There was never more then one person on shift so there was little room for training.
good,"At first I was excited to work here; first job. But it's so empty a lot of the time and it's such a small store that someone who gets bored easily should not work here. I was hired as ""seasonal"" during the months of October to January. I probably only had two 4 hour shifts a week when I wanted a lot more. Other than that, it wasn't too bad I guess. Everyone who worked their was nice and pretty chill."
good,"""Hey you should pre-order this game that you don't wont. Oh you don't want that game well how about this game instead. So you don't want that game either, well you should get our power up rewards card because I need to keep up these numbers or else I won't get hours to work..."""
good,You need to be bilingual to go anywhere career-wise in refurbishment. So called bonuses for production were virtually unattainable unless you were in tight with the runners (Who don't speak English very well).
good,"Gamestop was an intense experience for me.  It seemed as though we were constantly busy and understaffed because corporate wouldn't allow us any extra hours.  My manager at the time was commuting from Springfield to Mattoon, and the drive took its toll on him.  He was lazy and ineffectual.  As a result, the store was always a chaotic mess on the floor and behind the scenes.  However, we did get along on a personal level.  The phone was constantly ringing off the hook, there was lots of foot traffic from customers--it was always very busy and very fast-paced.  This made the days go by quickly, though.  Upper management was severely out of touch and cared more about numbers than the well-being of their employees.  There were benefits and retirement, but they weren't too good.  There were paid vacation days, and that was nice.  Also, employees were able to rent out games from the store to become familiar with the product, which was a nice bonus.  Overall, it allowed me to pay off my bills while I went to school, but I am glad to have moved on."
good,"Always fun talking to people about video games on a day to day basis, always worked with really good people and had a great boss, great job if your into video games."
good,"It was too much for too little, and the management seemed like it didn't care for its employees. Good to help your salesmanship though if needed, but surely not a stable job."
good,"The work culture at Game Stop lacks communication and enthusiasm. It's not easily identifiable because of the poor management. However, it has taught me to create my own employee culture with my colleagues which has bettered my social skills. The hardest part of my job is advancing and growing within the company because of the disrespect they have for a young adult such as myself. Although I have the experience and knowledge to grow, they are very close minded about having a diverse staff member."
good,"Video games are more than just a hobby. They are your passion. They carry you to new worlds, transform you into new beings, and let you participate in the telling of stories. You want to play as many as you can, but it can get expensive."
good,"Retail is always a numbers game, but GameStop sets ridiculous standards most of the time that are nearly impossible to meet. I love helping people find what they need, but at times it feels like we have to sort of coerce them into signing up for our membership because we have to hit a quota."
good,the job as a whole went downhill  laid off cause they closed a bunch of stores. 9 years down the drain  they got extremely pushy with goals near theend
good,Every day we would begin by doing price changes on games. weekly we would take inventory and go through new game release training to keep up to date on all of the newly released games. each day we were expected to reach a quota of new and preowned games along with pro cards and merchandise and if this quota often went unsatisfied we risked being written up. This job was extremely stressful and we as part-time employees were constantly going overtime due to the extreme workload.
good,"A high pace competitive environment, where ranking is critical to your success. Was able to travel to our annual conference which was fun for the time. Worked midnights and late inventories."
good,There was always favoritism going on in the store and I did not like the way certain managers treated our employees. My pay was not the best for all they had me doing and as far as work I loved what I did. I feel they need to treat everyone equally and with respect.
good,A typical day at work consisted of putting the appropriate boxes in my zone and labeling them. Zoners would bring product to my belt and I would scan them in. Numbers appeared under the boxes telling me how much product was to be put in the box.
good,A typical day at GameStop was making our customers feel welcomed and trying our best to get them to buy games that they like. I learned that being a manager there has been kind of stressful because you have pressure being put on you. One thing that was hard was trying to keep my sales number up because it all depends on the customers and what they want to spend their money on. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing customers faces when buying a new game or hearing them talk about their favorite game. Management was hectic because my supervisor was very strict and most of the blame went on me when other co-workers would mess up. However I liked being able to help my team become the best they can be so we can be the best store in the Bronx!
good,"I am working at GameStop as a seasonal Game Advisor, which is a good opportunity to make some extra cash if you have a regular full-time job. The fun part is that you can talk about your video game passion with customers and co-worker and be on top of the new games and systems that are coming up. Also, you have 15% discount on most merchandise. Unfortunately, it excludes new systems. "
good,I enjoyed working with the customers more than the actual job itself. My staff mates seemed to dislike me and the fact I was phrased on how well I worked while they proceeded to goof off.
good,"I had fun with my fellow employees and our customers, but ultimately decided to move on because the pay just wasn't worth the stressful workload. Payroll was a constant issue, and the store never felt like it had enough associates on staff."
good,"The hours suit my schedule for the most part. The people I work with are usually pretty great. The community and culture are by far the best parts of the job. The benefits are decent and they have plenty of options. Compensation/wage starts low. There is plenty of room for advancement, but it's not nearly efficient enough and they tend to keep you in one place unless you officially request otherwise. The work itself is interesting and fast-paced. Problem is that it simply takes too long to make a living on this full-time job."
good,A lot depended on whether or not your manager was a decent human being. I had some really great managers and I had some really bad managers. It would be best if the good/bad managers could be separated better.
good,Free game trials..But no room for advancement or Promotions. poor Location. Trade in system seems un fair to consumers and their customers............
good,"Hard to move up if you aren't female."
good,"you work to hard and you are not compensated for it, all they care about is sales and they don't care if you are injured or sick, you still have to show up to work"
good,I only worked at GameStop during the holiday season. To me it was very simple. The only chaotic time period was during the release of new video games.
good,"Gamestop is a pretty good gig if you make it to store manager. Many vendors give us gifts and the mandatory 4 hours of overtime is appreciated at the end of the month. If you are looking at entry level, good luck. Most people at entry level get between 3- 6 hours a shift."
good,Standard retail. Very hard to get a full time position. Compensation is low but it can be a fun place to start a career. Generally not your only source of income.
good,It became a number game and they theaten your job on a daily bases if numbers are not hit. They don't care about the employees only that numbers are being hit.
good,"High paced sales job, you may not get many hours a week unless you are a keyholder and meet weekly percentages. It's a nice environment, with nice co-workers and you will meet a variety of personalities.  You will enjoy a nice discount while working there and have a chance to win bonuses( lunch for example) for well performing stores.  The hardest part of the job is probably meeting the sales goals every week, but if you follow the proper behaviors set by Gamestop, it should not be too much of a problem."
good,"Ambiente giovane e dinamico, orari buoni, stipendio buono"
good,"My manager would discriminate me and my co workers daily, and when I called to try and seek help I was severely reprimanded. Other wise very relaxed and fun work environment, besides when the AC broke down"
good,Not the worst place to work. Very numbers driven. Good for learning how to manage. Good place if you like video games. Kind of ask you to lie to the customers to get the numbers they want
good,"Juggling many tasks while being attentive to guests coming in. Learned to multitask"
good,"Gamestop can be a fun place to work, but I was only working once a week most of the time which obviously doesnt pay the bills. Most people I worked with were nice and willing to help, others not so much, it could be very hostile"
good,"I worked at Gamestop for about a year, during the beginning of my employment I was in a very stable and relaxed work environment. As the company changed direction though, the store became less about the customers and more about stretch goals. Angry and rude managers were promoted while hard working and friendly individuals stayed at the bottom strictly based on a number system that didn't work."
good,"It's great especially if you love video games but in the end it's still retail, never lose sight of that. It really just depends on the location of the store and the management. Sometimes it seems like they care too much about the wrong things and how they get about The Circle of Life is a little over the top. Definitely a stepping stone job."
good,"Gamestop is the place to work if you want to be apart of small teams that have large goals to accomplish together. Learn all the aspects of running multimillion dollar small strores. Management is hit and miss depending on what market you are assigned too, the companies shifting cultures to identify with a larger audience with the emergence of digital media and entertainment."
good,"Working at GameStop is never easy, and this is because of the number of tasks they will give us that is meant for 2-3 experienced people, while it will be one experienced person, and one not so experienced. I have found it hard to handle tasks at a time and complete what needs to be done for the company either because I am dealing with hundreds of trades in one day, or the load given to me is inhumanly possible. Not to say I cannot do better per se, but I feel upper management could do better to try and help us and not hurt us, especially with Circle of Life. Other than that, I do enjoy the costumer's and the atmosphere, it just needs to work out its kinks."
good,Higher management (some store managers and higher) only care for performance and how good an employee looks on a spreadsheet and not about instore service.
good,"After years of working at game stop, there are things that I love and thing I dislike about the company. The clientele is hit or miss, with some great people, and some not so great people."
good,"My experience with Gamestop as a GA was overall net positive. I enjoy the clients and the people I worked with. There was opportunity for advancement. There are downsides and I feel compelled to list them. In general the company over-hires (reducing the hours they can give to people wanting to work). The companies pay is not competitive expect minimum, unless you are management."
good,"GameStop is a dying company. There's nothing wrong with working there temporarily but it is not a sure thing kind of job. For example, my boyfriend has been working for them for six years and they still won't give him a full time position. He loves his co-workers and is extremely good at his job, getting more done than the managers  on most days, yet a promotion is nearly impossible. When I worked there it wasn't for very long so I never felt that I was cheated of anything, it was merely temporary work experience until I could find something better. In that regard it's perfectly acceptable. Just don't expect to stay very long and remain in a happy place."
good,(Store manager) I loved the job but it asked for to much to pay so little. Management was great but it all depends on the District. Leaving was bittersweet.
good,the Environment is fun and the people are usually good.  but the pay doesn't scale well and there is little to no room for advancement...Better than McDonalds for first job not a career opportunity
good,Ring up customers for there new or used games they would like to purchase. put games back on to the wall make sure everything was place in the proper place.
good,"As much as I loved video games and helping people this job did not provide a happy assurance to either. "
good,GameStop is not very transparent abouf their growth or lack there of. Their performance is always communicated to the masses before actual employees. Want to know if we are performing well turn to msnbc
good,"Basic retail job. A lot of customer service, selling games and gaming equipment. It was my first job and I gained alot of experience working with them."
good,"It's a great place to work if you manage to get hired, but if they promise advancement, it'll never come. Other than that, the atmosphere is great and the people are nice."
good,just made sure customer got the correct items needed for special needs kid just listening to joy that was brought to both mother and child was good was great
good,"I feel that I can't give a truly accurate representation of work at Gamestop. I only worked for 3 months as a temp. The work environment was fun and overall relaxed where I could focus on the customer easily but, that by no means came with a small workload. each task was easily performed but, there were a large amount of details to pay attention to even in such a small location. That being said I most certainly enjoyed the work"
good,"I walk in put my book-bag down in the back room and tackle the goals of my shift."
good,"Greeting cutomers, asking them if they were looking for anything specific, and then if they were bringing them to that item on the sales floor."
good,"It's pretty much what you'd expect. Culture's pretty stagnant, and unless you have a good manager who cultivates it can actually be pretty toxic. It's easy to climb through the ranks if you put in the time, but probably not worth it, as even ASM positions pay less than entry work of other careers."
good,I was a seasonal associate at Game stop but they didn't train me well enough and didn't have enough time to explain how to do some of the sales area so this job was lived very short after the holidays were over.
good,"A great work culture, but the middle and lower tier management is almost entirely comprised of persons who are not developed enough to be in their roles. A lot of ""right place and right time"" supervisors who are not fit to lead the company while higher tier leadership are excellent."
good,Physical software sales are decreasing and corporate is throwing darts looking for a solution to diminishing sales. The company cares much more about stock prices than field level employees.
good,Good place to start if your're in high school and want a little money to hang out with friends not for a career. You will enjoy for the most part being with your co workers if you all get along work will be a blast if not the days will seem like weeks when you work
good,A days work is clocking in opening the registers. Doing inventory counts. Helping customers with their needs and purchases. Making sure we reach our sales goals and personal goals.
good,"In the beggining it was a great company, but as a store manager you are over worked and underpaid. Especially if you have a T3 or higher store. It is slow so you basically only make hourly. Plus the weekly operations need to be modified."
good,"Consistent knowledge given on a daily basis for products that company sells, coming out, as well as online products. Great learning environment for gamers of all kinds With assigned deadlines, this company helped me become better at my time management skills. This company is all about 100% customer service and trying to provide an experience for them as they enter the store. DM/RM's set up training for star candidates, to become district trainers to help management. I have been a district trainer for 10 managers for over 3 years. I was able to help some employees grow into managers, as well as help give a little bit more training to current managers in some areas."
good,"Management really determines whether or not this is a fun job or not. If you have a good manager, then you'll find enjoyment in your work. The fast paced environment makes for a great learning environment, and there is a lot to learn."
good,"This was a good place to work under the Head Manager.   I was given the job when I stayed after to help the manager fix a display his own employees could not.   He saw my determination and awarded me a job, the only complaint was a minimum hours given to me to work."
good,"I enjoyed being able to talk to people about games. That's kind of a must for a job that involves talking about and selling video games and other electronics all day. I had fun coworkers with similar passions and strong work ethics. Customers came into the store expecting quality service and information and they definitely received it from us."
good,Non posso rilasciare nessuna recensione per motivi contrattuali
good,"Your work ethics has very little to do with advancement. A reliable staff can make it ok though. Some customers definitely made my day, some made it unbearable. Some of the management staff is too high and mighty and look down on everyone else below them."
good,Was great working there and receiving all those free games.  I was really excited when I got my PS4 for free!  This company keeps you updated on all things gaming and to keep you up to speed they give you a hands on experience!
good,The only wrong with working at games stop was the fact that they never had enough hours for there employees. it was great working with other employees.
good,"Gamestop puts a lot of pressure and focus on your performance and whether you were able to get pro card/basic card, game warranty or warranty on systems and are you selling Pre owned  versus new  products since GameStop doesn't  make any profit on new game they profit on pre-own so they prioritize selling pre-own product if you do not exceed In this you will get in trouble and get less hours."
good,"At Gamestop, my coworkers were fantastic. I remember my first week or so on the job everyone was very supportive and happy to help. The customers were also very friendly most of the time."
good,Gamestop is fully based on how many little things you sell in one transaction. If you do not meet the requirements then it does not look good.
good,"Assisting other members to achieve goals."
good,"Hardest part of the job is meeting the requirements of the company, pressuring people to sign up for subscription based programs, or credit cards. "
good,"I've been lucky to have the teams I have, but corporate has a lot to work on if they actually want to keep the good employees."
good,"The experience given by this company can help people either move up in the ranks within the organization or prepare you for life outside. Over the past 3.5 years, multiple dynamics and focuses changed with the intention of creating a Service Based culture not seen in other corporations. Staff members are trained and upheld to the highest degree in being able to surpass guest (not called customers) expectations on a daily basis. "
good,"Gamestop is an excellent job for hourly employees. The training software was simple to use, enjoyable, and effective. Store managers were consistently available to assist or train. We were never too understaffed, even during black friday. "
good,"Working at Gamestop was a fun experience solely because of my co-workers. Gamestop itself doesn't really seem to care for its employees as it will fire them on the most minuscule and vague of rules violations (which did not happen to me for the record). Gamestop is the definition of corporate greed, having its employees listen to the same advertisement videos over and over again as it pushes them to sell used games at barely below market value and buy used games at dirt cheap non-negotiable prices."
good,I enjoyed my time with gamestop. It serves at a great ground building place for students and those who enjoy gaming. The managers are great people and the business is very easy to understand as well as adapt to.
good,"Gamestop is a company that just drains the life out of you. Everyday you go through the same routine and hours they give each store is so terrible. As a store manager, I would work alone until mid afternoon getting all the tasks nearly done before I can even have a helping hand. My employees were great and helped me out whenever I needed them but with so little payroll it is hard for them to even get a profit for their work. The most enjoyable part of the job was having customers that would be there everyday to talk to as i did my work. Hardest part of the job was having to work long hours with no other employees. I learned that I was doing way too much work for the pay I was receiving."
good,"the most enjoyable part of my job is the interaction, the familiar faces I meet and make friends with. For the most part it is a very chill job. With sweet Christmas benefits of free games & game systems (sadly only for the Store Manager and sometimes the Assistant Manager...). However, the hardest part of the job is... the interaction. Being treated like trash by some of the meanest people I've ever had the unfortunate experience of having to cater to. The verbal and mental abuse that this job, and really all retail jobs, have their employee's endure is leagues worse than what I've had to experience in any other facet of my life (including my time in the military)."
good,"non-skilled employment"
good,Gamestop is a massive videgame and electronics retailer. The pay is not the greatest and there is constant pressure to upsell and reach quotas
good,"Selling video games is an interesting and fun job, and it's made better when you're able to converse with the clientele to find exactly what they're looking for and provide them with their perfect service. However, while I worked there I was only given two days of work for the first month and a half, after calling in twice a week asking for hours and checking the schedule. The only time they gave me any more days to work was when I wasn't calling in due to a family vacation, and they didn't bother to tell me about being scheduled."
good,"This is a great place to work throughout your college years. It is not for everyone but you can create a career out of it. Your coworkers are the best part of the job and customers can make or break your day,"
good,"A typical day at work would be interacting with customer finding out what type of games or electronics they want. Keeping games in stock, informing customers of all the promotions we had."
good,A large company focused strongly on bottom line of exceeding sales and profit plans. Prioritizes customer service over day to day tasks. Rewarding at times but often stressful when sales plans are not achieved. Lower than average wages for part time employees often leads to frequent turnover.
good,"This place is for part-time only, if you want a little spend money theirs better jobs. They want you to do alot for minimum wage."
good,"GameStop is the leader in video game sales. With that being said, thousands of people would love to work for the company with hopes of landing a discount within the company. I came along as a key holder from outside the company excited to bring my previous work knowledge into the new job. My managers were professional, at first. Afterwards there was a lot of down talk and not so nice remarks in regards to other employees. The pay was low for all of the hard work we put in. This job would be perfect for a teen in high school, I wouldn't recommend this for a career."
good,Depending on opening/closing there are usually only some responsibilities that you need to maintain. Most of your time is interacting with customers and selling new/used video games. The other half is maintaining a clean store and making sure traded games are alphabetized in the file and put on the shelves to show customers options on used titles.
good,"Spawnlabs started out as a really great company to work for but as time progressed it became difficult. The management was very much into punitive micro-management. They had great work-from-home policies and the work was exciting and cutting edge, working on video game streaming over the Internet. Ultimately the division was shut down."
good,"A typical day was cashier and customer service. I learned about the consoles and many games. I had good co-workers and no bad encounters. The hardest part of the job was assuring accuracy of all items returned. I had daily sales goals item counts and conference calls to complete and visual merchandising constantly changed."
good,"Stocking merchandise, Customer service, and sales were my main focuses at Gamestop.  I led a team to increase our sales goals every year and to up sell GameInformer subscriptions and video game reserves.  I did not care for the way that corporate ran things more often than not they seemed unsure of what would be best for the company.  I enjoyed working with my team, although my store manager would put pressure on her employees when there didn't need to be making it a somewhat bad work environment."
good,"not many available hours. low pay for the knowledge that you need to have about games and gaming systems. varying schedules, not enough training"
good,"Gamestop is a fun place to work if you're looking for something very part time and casual. Those with sales skills will excel here with the many promotions, add-ons, and services provided by Gamestop. The position is very much like most other retail experiences. Sales goals, housekeeping, and cash registers are your bread and butter. Co-workers will usually have some common interests based on video games, and many teams feel like a small social group."
good,It's a fun place to work for the most part. The coworkers are good guys. The work isn't hard. The management wasn't too good though.
good,"great team, enjoyed my role immensely, considerate, friendly and efficient management. good hours along with ample opportunity to talk about an area that interests me."
good,"This job is not quite what a person would expect. The average day consists of a lot of tasking, up-selling, and sales percentages. Management does a good job of making sure it's employees are always aware of it's sales goals. You are required to up-sell insurance on video game discs, pre-orders for upcoming game releases, Gamestop Rewards memberships, Credit Cards, and additional accessories."
good,"The job is rather fun, but there are some problems that could be addressed. "
good,"Must be able to work alone for parts of the day, multitasking a lot of different things at once. Payroll often leaves a morning person alone for the beginning of the day, which could be problematic if you are not fast at completing specific tasks while also maintaining excellent customer service."
good,"Slow stores can be fun, but busy stores need better staffing levels"
good,"Gamestop sounds like a great place to work if you're a gamer, but it's not all its cracked up to be. Hours are scarce unless you're a part of the management team for the store you're working at. Hours are given to you based on performance, but that ""performance"" can easily be skewed depending on a customer that comes in on any given day. However, not even being the best performing worker can net you good hours. "
good,Gamestop is an decent place to work if you do not have any immediate bills and If you can get by on minimal hours and reasonable pay. For the most part gamestop is not a terribly hard job if you can speak well and show confidence in what you are saying. The part of the job that I liked the best is the fact that you meet very different people everyday.
good,The job was cool and I enjoyed work for them.Yet the time i work there i notice that they never promoted anyone in my area.
good,"As an avid gamer myself, I loved the idea of working at gamestop since I was old enough to play T rated games. Unfortunately it's not all that it has cut out to be. "
good,A great challenge that exposes you to many challenges of retail management. Highly accountable and highly rewarding when successful.
good,Lack of payroll and incredibly high goals and expectations. Good benefits and overall a fun environment.
good,I only worked about 5 hours every two weeks. Was also seasonal and not much hiring happens.
good,"On going multi tasking job, with customers and sales, and consistent challenges in the day to day business."
good,"people tend to think of this job as just playing games, but it's not.in ever changing technology it is as constant changing whether visuals,  marketing and above all sale mentality on a daily basis. operations and market brand emphasized with guest service. product knowledge a must in which most of it is from learning through outside resources."
good,Its really exciting going to work to be around video games all day and people who share the same interest.
good,"The Typical day at Gamestop started off by making sure the games work presented correctly on the shelves as well as making sure the games were in alphabetical order. Then I would continue by making recommendations to customers and helping them choose the correct game to buy. I learned how to look up items by keyword. I also learned how to use a few interesting tools. they helped me reach high places that held products. My shift was at slow points during the day so there were was one another co-worker who was scheduled with me, but it was always the same person every time. The hardest part of this job was figuring out where to find the games. All games were coded with a number by what console ran which game. it was very confusing. The most enjoyable part at this job was talking about something I knew a lot about, Games!!"
good,Leadership hired to many seasonal employees and didn't know what to do with everyone so they laid 90% of them off after Black Friday.
good,"No job security."
good,"My time at Gamestop was ok, not enough hours, but dealt with customers about video games which i like so it was sort of fun. I mainly stood by the door to welcome people and would also be at the cash register when customer was ready for purchase."
good,"Gamestop is a company that has an infinite amount of information and reviews out there, from numerous perspectives and some of it good some of it bad."
good,"Pretty cool place to work at, had outstanding coworkers and regular customers. It was always enjoyable to interact with the customers for the most part, and help them figure out what they wanted. There wasn't any real difficulties of the job."
good,"Great job to hold if you are part-time. Company looks at your stats for subscriptions, game pre-orders and add on sales."
good,Gamestop es una compañia diverida donde trabajar pero a su vez se trabajan muchas horas del dia.
good,policies & goals changed regularly. No matter how awesome you did at something it still wasn't good enough. Constantly threatened that I was easily replaced.
good,"A typical day for me at Game Stop (which was part time) usually involved helping customers find specific games or place pre-orders. We were encouraged to promote magazine subscriptions and I was the number one in the entire city of Austin in relation to the number of hours that I worked at the time."
good,It is a Fun place to work if you like to play videogames. Meet some interesting people each day. You get to know when new games plus new systems come out. Co-workers are always fun they make the job fun. I've learned how to manage others so when I do become a manger I will be a great store manger.
good,"At Gamestop, a senior game advisor handles a bunch of the same responsibilities as the other managers. Customers can be tough but good customer service can always help resolve issues. Job security is difficult but staying focused can help you avoid getting terminated."
good,"Company is sales but different the more you meet quotas doesn't mean more money in turn it means more hours to make more money, but does put you in an easy position for promotion."
good,"If you're into games, it's an alright job to have.  However, they don't pay much and there are frequent managerial mix-ups.  "
good,"Interacting with multiple customers at a time, while balancing a number of store and company related tasks that must be done by the end of the day. I have definitely learned how to multitask as well as prioritize work load. I have worked under 7 managers and 6 assistant managers as well as numerous other sales associates like myself due to the fact the company has a high rate of employee turnover. Most leave because the company overworks them or low pay forces them to find work elsewhere or hours become scarce. The hardest part of the job is not quitting when hours are reduced during the off season to only a shift a week for us low level guys.And ""off season"" is most of the year except towards the end of every quarter. Most enjoyable of the job is the video games, seriously its a company that sells video games whats not to like about that."
good,It was nice to have somewhere to have inside work for part of the winter months while work was slow at my other job
good,"the hours here are horrible but they call you in when they need people to work, pay is horrible etc.."
good,"10 hour days, 5-7 days a week, constant movement on feet."
good,"Heavy job load with multiple job duties."
good,"When I started working at Gamestop in 2006, the popular trend of video games was limited to a niche market of people who enjoyed their game of choice privately. Video Games were not mainstream until the release of the Nintendo Wii, and Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare were released, as these games allowed for people to interact with others in a more causal method than any other games in the past decade."
good,"A typical day would be slow at first nothing to special till rush hour. "
good,One of the best things about my job is meeting new people. I have met really good customers that are very loyal and knowledgeable about our product.  There is a lot of work there and it has to be done by corporate standards and sometimes it will change in the blink of an eye. This company has wonderful benefits as far as insurance and rewards for being there for the long haul.  The hardest part of the job is that you don't really have a life during the holidays.  One thing I can say Gamestop trains you on how to run a business and have the knowledge to apply that elsewhere.
good,"This was my first job as i started at 16. I learned a lot in regards to the business environment however although i moved up to eventual assistant manager position, to do so was difficult and to maintain the job while attending school full time was as well not because of the work load but the hours required as the store would consistently hold ""midnight releases"" and random calls to attend the stores needs. The employees joked around to much and were not serious. The management team also were immature, sexist and not serious as well. I spent 6 years at this job and although i learned a lot I do not promote this business as a career."
good,"Everyday at Game Stop is different. Basic things would be counts for inventory and then keeping the store clean and customers happy. Making it as easy as possible for shoppers to find what they want we are constantly re-merchandising and restocking items. We all work as a family, very close and supportive to each other inside and outside of work. The best part of my job is meeting all the different type of gamers that share the same joys in life."
good,"I worked at Gamestop for almost seven years and loved it until the last year and a half. the company used to be great and seemed to genuinely care about employees and customers, but over the last couple years they started to force managers to work 12+ hours with little notice and abuse the fact that store managers were salaries. Forcing employees to work on their days off, and cutting support for the store on a weekly basis. Recently the company has gone on a rampage and started letting tenured employees go for petty reasons without any warnings to replace them with fresh faces that get paid less, thus costing less money to run the store. A typical day is extremely busy with no time to slack off and many things you have to multitask to get done by certain deadlines, but could still be fun. The company does overdo your workload so don't expect to to have an easy time. Co-Workers are great and you will make a ton of great friends. I learned a great deal from Gamestop about how to run a successful store and business, but also learned what not to do to keep morale up and employees happy. The hardest part of the job was being micromanaged even though you are in charge of the store. Working with games and people who love games as much as you do was the best part of the job. Overall, I used to love the company and my job and would have recommended it to everybody. Now I would strongly caution you to think very hard about working there, as the company can seem a bit unethical at times and overwork you."
good,"A typical day at Gamestop for me was very enjoyable as games are something I am Interested in and have been for awhile.  While I was there I stocked shelves in the back and the front, labeled DVDs and games, made sure that they were in order. My co-workers helped me alot especially the assitant manager.  The hardest part of the Job was the manager. The most enjoying part of the job is that the staff were so friendly and so easy to work with"
good,"Fun environment because of clientele, job advancement is scarce. Hours depend on how good sales are."
good,"A typical day at work I will arrive and approve all time cards for the previous day.  Conducting daily loss prevention procedures and inventory counts.  Process all incoming and out going inventory shipments.  Updating current marketing displays and proper price presentation, All while maintaining excellent customer service in store and over the telephone.  I learned great time management skills as well as team leadership techniques.  Most enjoyable part of the job is engaging with customers to achieve  great amount of customer retention."
good,"I worked for GameStop for several years before getting laid off. My district manager was a great guy, but the culture of this company has changed significantly since I joined it."
good,Work can be fun but it can be stressful when upper management starts limiting hours and firing people for not getting customers to reserve games or buy a discount card. 
good,It was a fun job and I was able to move up very quickly through the management positions. But overall it was still just a retail job which most people seem to forget.
good,"A good place to learn about the lastest tech/games within the gaming industry. Management can be laid back depending on how well the employees get along with each other. Customers are laid back as well, just make sure you know your games and tech! Hardest part would be the cleaning up after the day is finished. For such a small place it can get messy. The hours are also short. You might only work twice a week for only four hours those day. The good part your tight knit group of co-workers and the networking you get from the customers."
good,"I liked and disliked my time with Gamestop. My most enjoyable had to be engaging with customers and talking about the various products within the premises. My typical day consisted of price changes, adding new stock, engaging with the customers and working at the register. I feel I have increased my selling techniques as I earned positive feedback from customers. But there were alot of problems with Gamestop that I felt were pivotal to running of the business. During my time in Gamestop there were numerous changes which I would have applied to get the best performance out the business. One of the first things I would have done is a Process Change (i.e.) how things are done, make more effective, faster etc. For example, many times we would have too much stock of a certain item and not enough of another. This was left ignored and many customers never got there desired item, even for over a month.  If I was manager this would have been rectified with a more accurate stock control. Another area as simple as, was the layout of the shop, the premises was small enough and during peak times things would become chaotic with customers having to queue out to the door. I would have laid out the shop better in some way customers would have more freedom of access. There are many other areas that need change along that line. There is too much focus on profits and selling as much as possible and not enough on the simple factors that turn the wheels of a business (e.g.) Customers, Stock Control, Cost Control, Employee Engagement and Praise."
good,"Most of the day you will be helping customers and maintaining cleanliness and organization. I learned a lot about electronics, gaming, and gaming accessories. Management is helpful but doesn't seem very interested in personal or employee interests. Co-workers are usually well informed however also sometimes have competitive mentalities which I find to be counterproductive. Hardest part of the job is getting a foot in or moving up within the company. Most enjoyable part of working at Game Stop is the discounts and ability to rent games free of charge"
good,Typical day at the job was pretty laid back with a few rushes depending on the time of year.
good,"Simple day of attending to customers needs in person and over the phone. Organizing and Labeling products throughout the day, learning your customers needs during transactions and keep their personal tastes in mind when doing any suggestive selling."
good,Working in a place that you go to on a regular basis was almost the ideal job for me. But the management was poor and I didn't receive nearly enough hours to even know what I was suppose to as an associate because I was rarely there. But the times I was there I had good co workers to help me out and show me what needed to be done and I got to be around the games that I love to play along with discounts.
good,"mostly customer service, payroll, stock, shipping and maintenance of products/services"
good,Gamestop is a solid company with decent benefits. I enjoyed my co workers and management was supportive. Work and life balance left something to be desired especially during the fall and winter months. I enjoyed the customer and employee interactions. My time management skills improved greatly during my tenure at GameStop.
good,"Going in i thought i would be able to more utilize my love and passion for gaming to my advantage and have a one up over people that dont have that passion, but as time went on i learned that the passion really isnt anything. My job is based on getting people to reserve games, selling them merchandise to make the store money and getting people to buy our 15.00 $ powerup rewards cards. All said and done its not to bad besides the pressure that your job is on the line if you cant produce."
good,"Deliver information relating to customers video game needs. Drive profit due to low margins. Deliver fun shopping experience, and keeping team motivated through challenges to offer the best service possible.."
good,"Sometimes great hours, but also bad marketing arrangements. Good co-workers, bad upper management. Definitely a pro/ con employment. Do it if you enjoy it."
good,"A day at GameStop is hard to predict. Managers like me worked 55-70+ hours per week setting up sales and different merchandising multiple times per day. I loved helping customers decide which console to go with and which games to choose however there wasn't enough time to spend with each customer to ensure their happiness, which was a con for me. A lot of money is spent in the gaming industry and I think customer service is the key element in driving a business. I guess for me not being able to fully engage and help customers was the hardest part of my job. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing kids and adult smile knowing they embraced a game they worked so hard to get. GameStop is a company which doesn't sell ""necessity"" items so it was rewarding knowing our customers came there for a specific reason! The yearly expo was also an amazing experience that I will never forget! Something every GameStop employee should quest for in a career. There is tons of amazing information and a great deal of free stuff!"
good,Not all it cracked up to be. Management is hit or miss. Quota's and lots of finger pointing.
good,"Fun place to work, generally a positive environment. Very stingy with scheduled man hours. Managers over worked."
good,"working at Gamestop is mostly any gamers dream, but in reality its not that fun. You spend hours on end fixing the shelves, filing games away and slaving hours over which wall needs fixed. The people you work with though is definitely fun. I never had a problem with anyone of my coworkers or boss. Also the most enjoyable part was probably having your lunch break or attending a customer because you get to stop looking where that missing game case was in the thousands of game cases on the wall."
good,"Best part of the job , has to be all the customers we get to meet everyday ! Hardest part of the job is that you're by yourself like"
good,Very fun environment
good,"As a Senior Game Advisor (SGA), you have almost all of the responsibilities of the Store Manager and ASM, but without the better pay. You typically would manage a GA or two (depending on the hours the store gets), and perform tasks such as helping customers with inquiries and purchases, filing, processing shipments, preparing for product display on floor, and tasking the Game Advisors to do what's required. The hardest part of this job is not the workload, but the limited time you have to make sure you get it done. Filing away games is easy, but when it's coupled with creating cases for games with cover art, processing incoming distro, shipping out RSBs (product out-shipments), scanning the floor for display and pricing accuracy, making category counts to make sure inventory is correct, cleaning, organizing constantly (as customers continuously wreck the alphabetized walls), reading emails regarding daily goals, memorizing weekly-changing phone greetings, all the while helping customers with whatever they require and at the end of the night closing (around 9PM), and then getting ONLY 30 minutes to count the deposit, make sure store looks proper for next day, cleaning and locking up everything -- it gets at times quite aggravating."
good,"Decent company to start at for young teens, but definitely not a career choice"
good,I was pretty unprepared for the work environment there. Every job I've had since has been a better fit for me. The hours were very few and far between.
good,A good place for those who love games and the culture that comes with it.
good,they give you very low pay and very few hours... co workers were always nice and down to earth but the corporation always wanted more and more work and numbers but it was a simple job. organize the store and sell the customer.
good,"In all honesty, we goofed around more than we worked. If it was a slow day, we were more than likely outside the front door smoking than tending to our duties. Management was touchy and emotional, let that ruin days. Nothing too stressful about the job, although customers can get under your skin. Minimum wage and 20 hours a week do not make this job worth it."
good,"Gamestop is a typical retail store that rates you based on goals it sets. Sometimes the goals are more subscription and preorder based instead of sales, which doesn't entirely make sense."
good,"Every day there were a multitude of tasks, and my multitasking skills grew quite often. I learned how to do lots of human resources type jobs with hiring and firing. The hardest part of the job was having to push things on customers that they did not want or need, to the point of harassment at times. My favorite part of the job was the customer. They are what kept our business going and what made our days great. Over 5 years, myself and my staff grew a solid customer base."
good,"On a typical day of work I would be required to take inventory, process shipments, keep an organized store area. The most important part of the job was providing excellent customer service and meeting store sales goals. I learned how to perfect my sales techniques and manage/motivate subordinates. My co-workers are friendly people and were trained well. We were able to achieve a lot together. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with great people and provide service that my customers truly valued. The hardest part of the job was maintaining store operations with a limited payroll."
good,A typical day entailed the organizing and cleaning of the store and helping customers find the video game software that they were looking for. I learned how to do inventory and how to count out a register as well as make drop offs at the bank for the store. The management changed regularly with the seasons and was pretty organized. My co-workers were fun and interesting individuals that worked hard everyday. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep the store organized while it was filled with customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was conversing with the customers about video games.
good,Very fun
good,Good experience with middle management but company is struggling to adapt to changing times.  Stores are poorly resources and expected to run with duck taped resources.
good,"I enjoy making sure any guest that enters my store leaves with everything they need for a great experience with the products that we sell."
good,"This is a good starter job, this is the job that will get minimal hours and will work around a school or part time scheduled. this is not a job that i would recommenced to someone trying to pay all the bills."
good,This was a great work experience in a environment i was extremely comfortable with. Fellow employees really make for having the desire to want to come to work and take care of business all while having fun
good,"The job itself isn't very hard all things considered, Having a wide knowledge of gaming, comics and pop culture help considerably. The better you can relate things the easier it will be for you to sell and understand what you're selling. The good or bad comes from higher up the chain, not so much at the store level but just above."
good,"It wasn't a bad job by any means, I worked stock so my job was pretty easy. The only problem I had was with one particular worker. He was always mad and targeted me every now and them. His name starts with a C that's all ill say."
good,I enjoy talking with customers about the products and helping them make choices on what to purchase.  I have a good knowledge about what is offered at our store and how to best use the products.
good,I was the only female who worked at this location and was taken advantage of most of the time. I was rudely spoken to by management and coworkers and was paid as a cashier instead of the position I was working as which was key holder/manager. They would tell me I was part of management and treat me as if I was not as well as being paid minimum wage.
good,Working during seasonal hours was great and I earned some good extra cash. Learned some new skills as well. I got a promotion to stay on the team afterwards but the only downside was I was told I would only be working once every six weeks for part time. It does look good on a resume!
good,"Gamestop was an amazing place to work.  i could talk about video games all day long.  i made friends with everyone that came in.  It was a fun atmosphere to be in, wether you are a grandma looking for a game for her grandchildren or a hardcore gamer that is looking for something new to play."
good,"Basic tasks were performable but the quotas we had to meet were something we the associates had little control over, and cooperate wanted you to reach the weekly quotas or you would be written up"
good,"Worked there as needed part time for about a year, honestly wasn't the most pleasant place to work at. Overall i couldn't really recommend working there to anybody ."
good,computers need to be updated good work place it can get hecked it at times and stuff could be organized better. lther wse it was good environment to work in
good,"The hardest part as a Seasonal Guest Advisor at GameStop, in my experience, has been scheduling. Although the pay is decent, and the hours are manageable, the hours provided are suitable for only a part-time job."
good,"Good place to work if you can get along with your manager. But if it’s a situation like mine it’s too stressful, not praised for the wins or encouraged to strive for more. There was tasks that needed to get done by the store manager that if it didn’t get done you would be threaten with a verbal and a write up, intimidation was the key into me leaving. It feels to me that some managers are better than others imo. seriously it feels like no one supports each other. But the pay is ok, and benefits are good. It seems to me that GS does not care about mental health."
good,The company was ok but sometimes to demanding and not enough compensation. Also Management was not accountable for there actions they would always manage to blame tohers
good,I would work the register and greet guests everyday. I would consistently have engaging conversations with my co-workers and my guests. I was promised a promotion after working there for 6 months but was sadly never given it because the lack of communication after my supervisor had left.
good,"It was great to work there the few times I was scheduled, due to hour restrictions and being just a holiday associate I didn't get to work often, but the times i did felt really fulfilling the customers and employees were fun to be around and the work itself simple."
good,"Your success is determined by you and your ability to sell. If you can succeed in that area, your growth will follow suit. You will plateau as growth is now being limited as the company's success falters."
good,"Basic sales associate gig, nothing particularly special. You help customers, stock shelves, and keep things neat. Basic cleaning duties, and run registers. You do get to try new games before anyone else though, so that's cool."
good,The expectations are High with a short time frame but if certain numbers aren't met then your store doesn't get extra hours for your employees to work so you have to end up working over your time allotted but not get paid for it
good,Slow paced mall environment. Had to push extra products too much although quotas were not taken into consideration for job security. One would probably have fun if literally all they do is play games. Like a neckbeard.
good,"The work mostly involved helping customers find which games/products they wanted, and managers were fine. Also involved cleaning and organization of shop."
good,Easy going job with fun people. Job mostly involved being helpful and friendly with customers and keeping shop presentable. Product knowledge and patience were most important traits.
good,Laid off due to reduction in force. Workplace culture was good. Family feel environment. Typical day of work was always challenging in a good way. The most enjoyable part of the job was the work I was doing. I never not loved my job.
good,"fun has its slow days but overall nothing really wrong other than the lack of hours, did several promotional events for games and everyone that works there has a hobby in commune which make getting along easy"
good,the company has a good culture. the company has average to above average benefits. the company is in a great area to live. the company is a fortune 500 company.
good,"Working at Gamestop wasn't bad, but management is a little odd. You don't really do anything. Very laid back and chill. Managements okay i guess. othe"
good,Retail is retail. If you love video games and neck beards this place is for you. Dealing with customers angry about trade in prices was the worst. Its a fair retail job though.
good,"L'ambiente di lavoro è abbastanza stimolante e MOLTO formativo, ma dimenticatevi di poter crescere in quest'azienda perchè ormai è satura."
good,A typical day at work includes standing around and helping customers when they appear. I learned a bit about product placement and how to sell up products to a customer. Management is laid back and like a typical employee. The hardest part of the job is how long you are on your feet standing still. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to see and test new games as they come out as well as release date functions.
good,"Overseeing the entirety of the store, being in charge of shipping and receiving, inventory, hiring and firing, creating weekly schedules, and other various manager duties."
good,if youre looking for a job to start off this is it. you have to be a certain age but the money wont come till youve been there awhile. it took time to become a SGA but it was worth it. only problem i had was i was unable to transfer titles to another town how to be demoted in order to keep my job.
good,"I'm glad I got the experience from working there, however, when working the Black Friday shift I was the only one who took the initiative to greet customers.  My manager was unprofessional yet also chill and willing to work with me when I was working another part-time job.  All-and-all I can't complain just a little miffed at the lack of professionalism but then again beggars can't be choosers."
good,Good place to work at for a summer job. Flexible scheduling so long as you provided sufficient notice. Decent employee discounts. Good management. Easy commute.
good,"I worked there for half a year and experienced a journey full of fun coworkers other than my manager. My manager didn’t work well with people that did better than her and would complain about people behind there backs to me. I didn’t agree with keeping that from them when she was worse than them, so I told them and she decided to ignore me completely and when I quit she acted happy."
good,"Typical work day including of getting daily task's done and completed making sure the store is up to part with corporate expectations. Along with bringing in shipment, answering phone calls, bring in trade, and over all making sure your customer service is at 100% and that all customers leave satisfied."
good,"A typical day at work greeting customers who enter the store.  Find out what exactly are they looking for as far as systems, accessories, apparel, and games. Not only direct them to what they want or need but help them throughout the transaction to ensure a great experience. This helped me learn more about different genres of games, talking more openly to customers, and how the Gamestop business works. There is no real difficulties as far as the job itself. I enjoyed the job a lot, If they had more hours to give, I would've enjoyed the job more."
good,Coworkers are always very respectful and create a very nice environment to work in. They never throw you into things without properly training you first.
good,"Be prepared to hit quotas. If you can hit those then you should be fine but if the store is failing, even if you're doing fine personally, life can get stressful."
good,"Working for GameStop is pretty standard retail fare. If you're a video game enthusiast, working here is incredibly rewarding. The downside? Hours are very minimal. It'd be perfect for a second job, but this is not something you'd want full time."
good,"Loved working at GameStop. Loved all my regular customers. What made me leave was the company overall. No security for steady hours and poor membership benefits for customers. They force sales goals on you in an industry that is being outdone by digital sales, and soon to be streaming gmes without a middle man. The pay starts at minimum and barely moves up if you somehow get a promotion."
good,"Gamestop offered a great opportunity to manage my own Store.  I learned a lot about effectively managing a team to produce results in achieving sales goals.  I also learned a lot about creating a positive environment so that my team felt comfortable communicating with management, challenge to learn more skills to become successful, and encouraged to progress to the next level."
good,"Only one person ever did anything at a time. For instance: If there was 3 of us on a shift, one person would stock and organize while the other two just sat behind the front desk. That same person would then do all the talking and sales and wouldn't get a sale because of the two people operating both registers."
good,"GameStop was one of those places anyone would love to work at. Talking about video games and interacting with like minded people was awesome. However, sales goals are ridiculous and unrealistic. There is no postive feedback that isn't followed by, ""But you could have done better..."". It's a good job for someone who already has a job and just is looking for some good extra cash on the side. This is not the job you want if you're looking to make a living off of."
good,"A standard day at work consists of tracking store numbers, interacting with customers, and making the store look good. Moving up is hard in the company, but if positions open there is a chance. The culture is fast-paced, fun, but stressful due to managing time with customers and task completion. In my experience, many times you will have to finish tasks after close due to them taking too long to complete in store hours. The hardest part of the job is getting good numbers due to the decline in things like warranties and memberships with the rise of online gaming. The most enjoyable part is getting to talk about an awesome hobby and have customers play what you recommend. It is an awesome feeling to have someone come back and tell you that the game you recommended was great, but the unpleasant/rude customer comes in much more often."
good,Gamestop has it's issues as a company that i can no longer stand. If you can get past those and handle stress it'll suite you. It's not that bad to work for i'm just done with sales based and it's pushing more towards that everyday
good,"If you are passionate about gaming this is definitely the company to work for.  Do be prepared to run the business as if it was your own, though you will not be compensated in such a way."
good,Unrealistic demand from employees to push products customers do not want. No commission or bonus for reaching said goals or going above and beyond. Glorified pawn shop.
good,Manager at the time was not very patient. Great company. Doesn't take care of employees at all. No discounts. Just show up and get your hours. No moving up.
good,"It was a fun place to work but the work was competitive based with no compensation. It didnt matter how many subscriptions you sold compared to others. Our store was downsizing employees and the employees with more tenure were prioritized over the employees with better sales numbers. We were encouraged to ""harass"" customers into subscriptions by giving them unrealistic discount numbers."
good,"Normal retail job advising games for customers. Systems incudes xbox, Wii , Play station, microsoft, sony, nintendo. Collected sales revenue and people were nice."
good,"Certainly a fun place to work. It was always relaxed and pretty moderately paced most days. Upsides, you get to talk about games for a living, and feel low pressure most days. Downsides, it doesn't pay well enough to sustain a modern life, and you wind up doing several different positions worth of work under a single job title."
good,while working on the floors meeting new people and explaining to them the pros and cons of buying the games of there choices it was fun to meet and interact with them and the employees as well.
good,Not sure why i need to review every position one was enough. It was all the same company. Will not be submitting any more new reviews. This should be optional.
good,The job is pretty easy and laid back. I would say the only issue is the number of customers that come in and do or say things that can really anger you
good,One of my favorite jobs when I was in high school. Flexible hours. Management was supportive and organized. The store always had a great atmosphere. Success driven company.
good,"Working with our regulars was always a blast, and building that customer base.  Managers' Conference was a blast, and provided a lot of great perks.  Work to life ratio is terrible.  Be prepared to spend way more time than is reasonable at your store.  Its hit or miss when it comes to upper management, some are great some are not.  Really enjoyed training and enriching my team.  "
good,lavoro per gente appassionata di vendita perchè l'aziende dà unagrande importanza alla prestazione personale
good,"The work culture at GameStop is generally enjoyable, and I don't remember things being exceedingly stressful during my time with them. The only stress with the job would generally come from regional management badgering employees to get pre-orders out of customers with every transaction. That being said, the environment itself can be fun, and the vast majority of customers that shop at GameStop are enthusiastic about gaming and are generally a joy to work with. The work/life balance was generally favorable too."
good,Colosso statunitense nel commercio mondiale di prodotti legati al mondo dei videogiochi
good,This was a job I held in high school. I think for kids interested in video games is a perfect first job. For a family person not so much. Job advancement is slow.
good,"If you love video games and just want to get by this is the job for you, its fast paced fun environment with a small learning curve. a good stepping stone into retail"
good,"How good of an experience you have at Gamestop really depends on your leader, and your team. It can be an incredibly fun and at times rewarding job. It's a fun place to work at if you make it one. They really just need to get more competitive with pay so that they have better options for their quality pool of employees and candidates. They are making strides to adapt, and we will see if they actually choose to implement improvements, or fall to the weyside."
good,While most of my experience working in Gamestop was enjoyable it still fell under retail being incredibly stressful during the holiday season which is when I was hired. While the staff around me was very nice and accommodating for any kind of situation in staff most of the main hardness associated with the job would probably be dealing with holiday shoppers.
good,"The work was well and good, the environment was good for the most part. My overall hours and pay weren't great but part if that was due to my position as a seasonal associate."
good,"It was personally a very good choice as a first job for a college student, one that really catered to my own interests and with a helpful and supportive working environment. It taught me to be more comfortable with customer service, and with it being retail a lot of incidents can happen that will steel you from many of discouragements that will happen should you ever want to work  there for a long time. As much as it was fun, it was sadly also stressful with the schedule changing constantly and no hours to be able to work, with management only being able to handle so much.   All in all, as much as my leaving the job left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth, I wish it was only better in managing time and flexibility with schedules for their employees as they said they would."
good,"I want to open with - I loved my job. My managers treated me great, I got along with my coworkers, I enjoyed my customers. Most of all I got to sell something I loved and had a passion for."
good,"If you like video games, it is a pretty cool place to work. You get to interact with other gamers and talk about games. You meet some cool people and can build relationships with staff and customers"
good,"I was only a seasonal hire at Gamestop. While I was there, the company seemed mostly concerned with stressing quotas. I'm not a talented salesman. I believe that's the reason they didn't keep me on staff longer."
good,"I stayed for as long as I did mostly due to the fact that the team i worked with and built around myself were all wonderful people, the upper management never seemed to know what to do and my direct superiors would flip flop on ideas that their boss told them to do almost every day or two. Usually a lack of hours so long periods of time by yourself."
good,"In a digital environment, GameStop stubbornly hangs on.  You are pressured to sell reservations in a buisness where it is less and less required toe a game and customer interest in extra goodies is waning. You are also required to push membership privileges which are useful to the frugal buyer but in the coming years will be ultimately useless as content moves digital and physical sales drop off.  High stress job where your position is often overtly threatened."
good,A day at GameStop revolves around customer service along with sales and stocking merchandise. The managers are good. They tell you the goals for each day and week..The enjoyable part of the job is connecting with guests. If you are a gamer...this is somewhat a good paradise.
good,With the right store and the right people the place is fun but the pay you get doesn't cut it for the hours you get. This makes you not care for anything to help the company especially when the upper management can't understand what happens at the store front level and are so out of touch with anything.
good,Very nice people to work with and flexible with hours. If you like video games or just want to learn more about games you haven't played before than there are a lot of people there with the same interest. If it weren't for the people working there however the job is very boring. Spend majority of your time just organizing and standing around.
good,"Cleaning Check out customer."
good,"I was very young when working at GameStop. A minor to be exact. What I do remember of it, however, was being pushed very hard to make goals for their drivers (reward programs, etc.)"
good,"I enjoyed working at GameStop as a manager.  It had its ups and downs everyday.  Some days were great, others not so great.  Anyone familiar with large, corporate retail management will fit in well here.  Heavily micromanaged, but encourages creativity and strong sales/relationship building."
good,"Responsibilities:"
good,A day working at GameStop is fairly busy. My task given to me by my store manager would be to greet customers and help them with whatever they needed.
good,the company wasn't terrible the job wasn't terrible but at the end of the day it was a temporary but I enjoyed it some days and some coworkers were fun.
good,"You can give 10 years to the job. But, that doesn't matter. Only management are given hours. Lower employees are treated unfairly. Customers can also be rude."
good,"Easy job, low pay. Helped me build confidence in sales when I was young. A good start up job as a teenager but not a good long term plan.  There are better options."
good,"relaxed work day, learn more from programs and gaming systems. management was OK. they follow code of conduct. the most enjoyable part of it was the knowledge i can give he customer about a system or games."
good,"For Video Game lovers, Gamestop would seem to be the ideal job, but for those who knows what happening behind close doors would tell you different. Gamestop is fun place to talk to customers about your favorite games or anything at all, you meet a a lot of friendly faces that sometimes turn a one time customer into a life time friend. The worse thing about the company is the ambition to push preowned products on customers or the fact you have to push so many things to a customer that only came to purchase a game."
good,"I like working here but its a hot mess. I don't get nearly as many hours as I would like or be willing to work, The employees are great and fun to work with."
good,"Its fast paste you have to have all the boxes murryed up by a certain time, then you have to scan and flip the boxes the right way before you can start zoning your zone if you have any product to pick, and if you dont have product to pick, the supervisor will have you help hand out product or help other murrying up."
good,"fun relaxed atmosphere"
good,"Senior management can be incompetent at best, toxic at worst. The people you work with and who come in regularly can be amazing. You will be lucky to make more than minimum wage after working there for 5 years."
good,It was A ok job if you are just looking for some cash but not if ur trying to pay for bills unless you get promoted to make more money to pay your bills
good,"On individual store levels, the people are usually great. As a whole, the company is a failure. I stay for the people and the discount, not the company."
good,"Gamestop has its perks but its really all about how much of a good sales person you can be"
good,"bad work ethic created with bad advertising and lower ideal sales targets.  Due to new province managers and overall leaders.  Loved it upon first starting but the gentleman who got xtra vision shut down within two years of being the manager of all Ireland stores managers and sales techniques, got that place closed, and I would perhaps wager we will see a similar closing of alot of gamestop branches in Ireland and will remain open in Dublin and other very highly populated cities."
good,The customers and employees are the best part of my experience at GameStop.  I will always look fondly back at my time with GameStop. I managed my team to become one of the most successful in the the company with customer service scores and loss prevention.
good,Working there was a good experience when i was under it show me how to run the cashier spot and also become a people person.and that helped me put over time.
good,"Gamestop was an amazing experience for me. I put my all into my job, to ensure everyone who came into my store left feeling satisfied. Usually would enter the store around 9/9:30am, to have the store set and ready by 10am. Count all the registers and make sure the store is neat and organized for customers when the store opened. I learned from my experiences to not verbally turn into a robot and use the same verbiage on everyone because its noticeable, make things genuine. Hardest part of the job in my opinion would definitely be the mornings on the weekends for sure. One person would have to multitask opening the store, providing customers with a memorable experience and also taking in shipment from UPS/FEDEX etc. It's a bit stressful especially when the customer traffic picks up and you don't have a 2nd hand on shift until about 2pm/3pm."
good,The work was average retail work noting to special they didnt train me for anything sense it was a temp job. My co-workers we're chill and friendly and it wasnt to chaotic.
good,It is the type of job to start at but hard to advance unless upper management likes you.  Other than that it is a good learning experience and helps you see different customers and different ways to work with others
good,its a bit of a niche place to work where you are expected to know most of the products before beginning. It takes a long time to move up and is difficult to get sufficient pay to make a living. discounts on products are provided and break time is allotted in the schedule. it can be difficult to get started as there is much to learn if you are not up to date on various games and systems.
good,Liked working there it was an overall enjoyable experience. Though I did not like how they made me push their membership program once the holidays were over and their pay left much to be desired.
good,If you're not a manager there's no career advancement. It was fun to talk to people about video games and I liked the environment but ultimately I wasn't given enough hours to pay for much of anything. Definitely geared towards part-timers.
good,"You will assume you're being hired as a cashier, but truthfully you're a salesman. If you can't get the required numbers, your hard work will always be overlooked."
good,excellent job for part timers but management is treated very poorly and sales goals can seem unreasonable depending on the area youre working in. good high school job
good,"often left to open store by myself until 2 pm on saturdays at an urban mall, meanwhile other stores have 3 employees on staff on a tuesday, too much pushing on reserves"
good,IT department is ran on a skeleton crew of associates. Company does not back fill positions in order to meet shareholder goals. Outsourcing is being utilized more through out recent years. Company unfortunately would prefer to hire outside rather than promote within.
good,Gamestop required a lot of work to be done for very little pay. They also want you to use underhanded sales tactics to screw people over. If it wasn't for the customers being so awesome I would have quit very quickly.
good,Good part time job with employee discount and flexible schedule. Hours are sometimes hard to get. You should expect to explain gaming to adults who are purchasing for their kids.
good,Gamestop is an Enjoyable work environment with relaxing times as well as very stressful times. Higher up don't care much for lower ranked employees and will replace them quickly.
good,"Culture was amazing when I came on in 2010.  It has become more rigid and micro-managed over the years.  It appears that every change that is happening at the company now is setting up for a rumored buyout.  It has always been a high pressure environment and a ""what have you done for me lately"" attitude from above."
good,"This company is definitely an interesting place to work. I worked there for a year and in that time I felt that I gained a lot of experience. Game Stop gives employees discounts and plenty of on the job training. You take a lot of online quizzes in order to keep up-to-date on which games are coming out soon. These help you to better answer customer questions. You also get the joy of talking about your favorite upcoming games with the customers. The interactions you have with fellow gamers helps you feel a sense of camaraderie with them that I don't feel you really get with other retail jobs.The only thing about working here that really irked me is the fact that you have to meet certain percentages every day. For example, you have to get a certain amount of trade-ins, and sell a certain number of memberships (or renewals of memberships) a day. There were four or five things you had to keep track of in order to keep your numbers up. If you can't hack it they will fire you (after a kind of grace period to see if you can improve). When I first started here I was not informed of this and almost lost my job after only being there two months (although it was two months in which they lacked telling me something so important).The management may not be the best, but it is a fun part-time job while you look for something more permanent (or if you're in school and looking to make some money for  yourself)."
good,"Overall health of the company can be better, for salaried positions incentivized promotions were abundant when necessary goal needed to be met. Non salaried job positions had lower expectations and were not paid adequately enough."
good,"Company at first was great but after a few years of management the company began struggling financially. They fired a lot of managers for no reason, but never changed anything."
good,"It was fun despite homophobic and sexist management making it a unsafe and difficult workplace. I literally had to jump through extreme hoops to do the same jobs just because of their prejudice. It's ultimately why I left and didn't come back. It seems as though those people are being weeded out now, which is good, but it's about 10 years too late."
good,"I really loved working at Gamestop at first i was young, but ever since the introduced and shoved the Circle of life it hasn't been the same. I would love to stay but they pay enough, specially after everything I do for the company and require us to do."
good,"A part time retail job that consisted of me selling video games and warranties to customers. Really nothing to review here. It's gamestop, everyone knows their deal."
good,"Coworkers were cool and fun to talk to. Many customers were irritable during the holiday season, and it can be stressful with long lines. When it's calm, it can get boring."
good,"I only worked there seasonally and had no interest in staying longer. I am unsure if I had the opportunity to stay anyway, but I believe my work ethic earned me that chance. However, this isn't a career job."
good,"Gamestop is a revolving door.  They do not care for talent, because they don't need it.  You are micro managed no matter what you do because that is the nature of the message from above.  If you do not fall in line, they are aware that there are hundreds of people willing to replace you."
good,Basic retail atmosphere. Talk video games with coworkers and customers. Organize and re-organize game library as needed. Babysit children left behind on occasion . Relaxed environment outside of the holiday season.
good,"Gamestop is a decent enough place to work. I would put it above certain other jobs in the same category. But if you're looking for a career, look elsewhere. This is only good for someone wanting to work part time to make extra money while in school or something."
good,"Depending on the store you will either get people who are fun to work with, or people who are aggravating to work with, the customers can and do pick up on this."
good,they expected too much for how little they paid. they expected you to hit certain quotas and sell certain items over others but didn't compensate you and customers would get annoyed with how pushy you were about it.
good,"Great Talent, high pace environment where you will develop great set of skills around customer service, management, business acumen, talent development and leadership."
good,The people who work at GameStop are great but I forced to deal with constantly needing numbers for their quota which in the end is stressful when you get so few hours and are not fully trained for your position
good,"The corporate promotion structure is unfortunately nearly nonexistent. As a Store Manager the job is alright, although the rate of pay is substantially lower than many other retail chains. Once in the SM position, there is very little opportunity for any further growth or promotion."
good,Work is usually relaxed unless a holiday or a sale is taking place. I learned how to be better at customer service and to handle cash. The workplace culture at my store was very friendly and always made me feel like I was welcomed.
good,"For myself, retail was not my favorite thing. Having to make sure everything is in alphabetized and in order when there are thousands of items. Every week there was always a new way the store had to be set up. It was just not my type of work. It can be for others."
good,"I got hired in as a seasonal game adviser and climbed the ranks. Overall it was a fun environment, but as I moved up to store manager the expectations definitely did not match the compensation. Barely made a living wage (although not in my area) but was expected to work at a minimum 45 hours a week, often more. Spend most of the day as the only person working in the store, and will often go more than five hours before getting a break."
good,"Game stop was a good part time job for me but, did not fulfill what I need in a job. I feel that I have more potential than they were willing to acknowledge."
good,GameStop is an ok place to work if you can deal with minimum pay for a lot of work and no incentives to push products other than to not lose your job.
good,"when it got busy it got really busy, good if you like dealing with customers although the workspace is very small and hot, otherwise the people you work with are cool for the most part"
good,"I've learned from working with Gamestop, that great customer service requires forethought and knowledge of the particular items being sold and discussed with the customers."
good,"My first manager at GameStop was great and I loved working there. Minimum wage was not enough, but I was still in school, so it was not that big of a deal. Second manager was terrible and a bad person, so your enjoyment will depend on your immediate manager"
good,"Normally bored, very little to do. Management was typically annoying, and I was almost never scheduled (I think I got maybe fours hours a week). I was a holiday hire, so I don't know if that was part of the problem."
good,"I dont agree with gamestop and their ideas. I do not think that the thing that everyone cares about is the saddlery, and that this company does not give a fair salutary."
good,"If you love video games, this is the place to be. You get to sell fun! Giving knowledge to customers about gaming can be rewarding and definitely fun."
good,"Nothing out of the ordinary for a customer service job. Management has changed drastically since I worked at this location but the management there was fantastic when I was there. A fun and fullfilling job where I felt appreciated for the effort I put into it with coworkers who obviously genuinely wanted to see me, and everyone else, succeed."
good,"Typical corporate politics which I purposely stated I do not deal with upon hiring. I made managers look bad as I surpassed all in the district in cards/reserves, and this stepped on toes. I did my job very well and it made people mad. Management was ok, new and young so didnt know much about people or the world. Ill managed staff and then used it as an excuse as to why no promotions. Powerup cards were very demanding, but easy for me. Others struggled as it pushes you to be confrontational which many in today's society are not. I enjoyed this as I didnt need the job, just wanted to do something to fill my time and have a good time. Was obtaining a degree at the same time and when politics got involved, I moved on."
good,I worked in their retail environment for four years and it is very cut throat. They KPI's are insanely high for the pay you get and its not worth it. Go work somewhere else
good,I really enjoyed the first few months of my time there the people working with me were amazing and I loved the customer interactions. What made me the most frustrated was the constant press from higher ups to continually sell more and more. We began to get punished for having bad days regardless of how well we were doing that week. It seemed like they cared less and less about the experience we were giving to our customers coming in than they did about making sure those customers purchased ever addition they could get and workers would be disciplined for not trying to get them to purchase every item that could be attached to their initial interest in coming in. I saw first hand how much frustrations some of our customers would go through when they wanted a simple purchase but could not get through without a 10-15 min conversation about why they didn't have our Pro card. I loved the people I worked with and helping out with the customers but unless you are properly prepared for a heavy selling culture environment this is not the company for you.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to learn more about the GameStop culture. The hardest part of the job is meeting sales goals. Management was not the best.
good,I am thankful for the experience i gained working here. The company is not the best to work for. Employees are poorly compensated for the work that is required to do. They expect one person to be able to run a whole store by themselves.
good,"The discount is great, and the environment is okay.  However, if you are looking to advance look elsewhere.  The company is not growing enough to support growth from within."
good,At times very fast paced. Fun working environment but it helps to be a gamer yourself to properly help steer customers to the best products for them. High sales expectations.
good,"I don't really want to get your hopes up to anyone looking to work at gamestop, you learn a couple of things here and there but in the end nothing really happens or you get nowhere"
good,"Working with people and the customer is always the first priority over any tasking. It is a gamble on what type of manager you will have and their management style. Always oriented around performance and their ""numbers""."
good,"Interesting environment"
good,"Despite it being a seasonal thing for Christmas, I always felt like part of the team and that I was needed. It also meant I wasn't under the same pressure to partake in shady sales tactics to push used games sales over new purchases."
good,"Greeted Customers"
good,"Depending on your location and coworkers, you can have a vastly different experience working at one of these stores. With proper guidance, you can have a strong and friendly team that doesn't get lost in chasing the KPIs."
good,if you like video games and working with the public it is a fun job you get to meet all walks of life sometimes dont have enough people because of lack of hours
good,Great company to work for if you love video games.  Would've loved to be given the opprotunity to work there longer than seasonal. But EMS is my goal.
good,"As a store leader most of your time is by yourself with no coverage, for up to nine hours a day. Stress from that and lack of payroll can be taxing on employees."
good,It's a fun job to have and the training for entry level retail associates are in depth and you learn a lot about the company. However the hours are not set and sometimes you don't work there for over two weeks.
good,"If you work part time, expect to rarely get an opportunity to advance with the company. Part Time hours are VERY part time, and the pay is minimum wage or slightly above. Nothing fantastic. Management varies, I worked with 4 different managers in my 5 years with the company and that determined my job work/life balance. Some managers were better than others. When I received a promotion, I saw very little of a pay raise while being expected to do a good majority of what an Assistant Manager would do. "
good,"If you are a high school student or just got graduated this is not a bad place to start building your work experience. However, do not strive to advance here unless you are going a corporate level position. This business is slowly dwindling with the rise of digital product sales. I do not know if GameStop can adapt to continue to be in business for the future, but it is a safer bet to just use them for some experience gain then move on towards the career you want."
good,"Although being around loads of games and equipment sounds good on paper- and it is in person- but dealing with the workers, becomes the reason you'd want to quit. District Managers work by the book and force their personal frustration with sales on the team, disregarding their play ( or lack of ) to the bad results."
good,It was a good job in the beginning but once you become a key holder you had the same responsibility as a manager and you got a payed a fraction of what your manager got payed.
good,"It is a good part-time job for people who enjoy playing videogames.  Employees are allowed to rent used games for free.  Management is overworked and overtired, but the lower-level employees are treated fairly."
good,GameStop was definitely  what you see is what you get my alphabetizing skills got better hardest part of the job had to be sweeping and that's it the management was real nice and fun to work with the most enjoyable part was talking to customers about video games.
good,This was a college job and fun place to be a part of. Chilled and talked about video games and check out policy is awesome. The only thing about this place is holiday time is crazy
good,Initially as a part time associate the job was amazing. I got paid to talk about video games and got discounts. As i started to move up to management i started to see how over worked and under paid the managers are. Of ten all top management worried about was the bottom line. Health or family issues only mattered when it was convenient.
good,"I did not work here long enough for me to form an opinion of the place. Boss seem tough but fair. The work was easy to pick up on and the other employees seemed willing to help out. Other than that, not much to tell."
good,Great seasonal mall position for high school students. easy hire amd no experience needed. you will be trained on the spot. no video game knowledge needed.
good,"While I didn't hate working at GameStop for such a short period, the nature of having to meet quotas on a weekly basis made me want to not work there again. Customers can tend to vary from those willing to work with you / be nice, to those who think they're the most important people on the planet."
good,"It is a decent place to work.  They do offer great benefits, 401k packages, and have some partnerships if you want to go  back to school (most of these only apply if you are a full-time employee).  Anything that pertains to retail can be stressful at times, however, most of the time you are dealing with regular guests, so it is not as bad as some other places."
good,Keep to yourself and put on very comfortable shoes. Make sure to keep up with your own time often errors occur. HR department needs to be more thorough when regards to employee complaints.
good,I guess it was a fun job. I liked video games a lot and so It was a good fit. I got to talk to people and sell video games I enjoyed every day so that was always a good thing.
good,"Decent environment and staff. Customers were ok, learned a lot from management. Hours and flexibility were decent. Had fun overall. Would go back and work there again."
good,wasn't always good company doesn't take care of u but the ppl u meet are awesome the company itself is terrible u cant trust them to have ya back in certain situations it will protect itself rather then help u first
good,"Due to leadership changes, many focuses shifted and resulted in a huge drop in productivity. Competition was removed as well as true sales drivers, and lower management was held to blame."
good,Management was terrible will not work there again could not shedule me around my other job even though it’s not that dam hard to do like I do management somewhere else and have to deal with way more and I can do it way better
good,"Someone's experience working at a GameStop is going to vary widely from store to store.  I've been fortunate to be part of two excellent stores with great coworkers and positive work environment, but have also assisted stores that are not so fortunate. The Corporate Management at GameStop has a habit of creating work conditions and expectations that can lead to a toxic, negative space, so finding stores that can consistently overcome that can be a challenge.  "
good,"Fun if you like video games, had to manage employees and customer interactions. Handled opening and closing duties. gained sales experience and customer interaction."
good,Hard place to get on if you don't know someone. But great if you can get on there. I mean the pay was low but yo can advance if you work hard and do your job.
good,"Gamestop is an easy place to work at. The people who I worked with were all gamers and good people. You spend most of your time filing games, completing transactions, and tidying up the store. You will not however spend any time talking about games, or standing around. You will always be doing something. Its not a fun job. It's not the kind of game store where customers come in and wanna chat it up with you about their favorite games. First off there is barely any business, and second the customers who do come in are usually in n out. It's simply a retail job like any other. This is a good job for young kid looking for their first job."
good,coworkers were cool.  pretty busy but wasnt anything you cant handle.  this location moved so i do not know if they retained the same employees. hope the new place is cool too
good,Great people to work with and a passionate subject but poor balance of the the hours to accomplish tasks versus hours afforded. Left because it did not match life goals.
good,Ho maturto ulteriori competenze di dialogo grazi alla mansione ricoperta di addetto alle vendite.
good,it was a season job that was great to work while it lasted. i never got the chance to work in a part time or full job excipiente but they were impressed with my commitment to te job.
good,"Mi ci sono trovato benissimo sia con lo staff, che come posto di lavoro, peccato però che ti prendano solo per i periodi natalizi 3 mesi e ti mamdano a casa e non ti chiamano piu poca possibilità di carriera"
good,"ho impatato molte cose negli anni"
good,"This is not the most friendly places to work in terms of its corporate structure. People who are in management tend to be overworked, underpaid and overall stressed out. Since management is not taken care of it tends to roll downhill."
good,"fun place to work based on co-workers, easy to pickup and go if you have gaming knowledge. discounts on used games. very fast paced even during down time, however it can be very rewarding."
good,It's what you would expect working at a minimum wage job. Store Managers make very little and the environment is constantly changing.  Very much a typical sales job.
good,"Poor management and over expansion, No movement becomes occurs unless someone is fired. The pay for anyone but the store manager is barley above 11 an hour."
good,"Typical day - open the store, service customers, train new employees, sell games and memberships, cashier, close store"
good,Working here helped me learn the responsibilities of a job and helped further my career by giving it a humble start. The people there were amazing an i consider them as friends.
good,"Personal networking"
good,"Gamestop showed me the ways of retail, though it was not my first go round in customer service, there were still many things i was able to learn from the managers there."
good,"I loved this job when I was a thirty key holder. As an assistant store manager, though, responsibility and tasks are extremely high. Constant changeover of sales focuses, CEO expectations, and understaffing puts the bulk of work on managers. Fast paced for managers who are scrambling to complete daily tasks. Lots of fun for GAs who get to talk video games all day though."
good,gamestop gave me the chance to advance into managment. i learn alot through my previous managers. there are goals set on a daily basis with reprecussions for not meeting
good,"GameStop is a very fast paced workplace as there is constant work that must be done. Although there are things that are always said to be already done, it isn't. Responsibilities that are given from the higher-ups sometimes can be as minuscule as cleaning up the backroom or organizing/filing games. Although you get to work with video games, GameStop has recently adopted a much stricter policy where every transaction counts.You get to talk to fellow employees about video games, including customers, which is a plus. Depending on the team, however, will determine how smoothly everyone communicates and the experience guests/customers will have, which affects the loyalty they have to GameStop."
good,"Taking care of customers is number one priority. Providing customers with good customer service, taking care of their needs and bringing smiles to everyone's faces was key to a good days work"
good,"From my experience, Gamestop is a lovely place. People are typically nice. And you get to recommend games and explain things that you could feel very passionate about. However, it's not really a job worth having unless you are upper management. Game Advisors generally have one night to work on average. They work the store. From reorganizing walls to helping people. Managers maintain sale and pro numbers."
good,Store Leader love my people and the customers are awesome mostly.  But things are always fast paced you feel stretched thin and you never have enough help to get things done. Pay is decent 65K per year 44 hr week free systems and games are also a perk but the crazy hours and lack of work life balance makes it difficult to hang on have to move on to something better.
good,"Excellent first job and could be stretched into college years if you don't have other responsibilities. If your enjoy gaming culture, it's the best place. You'll have to deal with a myriad of personalities and frequent dumb questions. but it's worth it"
good,"Bisognerebbe formare meglio è in maniera più tecnica, gli store manager e gli area manager. Formati in maniera superficiale e nella maggior parte dei casi troppo giovani e con esperienze lavorative minime."
good,Worked only as seasonal but performed the same typical duties as regular associates.  Culture was competitive - for the most part the manager was available to assist with new hires.
good,molte pressioni e ambiente lavorativo con un benessere normale che va a giorni
good,"organizing games alphabetically, but based on how popular the games are"
good,"While working with Gamestop, it was a calm and relaxed work environment. All employees were friendly and able to answer most questions about gaming software and hardware."
good,Its a good job for a teenager or a college student. Or someine trying to get on there feet. A lot of pressure to sell magazine subscriptions. And Game reserves
good,"Gamestop, creates a competive environment between associates, stores, and districts.  But dose not reward the victors of competions with anything of true value, often a simple corprate email, or a pat on the back is all one might recive."
good,Not a bad place to work. Management is fair but hours are lacking. Training is quick and understandable. Promoting sale is highly encouraged but a major requirement.
good,"If you're going to school, nice place to start, but I would never make this a career choice. Management is underpaid and placed under too much pressure for the hours and stress that the job gives."
good,"working for gamestop was one of the best work experiences of my life, however unless you are a SGA then you get no hours and even if you are a SGA the hours are not guaranteed. also if you want to move up its almost impossible al;so even the store managers are not paid well for their time."
good,great for co workers not as a company. they MAKE you up sale and if you dont they will fire you and you get write ups. its kinda sad that a place thats supposed to be a fun work place is very pushy
good,great company for video game enthusiast.  I took this job years ago as my first management position and it was a good introduction to management where I had 4 associates to manage.  This position laid the foundation for teaching financial responsibility and payroll management in order to meet profitability
good,Its an alright job to start with or have part time but i would not recommend moving up in a store position. The higher you go the more stress is involved.
good,"Ambiente di lavoro ottimo a inizio carriera, andato via via scemando."
good,Metrics are ever evolving. Strong soft skills and product knowledge is key to success. Willingness to change and integrate sales techniques based on customer needs.
good,"A usual day at gamestop would be fixing up walls, taking care of customers needs, whether through phone or at store. Restocking consoles, games , and cleaning store"
good,"Often times as a guest adviser you don't get many hours in a day let alone a week. The people there are extremely nice and do not talk down on anyone. The most enjoyable part of the job is being surrounded by game systems, games, and accessories"
good,I only recommend working at gamestop if you're a dedicated gamer. the discount is the only thing that makes the job worth it. the hours at the mall are inconsistent if you're not a key holder or manager. the team is cool but there's a push for sales goals in a mall where 75% of the customers are there to kill time.
good,"Fun environment, loved the regulars that came in and you got to talk to.. Also learned a lot about games and how they worked.. The people you worked with made it twice the fun"
good,"Not a great place to work"
good,"I get to hang around d with people who likes video games and watching anime. fun environment, great people, discount on games. Customers are usually very disgruntled. There is no room for advancement other then the high turn over rate."
good,A fun place to work if you enjoy people and video games. Expect to go from slow to busy at a moments notice. you will always have something to do around the store form stocking shelves to helping customers.
good,"Gamestop is a fun place to work, laid back an casual for anyone who enjoys gaming and other nerdy things. Advancement is easy if wanting to pursue, but also great for part time college work as well."
good,"As a Store Manager you are the store. You do everything. You have support staff, but it is ALL on you. You will work several hours per week (although this new law may have changed things), you will work inventories, you will work midnight launches, and you will potentially do all of that in one week. It's not hard at all, but you have to be meticulous. It's extremely redundant and can get quite boring. You tend to have a lot of customers that have poor hygiene, but most are pretty nice as long as your customer service is on point. Opportunity for advancement is there, but if you aren't coming in at least as an ASM, the lack of pay/hours will be tough to live off of. The Store Manager conference is exhausting, but it's a ton of fun. Store Managers get a ridiculous amount of free stuff. However, to keep morale in your store, I'd recommend you do what I do...offer up a lot of your free stuff to your employees."
good,As a part timer we would go into the store and help out on the registers and organize our stock so that the sake associates can have a smoother process in finding the item the customer needs.
good,"So little hours, almost 5 a week. Some weeks wouldn't have any. Over two months i worked maybe 7 times. This wasn't part time, nor what I signed up to"
good,"A typical day at work is going in and doing inventory control, which is receiving shipment.  Then I proceed to working on shipping items out of store to customers, and inventory checks.  I then proceed onto cleaning up the store while assisting customers in what they're looking for and any extra things they might need. I close out my day with cleaning up and closing of the store. I have had a good time working for the company, giving me the management experience.  I have only felt that it has slowly become more work for less money, being stacked with more tasks and hours being removed from our store.  I however do enjoy working with my co-workers."
good,work here at your own risk the company makes many promises and fails to follow thru with them.maybe if they chose to treat there employees beter they would have less class action lawsuits lol
good,I've only been here for a short while so I can't really say much for what is going on...Maybe if there was a better way for training other than Trial by Fire I would give it more stars...but that would also have to consist of having more than two seasoned employees and more hours given to the store for people to work. With only being their three days I was already being left in the store alone for an entire shift and closing up shop....Maybe it's just my past working in a management position that clouds my judgement...but the company should be more concerned with their employees instead of cramming games in customers' faces.
good,You get to rent out games for free as long as you work there. That's about the extent of working at Gamestop. You have to really love games to work here for low pay.
good,"Management has a lot of power at this job. "
good,"The pay and hours were never great, but the culture and the people I worked with were fantastic, fun, and supportive. There is a lot of pressure from corporate to meet metrics, which could sometimes limit how well we could help customers."
good,It is definitely not a bad place to work but you can often get caught up with the work and even get left with nothing to do and be stuck standing around.
good,"Worked there for the holiday season. Nice if you're interested in gaming, great employee discount. Management was good, co workers were okay. In a mall so it was always busy."
good,"Gamestop is a great company to work for as long as you don't plan on moving up to management. On a smaller scale, the environment is fantastic, but the company genuinely does not care about its employees. The pay is sub-par for what they expect and the benefits are nothing to write home about. Expectations are much too high and the upper management is extremely wishy washy with that they're looking for and there is absolutely no accountability. "
good,"Working for Gamestop was kind of a mixed bag."
good,If you enjoy games it will be an enjoyable job. It is only part time to all employees except key holders (managers.) It is a slow paced job majority of the time.
good,This was a refurbish warehouse environment.  There really wasnt much to do.  Work was very repetitive.  I separated and scanned all handheld devices that were returned to the store.
good,"Every day you had to put back the game cases, like filing books at a library. Those with ethical concerns shouldn't apply due to being pressured to lie about certain things in order to attain pre-order goals and sales goals for the month."
good,Good Place to start a career. Fast paced environment always something new to keep you fresh and ready for the future of entertainment. Power to the players.
good,"Great opportunities for a motivated individual willing to learn the company and understand their direction.  If a person is willing to move around to different store locations, they are likely to succeed in management."
good,"lots of sales and customer service interaction. constant daily merchandising and marketing, usually alone for 4-6 hours of shift, keep sales quota or no longer have a job. management all seems new, usually hired from the outside. good job for new person, but not for experienced retail/sales associate"
good,"The job is fun and has a comfortable environment but, the hours are terrible. You literally work 3 hours for a week sometimes more or less. Other than that the job is a bit calm and fun."
good,"Basic cashier job with a heavier focus on customer service than most retail positions, but a far friendlier environment. Only main con i can mention is the inconsistent hours per week."
good,"The company I do currently enjoy working for. The employees are all friendly, respectful, knowledgeable in their tasks and know all of the latest titles. The only issues I've had with GameStop are the hours. The hours for a Guest Adviser are very minimal. Other than that I have no real complaints on management and employees."
good,"It's a typical retail job. There are numbers you have to reach and maintain. Though the system that determines how you maintain those numbers can be skewed and is flawed in many ways, especially towards workers who get less than 20 hours a week, like standard part-time guest advisers. It hinders their chances to advance, especially within lower volume locations. The benefits don't cater to part-time workers as well, but I suppose that's typical."
good,This is a sales based job only. if you do not have experience with sales you will not advance in the company and will likeley be let go. fun work enviroment if working with right people
good,I've gained a lot of experience working for Game Stop and grown as a person and an employee. I'm grateful for the experience and training I've received  there. Helping customers find the items they are looking for. Cleaning the store when it is needed. Getting change for the store and taking the deposit to the bank. I thought the management was ok but now it is not. Putting smiles on the kids faces.
good,When i first started working for gamestop i expected to be trained properly. First day on the job they job thru me on the floor right away. Didnt get trained till 2 weeks after starting. Had to learn for myself
good,"Working here is fine, Must have an interest in different gaming systems. As well as different genre of games. Must be friendly with all customers and be able to handle midnight madness for the launch of certain new games.(not at all locations)"
good,I worked there for a week as part of my Transition Year work experience.  The staff were very helpful and friendly and I enjoyed my week there........
good,"Pays minimum wage for a job I feel requires more. Not consistent with hours/provides enough hours. Good staff, great benefits, over all nice company. Not much space to grow."
good,"Working for gamestop was a good experience to get retail sales under my belt, but they did nothing as far as job advancement or promotions go they expect you to do all the work while your manager sits and stairs at a piece of paper even though there are 14 people in the store."
good,"I've been working here for over 6 years and since I've been here I've always had this feeling of, Incan do good but it's never good enough. Week after week my team will hit goals and we don't hear much but give us one week where we don't and it seems as though the flood gates will open up."
good,"I thoroughly enjoy working at GameStop. The environment is great and the business is pretty easy to work for. The biggest drawback is the lack of hours and minimum wage pay. I contribute to a sizable profit for Gamestop every shift (I can see analytics on the computer as I work/after my shift) and I am a very good employee, but I only make about 28.00 a shift. that is just untenable. The store itself is fantastic and the store leader is fantastic to work for/with, but the corporate expectations are simply too high for the the meager wage."
good,"I love working here, but currently we are understaffed but over hours. I am lucky to get 3-4 hours a week for minimum wage and it's just not cutting it. I know how to do transactions and it is giving me experience but not the best experience."
good,"Normal days at work involved helping guests and the selling culture."
good,"there fine, its a lot of technical work it takes a lot of dedication to be able to me your production goals each day. There are reprocutions fo falling short but good benefits."
good,"Gamestop provides a decent workplace for entry level work, but is not a company worth spending too much time with. Other than that, this is just filler."
good,You lose hours if you don't meet their idea of what your numbers should be. I was a temp store manager for about 6 months and more days then not I worked open to close with no break (8:30 a.m-9:00 p.m)
good,"Must involve with customers and help them with their needs and also clean the store, re-organize game shelves for customers. always changing the store to catch customer attentions."
good,You get a lot of sales and customer service experience. The company isn't especially vested in your happiness or satisfaction with the company only with the bottom line.
good,"GameStop is fun to work at. Friendly customers and fun people to work with. The company has high demands that is required by the employees. High demands with absolutely no rewards aside from a very shallow good job and keep it up next week. Although I do not agree with the practices of the company, I still believe it is a fun place to work at. It is always great knowing that you genuinely were able to help someone find what they are looking for. Things to think about before deciding to work at GameStop. One, remember that it is a retail environment, if you can't deal with different kinds of people coming in to the store then try to find a better job suited for you. Two, unless you are the manager or the assistant manager do not expect this job to be the main source of income to pay the bills."
good,helping customers with thier gaming selections. usually the customers were really good with knowing what they wanted so guiding them to what they wanted was rather easy. nothing really complicated about the job. My management was very helpful they made sure i knew what i was doing.
good,"Every day is a busy day of work."
good,I only worked here for a seasonal job between breaks in college. I loved this job. The ability to interact with customers was an amazing opportunity. good employee discounts
good,"The experiences is very dependent on your manager and co-workers. If your manager is lazy and incompetent, then your day will drag miserably. They also make you stay late to setup the stores at night, but re-reimburse you for your efforts and time."
good,It's an okay place of employment but you do not get a lot of appreciation for the work that you do. It seems that it doesn't matter how well you do your job. You will be treated the same.
good,not all about games. must have strong sales background. very high pressure sales environment. you sell or get fired. if your not into gaming then i wouldnt recommend applying.
good,"Typical workday is broken down to 20% Store Ops, 20% Visual Merchandising and 60% Guest engagement.  You have to have good time management to handle the daily tasks.  The hardest part of the job is being accountable for certain things that are not controllable.  The best part of the job is mentoring and training.  Over the 20+ years I have had many people promoted to the next level.  The product mix is great and the culture is fun."
good,"Just your typical sales associate job, for your typical large company. GameStop didn't really do anything different than your usual retail store. Fun people though"
good,"Worked morning until end shift, learned new things about game console, respectable management, surrounded with friendly people, have to reach your quota daily."
good,I worked at Gamestop for about 5 months and had a really great time mostly. Altogether it was great but school and my grades were ultimately why I had to quit.
good,"Great customer relations, great co workers. Upper management questionable. Harsh on accidents. Not interested in employees family emergencies. Required to work every holiday except Christmas. To many meetings over numbers. Dangerous conditions having only one person closing and going to bank at night. Pay raise depends on store making pre set yearly sales goals, (which were extremely ridiculous). Too pushy on customers to buy unwanted products."
good,"The people were very nice and i made life-long friends working there, but sometimes the customers were very rude and threw a fit when  they didnt get what they wanted. Management was awesome."
good,"At GameStop, while I was working there, it was fun for majority of the time. The most enjoyable thing about working there is that you got to rent a game for three days regardless if it was pre-owned or new. The hardest part is definitely keeping the customers happy. It's hard with releases of new games and parents getting upset about certain deals that don't make any sense to them. Other than that, GameStop is pretty okay."
good,"During this job I started out with a great staff. Over the year or so I worked on and off depending on when they needed me. The only main issue I had working here was having to push all the promotions and add ons for people. Once management changed, the environment became something I didn't wish to stay in. Overall  it was a great experience to learn about retail with something I love."
good,"Selling games and electronic products to help guests. I've learned alot in the years that I've worked there. But it will get dull as time goes on,"
good,I thought going in that this would have been a great place for me. However after being introduced to some of the stringent company policies I found that it was not really there to help the customers. At the shop I worked at which is currently closed we tried to focus more on helping the customer get the most out of their money and make the best decisions. Course
good,"Days started out with me coming in and just organizing displays. After some time,I was moved to the register and helped people with pre-orders and find games they wanted or accessories they needed. Fun place."
good,"I worked at GameStop back in the good old days, when the GAMES matter more than anything. It was about being knowledgeable, and being able to help all varieties find what they were looking for. Now it's just a cluttered mess, with associates who are guaged by their reservations and subscriptions, rather than their applicable experience or abilities."
good,"Workplace can be enjoyable and gives plenty of opportunities for interaction with customers in a hobby I'm personally involved in, but the pay can be low for the amount of work and hour constraints involved. Difficult company to advance in."
good,"La giornata tipica in gamestop si basa sul marketing che ogni mattina viene studiato e poi applicato in negozio, oltre naturalemente alla gestione dei clienti e dei prodotti"
good,"GameStop as an overall company seems to lack the understanding that each individual store has its own culture based on associate and customer interactions. The company is trying to direct themselves towards a selling culture, causing a huge disconnect between corporate, their associates and the guests."
good,"Cool beginner job especially if you're into video games. At the time I worked there, employees had a perk which allowed us to borrow a game for a night in order to give us some insight."
good,"I worked for GameStop for 2 years and in that time the management was lacking. The hours were good, but they treat employees pretty poorly."
good,A fun job that can be rewarding if you make it so.  Can be very pushy as the company strives its employees to be salesman without the credit of being a great salesman.
good,"This job is as great as your manager. I personally have an amazing manager currently, however i have had other managers that make the work day hard to get through"
good,The customers and staff are very easy to get along with. The customers seemed very eager and happy to talk with us and I loved talking to them about the products we sold. My communication skills have improved because of how many customers I would help in my every day work with GameStop.
good,Basic retail job. I sold video games to kids and their parents. Fun time if you're in college or something similar. Not a bunch of advancement opportunity
good,"It was a wonderful experience. It was definitely busy and very stressful. But we all worked as a team, encouraging each other. Even though there was tension from the stress we worked through it."
good,not enough challenges in a day. Bored to quickly. The pay is horrible for the amount of responsible requested from the company not much to enjoy not much to learn from
good,Generally if you have good manager and you are accustomed to talking to people a lot you will have a great time here. Talking to people about Video games is pretty simple as long as you are informed about them. If you are not fast at typing you will have a little trouble working the register system at first but you will get used to it pretty fast after repeating the same actions. Organization of the store is easy as long as you know the alphabet and use general cleaning habits. Getting promoted is a bit of hassle depending on the district since upper management tends to play favorites.
good,"Gamestop taught me many things that I will continue to use in the future. It was a fun job, but not a great career. Management Above store level still has a long way to go in treating there backbone right."
good,"Typical retail job. Company has gotten away from the core video game experience and tries to do too much at once. It helped me get by while in school, but it gets old fast."
good,semi ok job. not a great area to start your working career. very slow paced work environment excluding holidays. sales goals are unreachable due to digital market.
good,"During a typical day of work, id answer any questions from customers with my best knowledge about video games and other game related questions. We also took time to assure games were in order as to where customers could find them quickly and efficiently. I"
good,"Pros"
good,very simple job. pay was ok at the time. not much room to move up in the company. store managers were very difficult. would not work there again.
good,had a bad manager don't know what else to say nit the best job but i would recommend it to people because if you get a good manager then you will have a great time.
good,"The pay rate was not all that great but its a good environment to be in. This job is good for giving people customer service experience. If you like video games and want to be apart of that world, gamestop is the place for you"
good,A lot is expected of you. And if your in management you are usually alone for 5 hours doing everything. If you are a store leader or above. Your set. And can usually get away with a lot.
good,"GameStop is not a bad place to work. Far from it. It's a fairly easy job as long as you have a good work ethic and a productive attitude. It also helps if you don't mind being cheerful and chatting with customers. Most of the day is spent keeping things neat, helping customers with purchases or trade-ins, and answering questions. But, in my experience, there were some issues with being told multiple different ways to do a certain task when only one of those methods is the technically ""correct"" one. This can lead to confusion and frustration during the busy seasons."
good,It's difficult to write a review for this company since I didn't work for them very long or have any real exposure to the corporate ladder or structure. I was a seasonal sales associate who was working part time while trying to get my feet back under me after leaving a previous position.
good,"Fair Job, Not enough hours though. Holidays are fast paced and interesting. My store kept losing store managers so we didn't have much help at the time."
good,"A typical day usually involves me taking over as the closing manager. I get a summary of the day so far and what is expected of us a store and what I need to get done for the day. The day then just involves helping guests and trying to get tasks done if we have the time. "
good,I felt a bit overworked tyere but all in all its an overall good exprance. Wasent going to complain too much. Other staff were reasonable and helpful. A lack of communication outside of work leaves a bit to be desired
good,Great place to work. Coworkers and management were friendly and easy to work with. I would have stay there bUT I had to up and move out of town. There was also room for growth.
good,"Provide Customer Service To Customers. "
good,The workers are almost too helpful. The store is very cozy feeling when you walk in. The different categories stick out to grab the eye naturally. The prices are fair.
good,"It's great for a place that's a stepping stone. Hours are flexible, the job can be loads of fun, and it's an environment you can be comfortable in. But moving up, I feel like I need to upgrade to a more secure job with regular hours."
good,"A typical day at work depends on if you opened or closed, I mostly closed. You would have to check out boxes and make sure all the outgoing products were ready to ship by tomorrow. My co-workers were very dependable. The enjoyment of the job was working with the public and sharing my own opinions on the games and convincing others to buy what i thought would be good for them. The hardest part of the job was always meeting the sales goal as everyone had to work together and meet them, if one co-worker fell behind it was up to the others to pick up the slack so the weekly and daily sales goal was met."
good,barely trained just told to greet guests and alphabetized the stock never once taught how to use the register. Then wasn't told when my seasonal period ended.
good,"While working at GameStop I encountered wonderful customers, a well paced work environment and overall a rather nice place to start my work experience at."
good,"It was a temporary job, so you would get moved around a lot, and would end up working twice as hard as the the person next to you who actually worked for the company."
good,Get to work with latest technology.  Many areas to learn in.  Retail is always open so you always have to work.  Very good experience.
good,A typical day of work is informing customers about the product he or she are purchasing and if they have any problems we will troubleshoot information.
good,They hired me as a temporary over the holidays along with 4-5 other people then gave all of us about 12 hours total over a 3 month period. They should have just hired the one person.
good,"-Typical days organizing games, and assisting customers"
good,It was pretty slow most of the time and I learned how to scan items on the cash register. The management and co-workers were very nice. The hardest part was giving information on the video games but the most enjoyable was interacting with customers.
good,I worked with this company for years and For me it is very average. As I moved up to management level the enjoyment I got from the job seemed to dwindle. The company to me changed from being employee/ customer based to nothing but numbers. It can be very stressful at times. What keeps you going is that the customers and your co workers all have the same interests as you do. GAMES
good,The company can be very demanding to have numbers. I feel like they claim to want to treat guests like family but treat their employees less than well. They push to have better numbers and you are given a counseling if you aren't meeting the impossible standards of the company
good,"I applied for the Christmas and Black Friday season and I only worked two different days, that weren't near either of those days."
good,"La gestione dell'azienda e del turno di lavoro era il punto debole,sempre sotto stress per far sempre più vendite."
good,"My team of coworkers and management help bring a sense of ownership to our store, and we take pride in its maintenance as well as the service we provide to our customers. I will say the hardest part of the job would be the more volatile customer base, despite having a great customer service ethic, there are simply some people who are unable to be pleased and cause discomfort to not only my staff, but other customers within the vicinity.  I will the also say, the most enjoyable part of this work is the other end of the spectrum, the customers who treat us like human beings.  Most of us workers can consider ourselves ""gamers"" and we like to share our experience with our customers to help them enjoy their own gaming purchases.It is extremely satisfying to know you helped someone enjoy their purchase just as much as you enjoyed yours."
good,"Adecco is a good temp agency, when I first moved to ohio they helped me get my first job. Very fast job placement. but it lack workers comp"
good,GameStop cares only about their full time employees. They are shady with pay roll and refuse to answer simple questions about how they do pay roll. Its an ok job if you are looking for some extra spending cash but you will not be able to support yourself off of what they offer.
good,"temporary hiring system is very poor... you're expected to convince management through work ethic if you're worthy of staying employed, but most ppl hired never get scheduled to even show their worth and talents"
good,The management in this company tends to be self centered and egocentric. They will expect their team to work for each other and themselves while never really putting their own efforts in.
good,"Although I only worked there seasonally and had to relocate due to financial reasons, GameStop was one of the best jobs I have ever had. Their management style is leadership based in every sense of the word. I never felt like I had a job but had an experienced mentor guiding me day by day, and for that I am so grateful. I would highly recommend working here for anyone interested in video games and electronics."
good,"Most of my time spent at Gamestop that wasn't administrative functions was just interacting with customers and helping them understand what they were buying and also offering them something based on their personal preferences if they didn't know exactly what they were looking for. I loved running the midnight launches, the energy was always high there and it rarely felt like work."
good,GameStop was a great place to work. Everyone in the workplace was very friendly and this includes the customers. If you have a love for games and need a place to work this is a great option.
good,Easiest job I ever had. would work there again  manager wasvery relaxed and laid back to everything. pay was bad though. we got our checks sent to a comdata card instead of direct deposit.
good,Love the ability to sell and talk about what i love all day. Unfortunately i only had a couple days to do it because the acting manager at the time just stop putting me on schedule. I dont even know if i work there still or not.
good,"the Gamestop that i started at changed drastically over the years i was there, it is now way to focused on getting every penny out of the customers then helping them find what they actually want."
good,"Recent changes in company structure allow for a more empowered environment. I'm able to run my store the way I feel is best. Full time benefits and PTO is pretty decent. Rewarding job when you have a staff that shows engagement."
good,"For customer service the training is pretty basic, however they try to help out as much as possible. Benefits are standard after working for the company for a while [typical 90 days thing]. Standard call center job with standard hours. Occasionally worked on holidays."
good,"Appagante rapporto con i clienti."
good,"It's a fun job, being surrounded by video games is nice, being able to talk about it as part of my job is pretty fun. I don't care much for the pay, it's not very much at all, even as an SGA you don't earn very much, even though you are tasked with closing the store."
good,"I liked most everything about this job except for the hours. I do not know if it is still the same now, but they did not offer full-time employment to anyone but managers. I would have kept that job forever and moved up in the company if I was able to provide for my family while working there. The pay was what you would expect, not great but not terrible for an enjoyable job."
good,Company is in a good location and the working hours was good.  Company have very a lot for free lunch for everybody.  When I was there I didn't like the score system they had in place for the Tech.
good,"Ogni giorno si fa in modo di ottenere sempre il risultato migliore affrontando le priorità del momento e programmando i periodi futuri. "
good,"usually works well with school schedule, but is not a place to stay forever. you deal with customers of all sorts so customer service is key."
good,If you are a college student or like part time jobs this is perfect. Alot of the customers aren't game literate. Alot of demands when the pay isnt all that great. and you can get fired for practically nothing.
good,a job that is part-time as a Game adviser mini wage. its there if you need a part-time job with no benefits they have health but a game adviser cant use the health benefit. The Game adviser doesnt make a lot they get less then 20 hours a week deeps on the manger to give you the hours and that person my give you 20 or my not give less 20 my give you 10 hrs this week or give less then that.
good,all about the numbers and too much red tape and politics. not helpful in personal development and growth. most enjoyable part of the day is the kids faces when they come and you suggest a game they will love.
good,it is just a typical day at work. Making sure people do not steal from the company. Got along with my employees and managers. Was apart of the safety team.
good,Like my peers - great teamwork have to work long hours on game launches and inventories. Lots of emails. Travel was good as we have a lot of stores in Orlando.
good,"Worked at cashier and answer phone for any customers that had questions or concern about any product. Also had to make sure that the inventory was stocked, as well as organize the items on shelf."
good,"Very nice place to work, got to learn about new games and systems. Laid back and easy to do, love to meet and help customers."
good,"It's retail. There was low pay, random hours, and angry customers, but at least you get to deal with video games. I worked hard for the company and was never promoted due to favoritism in upper management."
good,Though my time was short there the management and fellow employees were fun and easy to work with. The problem I had was despite being promised more hours to prove myself the few hours I got were very sporadic and inconvenient. The work itself was very people oriented and focused on helping customers either find their desired product or sell them on one if they are undecided.This allowed me to converse with many interesting people.
good,"Holiday season work is a shot in the dark, because I worked maybe once every other week because of employee overkill. Dealing with people wasn't hard and my coworkers were cool. But my hours were terrible."
good,If you like video games or have a extensive knowledge in video games. This would be the company for you or to own one. Meet a lot of people and get to talk about video games all day.
good,"Nothing extremely good or bad about working here. If you play lots of games and are able to talk to costumers about them, you can excel."
good,"Working with a lot of customers and organized the inventory. It helped me learn some people skills and management skills. I learned that Game Stop can be a helpful place for your question concerning about games and technology. The management is well rounded and helpful. Some co-workers slack off and some don't but that is most jobs and Game Stop is no different, but for the most part people work hard here. The hardest part of the job is the pay, it's not the best but you can get raises if you work hard. The most enjoyable part is that it is fun for the most part you work here."
good,fun work place supportive staff always helping each other enjoyed working with the public my goal was always set i enjoyed working their.
good,"They only worked me twice, the whole time I was there. I would have loved to work more it seemed to be a great environment but was never given the chance."
good,"GameStop as a place to go to talk about video games is great, but working there is not always as appealing.  Company is very centered towards promotion of the new fad item or service and meeting sales goals.  Management can be troublesome depending on the store, each store has its own way of leadership.  Loved my first few years with the company, though I was not in the management position I had when I was offered a promotion at a different store. Keyholder positions are not unbearable if the rest of your co-workers and management team do what they are supposed to.  The experiences with the customers vary on the time of year and what is coming out, but most are pleasant. The company does have many avenues they use to aid their employees and assist them in most situations.  The problem lies in being able to access them and understand how they work.  Working at GameStop unfortunately led to me having difficulties with a very dear hobby of mine.  From having to tirelessly promote unrelated or unnecessary items to customers to having the same customers attempt to lecture me on the items I was selling wore me out and killed my drive to work there. When I wasn't taking care of customers, I had 100 other duties to keep track of and 100 more things to clean and organize as well. Feeling strung out is almost a certain constant when you work here regularly."
good,Enjoyable place to work at and you get to meet new people on a daily bases and talk about games. Store manager/Co-workers are awesome to work with. Best part of the job is helping people with issues and helping them with there video game needs.
good,"Fun place to work with open minded management and co-workers. Numbers based and quota expectations set high. I enjoyed the technology environment and the like minded co-workers and employees. I disliked that I was limited by part time hours, received no benefits, and got paid so little."
good,"It's never a dull moment working, there's always someone coming and asking questions about the newest games coming out. it's a great way to work on your people skills and helps you get comfortable around large crowds. Also it helps you to think on your feet."
good,"Fun place to work"
good,working at gamestop was more about knowing your product well and being able to communicate properly with customers. I was a video advisor which made me involved with sells and customer service.
good,"At Game Stop I had the opportunity to aid customers in their gaming needs, and also keep them up to date on the latest gaming technology. I learned about the different genres of games,and also console technology.Most challenging part of the job was getting subscriptions.Most enjoyable part of the job was learning about new technology."
good,"Atypical day at work would begin with arriving to the store an hour before open to ensure that everything was ready for the coming day. completing any tasks that were left over from the night before or nay that needed to be completed before the store opened. Most of the rest of the day was waiting for customers, unless we had some kind of inventory,task, marketing to setup or section to clean/rearrange. Most store level managers were nice, but upper middle management didn't care a lot about the people on the store level. The hardest part of the job was the stress and pressure associted with meeting sales goals."
good,"Game Advisors work 0-8 hours a week. 3rd key associates make barely above minimum for part time. Advancement is possible, because many kids leave for classes or different service jobs and that creates openings."
good,Good place to get started with your love of videogames and run a business while your at it. Don't have to dress too formerly for this industry and you get the inside track o the latest tech coming to market.
good,"it was really simple, cashier and get people to buy more, no more no less. the people were fun and the environment was fast paced."
good,"Guest service"
good,"Usually lots of customer service questions, recovery of the product, and cashiering. I learned how to alphabetize games and how to communicate with customers quickly and efficiently. Management was very considerate and co workers were easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was getting to know about all the video games that are in the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help people learn about the games that they didn't fully understand."
good,"Your days at work will be stuck to a game planner or play book or whatever its referred to as, you must source to be effective and should you fail at this then your weeks are gone until you do. Yet there are some districts which display cohesive team ready attitudes but others are very much more clicked together and suckle at the power teets. Management could always be better but you will undoubtedly have a regional director describing how their business plan (which doesn't ever benefit the store manager) is going to be the ""ONE THING"" to take your P&L to the next level, all the while pointing out your inefficiencies and how your easily replaced.  the enjoyable parts are that you get free games from certain developers, your cowokers will more than likely be nerds but know everything about the Nintendo Wiis Legend of Zelda Sountrack, but if your enjoying yourself its not that bad."
good,"I worked at GameStop Distribution as a seasonal employee just before Christmas.  Job was easy, but management didn't treat people with much respect."
good,working for gamestop has given me the opportunity to handle more out of life. I am better fitted to grow with other companies and roll with the changes.
good,"I worked at Gamestop while I was in highschool and left when I was in college. I had been a regular at my first store for years and the manager hired me for holiday help when I got my working papers. I was always lucky to have a fun group of people to work with regardless of what store I was working at. Customers were generally your standard casual and hardcore gamers, but there were always a few troublemakers that were just a hassle."
good,It's not a bad place to work if you like video games and the discount you get for working there is really nice. It's preferred if you have a second source of income though since hours can be hard to come by some weeks.
good,Customer service sales and  shipping and receiving managing staff scheduling. Gamestop is a fun place to work for the right age group of employee 18 to 32.
good,Fun place to work.  Everyone smiles and says good morning.  The cafeteria food is good and cheap.  Great place for college aged kids to work.
good,"A typical day at Gamestop, Inc. in the license department consist of doing your work and avoiding management. This department is not excepting of positive change, and the tools they have to work with are not being maximized due to lack of knowledge and lack of acknowledging what you don't know.  So this form of management doesn't allow the room for business process improvement."
good,"The workload is tedious, mainly because in management, payroll budget constraints is the main resource for executing and completing daily workloads. Overall the company is fair in a generalized concept, it is a unique business therefore expect unique circumstances and prepare to work hard. "
good,"Having worked to Gamestop for a few years now. It is clear that they only get what they want out of you.  They have a training program that is very one sided and does not leave much room for feedback.  The store supplies office is slow to restock some of the elements needed to maintain the stores functionality.  "
good,"A typical day at Gamestop would be walking in to open the store, counting money, making sure everything is clean, organized, and marketed correctly so that the store is ready for customers. As the customers come in, greet them with promotions and sales going on for the week and try to help them as much as you can with their questions, problems, and purchases. Most managers are very laid back and will help you if you want to move up in the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was how quickly you learn about videogames and the business itself."
good,Started from the bottom and worked my way to being a Manager. A lot of good people to work with. Sometimes work load seems overwhelming.
good,Esperienza molto interessante in contesto di magazzino ben strutturato
good,"Wasn't there for long to notice conclude much. Very organized and boring. Customers took all their purchases very seriously. There were plenty of valued, returning customers."
good,Just started out this month. Overall the work environment is usually low stress and the staff is very friendly and incredibly helpful.
good,Worked long hrs and for little pay. lots of rules and regulations for almost no money. Would not recommend working for them.
good,Fun work environment. Great employees and customers. I learned valuable information about the products I was selling
good,The pay wasn't that great compared to the work they expected you to do.
good,"La tipica giornata di lavoro si svolgeva nella seguente maniera: apertura punto vendita, ricezione colli, catalogazione articoli, esposizione merce e marketing, vendita e gestione clienti."
good,Management is nice. Wonderful co workers. Learned product knowledge. Hardest part of the job is selling magazines.
good,"not bad just a lot of work and not enough time.  holidays are chaotic and too much too do with everyone coming in and working with 1 other person, maybe 2."
good,Good environment for fellow gamers. Selling products that you know about to people you relate to. low wages though and sometimes poor hours.
good,i enjoyed this job for while it lasted. I mainly just promoted new games and systems as well as organized the store. One of my favorite jobs for the conversations I would have with customers. Just didn't get as many hours as I had expected.
good,it was a fun job that aloud me to work with people that are similar to myself. great management and co-workers. really a fun job.
good,"Working at GameStop is a very fun place to work for people that are passionate about video games.  However, the standards that employees are held to in terms of sales can be cumbersome.  In particular, my manager would, in a way, manipulate his sales in order to look better to his employees, giving us impossible goals while preaching how easy it was to attain."
good,"•	Maintained friendly and professional customer interactions. Worked as a team member to provide the highest level of service to customers. Demonstrated that customers come first by serving them with a sense of urgency. Placed special merchandise orders for customers. Opened and closed the store, including counting cash, opening and closing cash registers and creating staff assignments. Described use and operation of merchandise to customers."
good,An ever changing and adapting company to keep up with the technology of the times.  On the management level you have to worry about not meeting your sales quotas and projected numbers.  The turnover rate is higher tan most other companies due to the requirements to exceed the previous years sales.
good,"You start off the day with opening procedures of cash management and inventory validation."
good,"Gamestop is a pawn shop for Video games.  It's a fun place to work.  Only problem is...with downloadable content the video game retailer is having a difficult time staying afloat, and this pressure trickles down hill to the Store Managers and on down"
good,We were told to always put the customers needs first and that is what we followed in order to maximize customer service. I enjoyed being able to help out people with my knowledge.
good,A typical day at work starts with opening the registers and doing opening counts and paperwork. I then move on to shipment to make sure product is on the floor for customers in a timely manner. Mostly I am helping customers find what they need and telling them about the new items coming out.I learned a lot while working at GameStop. I learned how to successfully sell items to customers and how to manage a team of individuals. I learned that getting personal with customers that frequent the store will make them come back and spend more money. They listen and heed your advice on games.The management team was good. They are worked hard but never let it show. They smile and continue to help to the best of their abilities. I had overall pretty great co-workers that worked hard and were as dedicated as I was. I the hardest part of the job was taking in items that looked possibly stolen. No one wants to be the employee that lets a customer get away with that. The most enjoyable was watching a customer leave happy and satisfied because I went above and beyond to help them with everything they needed.
good,"-Complex problem solving, active communication and listening, and management skills"
good,It's hard to love a job that is in retail even if you happen to love video games. I found the job to be repetitive and having to convince customers to reserve games was annoying and very unnecessary. I did like that they did promote within and for the most part the days/nights weren't too bad.
good,I enjoyed working there under my previous manager. She made working there easy and fun. Met some great customers and had some amazing co-workers.
good,"The great thing at working for Game stop was that there was always something new to learn with new games and software debuting everything week, it really updated my knowledge on gaming and computer technology."
good,"In the 14 years i worked for gamestop, i had a great time and learned a lot about the retail industry, from engaging customers on the floor in timely and professional manner, to setting up weekly and monthly planners to reflect the companies directives, to hiring, scheduling and coaching other managers and staff to run a smooth, neat, clean and organized store.  time management is a must in this environment, as busy work is put on hold, the moment a customer enters the store to shop.  being able to quickly manage daily tasks in between is crucial, so there was never really ever downtime.  i really enjoyed talking to each and every customer, finding out their needs and applying gamestops approach to sales, never making a guest feel pressured or rushed.  At times, when customer issues would arise, i would always feel i knew that there was a solution just around the corner, and by taking care of every customer, every time, there was never a problem i could not solve."
good,"not much to say aside from the fact that It was my first real and extensive job and that I learned a lot about customer service and cross sales.  A typical day was just opening the store or closing it with the most about of reserve quotas possible.  That was the hardest part.  "
good,"Its just falling apart as a business, good job while one is at school but a company that needs to restructure."
good,"Learned to satisfy customers , retail experience and management experience"
good,"Retail, Games, Gamestop, where you sell games… ok place to work."
good,Great interaction with customers and staff. Learned how to sell products and services. Managed staff of 10-15 employees.
good,"fun place to work at but not the best for work advancement, none the less a cool place to work if your a teen"
good,"Most days, we were busy. Lots of kids came in looking for video games, and parents came in asking plenty of questions. We would have high volumes of pre-orders, but the night team would work fast to get them out of the store. My coworkers were very relaxed and amiable, and they made the experience more enjoyable. The hardest part was dealing with unsatisfied and inconsolable customers, but I did enjoy being in a fast-paced work environment that kept me on my feet."
good,Have fun with kids coming in and ruining your store. It was a fast paced place with little to no chance of advancement.
good,"ho imparato ad essere piu responsabile nell'apertura e chiusura del negozio (della cassa).I miei colleghi erano ottimi,la pausa pranzo/caffe era la parte piu difficile del lavoro (perchè non esisteva)mentre la parte piu piacevole era un ambiente sereno ed era l'hobby di tutti"
good,"Overworked employees, poor salary, Unrealistic expectations. Constant cutbacks and difficult clients"
good,I would greet customers as they would walk in. I also would handle their questions to my best knowledge and direct them if they were lost. I also brought up customers to the register to help them check out. My co-workers were friendly and helped out if the store got busy. The hardest part was handling majority of customers when the store gets packed and the most enjoyable part is being around people with the same interest in games as myself.
good,All you really do is stand around and talk. You do some work like places games on the shelves but a majority is talking to the customers about video games and working the register at the same time.
good,A typical day would be checking out customers and stocking shelves. I learned basic clerical functions at this job. Management is decent. I enjoy working with my co-workers. The hardest part is dealing with unhappy customers. Most enjoyable part is working with co-workers.
good,Haven't worked there since 2005 so I am not sure how it is now.
good,Working at gamestop is obviously fun. But their upper management is not good.
good,I really can't say much about this position due to it being a temporary job as seasonal help. I will say though that my manager was very kind and I still get along with him to this day.
good,Entry level positions only get around 4 to 10 hrs every week.  Always a new product to push.  Very competitive workplace.  With hard work it is easy to succeed.  Wages are low compared to others in the industry.  Co-workers are all wonderful.
good,"this store was run by a nice guy who had to leave to train and get another store out of state up out of the gutter, the person he left in charge was a snap on authority and I had to quit or she would have fired me, it was more a personal issue than a job related issue. it was alright for upper management to have people in the store after hours but not lower managers bad examples being set, I learn by example for the most part.so if you show me this is how it is done and expect me to follow some guidelines or manual that most people do not read, you have another things coming. As I said the Primary manager I got along with super, yet the one left in his leave was  just power hungry and inexperienced."
good,"An average day at GameStop consisted of organizing and reorganizing all shelves and display cases, as well as maintaining sales, subscriptions, and returns on a daily basis. I thoroughly enjoyed working with the positive, hard-working associates and managers. Although the job was strenuous during weekend hours, it was only as enjoyable as we made it."
good,A typical day at work involved sales. Numbers were most important to the company. I learned different ways to sell attachments to customers. Management with the company was also evolving. Co-workers were always changing. The hardest part of the job was overcoming the amount of turnover. The most enjoyable part of the day was interacting with customers.
good,"If you are into video games, there is no other place to start.  You work with with people with similar interests."
good,"In charge of opening and closing store. Rotating week to week shifts. Hours for full timers is usually constant but can be cut if numbers and hours are low. There is usually a good atmosphere with employees and management. Company focus can vary wildly, due to new changes in the industry, competition from other retail chains, and management changes. Can at times be difficult to keep up with constant changes to customer service expectations. Rules can be laxed at times and leads to 'picking and choosing' when discipline is handed out."
good,It was a fun place to work. But not what you need to increase any skills or move up in a career.
good,There was always something to do. Customers usually had a lot of questions. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with all the new games and reviews.
good,"A normal day at Gamestop depends on what titles are coming out. Some days can be extremely slow, while others are extremely hectic and fast paced. One is required to go through a daily checklist of activities needed to be done. The monkey wrench that gets thrown into the mix is when orders come down the line to change certain parts of the store, stop what you're doing to change something else, or your DM wants to know certain things. "
good,"At my store, a typical day consists of advising customers, keeping the store presentable and operation of a POS system. When you enjoy video games, it shows in the work. Gaining regulars helps your sales, but also makes it more fun to talk to them about the latest games and reviews."
good,"loading and unloading truck good people to be around, a typical day in around the holiday when you have a lot of game to load and unload the management was good. this is a job that will keep you going and the time go fast"
good,"My favorite time on the job would be helping customers out find what they need. I made some friends while working at gamestop. Working hard since the economy is bad, and its never easy to make money. Applying at different jobs is like a needle in hay stack, but I want to find a permanent job for future purposes. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the employees you work with. The easiest part of the job is to do what im told to do. Getting a task done right away is what I like to do."
good,It's enjoyable talking to customers about games. Schedule is usually flexible. I've learned good salesmanship from my time there. You also learn to have good time management skills.
good,"The job itself is fun, the coworkers and managers are pretty fun.  Hours are usually okay, but only if you get your preorders.  Corporate is horrible, and usually run the store managers into the ground.  Pay is the worst."
good,Great atmosphere with the opportunity to grow. People are great.
good,Very relaxed environment when not busy. Learned a lot about retail and customer service. Good benefits.
good,"Fine company at the time, opened/closed and dealt with money. Can't speak for how the company is now."
good,"typical work day was stocking the shelves with game cases, and doing customer services. You answer questions about game consoles and games. The management is great and they will work with you. However, they never really had enough hours to balance out with other co workers and you get the most hours of 20-30 hours a week."
good,"Gamestop is a decent job, the typical work day of course depends on position, mine would vary from opening, counting up registers, making sure all systems are accounted for, respond to all the emails and daily tasks, make sure the store is in ready to open condition, Take in all shipment that arrives at about 12. After that its make sure my other coworkers are doing what they are supposed to be, while selling selling selling. or if im closing then its everything in reverse order. There really isnt much hard about the job except you can work really hard and generally it either wont show, or you wont get paid well. You do get to meet a lot of people that come in that can open up opportunities for you elsewhere. The job is ideal for the typical high school student, not so much an adult with bills to pay, because it most definitely wont pay your bills and there is quite a bit of negative reinforcement."
good,I enjoy working there. my co workers are friendly and it gives me the chance to work on my people skills. I have a better understanding of retail work and how products are sold.
good,"Fun atmoshpere, with goal oriented individuals.  Lots of perks and opportunities to grow."
good,"The company lacks in many of the necessary areas for a business to be successful. The manager and sales associates are poorly trained, and uninformed about the product that they are expected to sell effectively. The corporate goals were also poorly implemented. Employees performances were assessed based on an inconsistent and arbitrary set of ""goals"" that were poorly tracked and in no way were the employees treated in an equal manner. The employee recruitment policy is implemented in a blatently biased manner, and could be deemed illegal discrimination."
good,"learned register catalog "
good,I enjoyed this work place as it was a nice place to start your first time job.
good,"I held a position in the document control department and handled incoming and outgoing calls with customers that had questionable orders of might have had fraudulent orders on their accounts. The team worked great together and the supervisors handled them well. The issue I had with the position was I am an expedient worker and I would run out of things to do in a couple of hours and when I asked for more work because I was extremely bored, there would be none available."
good,Learned valuable management skills and great customer service experience
good,Just like any retail you are required to work weekends and holidays. The particular store i was at was fun because of the people.
good,"A normal day would be filled with trades and handling customers in a very polite and timely way. All the while handling upset customers and cleaning various biological wastes off the floor. "
good,"The pay was basically non existent, a promotion to management was only a quarter pay raise, lot of stress and work for minimal compensation, and corporate was sketchy."
good,"typical retail job. Had fun with the staff we had and the representatives from the bigger companies. Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo."
good,come to work everyday ready to sell the lastest game systems or newest equipment to it the system or even the new games that are new arrivals.
good,"Loved working with the customer and interacting with them when they came in to ask questions about games.  The work environment is calm and filled with people that ""usually"" truly love their job."
good,"It was a learning experience, I learned a few more thing about video games"
good,Very fake work place. Would not recommend anyone to work for this company or buy from this company.
good,Good place to work but they were supposed to be training me to be management. They just keep giving me the run-a-round when I ask about it though. I should have been trained in the first 3 months but it's going on 7 months now and my training is only half way done. I simply can't afford to wait around another 7 months to be trained.
good,Not much chance for advancement. Do not expect to get a lot of hours.
good,A typical day would be to organize game boxes in alphabetical order. it's great to meet people who have similar interests as you.
good,Company was mainly focused on selling product and excellent customer service.
good,"Being a gamer, I was excited to work at a place where I was able to talk about and promote video games.  It surprised me how many different people were gamers as well, and there were even times long conversations between the customer and myself would occur.  This gave them the confidence in me regarding the products they were about to purchase and would return to shop.  I was even given the opportunity to travel to a conference expo and go hands on with video game products before they were available to the public.  I was able to get along with most of my co-workers and had a friendly relationship with them following my departure from the company.  The hardest part of the job was readjusting to new management.  The best part of the job was the games, of course!"
good,"Opening Store,bank & money mangement, preparing for incoming inventory & customers.Sales,marketing,& cashier duties as well as assigning specific projects and organizing releases.Customer service  and manage store profits,maintenance duties,security checks and physically closing of store.The hardest part of job was inventory.The most enjoyably part of job was customers."
good,It is a fun job but they require many things and compensations arent that great
good,"When i came in to the place they were having issues with theft so we couldnt really borrow games occasionally, which is suppose to be one of game stops perks. The top level Management couldnt really get a handle on the situation as to why that specific location was loosing money."
good,"It's video games; outside of the holiday season most customers know what they want and most know what to expect from GameStop. Which is fine most of the time, you get to talk to people about video games all day. I learned plenty from my customers and many times each day I was able to give a great recommendation. The company however puts a huge emphasis on offering the complete customer experience which results in a culture where many ""things"" are pushed onto the customer regardless of their reason for visiting GameStop. It's different than BestBuy where warranties and overpriced cables are pushed on the customer, at GameStop it's more commitments; subscribing to the rewards program, reserving upcoming games, aggressive inquires into merchandise to trade back in."
good,"People can be very relaxed and laid back, but really know what they're doing when it comes down to it."
good,"A typical day at work is promoting upcoming releases that include hosting midnight events and handing out free cool stuff to customers. We sell and trade used and new games, and get to talk about games all day, a dream for gamers. "
good,Basically i learned what is to work with people event if its a good or a bad situation i do my best to give that costumer the best possible service so he can leave in a good mood and when he comes back he can have that same happy mood.
good,"GameStop is a great place to work for those that understand the job is more about helping people than it is about knowing games. The company does very little outside hiring for higher level positions within the stores themselves. Instead there is a huge focus on training and promoting within the store which makes it a great place to grow. The business is very fast paced and dynamic as GameStop is always striving to stay relevant in an increasingly digital world. This has lead to a constant stream of new initiatives and plenty of changes to pre-existing ones. For those that enjoy a challenge it is extremely exciting but for those who are more laid back, it can get incredibly overwhelming very quickly."
good,Great job!!! Sad it was only seasonal. Great customers and staff. Always stayed busy doing something.
good,"Alphabetizing games and helping customers is typical of a normal day. Usually a relaxed environment, although number of hours weren't great.  "
good,Taking care of others needs and keeping an immaculate environment.
good,"Working here requires a passion for video games that transcends every frustrations of retail. Typical day for a Senior Game Adviser when opening consist of basic store operations. Opening and counting the tills, and confirming the prior days deposit. When packages arrive to process them completely; including organizing the product for back stock or sales floor, then setting product up on sales floor. Keeping the store cleaned and organized depending on flow of customers. When conducting sales, making all other sales pitches in addition to what the customer came in for. A closing shift will entail the same responsibility as the opening clerk (sans receiving shipments). Closing the store requires preparing the deposit as well as counting the tills and safe. For the store, returning it to ""ready to open"" conditions."
good,"Gamestop is a good place to work at as a second job or as a hobby. I loved working around games and knowing whats next in games, but unless you are a manager there or in charge of your own branch, there are not many hours. Pay is minimum and working holidays can be stressful. The co-workers were usually funny, nerdy people who were easy to get along with. "
good,"For most of my career with this company, I enjoyed the people that I have worked with and the customers that I interacted with. Had it not been for them, I would not have remained for two full years. "
good,"Typical day included stabilizing the constant flow of incoming and sometimes outgoing shipment throughtout the business day while all maintaining a set and enjoyable environment not for the customers as well as employees. I have learned to manage the time I am given and to use it wisely as well assisting in training fellow employees to excel such as I have. The fellow co-workers were fun and energetic and often reflected their daily performance. The hardest part the job was simply managing the constant flow of inventory moves throughout the day, however, after time of familarity it became just another part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was being around the products that I sold. Being an avid and fluent gamer, selling was an after thought as I geniunely have passion for it."
good,"On average, work days follow the same general schedule. The opener completes the day's tasks and, once open, assists customers with their needs. Any shipments are either received or prepared to ship out. At closing, the store is cleaned and the money is counted."
good,"My working hours were 7:30-4:30, Mon-Fri.   Allowed for good work/life balance.   "
good,"Working at Gamestop was mostly a rewarding experience. Overall, it was hard work, but that was due to the small amount of payroll given out. The customers were a pleasure most of the time, the team was great. Upper management was understanding. It just seemed that when it came to advancement, opportunity and overall morale, that was lacking at times."
good,Great place to work. District managers micromanage too much.
good,"Its an ok job but it all depends on who you are working with, and where."
good,"I only receive a few hours weekly, not enough to truly evaluate employer."
good,Stocking shelves with game cases. providing customer service. Simple job. It was nice to know the newest games releasing. Management was fair and respectful.
good,"I love my work, everything that it involves about the Game Industry, and all the people that I meet at work. The only thing I dislike about my job is the hours. I am definitely hurting for hours, and their system to get more hours is a little unfair. Let me explain, to get more hours you have to make a certain % in certain aspects of our sales, but its actually up to the customer themselves to want to buy the certain things we sale, and if they don't have enough money or are not interested, then we being the current ""Advisor"" at the time, will not make the %, thus not receiving illustrious hours. Its just hit and miss really. Right place at the right time moments."
good,Was a comfortable laid back enviroment. Friendly and accepting co-workers. Very routine.
good,"Working here has offered an eclectic array of coworkers and customers, offering both positive and negative experiences, but, overall, providing a good foundation for working any retail position. The job gives a basis for customer service, sales upkeep, phone and in-store assistance, filing and cleaning, and so much more. As well, with a positive attitude and understanding outlook to approaching the job, one can become submerged in true ""geek culture"" and find solace in the company with which you surround yourself."
good,"At GameStop we always worked as a team, with my co workers. I learned quite a bit about customer service, I even had some manager training in the process, the hardest part of the job was selling reserves."
good,Great jobs for teenagers who love video games. the management and co-workers help out alot
good,"As far as retail goes Gamestop was mostly average. The pay is not great, the benefits are minimal, the hours are long, but the people you work with and the products you offer are fun."
good,- customer engagement/ creating relationships
good,At Gamestop as I rose to Assistant store manager I've had the pleasure of learning many things about management and retail. However Gamestop specifically was very corporate based and nationwide centered. I feel the upper management was out of touch with the actual industry and too intent on applying archaic sales strategies where they didn't belong.
good,"Retail job, specialized retail perhaps. I do feel that I know more about the product than when I worked for another retailer back in '07-'08 in their electronics department. My current company is good to work for, but lately I have not enjoyed customers trying to take advantage of me and make me feel bad just for sticking to store policies for returns and trade ins. I am looking to get out of retail, or if I stay in retail I am looking for back room / behind the scenes type of work. Im a hard worker, and I think of myself as loyal, but need a full time job with change for the better."
good,"Educated customers about merchandise, operation, and care of products"
good,Not a very serious work place but occasionally would demand cetain requirenments.
good,big managemtn and big business ruined a perfect environment
good,packing orders in a timely manner. make sure all orders are out by 7. Monday hours are 8am-7pm and tuesday- friday hours are 11am-7pm You dont get all of your hours sometimes. Monday are the busy days and as the week progress there are less and less hours.
good,Got to be cashier and talk to people about video games. Very fun job.
good,From the employees that don't want to be the management that was at my store that hated there job. This job was by far the hardest i have had when it came to the people that worked there.
good,"Typical work environment in a retail world. Small staff, large costumer base."
good,"A typical day at gamestop is always fun, if you're a gamer. The best thing was always talking about games with the customers."
good,"Gamestop is a really good place to start gaining retail experience. The stores are generally not too big, and you still get training in large sales volumes through the holidays."
good,"Open or close store if I opened the store with would double check the numbers from the previous day. If everything added up correctly I would do the daily bank deposit. After the deposit I would do the daily inventory. Then open the store helping customers, selling products, and promoting new products. Employees were fun and outgoing. Hardest part of the job was getting some employees to do daily tasks due to the fact I was younger than them. They felt they were better fit for my position, yet they did not have the experience I had in the video game/ retail industry. Most enjoyable was talking with customers, helping them as much as I could. The video game industry is so vast and diverse. Its just fun to be around people with that passion."
good,"Customer service, keeping store clean. Helping with special openings and sales"
good,"great work environment, only temporary job assignment. Work at your own pace, customer service department ar really friendly."
good,"Gamestop was a fun company overall. I left because of my commute and of the stress of constantly having to sell products. I was talented in selling but I am only human and on rare occasions I was off and threatened. I enjoyed being a manager and helping my customers. I loved the people I worked with and the products we sold. A typical day would be I would come in at 8:30 am and being by myself until three. I would do my neccessary system and perpetual counts,drop the deposit and get change,open the store at ten and help customers by greeting them meeting them on the floor and asking three open ended questions, making a reccomendation, making sure to sell preorders and discount cards,surveys,warranties,and thanking them. If a customer cancels a preorder it hurts you, however just smile and take it. The hardest part is being by myself for hours even on weekends due to lack of payroll. The best part is I received many compliments about my xceptional customer service. That made me feel good. Also I enjoyed hosting midnight launches."
good,"I worked as an assistant manager at a Gamestop. As with the usual retail situations, working with a variety of customers daily was quite enjoyable and fun. At times there were visits from the occasional unruly person, but those times occurred more towards the holiday season. Work was fairly straight forward, everyone essentially knew their duties and we got them done each day. A few stressful things about it are the holidays, and the continuous hounding from the higher up managers to sell their subscription magazine and reserve games. At times you felt like a pest because you had to sell them. If you did not, your numbers would look bad and eventually your hours may be cut."
good,Retail store with the specialization in video gaming.
good,It was fun walking customers through their purchase as this is a hobby I've always been very interested in.
good,"On a daily basis I get to engage with an interesting customer base, process shipment, and other basic managerial duties."
good,As the store manager I was responsible for all areas of store operation and performance. Store managers are also responsible for communicating successes and opportunities up and down the chain of command.
good,Did not provide an good environment for professional growth.
good,"Every day brought on its own set of unique challenges, from both operational as well as customer experience stand-points. Co-workers were friendly and passionate about what they sold. I learned how to manage subordinates in a retail environment and those skills were probably the most difficult to learn. Point Of Sale equipment and day-to-day functions were fairly easy to learn and incorporate, but the most enjoyable part of the job was talking about upcoming and current titles with customers in order to foster relationships and earn business."
good,Gamestop is a great job for anyone seeking a personable experience with a customer.
good,Typical day consist of ringing customers and trying to sale add ons. Not the best place in the world.
good,"A typical day at work would involve management of our current inventory, as well as negotiations with vendors on cost, contracts, quantity and ship times, cut purchase orders, work with customer service to improve any customer issues regarding the website. Attend trade shows and meet with new clients, to continue growing the catalog."
good,I just believe the Upper Management and the cooperate offices. do not see eye to eye. Cooperate think one thing and the RD's tell the Dm's something else. so the Dm's have to rule with a stick per the RD's words.
good,Working at Gamestop was an experience I am glad to have. The environment was open and friendly. It was easy to give customers my input and knowledge of the products in the store. The managers were informative and straight forward.
good,"I've spent the better portion of the last six years of my life working for GameStop. It was a job I've genuinely loved and appreciated from day one. Unfortunately, the work and life balances in the upper echelons of management are difficult, and the pay honestly isn't worth the level of stress I've been under as a manager."
good,Working at gamestop was like a dream come true. I had always been really into games and anything to do with them. I was able to meet plenty of fun and unique people through this job.
good,Making sure you on time because it will affect your attendance I learn how to work as a team.The work place was about safety and 5S cleaning and the job to be done on time.
good,Hired in as holiday help I tried my best to learn and work hard while meeting the demands for the customers. Management was what kept the store going for as long as it did and worked for the people and not for the paycheck at least at my store.
good,"Start my day at Gamestop by cleaning up, straighting up the walls for customers, read emails, conduct daily shippments. The hardest part of the job is trying to get enough rest during the holiday season. The most enjoyable part of the job is the whole environment within the store of all the product that we sell."
good,"Since the pay increase throughout the company. There is more reason to stay. For me, that pay increase didn’t happen until I moved jobs. The work load still does not justify the pay."
good,"Personally this job was confusing to rate. The work was nice and customers where nice, but my manager didn't run the store very well. This caused a lot of problems which is why I left."
good,"Working at Game stop is something I would recommend to people with well paying jobs who just want the extra money with no real issues. You will improve while working there and with what they sell, any discount is wonderful, but overall I would not recommend working here unless it is as a secondary job."
good,"At the beginning Game stop was fine, just another retail job, but at least the material was something I cared about. Made a lot of good friends with co-workers and customers alike, but the more time went on the worse it became. Game stop is not doing too well financially (as everyone knows) and towards the end, overbearing corporate policies designed to save Game Stop money at the expense of customers and employees became to much to deal with."
good,"GameStop can vary depending on the location. If you have a good store leader and district leader, it can make things easier. If you like video games and geek culture, Gamestop is a good place to work."
good,Impari a lavorare per obiettivi e a contatto con il pubblico
good,"Whoever your store leader is can make it or break it for you. Workplace culture is somewhat improving due to new CEO with the changes ahead. The main focus is on sales though, not video games, knowing games is a plus, but if you can't sell you're not going to have a good time. There is a lot to remember and more to do than meets the eye, but that will vary depending on your position."
good,"Gamestop employees are like family members. Unfortunately, management decisions has taken the company in the wrong direction. Many skilled employees have left the company for different opportunities."
good,I would have to say I stayed working with the low pay because I loved the team the store leader assistant store leader and I created a power house Gamestop. We loved the store and it showed in our numbers and through our customers. Although cooperate ruined everything because they don’t have a good hold of things and the pay was horrible I can still look back on my time there with a good memory.
good,"It’s a nice company a lot of good people there is a lot of, chances to get hired once you become a temp.There is a lot of way to make money inside the company and they are really easy just time consuming"
good,"The store I was working for had an amazing staff and manager.  Very knowledgeable and teamwork was great because of a smaller community.  "
good,"If you're just looking for a part time job, and have knowledge in gaming, then the job is for you. The pay ins't great and during the holidays, it can get extremely busy,"
good,"GameStop is a fun place to get started.. It's retail. It's sales without the bonus of commission. Pay does not compensate for the work you will do, especially in a manager role, and I don't have much drive to do well because my pay will be bad regardless. They will dangle promotions in your face and you'll never get them. Unless you're a store manager or an assistant, hours are not consistent and it's really hard to 'prove yourself' as an associate."
good,"The best part of this job to me were who I worked with. The people were fantastic, but the company has some broken policies for sure. I think your experience will have to do lots with who is your leader. I lucked out, but I've seen some other people in different districts who were miserable due to poor leadership. My district was super fun though!"
good,"Its a basic upgrade from game adviser.  The only difference is you can be in charge of openings, have to count cash at closing, and manage the part timers on how they are doing,  If the store is understaffed it can be tough times as there objectives once must hit before leaving and at times I would stay after my shift to make sure the priorities were done."
good,just make sure you have something else to support you until your rank is key holder status or above other than that I Love my job like seriously and my team
good,"As a store manager I feel incredibly under payed. the day to day job is not bad and actually enjoyable for the most part, but the amount of responsibility compared to what we earn is disheartening."
good,Good place to work if you are a gamer and don’t need a a lot of money to live. Work hours are 40 hours a week 55 hours a week during the holidays. Great people to work with.
good,"Worked there for 12 years, met alot of cool people. Have alot of fond memories. But the job gets complacent. Lots of repetition on a day to day basis. As more people go digital, its becoming harder and harder to sell customers on the loyalty program and pre-sales which is a big part of their business. With that being said, its becoming more and more apparent that the company is on the downfall."
good,"As a keyholder, you are expected to do everything that a typical business owner does to keep a store running. 70% of the time, you are working alone as well. The reason I said it was Slow-paced and also fast-paced is because in a single day, it can be both. Day starts with no transactions before noon, and then maybe 1 -5 guests between noon to 3, and then suddenly there's 7 moms, each with 2+ screaming children, each with a transaction, and at least one with a trade-in."
good,Great place to work as a temporary job. Fun place but low pay and if your manager is terrible than your not going to like it. If you need easy money than go for it.
good,"Working a job where I got to tell people what games were fun and what games to avoid was a good time. 2nd favorite job I've ever done. I typically only got 4-6 hours in a shift and only 2 or 3 shifts a week, but I had other things I was more focused on."
good,"I enjoyed my time with this company as I am someone that is extremely passionate about videogames.  This company taught me management skills, time management, social skills, how to deal with angry customers, inventory control... I learned so much here and I am so thankful for that.  I would still be with this company if it wasn't for the recession we had in 2009, the company also changed it's business model a lot since then and I don't agree with it any more."
good,gamestop is a good place to work if you love video games and meeting new people. but it is competitive and there are certain numbers you must reach in sale in order to keep the job
good,"I enjoyed my job but at the end of the day you have to meet certain numbers with trade-ins, preowned sales, sales, preorders, and pro membership sales"
good,"working for Gamestop was a fun experience for the most part. When working in groups of 5 you tend to get to know all of the people that worked there. moral is typically high, and you get to meet some incredible people.however promotions are far and few between. moving up in the company is incredibly hard."
good,"La giornata tipo consiste nel pulire e aprire il negozio, esporre eventuali novità o modifiche marketing. Poi analisi dati, prestazioni giorno precedente e eventuali strategie di vendita della giornata. Intanto si vende, si propone merch a chi compra giochi e viceversa, prenotazioni, ritiro usato e valutazioni, ricevimento ed esposizione merce, resi verso sede o altri store, eventuali task di allestimenti o conte settoriali, conta cassa, versamento e chiusura."
good,"A typical day at work would start with tidying up the shelves and making sure the store looked nice, a process that would take roughly half an hour. In the hour and a half with nothing to do as no customers would arrive, I would frequently walk the walls aimlessly, as we had nothing else to do. This sums up my entire experience at GameStop. While they promise a fast paced work environment, nothing could be further from the truth. While management was generally understanding and coworkers were friendly, things were incredibly sparse and quite boring most of the time. The pay is bad, but given most of your job is standing and waiting, I can't complain too much."
good,"it was a decent place to work, nice people and nice co workers.  the pay was good and the schedule was well maintained. .............................................."
good,"My Task as a Lead, running  a team of 30 to the most of my Technicians supplying them with the tools they need so they can achieve their daily production goal, working along with each and one of them,training, and working as a team. I've learned how to work with any situation that comes my way. "
good,"I liked the people that I worked with a lot but the fast paced, everything is on fire culture was draining day in and day out. There was never a chance to breath before there was another fire to put out."
good,This job allowed me to attend school and worked around my class schedule. You did have to hit targeted goals for sales and new members. Typical day started with setting up new promotional items. Put new games and consoles on display according to marketing guidelines.
good,"I had a great time with this job, great starter if you need to learn customer service. Definitely not a job to have if you're trying to support anyone unless you are the Store Manager or Assistant Store manager"
good,"I loved working here however, the pay benefits and hours made me seek other work opportunities. I advanced very fast in this company but even with a promotion there was still little hours and the pay still was not sufficient. Also there is a huge pressure from corporate to sell memberships, pre-owned games, and warranties. So much so that if you personally do not hit the quota you are called out in a weekly email from the General Manager and sometimes you have to redo computer training to help get your upselling quota up."
good,Its more of a chill environment but it does build up stress when you're not properly trained and everything is thrown at you to do on your own for the first time.
good,"As far as retail work goes, GameStop is great. But retail work blows, and GameStop pays very poorly. I loved my time there, but unless you plan on becoming upper management (e.g. District, Regional, etc), or will accept lower pay for your position, find something else."
good,The most enjoyable part of working at game stop is the coworkers.  The management is fair and I don't have any complaints.  The hardest part of working there is getting the circle of life scores on a low traffic day.
good,"I was with Gamestop for the holiday season, October to December. Training is easy and the job itself is rather easy. It gets difficult the closer you get to December with the first real stress arising with Black Friday. Starting on BF, cashiers will likely have no they are not checking somebody out. This was mostly fine, but there were the occasional argumentative customers. Days like that were extremely draining. Highly suggest for those who want perspective on how hard retail can be, but otherwise I say wait until January."
good,"Gamestop is a great place to work if you're going. to college or getting your first job. it is slow paced and easy to learn, although you won't make that much money, you will gain experience."
good,"I absolutely loved my time at GameStop. The people I worked with and the customers are amazing. The pay is not great and is definitely not enough to live off of unless you live with your parents or receive state assistance. As a manager, my work weeks were long with mandatory overtime and evening shifts. The DM at the time was not very supportive. However, the advancement is there if you work hard and show initiative."
good,"Each day was goal-based, often smooth, all while providing quality service. I learned a lot about a store budget and operating a team. A challenging part of the job was handling some of the customer complaints, but the job always got done where they were happy and the company was held to a great standard of integrity. The environment and the regular customers were the best part about coming to work every day."
good,"Game stop was very fun to work with and had a great environment but the higherups, particularly the District Manager, do not have a solid head on their shoulders in regards to what it is like to work behind the counter. Most times we were yelled at for not badgering out customers with too much information or questions in order to deive sales (with there being sometimes an up most of 8 or more questions we were required to ask each customer as we were checking them out, including 5 or more additional sales offers that usually did nothing more than annoy our guests). Furthermore it is rather difficult to feel appreciated when your pay does not reflect the amount of work you do: I lost 3 well earned raises when minimum wage increased and our DM refused to adjust the pay for high leveled employees in reflection, and as a result was being paid the same amount as the entry level employees even though I was a shift manager. When I eventually resigned I was making only 50 cents more than those I was managing, whereas before minimum wage increased I had been making almost 2 dollars more. The company is also very hands off if you want to transfer; as I discovered in the process of trying to do so. They leave it up to you to find a new store who wants you as well as to convince this new store to give you the same position you had at the old. I ended up not being able to work for this companybanymore when, after almost 3 years of being a shift supervisor, I was offered only the seasonal or entry level work at another location (which would have knocked my pay right back down to minimum wage)."
good,"Under paid, especially for the amount of love and care I put into my work. I loved my job, loved my boss, but once I found out that my pay was so low compared to competitive workplaces, I quit. After working for about 5 years, I was promoted once and up for promotion a second time, but the amount of work you do is just not worth it. The company pushes sales goals down your throat and often those goals are not achievable. If you love gaming, then it can be an easy job for you that is rewarding in diving headfirst in the culture. I certainly haven't had the ability to play as many games now as I did back then. Overall, fun job, but the company is awful and I only suggest it for a short period of time before finding something else."
good,"They are great benefits for working in Gamestop, only if you are a gamer and are willing to know everything there is to know about selling the Pro Rewards card. that is the secret of moving up in the company."
good,I have to say I think Gamestop has some of the best customer in retail. I absolutely loved my customer. The coworkers there were fantastic as well. It’s not a place for you unless you’re willing to put effort into selling.
good,"This review generally depends on the day of the week, honestly. As a Store Manager (Leader) I was in charge of ninety nine percent of the day-to-day activities of the store itself. I handled the check-in of shipments, store merchandising displays and relocation (stocking), proper schedule creation for associates, hiring/rehiring/termination of said associates, training of new hires/rehires, sales clerking, bank deposit/change runs, store merchandise counts to ensure a reliable stock count for store inventory, handle customer complaints, keep the store's marketing accurate and up-to-date. The list goes on and on for a store leader."
good,this is a fast-paced job in retail.  very low on the frills.  The employee discount is not bad and very helpful for gamers. nothing much else to say about it.
good,"For what its worth Gamestop is trying to adjust to the changing times and be a place you can stop to buy anything regarding entertainment. Their direction to pursuing the ""Circle of Life"" could use some revitalization however due to the fact that when you work you are treated as if you are paid off commission and are hounded by your superiors usually the District managers and regional directors to maintain if not succeed in sales of high profits and it is never enough. Compared to the measly pay I just feel that it is unjust to be pushed and threatened this much for such a mediocre job with low opportunities."
good,"I enjoyed my time here. Having said that, it's not a very stable place to make a living. I'd recommend only if you like video games and need something to do during the holidays/a seasonal job to cover a slow period at your primary employer."
good,As long as you keep up with your task this is a very easy and fun job. Make sure to check GSO every day and stay up to date on your Level Up training.
good,"The company is a great way to get a start in the retail world. They try to make sure employees are taken care of but also can be shady and only business. There are other internal issues with management and their process to deal with situations, but that is due to pressure from up above them. Its a cooperation that wants to increase its profit and they will make sure to follow the trends that follow the money. Gamestop in terms is becoming a full Geekstop where if the money and vision they set is not being executed or the status quo is tested, they will rectify it with any means necessary. A life time career is not common and even the vets I have met have parted ways because as the business changes so does the connection to employees. People that need a start in the retail world, I suggest Gamestop. Anyone that has experience, I don't suggest them as long term goals unless the pay and title is right."
good,"I loved the people I worked with directly, and the other employees in the other local stores.  We also have great relationships with many regular customers.  But while from the outside that seems great, on the inside we were all struggling to keep up with the demands put on us by the company.  "
good,"A decent place to work if you do not have a lot of time on your hands. It can be fun at times, the release parties are usually the best and you have a heads up on future games."
good,"The day to day part of the job is extremely enjoyable, especially building relationships with your guests.  However, the constant addition of new metrics and verification can be overwhelming."
good,"Hours were scarce if you were not management. Free posters and other random goodies is a huge bonus, along with renting games. High pace, but only if you push the right numbers. You can screw everything else up, but if you numbers are good, you are good."
good,"you do, however, talk about games all day. This is a sales job, retail. there are goals / requirements you need to meet. if you are female, you will be flirted with all the time. Alphabetizing is a staple, if you have any trouble with your ABC's, you wont last long. Otherwise, you get to sell video games, talk about video games, sometimes play video games for free."
good,Gamestop for me was an okay experience as it was mostly temporary. The coworkers I had were great and fun to work with but I had very little training which made it difficult for me to perform my job as best as I could. Combine that with a lack of hours and you don't get stellar employees.
good,"ol people to work with...work life balance was not good."
good,"Honestly, the corporate overlords of the business are completely detached from the actual gaming/nerd culture. Gamestop is a corporate business, first and foremost, and that becomes incredibly apparent as you work there."
good,The managers and other co workers were great people and I'm still friends with them today. The discount wasn't the best but we could reserve games and rent them out whenever we wanted.
good,"I wish the pay was better but the job is mostly enjoyable, especially if you have a great team to work with. If i was having to relocate, I would have liked tp advance in the ranks im this company. Might try to pick it up again in the future for a part time gig."
good,you can go up in the company but it gets tuff and competitive but if you are on the store floor level its not bad at all to work for but you defintily can not raise a family off of a GA salary
good,"I just wish that there were more hours available. I really wanted to stay and grow with the company, however I can't make a living off of 8-12 hours a week."
good,Gamestop is a very fun place to work. You deal with a wide range of people and you have a pretty good employee discount. Only cons I can think of is the low pay for there management staff.
good,It could be better.  Could use Better pay and incentives. The goals each week were stressful. Pay wasn't worth the task they had you do. Little to no training whenever the was a new program.
good,"I didn't get a lot of hours and mostly worked weekends as a part time employee, so it was perfect for High School or even a Summer Job if you didnt need the money too badly. The discount was alright I guess, nothing to get too excited about. The co-workers were really the only thing I took away from this job as a positive experience. They were all really friendly and enjoyed the same things that I did so It didn't feel too much like work. The hardest part for me was pushing sales."
good,"GameStop prides itself in putting customers first but in this they forget about their employees, and by setting those rules up alot of associates get disrespected by the customer and ultimately leave because management cares about "" the customer is always right"" when in reality there must b a balance."
good,"I greatly enjoyed my time at Gamestop. I worked there for almost two years, and in that time climbed up to Assistant Store Leader. My DM was smart and communicative, I generally liked my coworkers. There were a few truly bad apples, but I think you could say that about any job. The job duties are not difficult. They provide you will all the required training, and as long as you proactively check your daily dashboards, they will provide you with instructions, directions, diagrams, anything you need to be successful. It's a great job to learn about retail and sales if you've never done something like that before. Being knowledgeable about video games is obviously an advantage, but you will leave all the product knowledge you need at the job. The more important skills are soft skills like communication, leadership, and organizational skills. "
good,Company was fun to work for but anyone above store manager is one tracked mind. promotions are few to non and even when you are qualified they will hire someone from somewhere else or use a different stores person and never fill the position in your store.
good,Peccato per i tipi di contratto che propone.. sono molto poco vantaggiosi e tendono a sfruttare molto la persona che accetta
good,"Great for a First Job or to Compensate for a Part Time job, but definitely not something that you could pay for your life off of. It might be feasible for a part time college student suplementary income, it can be stressful and corporate are greedy as ever, but the employees you work with are splendid."
good,"The Gamestop location where I worked was fun. There was a lot of interesting people there that made the job enjoyable. The manager and assistant manager were amazing people. Always trying to help you learn, whether it was the Point Of Sales system, customer interaction, techniques up-selling. They also genuinely cared about your well-being."
good,"GameStop is a great place to work when you  need to get started on your first couple of jobs; however, there is little to no room for advancement within the company, and it tends to feel like even though a person may be more qualified someone who has been there longer or first can pass you in advancement regardless of their qualifications."
good,"Gamestop was fun to work at, just lacked in career opportunities.Would recommend for a part time job for the summer or a high-school job. Really enjoyed the relaxed environment."
good,It's a great place to work and discuss different video games. However it is still retail so it can get uncomfortable at times when you keep pushing sales
good,what the guest don't know of gamestop is that it makes it hard on their own workers by making everyone follow a sale percentage. For reasons like this is also how they will judge you for keeping you or fire you.
good,"it was more of an in between job for me, the manager was pretty cool, the discounts were pretty cool and I could ""rent"" games to see if they were any good or not"
good,"The job was a quick paying job that helped me during the holiday season. It was a busy time, but it was an enjoyable time working there. Just a warning expect a lot of random strict rules and dealing with customers that can be a handful."
good,"I enjoyed my time there while I was working. I loved the customer base and enjoyed talking about the work. I feel the biggest problem that existed there was the issue on micromanagement. This took place where the district manager would hover over the team and tell each employee what to do without having a full understanding of how the location's customers would act to those orders. It put a lot of stress on the store manager, and she was unable to lead properly, so she put stress on the rest of the employees."
good,"Working at Gamestop means some times only working 3 hours a week. Management is super strict and mistakes are not easily tolerated. Meeting numbers means everything, but if you know the job everything is easy and overall pretty relaxed."
good,"A typical day at work would be to do stock, greet customers, and do inventory."
good,"I enjoyed working there at first. my co-workers were awesome to work with and the customers were easy to work with (some more then others) but that comes with any job that includes customer service. Later in my experience of working there, prices began to increase on items that make it hard to sell to customers that don't even need them. it almost felt like I was ripping people off and left a salty feeling in my mouth so I didn't last very long in that company."
good,"A typical day at work - part-time position, 3 to 6 hour shifts."
good,"As a seasonal, part-time employee, I was only there maybe one or two days a week. I am not sure why I was hired for such limited work hours, but I enjoyed coming in to work. My favorite part was meeting and connecting with customers, and helping them find the game or product that they'd most enjoy. Many times they would have a couple games in mind already, and it was up to me to help them pick the one they would enjoy more. The workplace was incredibly friendly and supportive, and everyone smiled, unlike many of my other jobs. The hardest part of the job to me was the limited hours."
good,"GameStop is an amazing place to work at. The job is very fun if you have a good team around your back and if everyone is focus. the hardest thing you will have to deal with, when working at GameStop is the people as well as the constant quota you have to meet daily"
good,"GameStop was a pretty great place to work until they moved all store managers to hourly and made it no overtime. Running a store sometime takes more than 40 hours to do and the only way to do that is to clock out and work off the clock. Great culture, great free stuff, great conference but not worth is overall"
good,GameStop has a easy going laid back working environment. The employees are great to get along with and helpful with any questions you may have. Friendly and caring.
good,A position at GameStop is based around two things: Pre-orders and Subscriptions. Sell those all day every day to everyone who comes in. That's the key to getting hours and sticking around after the holiday season.
good,"Imagine getting to work with your friends who you get along with, but 75% of the people who come in disrespect your female coworkers, writes you off as a dumb kid, and majority of them try to convince you they are the best of the best at (insert game here). Thats what its like to work at gamestop. Loved my boss, loved my coworkers, didn't really like the customers that we got. It wasn't every customer but it was still pretty bad."
good,"Great movement possibilities in the company, but it may take sometime since many of the managers tend to stay for decades. The managers, district down, generally are supportive and give great guidelines to adhere to. If you're an assistant manager, you are usually given the reins to develop you team, business plans, payroll management and more. You are expected to be proactive. If you are, you will excel. However, the upper management and CEO's are a bit disconnected from the store fronts and do not really understand what the demands of the customers and their employees are."
good,"Fun place to work with good people. Higher ups can be sticks in the mud. Competitive with reserves and subscriptions. Pay rate isn't wonderful. Yes, it's great for a 19 year old kid living at home with mom and dad making 8.50 for a key holder position, but it's better when you get to Assistant Manager. At least it's double digit pay. Discount, hooray! It's only 15% off of games and accessories. Dealt with reps of Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo. That meant FREE STUFF!!!!! Overall, super fun work environment if you don't have a vindictive manager."
good,"The company itself does not really care for its employees. They promise some things then in return do something completely different. Ex. They will say that there is a B2G1( Buy 2 Get 1) sale coming the following week and encourage everyone to promote it. Then once the week turns around they change their mind and do not do it. Normally this would not be an issue but by the time this occurs the customer base already has the idea set that this sale is going to happen and when it doesn't you become the liar. This, in turn, hurts your reputation and sales since the job is entirely based on giving someone your opinion about a product and they take your word for it based on your reputation, past experiences, and personality."
good,"Customer service is the number one priority, however there is always another agenda to sell specific KPI items to the customer (this is always the case with any corporate retail company), however the vast majority of employee success applies to these metrics and overshadows the many other aspects of job performance."
good,"It's a great part-time job for a student but not as a livable job the starting pay for a game advisor in fl is $8 and thats with long term customer service experience, unrealistic weekly goals. But in the least my manager was a very great store manager, very knowledgeable and taught me a thing or two so no regrets working with them just wish I knew the pay before I started other than that not a bad work experience"
good,"Had a manager that not only became my favorite manager in my life, but he went above and beyond to do what he could, to help. With his hands tied and getting into trouble with his own manager. The only real issues with this place is during their ""off season"", is how they like to put it. You can only get a max of 18 hours a week and that's pushing the max hours. During the holidays however you can get over 40 but the manager will get into trouble for allowing it."
good,"An easy place to work at if you are starting out looking for a job. Pay is non existent unless you have absolutely no bills. The days can be extremely long and boring, but if you love video games its the place to be."
good,"I absolutely love working at GameStop. I love the culture and the people who come in, and I love the people I work with. However, I've been working very hard for a promotion, and even if I get promoted, I won't be making enough money."
good,"I started there as a seasonal employee, was kept and them promoting to Senior Game Adviser about 6 months later. It's pretty easy to move up in the company, which is great for gaining management experience. The setting was pretty chill and I always loved my coworkers. You got to know a lot of people even working in surrounding stores. Being a woman in the industry can be tough because male customers don't take you seriously or hit on you. Customers in general were really difficult for stupid reasons sometimes, but that's not GameStop fault (not all the time anyway). The company tries to add on too many new things, like selling Cricket in the stores. It gets too complicated. Managers also have a lot of things they have to get done daily and a lot of responsibilities. I didn't hate working there by any means, but I'm glad I don't have to deal with new company policies or the customers there anymore."
good,"I would be greeted by all my co-workers, my manager would inform me on my daily tasks, the promotions hat were being ran, 15-30min break. The hard part of the job would have to be organizing video game cases in alphabetical order, and the most enjoyable part of the job would be working with people that like videos as much as i do."
good,"Gamestop, for me, was not a good workplace. I can't say how anyone else feels or felt about working at a Gamestop. But my experience left me with a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. If you apply and get hired, be prepared to learn how to become the best salesperson you can possibly be. Gamestop tracks the number of membership cards each store and each associate sells. This can be good and bad but mostly bad when an associate has sold the least amount of cards in the store and their job becomes threatened because their numbers aren't quite up to par with the standard. The people you work with are amazing and unique and great. Managers are always very understanding and fellow associates are great fun. The only problem is you feel very disconnected the higher up the Gamestop food chain you go. District managers and regional managers hardly ever spoke to myself or other associates and only ever spoke with the managers. Not saying this is a completely negative thing, but it definitely made the us little guys feel even smaller at times. If you like video games and if you like selling merchandise regarding those games and don't mind putting in the extra effort, then Gamestop is the place for you."
good,"Job is 100% supposed to revolve around the customer.  It is a very goal oriented and number driven industry.  The best part about the job is the people you work with. I have worked here almost 10 years and all my best friend were or still are employees.  The hardest part of the job is that the company demands almost an unfair amount from you.  Payroll is always a constant issue, and most of your job as a manager is time management and making sure everything gets done.  Its a constant balancing act.  Very challenging as a store manager, not as much ASM, SGA, or GA levels."
good,"I worked there as a seasonal employee and was kept on as a part time employee after the holiday ended. I was always getting shifts gave to me by other employees and worked my hardest, unfortunately, thew whole year I was there I was given only 1 employee review by a manager who was only there for a week then left, and I never got any pay bumps. I always stayed at minimum wage."
good,"I luckily was one of the many applicants who got a job at GameStop. Typical day at work went by solidly. Most of the time I was being trained and learned many new things. The Management and Co-workers I worked with were all nice, fun and cool. However, the hours were awful. I worked not so much because they already had many workers. On non special days like holidays, only 2-4 people were working. Not a great job at all when it comes to trying to make money, but as a side job I highly recommend."
good,GameStop was an enjoyable place to work and it still has the potential to be. But upper management (above District Leader) is delusional as to what actually happens in stores and just expects us to print money.
good,"long stand still days for the most part untill it got busy"
good,"Decent job for anyone new to retail. You will learn a little bit of everything necessary for a career in retail. A little bit of performance (sales, incentives), marketing, and business operations."
good,Being a Game Advisor at Gamestop was my first experience in customer service. I learned a lot about how to satisfy a customer's needs and give great service on a daily basis. The environment is very real as everyone I worked with enjoyed playing video games and reading up about new products to sell.
good,Its a great atmosphere for anyone who can appreciate video games. The culture and diversity among the people is inspiring.
good,"Working with GameStop is great at times. The co-workers and customers make it worth it. Unfortunately, the pay and treatment of management is on the lower side. We're given unrealistic goals to reach in an unrealistic time frame and it puts on way more stress than need be."
good,"Exciting place to work if video games interest you.  Learning the basic characteristics of the different types of games was the most important, yet difficult aspect of the job."
good,"Gamestop was a fun and easy job to work at. Coworkers were nice and the job wasn't that hard at all. The problem lied within the companies terrible policies and practices, along with the upper management like the district managers. They are often people who don't even know the first thing about games or gaming and are obsessed with money, money, money. A typical work day depends on what your job is. If your a seasonal you'll just go around the store asking questions, providing game advice, and organizing the shelves. If you're a game advisor you have all the previous assignments plus you will be manning the register, gutting and putting games away, returns, trade-ins, and stickering products. Store managers though I was not one, often had a lot more tasks and earned only fifty cents more than the average worker."
good,"I loved working there but as far as being taken seriously by upper management, GOOD LUCK! The district manager is so over worked you hardly ever get a chance to meet her."
good,As an assistant manager at Gamestop I have a lot of fun and really enjoy the environment and day to day work. It's an easy place to manage and my coworkers are great! The only two downsides are the pay and corporate. I definitely cannot support myself as an assistant manager and corporate will not hear you out when it comes to a raise.
good,"I've worked at Gamestop for almost 3 years this coming October (2016), and in the past three years, I've gotten two raises and a promotion! But yet I'm making $8.75 an hour. I have been working here since I had turned 16 and since then I've been through two holiday seasons and worked my butt off for the ""Company"" (A.K.A. my store). Management is great, and sometimes not. This being that I've had 4 different managers in the three years I've worked there due to relocation or being offered higher paying jobs. At first, it was all about numbers and pure profit. Then for about a year the only objective was customer service. Then the next year it is all about numbers again. The company is always coming up with new plans (schemes) to get people to sell their stuff to them and then spend as much money as possible in the store. Which is just retail. The hours are awful, I can barely make a living off it. One week, it will be 20 hours, the next, it'll be 7, the next it'll be 35, and so on.. Hours are dependent on how much money the store makes per week, so if you're in a dead part of town, expect almost no work and being yelled at by corporate. Although, I have made some great friends while working there, which is the best thing to come out of this job."
good,"Was only a seasonal guy and was hoping to get hired afterwards, but I wasnt so lucky. Good seasonal job its when the new xbox and playstation came out."
good,"Working at Gamestop is alright. Not that much hours for associates (10-12 hour a week) Have to make your numbers. GPG sales, Pre-orders and the iPad."
good,Opportunity to engage guests face-to-face and create solutions for each one. Not commission based. I learned that treating a guest like a member of the family lead to an increase in return visits.
good,Working for GameStop is a fun working environment but for the hours required and the pay given wasn't exactly of the same worth. Personalities of the management varied so drastically that it was like working under a different boss each shift. Now from what i hear now the managers that were there before aren't anymore.
good,"Like most specialty retailers, GameStop prides themselves on adjusting to the need quickly and being able to change in a very dynamic environment.  It provides a good quality of life for its employees and allows for decent work life balance."
good,"In my time at Gamestop I had a chance to work on my organizational skills and assisting customers, which was great. The management was excellent and the workplace was friendly, but being a seasonal associate I had barely gotten hours and the pay rate was absolute minimum. Almost all associates hired for seasonal work were let go afterwords as they did not have enough hours to keep more than one or two people."
good,"GameStop is a fun place to work. The work is not difficult, requires alphabetizing shelves and use of GameStop computer system for item look up and customer check out. Local management is nice and tries to get hours for all employees. However GameStop Corporate assigns the number of hours that managers are allowed to schedule which limits the number of hours Employees are able to get. The hardest part of working at GameStop was the lack of hours. The job was overall enjoyable and would work for GameStop again if I could be guaranteed a minimun of so many hours per week."
good,"Flexible hours, good training available to learn in business side of retail sales. but upper management is a bit of a pipe dream. the job itself can be fun, but it really depends on the neighborhood you work in. Trades are time consuming. Hours can run late. employees can be great or terrible, depending on your manager and who gets hired. beware of fraud and theft attempts from employees."
good,"Days at GameStop were consisting of constant inventory. Counting, cleaning the store, and helping customers. This is expected from any sort of retail job."
good,"As video games grow as digital content, dedicated video game stores are struggling. GameStop has tried to adapt, but still pushes numbers and sales expectations on lower level associates. "
good,"Typical small box retail environment. Fun place to work, even better if you like video games. Hardest part of the job was having to deal with excessive payroll cuts so there was never enough time to get the work done the right way."
good,"I have always gotten along with teammates and managers, recognition is usually given where it is deserved, it is hard to keep work separate from home life when you are a manager."
good,"Great place to work in, coworkers are always friendly and have an awesome energy. Really great work enviroment, the days go by so fast and it was always a blast to work there."
good,"Long hours, not enough staff, lots of expected goals, good pay.This job can and will wear you down, but for those who are single gamers with no families, this job is for you."
good,"Was a great job when I was still in school the flexible hours really helped"
good,"It's just a typical retail job. A booming digital game industry has the higher ups wanting to expand their business. One such expansion was their acquisition of a certain mobile service. I was fine with us offering the service, but for us to actively sell the products without commission was it for me."
good,Nice company to work for.  Pay is low but good atmosphere. coworkers are nice and management is easy yo get along with. It is a retail company so pay and benefits are typical.
good,Assisting customers with their purchase and balancing out the registers is a typical day of work along with resolving any and all customer issues.
good,"Out of all the places I've worked I enjoyed working at Gamestop the best.  If you enjoy video gaming than this is the job for you, especially for a first time job.  The pay for store managers and above are actually pretty good for retail.  However, for anybody that is below store manager level the pay is extremely poor.  "
good,My time with gamestop was an experience I will never forget. It taught me to better myself at work and always make the customer number one.
good,A typical day consists of having to open unpleasant emails communicating displeasure from the preceding shift. Usually there is a change made by upper management or corporate while not a single word had been communicated to the ones the change affects the most. The hardest part is the lack of communication and the seeming indifference of upper management of the concerns of the associates. The most enjoyable part are my coworkers because there are people with incredible personalities from many backgrounds and parts of the world.
good,"Me gusto este trabajo porque distaba de lo que había echo hasta la fecha. Comenzar desde abajo y terminar desplazándote a los comercios y fabricar de la nada, desde los tochos una sala insonorizada resulto reconfortante en esos momentos de mi vida."
good,"Work was simple and easily carried out, nothing too taxing (sometimes incredibly boring). My co-workers were the best part about the job by far. We were all the same age, had the same interests and we all just got along really well. This made going in for work much easier. The same could be said about my managers, they were all young and interested in the same things as the rest of the staff. Thus being said, the most enjoyable part of the job was being with co-workers. "
good,Working here is a blast sometimes as it feels like it is a place where you can go to have fun with the customers and show them what other things they would like. My stores team try to make each and every costumer feel like they can always come back and be welcomed to hang out and just talk to us about games and other things. I have learned so far to always be quicker on my feet and to quickly memorize where items and things go and to keep things in a neat and aligned order. Management is great as it provides fair work hours for people who have just started and those who are further experienced. The hardest part in this job would probably be trying to keep up and work fast to get what the customer needs as you search through libraries of pre-owned and new games.
good,"The manager and team were great! However the customers and environment were less than welcoming and enjoyable. It was nice to help people find the appropriate game for the their needs, but it wasn't very rewarding or an appreciative job. All in all, it was a great experience to learn, but not where I wanted my career to go."
good,Work environment varies from store to store. High focus on sales and membership subscriptions. Expectation of product knowledge without proper training.
good,My time with the company of Gamestop was an amazing experience. It taught me a lot coming into the work field today. It was my first job so it was amazing starting off but for those who see themselves excelling to greater heights Gamestop is not a career its a great Career Builder.
good,It is about as relaxing as retail jobs can possibly get and has a very casual feel to it's operations as everyone is really just there to partake in a hobby or give their family members and children gifts they will enjoy. The Paper work on trades as well as organizing the store will get tedious but overall it's a very straightforward and fun job.
good,"GameStop can be a very fun place to be, being surrounded by games and systems all day long. However, the amount of people that come in, the amount of games that are traded in, it can also be incredibly difficult, and a bit hard to manage everything."
good,"This is a good place to work as an early job because it will give you a decent early job in a fairly interesting and fun environment (if your into electronics). However, you will likely only advance so far before your stuck in a rut due to the industry, management, or the particular store. I managed to rise to Third Key Manager in only a few months but moving beyond that is entirely dependant on someone else getting fired or a new store opening up ( likely at a distant location requiring you to move if you want it)."
good,"Personally my favorite job. It had a lot of customers coming and going, I got to meet a lot of different people. "
good,"it was alot of fun working there, great for teens and college students, not great if u have rent and utilites,"
good,"I worked this job seasonally during the holidays."
good,"One of my tasks i had to endure while i was a christmas temp at Gamestop was to deal with customers needs while they waited in line"
good,"For the most part, the job involved informing customers about potential games for purchase. This was a very fun and laid back atmosphere but the hours and compensation was minimal."
good,"The job is a really good one for a kid in school to make some money on the side, but not as a serious career."
good,"If you are a game advisor you will not get very many hours, but if you do well then you can move up pretty easily as a senior game advisor."
good,"I have worked with Gamestop for a couple of years now, and have advanced to a position where I am in charge. At first, I was extremely excited about the promotion, and loved everyone that I worked with. Knowing everything that you can about games, and passing that knowledge onto customers that end up really enjoying the product is very satisfying. Unfortunately, that is the only thing positive I can say about the job. The stress of the job gets overwhelming a lot more than any other job I have worked. If it is not the holidays, you will not be getting great hours, no matter how high up the ladder you are. If you cant keep up with the, what felt like weekly policy changes, you can kiss your job goodbye."
good,"Gamestop is a fun place to work at lower levels, however the more you move up, the more responsibilities you gain while still doing the grunt work.  Even as a manager you have to do all the grunt work as well as management tasks.  The corporate office will often increase goals and workload while cutting hours."
good,"If you love gamestop for the Video Games, and you want to work here for the Video Games... Then gamestop is not for you."
good,"Everyday I go into work and get to interact with new people and familiar people alike. Work is fun and consists of basically normal retail work. I enjoy talking to customers, giving suggestions and addressing customer complaints and concerns. Once I've solved a customer's problems and they leave with a smile I feel very proud of my customer service skills. My co-workers are usually managers and are very knowledgeable, so I know I can count on them if I don't know how to solve a problem. I've learned to be extremely patient with people, especially when they are upset."
good,"My employment began during the holiday season of last year (2012). At first, it was great- my co-workers and management team was friendly and helpful. The work atmosphere is pretty non-stressful, though the sales goal is pushed on all the employees (for good cause of course- I understand the business aspect of GameStop). However, I can say that it is rather difficult to advance up the managerial ladder- it seems that once you've been placed in a position, there is little you can do about it. Though this may vary depending on the store- my particular location was a bit outside of the average GameStop. Also, the hours fluctuate based on your sales, which, if you aren't a cashier, is difficult to track."
good,"Didn't have much room for advancement, hours were pretty inconsistant."
good,"A standard day involves engaging with customers in an attempt to help them identify what products they need.  Management seems to fluctuate periodically ranging from higher ups who care about their employees to those who just see them as tools.  Higher ups in the company seem to push goals which are uncontrollable, such as customers trading in games.  Despite this, the staff in each individual store seems to bond and support each other well."
good,"•	Mentoring, training, and "
good,"At first the job seemed to be everything anyone would want in a retail job.  Passionate employees surrounded by customers who all share a common interest with what you are selling. Being part of the always exciting world of video games!  I mean it was like a dream come true."
good,"a typical work day at gamestop consisted of morning inventories ,customer service was the most important aspect of our day ,staying up to date on the latest video games and gaming systems . The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting people who had a love for what they were selling and buying."
good,GameStop is a great place to work. It is very fast paces and ever changing. It can be stressful at times though. The company is very supportive but does little to truly train and develope. You have to be very self motivated in many positions with GameStop.
good,"Aside from minimum wage and poor hours, Gamestop is a very enjoyable place to work. The management is very open to ideas, friendly, and upbeat. The atmosphere is very positive. The hardest part of the job is occasionally dealing with disgruntled customers, which does not happen often. The co-workers are all about the same age and have share similar interests both during and outside of working hours."
good,"It's decent work for retail, not the best not the worst. 15 percent discount is nice for gamers."
good,It's video games. What's not to love?
good,"Good company to work for. They are very similar to the military everything is done ""by the book"" leaving no room for creativity."
good,This job is very competitive. If you enjoy friendly competition this is the job for you. if you dont like being yelled at then dont consider this job.. They set a high bar immediately upon hire and it only gets higher as you progress in this job.
good,"Working there for more than 6 months would be a horrible idea. Little room for growth, and the people you have to deal with make suicide look like Six Flags."
good,"It was fun , learned a lot about customer and clientel interactions in according to a workplace."
good,"The work was simple and didn't expend much energy. You would answer questions and handle sales. If no one was there you cleaned or reorganized the walls of games. If there was nothing else to do, though unlikely, you just stood there and talked games or life with your co-workers. Lax and relatively care free. Gamer's paradise. The only issue is that it pays minimum wage and has almost no chance for full time pay or benefits."
good,"Pretty much your standard retail job involving selling, pushing trade-ins/pre-orders, and preforming cash register duties. Co-workers made the job worthwhile but the upper management was awful and having to compete for hours while trying to shove pre orders down customers throats can be stressful."
good,"Usual day entailed upkeep normal upkeep of the store to make sure it is presentable, selling of different items, and convincing patrons to become returning customers. Very easy to love this job, especially if you have a passion for sales. Management was usually good but they revolve around a lot so it takes a while to get used to such varying personalities. Most of them were great though. The only fault is the companies tactics on helping customers can sometimes come off as harassment to them. Nevertheless if you can pull decent numbers with your own tactics the way you handle it becomes moot."
good,I started work there in high school. Very motivated and management made the days go by. The job was very simple. Customer service and sales driven.
good,I really liked working here until management started forcing us to push pre-order sales as well as magazine sales
good,Typical day consisted of manning the registers and working with customers. I enjoyed the content of the sales and working with my peers. The hardest part was dealing with ignorant and aggressive customers.
good,"Una sola regola, gli obiettivi. "
good,"I enjoyed my time at Gamestop but I would not rely on it to pay all your bills, extremely part time unless you are in management. Very inclusive work environment"
good,Not a bad place to work. You get to be around fun stuff and talk to people about their hobbys/passion. Lots of room to grow in knowledge and role. Most co workers I've had are always great as well. People who care about what they do.
good,Gamestop is a great environment and a great company to work for if its your first job as a young person to learn basic customer service skills and how to prosper in a numbers based sales environment
good,GameStop has in the past given me the opportunity to develop my own talents and to move up to a position where I feel I have the skills to benefit my current position as well as any future opportunities.
good,"If you are able to give a typical and lengthy sales pitch every customer about protection plans and pre-orders, then you should enjoy Gamestop! However, there are no sales intensives except for extra store hours."
good,Gamestop was a nice experience I had the chance to interact with people on different levels. I leaned things. I enjoyed playing games so it was nice they let us play the games in advance
good,The pay is not great and they would have inconsistent schedules. Sometimes they would call you in and sometimes they would lay you off. Really depends on the payroll. If you are a gamer and would like free collectibles and discounts on games then go for it
good,If they paid more and gave me more hours I’d gladly stay with the company. The discount is nice and I love my coworkers. It pretty hard to advance in woth the company though
good,"I worked as a General Associate and really enjoyed my job! I loved the people I worked with and the nature of my work. Unfortunately, as a part time worker, they eventually had to limit my hours to 4 hours a week and sometimes not even that. I would proceed with caution if you need a lot of hours."
good,"Ein recht entspannter Job, solange man seine Aufgaben erfüllt und sozial nicht komplett inkompetent ist."
good,"If this is a job for extra money or for a full time college student needing a little bit of money, this job is great. But if you need money for a living, this job is not the one for you. The only money here that is decent is if you make it all the way to management. On the other hand, the people are amazing, the customers are friendly, and the job is easy and enjoyable."
good,"If you are any kind of nerd or into nerd culture this place is a lot of fun to work at.  I will say, you are more of a salesman than you are a retail employee.  There is a system in place that requires you to fill certain ""quotas"".  That part is no fun, and quite frankly a hindrance.  When I was leaving though, they seemed to be working on doing away with that system.  I only made it to the Senior guest adviser position but based on what I saw, I don't think I would have wanted to go any further in the company.  Higher positions are very demanding and didn't seem worth the struggle."
good,GameStop was a great place to work until digital gaming started to take off.  Now their business model is under attack and they are attempting to transition to the new environment.  The people in the stores and the field management are great to work with and really put in effort to help people succeed.
good,"Your fellow employees could really make or break this job. Most days are spent fixing up things around the store or trying to get people to buy reward cards. Winter is the worst, I would say even more so than other stores. Some transactions can take a very long time (returns and trade-ins) which makes customers very rowdy."
good,If you're looking for full time work then its probably not for you. The only full time employees are Store Leaders and Assistant Store Leaders. That being said management is always great and they do actually care about their employees. Culture is nice and the environment is very relaxed and friendly. Who doesn't want to talk about video games all day? Advancement is promised but not really followed up with. I was promised a promotion twice and was passed over by less qualified people
good,I learned to lead and train multiple employees at my time here which really helped my personal advancement in being able to learn from while also training my fellow employees.
good,"This is by far the easiest job I’ve ever had. It’s also the lowest paying job I’ve ever had. The responsibilities are minimal, the customers are mostly fun and laid back. The atmosphere is super chill, co-workers are pretty chill too. I’ve never had any issues getting the time off requested"
good,"The job is a retail job. That should say enough, but the time I was there it was ok and paid the bills. I would recommend this company for a friend that needs a quick job."
good,"I learned how to manage a store and respect me employ's, how to pull and stock inventory. I learned how to work as a team it was a changeling experience."
good,Very fun place but stressful upper management is very dated the selling culture isnt very good with this time in video games and the amount if work we have to do doesn't match with pay
good,"It's not a company that is built for its employees. The CEOs of GameStop have most likely never worked in retail so they've never had experience in meeting ridiculous sales goals in impossible measures of time. "
good,Started off at a lower level key holder and then advanced within a few months. My management team was always up to speed whenever i needed them and my training manager was always there when i needed them.
good,"gamestop is a great place to work at fresh out of highschool, if your sales a great you can get promoted, the pay is rather low however and for starting jobs the hours are not that great."
good,The management was understanding toward the seasonal employees. The sales environment was flexible and employees were expected to take initiative to help customers.
good,Only worked here seasonal. Now I got to say this is a company that is going bankrupt and needs help to stay around I suggest to people still that you get a Pro-Account at Game Stop to keep them in business. I love video games and think that stores like this deserve more love theses days.
good,This is an excellent job for someone wanting to get their feet wet in the retail business.  They can work with anyone on schedules and willing to help them advance in the company if desired.
good,Wasn't really anything exciting for me. Its like your everyday retail store with games and electronic devices. Coworkers can be kind of annoying when they try to one up their video game knowledge on you and others.
good,staff is friendly to work with and fun to talk about video games with as well as customers but hard to get hours unless youre in a higher position. would recommend if your goal is to grow in this company.
good,"Since moving to this state I've experienced quite a lot. When I arrived as an seasonal never knew where it would go but confident it would get somewhere at the end I received raises, promotions, and managerial experience that brought with me from my time there."
good,It is a great place to work but since the business is having a hard time staying afoot the culture has suffered for it. I did love working there though I just wish I made more money so that I can live comfortably with it but that's retail I guess.
good,"I was young when I first started working. I learned alot when it came to video game & product knowledge, but when it came down to actual business inquiry, it wasn't exactly what I hoped for. Consistently  pushing sales on customers, who originally cant afford the product to begin with. All the company cared about was numbers, & not customer satisfactory"
good,"Running the store and 90% of the customer’s is cool. "
good,"If you have a passion for games, work for them, if not then dont. I love fighting game and Tournament Culture. Im neutral not supporting either side of an argument, fight, war, etc. Not supporting one political view over another not connected with either side involved in a war, contest. I loved working for them, hope to work again in the future."
good,"It's a very laid back job. The only time it really picks up is during midnight releases of big releases, or holidays. The only thing I can think of that was bad was just the practices the corporation has done and still does."
good,My typical day at work consisted of accomplishing goal set forth via Territory Manager which was great to have said goal yet Territory Manager was VERY hands off and did not provide feedback or direction needed.
good,"I worked during the winter season of 2013, during that time I had the privilege of working all available shifts switch including opening, midshift, and closing. I was also given the opportunity to experience working intense holidays such as black Friday and Christmas Eve. Most works days consisted of greeting customers, answering any questions they had, organizing products around the store, during closing shift vacuum and take out any trash bags."
good,It is a pretty enjoyable job very laid back because it doesn't get busy as much at this store but the pay is pretty bad but the work space is very great to be around.
good,"Let's be real most people who go into Gamestop are either dedicated gamers, casual gamers, or parents/grandparents looking for that new game their child wanted. Working there was a joy, even if it was a seasonal job."
good,My first high school job. I took it in the summer and was paid 12 dollars an hours up to 80 hours. I took this to help with family. It was a nice first job.
good,Gamestop is a job where you need to post good results but when you do it doesn’t help you personally in any way shape or form. I’ve been working there for 4 years now and am still only getting paid $9.39 per hour as a keyholder I love my team but the micromanaging is tough.
good,"While they do provide a decent level of compensation, there are many aspects to the company that seem to not take the customers best interests into account and are borderline deceitful."
good,A Typical day at work is assist customers and organize games and clean. Management depends but the pressure of corporate is a lot. There isn't a sense of freedom.
good,"A typical day at GameStop was pretty routine. Work in register for a bit and when the store was mostly empty to work the floors and shelves and make sure everything is where its supposed to be and make sure the store is clean and organized. I learned most of my register experience while are GameStop. My managers were really cool and fun to be around. The workplace atmosphere and culture was very relaxed but at the same time we know we had a job to do and made sure we did it every night. The hardest part of the job some times was that it could get pretty boring and repetitive at times. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co workers, they made it really fun. Overall I really enjoyed my time at GameStop."
good,"Like I said you will only make real money if you are a manager. Once a manager how ever you will be salaried and no longer hourly. That's important to know because you will not be given enough pay roll hours for your staff so you will often find yourself working 50-60 hour weeks just to get the bare minimum done."
good,"It was a fun place to work until I actually had to deal with customers because I was a girl; the shoppers frequently looked down on me and didn't trust my advice on games or recommendations. I really didn't learn much and my typical day was spent handing out fliers for the holiday sales or checking the shelves to make sure they were in order. I wasn't frequently on the register for some unknown reason other than that I wasn't ""experienced"" with holiday even though I had run the register before. Management was alright, my boss at the time was great and very approachable. The hardest part though was customers not trusting what I was telling them due to my gender and even my coworkers almost looked down on me for my gender too. The only enjoyable part at the time was the discount, getting to see my friends who visited me at work, and getting to use the store like it's a library."
good,"Il turno lavorativo come tirocinante era di 6/7 ore, solitamente dalle ore 13.00 alle 19.00/20.00, tuttavia per l'affluenza costante di clienti e le attività di chiusura cassa e di riordino del locale, questo termine non era mai rispettato e quasi con cadenza giornaliera mi ritrovavo a chiudere insieme al responsabile alle 21.30."
good,A typical day at work was to provide customers with an enjoyable experience among the gamming community . What I learned was that although management wasn't the easist to work with it didnt effect how much i enjoyed working there and how everyday gave me a positive outlook on life and would love to work in that environment again
good,Being surrounded by games and assisting customers with game related topics was always a fun experience. You mostly organize the walls and drawers if messy and inform customers of current deals and promotions.
good,"Great place to work , upper management was incompetent in AZ , found more hands on leaders in TX . Lots of selling .They pay boys more than girls . no room to grow, can hire whoever if you are a manager . lots of micro managing"
good,"Working for GameStop is a lot of fun until you start getting to the positions that require a lot of responsibility (Assistant Store Leader+). A lot is expected of you while you're not provided with the hours to do what's expected, so working off the clock (while officially is something you should 100% not do) is something that's almost required."
good,Collectables Buying managers and seniors have zero experience and are simply managers because of seniority in the company.   No direction or drive to work there. Most of upper Management have never worked for any reputable company prior which leaves not much experience in the organization. Senior buyers & leaders   lack the skills and experience for a new employee to learn or be challenged. They do not follow traditional buying procedures and purchase product blindly and irresponsibly. Not a healthy work environment to be in!
good,"Its a very laid back place to work, which can get boring from time to time but at least the people you work with seem cool and the work environment is cool too."
good,Dealing with drug addicts selling their neighbors property on an hourly basis can take a tole on you. Pay does not scale from district managers to store managers etc. Upper management makes insane money and anyone store level gets the short end.
good,"Gamestop was a good starting place for me coming into the working world, I would recommend anyone whos wanting a laid back semi-competitive type job to apply here or to try and get a job here or something similar to the work felid that this provides."
good,"I would recommend this company for anyone just starting into the workforce or even looking for quick advancement into management positions. I would be cautious about a long term career however, as we continue to move into the digital age the relevancy of this company will continue to decline unless they find ways to acclimate to the digital age."
good,"what u see is what u get. theres really not much in regards to gamestop, its a fun job but if ur not a manager ur not gonna make much or get many hours aside from holiday times. dont bank on it to cover the bills."
good,"There's not much worth to say about it's job, it's retail and nice to have access to games and talk about games when you're a nerd yourself but our head manager always pressured to end conversations faster even though they were paying customers."
good,"Great place to meet new people and learn about games and gaming culture, but compensation for store leaders is not enough to equate stress caused by job."
good,"I wish they would've offered more hours as a seasonal, it was really exciting being an asset to this company. I learned a lot of different skills but like I stated before, i wish they would've offered more hours for Seasonal positions. If you have a strong passion for assisting people with great customer service as well as technology, GameStop is a good place to work at."
good,"Gamestop is a fast pace environment due to inconsistent guest flow depending on the season. Aside from helping guests enjoyably through common interest, on slower days there are multiple tasks on a daily/weekly basis that needs to be completed. Sometimes working gets hard and tasks get held back due to inconsistent foot traffic. Trying to complete tasks and focusing 100% on guest with a high sales goal expectation following through, makes you plan out and think through everything in a timely manner to avoid stress. But the most enjoyable part in working at Gamestop is having to speak to guests and enjoy common hobbies, ensuring that guests get everything they need."
good,Learned a lot in my short time with the company. Developed more customer service and communication skills while working here. Pretty good job if I wasn't seasonal (and was told I got hired afterwards). Good discounts also.
good,It’s a great jobs if u love video games  you can just sit and talk to people about their  and your passion for video games and sell them everything need just wasent a lot of good hours for seasonal people
good,"Can be a fun place to work with the right group of people. The pay is nothing to brag about and the company doesn't often reward good performance, but always punishes for poor performance."
good,"typical day is pretty laid back and easy to manage during slower months, but stressful and lackluster in season months. Co-workers generally are pleasant to be around with some being unhappy to be at their job because of just working there too long. Management is hit and miss, some being overly serious about their job, while others are gentle handed and genuinely care about their employee's happiness. "
good,Typically you would expect to deal with you regular gamers / nerds which you would expect to find at a Gamestop location. As an assistant manager I was required to make the weekly schedule and make sure things are in stock and that the stock was accurate. Breaks were non existent and hours were never consistent due to the fact they cut them by the week. Policies seem rather strict for a game store but at the end of the day its a retail company.
good,"If you're looking to get retail sales experience and perhaps management, this is a great place to start. There are a ton of ways to advance and many different things to learn about not just Gamestop but business in general."
good,"Due to the fact i was the only girl there, the guys were great to me. No pressure what so ever. I did my own thing in which i felt more comfortable, since i really didn't know anything about video games. It was good and fun experience."
good,"-- A typical day was stocking, viewing emails, setting up the store for promotions, open and close the store, typical manager stuff."
good,"I worked at GameStop for a short while, at least on paper. In reality, I had one shift during the time I was employed, I wasn't even a bad employee, but with GameStop, they care more about how many memberships you can sell to customers, during a shift. As a new guy, they still expect you to do as much as everyone else. How can you even expect me to do that if I'm still learning how to use the register. The people who work there are nice, its really just higher up the ladder that screws you. They give the store leader only a few hours to let people work, and they basically go to veteran employees first. You basically have to keep asking for hours or you won't get any and will eventually be removed from the system."
good,Great for high school kids or if you just need a part time job. If you can move up the ladder it may be worth it. If you love video games and talking about them it's great. You still need to meet goals and be a people person.
good,"Show up, learn what's new, what sales, interact with numerous, various guests, sell entertainment."
good,"Overall Gamestop is an extremely fun place to work but offers little in the departments of pay, benefits, and advancement.  Only Store mangers get fulltime hours (40+) all other employees are part time and do not receive a reliable schedule."
good,"I have been a gamer for as long as I can remember and GameStop was the dream. It took a long time to finally get in but once I did it was fun. They pay isn't great as a base level employee, but it was a labor of love. I gave 4 years to the company and for the first three i believed in the company and the direction it was moving in. The last year I have become a bitdisenchanted, the company has relaunched it's notorious ferver for chasing numbers and not paying attention to it's hard working employees and promoting people that weren't ready. This has lead to a giant gap in competent leadership. Over all if you just want to work there as an independent contributor or low level management I'd say go for it, assistant and up is super political and less enjoyable."
good,i worked at every store in r.i. and depending on the town the store was in set the pace for a very slow slow day or a non stop day of running around if a store was in a mall.
good,Pretty easy place to come to and just get the day done with.  Same thing usually seems really repetitive but with the cool atmosphere it made it able to stand.
good,It was a different experience and it help me to grow my skill. They showed me how to me sell and help people out by showing them the right game. i love my job there.
good,An enjoyable place to work with laid back management for your store. Only complaint is they expected you to push their credit cards and warranties like you're job depended on it.
good,"As a college student, I really appreciated the flexibility I have there. It's always a welcoming and fun environment. The people higher on the chain are also nice and visible for questions and things like that."
good,when i use to work there it was awesome just the manager didnt really....manage anything i wish he helped alittle bit more and also never really gave me hours but the job when i was called in was pretty good specially since i loved shopping there and love video games
good,"Overall team at the time was great to work with, treatment of female employees by certain staff and customers was the biggest turn off of the job. The pressure for resell, turn in rates, was high even if you only work one day a week."
good,"Just like any other retail job, Gamestop has a lot of personal interaction. However, on slow days, you'll find yourself doing alphabetizing, lots of it. Since it is a specialized retail, you'll get to talk about a lot of things you love with other like minded people. But the hardest part is keeping up with the requirements set by your superiors."
good,"I quite enjoy the job, i get to talk to guests about anything gaming and even other things sometimes. To be honest if i could do that and only that every shift I'd more than being willing and happy to."
good,"GameStop cares about their employees, but only if you have a good manager. Bad people tend to get into manager positions, and if you are stuck with one it will not be fun at all. If you are a gamer, the employee discount is helpful, but corporate makes a point that it doesn't stack with coupons, reward point discounts, etc, that regular customers would get anything."
good,This is a fun company to work for but unless you are a manager or the store leader you will only work about once a week. They are awful at distributing hours to their employees.
good,"After 16 years with Gamestop, I learned many things about the company and the industry. For the most part, I really enjoyed my time with Gamestop and thought is was a good company to work for. The biggest problem was all the double standards and fraud to make numbers look better than they were. Pressure from top down asked for better numbers and this caused fraud and number padding from stores to district managers as long as corporate didn't find out."
good,GameStop is a small to mid-size video game retailer that has a subscription base discount along with it's used games selection. The company benefits and 401k options make the lack of work life balance more tolerable. All in all love this industry to put up with some of the charades.    <3 <3 <3
good,"Overall, being a part of the company has many perks. As a manager we have a yearly conference that is located in California or Las Vegas where we get advanced knowledge & testing of everything coming out in the year. The benefits offered to full time employees are really fantastic too. "
good,A typical day at work consist of moving around a lot restocking shelves and just really helping out a customer that needs assistant. The most enjoyable part of this job was learning the consoles and the games coming out for them.
good,All of my managers were great.  The company likes to change how the job works a lot so you have to be on your toes and grit your teeth a lot
good,All of my managers were great.  The company likes to change how the job works a lot so you have to be on your toes and grit your teeth a lot
good,typical work day is slow. Learned new customer skills. Management was pretty good. Co workers were ok. No hard parts about the job. Best part was being around people who like the same things you like.
good,Meeting new people was always a bonus especially if you are yourself a person who buys video games. Working at GameStop was nice for a little while because of the new experience.
good,"I worked at a gamestop inside of a mall. Typical daily duties included ringing up customers, giving advice on games,computer software or hardware, and video game systems, cleaning the store, re-arranging display cases, and answering customer calls and complaints."
good,"The employees are all great, good management as well. Fast paced, a lot to know. Very professional people. Good discounts. Enjoyed selling to enthusiastic customers, those who like gaming as much as I."
good,"Most of my workdays included stocking the shelves and advising customers on what product they're looking for. The management was minimal but good. The co-workers were friendly and helpful, I really enjoyed the video game culture as a whole."
good,"A typical day at game stop. you would go in 1 hour early before the store opens and do a mini inventory count of all systems. its known as a system check. Also you get shipments from UPS so you would also have to add them into the inventory. and store them properly.  during the course of the day you would also have to add any price changes to certain items or devices as it happens. Helping customers and going above and beyond is what game stop strives for."
good,"GameStop is constantly changing to make sure it stays relevant in the new market swing, digital media. We are updated frequently about new games and gadgets, that sometimes it can be an overload. You have to so many sales to remember, and projects to represent in a quick minutes notices with no help it can be frustrating because you have no help and already doing 2 projects currently for your DM and your RM needs another done immediately. Working for GameStop can be fun because of all the characters working there so you're never bored or standing around doing nothing."
good,Although the environment was fun and the job was definitely worth the pay the constant changes from corporate made it hard to build a familiar customer base as we were always losing our most valuable flavors.
good,"Has reasonable hours so it doesn't cut into most work/life balances."
good,"Unless your in college and need a flexible job, gamestop is not it. The company doesn't supply the store with enough hours to make a decent living. Most if not all the benefits are for full times regardless of how you've worked with the company."
good,"good work experince, fun, outgoing a lot of different people that all love video games and the up and rising consoles good vibes"
good,"Work environment was great. Working habits also solid, just the management was the only issue. Very contradicting behavior"
good,"I love working at GameStop. If they paid me a competitive salary for everything I am responsible for I wouldn't consider leaving. However, a typical day at work consists of a daunting amount of tasks. Mind you, I make less than a teacher for everything listed below. At the start of my day I have to check for orders that have come in over night to ship directly to customers along with shipping any products requested by other stores. I also have to complete various inventory counts daily, along with completing any price-changes before open. After those are done I typically respond to any corporate correspondence and check our sales plan for the day. Based on what our projected hours are for the week at that time(it can change daily based on sales) I may add or cut hours from our weekly schedule which is made a minimum of two weeks in advance. Based on our sales plan for the day I calculate how many units we need to sell to hit our goal for the day. I also cross-reference this goal with any updated sale items to drive not only units, but future sales. Along with various video games, consoles, and hand-held console sales certain stores such as mine must hit a certain number of unit sales(recorded separately) for the phone carrier, Cricket Wireless. This includes activations, bill-pay, adding lines, etc.We also must make sure that all assigned tasks for the week get done so I will get as much done that day as possible and then delegate the more simple tasks to my associates. We also set up our own marketing kits and store refreshes which reset every three weeks. Another major part"
good,"GameStop is a great place to work, if you are part-time/ full-time. the environment is pretty friendly, the hardest part, but also the most enjoyable was alphabetizing the games. You start to hate it, but it becomes such a big part of the job that you love it as well."
good,It was a good job for the holidays and was flexible with my schedule. But after the holidays there weren't enough hours for me to get work.
good,"Fast paced, entertaining job filled with interesting people. The job has it's up and downs, but to work in a place full of something you love (video games) there is no other place like it."
good,Fun work environment. You really connect with the customers most of the time. I worked at two stores primarily at different time periods and both went through store managers a lot. Some where great people and some were just getting by. In this kind of environment it isn't hard to make a disgruntle customer leaving happy. Hardest part of the job is just keeping up with the information that's constantly changing with the gaming industry and how GameStop have many sales going on and you want to be sure every customer knows about them. The best part would be how most customers come in so eagerly to talk to you about things related to the products the purchase. I learned to treat every customer equally especially if I have never met the customer before.
good,"The environment is interesting, hearing about new video games and talking with customers is great.  The thing is that the company pushes employees to get number, heavily.  Besides looking at numbers to gauge their employees, they do talk customer satisfaction seriously which is good for the company and the consumers.  All and all, it is not a bad place to work, but if you want to work in the company as a career shot for management or higher. SGA and GA do not pay well."
good,"I got this job a bit into my college career yet by January I was out of it despite my utter desire to work. They almost never called me in, and I was let go without any notice. Apparently this is customary for seasonal work, yet all I really wanted was to earn a living or at least open the door for one."
good,"When Store Managers are able to run their Business as empowered leaders and take care of their customers the results are amazing!  The Company is still focused on metrics aside from those mentioned and in the hands of a poor supervisor the results can be chaotic and misinterpreted by Store Managers.  A lot is expected of anyone working at this Company, with success comes rewards - great perks and benefits for its employees."
good,"GameStop was my first real job after high school so i was really excited about working there. I got hired on as management so i had to learn a lot of things very fast because i was hired right before the fall were the store gets the most business. Most days consisted of helping customers, being on register and stocking products. I enjoyed this job a lot because i already had knowledge of the store and the products inside. Management was alright, the manager helped me when i needed it, but he was worried about himself more than the employees. Co-workers on the other hand were always fun to work with, but get lazy at times when is starts getting slow. The hardest part of the job was when i was by myself for long periods of time and the store gets to busy. I get the job done, but it takes me a little bit longer than usual. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers because i got to engage with them about the products we sold because i had a large passion for them."
good,"This job is most definitely on the easier end. Set business hours. You can usually tell when people are going to come in. Easy to get into a routine. Only about a handful or two of people on staff, unless it's during the holiday season. Work load is pretty minimal and/or easy. Rarely open late unless there's a midnight release for a specific game. No heavy lifting. Management works with your schedule as much as they can while having few people on staff. Customer service is the number one focus."
good,"Charged with supply chain management, daily operational procedure, customer interface, and revenue transcription, end – of –day working procedures including closing and locking the store. I learned all aspects of retail, including keeping stock of items, using a cash register, interacting with customers and many more. Management and co-workers, although sometimes hard on new employees are very helpful and friendly when it comes to the learning process. The hardest part of the job was not knowing how to react when I could not answer a customer's question. Everything else was very enjoyable."
good,"Great place to work if you enjoy talking and getting to know your customer. A typical work day consists of counting standard daily inventory items will prepping the store before you open. Greeting and engaging guests are you main focus and finding them the items they are looking for. As a manger you set daily sales plans for your team. Goals run on a daily to weekly sales plan and we all work to hit are individual goal and store goal whether you work 3 hours or 40 hours for the week. The hardest part of the job and its not all the time, Is the work load that can be given to you at a moments notice And you still have to actively assist your customers but still complete your tasks by a set date, customers always come first . The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know your customers and its what has kept me there the longest and helped me enjoy my job that much more."
good,"All'interno di una giornata lavorativa vengono svolte più attività."
good,The environment was a positive one as were the co-workers.  The only problem I ran into was management.  There was a vastly unequal distribution of work hours amongst the employees.  On average some of the seasonal hires were only working 3-5 hours a week while others were working 10-15 despite having the same availability.
good,"Depending on the DM you get, you can really enjoy your job here. You don't get to make many of your own choices tho. You're really like a robot during the day, asking every single customer the same questioned every single day! If you like games tho, the customers make the job worth it...along with the annual game conferences and free swag! I'd go back."
good,"My co-workers are all awesome and down to Earth. This is honestly, the easiest job I've ever had. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is interacting with the customers about stuff that I'm passionate about. I like working here, my only complaint is that the hours are nonexistent. I might as well not be working here."
good,A day of work at GameStop is very fun considering the culture of the job and video gaming. A great job if you're going to school and need a part time job. Flexible part time work schedule Co Workers work together.
good,"The job is amazing. Working with people, helping them acquire what they are wanting. Pay is low. I am assistant manager making 9.50 an hour. They never have hours available outside of the holidays. Being a third key I have had 2 shifts in the last 5 weeks."
good,"Typical day at work involved organizing shelves, meeting and greeting customers and ensuring they were taken care of from entrance to exit."
good,"For most gamers, it feels like working in a toystore! There are lots of interesting regular customers who like to come in and chat about games, and even one-time customers will often want advice and information about games, so if you'd ever dreamed about a job where your video game knowledge and enthusiasm would come into play, this is perfect!"
good,"I enjoyed my job at GameStop. The customers and coworkers were all wonderful to be associated with. The company switched its focus to a more sales focused drive, but the district I transferred to was still focused on a past method. Peppering the customers with a lot of different add-on sales is fine, but if you didn't reach the district standard then you were looked down upon. It wasn't that having a goal is hard, it was that the goals weren't always obtainable. Especially when you have a great week and you are still told it wasn't good enough. "
good,There was no such thing as a typical day at work. Every day was different presenting new challenges and new experiences to have. I learned that every customer has specific needs and they have different interests. It was also learned that there is an age demographic between different product sold. Management was great and I found that they truly cared about their employee's well being; doing anything to make their employee's happy. My co-workers were very attentive and supportive. It was a great atmosphere to be involved in. Since we were a gaming store typically our customers and my co-workers were very laid back individuals. The hardest part of the job was the trading in of IPhones. They tend to glitch on occasion and three months after taking them in they can come back as a flagged(stolen) phone. It's impossible to even know if the phone you are taking is stolen until someone reports it; your responsible and receive a written warning (or termination) if this occurs making this very stressful. The most enjoyable part of this occupation was being able to identify with customers. Watching them leave the store with a smile on their face and being able to provide enough product information for suggestive selling was great. A development of trust was key and my customers trust in me was very important.
good,Disbursing products from one location to the next on a walkie lift; using a RF scanner to find locations of products.
good,"Working a Game stop you gain knowledge of how to approach a costumer and how to make them feel welcome in the store. as well as selling, receiving,and taking shipment. and maintaining a clean work environment."
good,"Maintained accurate records of store's daily earnings, cash control, labor and Marketing plans. Motivated, trained and supported employee work efforts and ethics. Also providing excellent customer care."
good,"A very busy work environment with several forms of behaviors that are implemented into the workers. Assuming pre-owned, Reservations, Power Up Rewards Cards ,getting good surveys etc. Doing standard scheduled counts, checking shipment monitoring    P& L reports, scheduling, putting up marketing, and more. Definitely learned a better perspective of management and how it can be impacted and how important the behaviors of your workers directly effect the business."
good,"My day first starts off by taking the deposit to the Bank, then the Inventory Count and finally opening up the Store. I inform Guests about current deals that Gamestop is running and manage any form of complaints my Co Workers and Guest if any were to arise."
good,"I only worked here seasonally, but it was a decent job. My co-workers were always really cool and the manager was very accommodating. I was over qualified for this position, but I was happy to have any job at the time. Overall a good place to be."
good,"A thrilling experience time there was so fast, and  informational.  but never a day of boredom. always did something."
good,"A typical day at work entails cleaning and organizing the storefront, ringing up customers and trying to assist them to the best of my ability in finding what they are looking for or something they don't know. I learned the importance of customer service in a retail environment and how to interact with people in a sales environment. Management at work was organized and knowledgeable of the tasks needed to be performed and were always their to answer any questions. The hardest part of the job is just adjusting to the POS, and inventory tricks and shortcuts. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people i worked with they were all friendly and made going to work fun."
good,I loved my job at Radio Shack. I enjoyed working in the environment I was in and I enjoyed working with all of my co workers including the manager
good,Pretty easy going job overall. Fun if you enjoy the hobby and talking to people about it.
good,"If you're a video gamer, this is a nice place to work and be professional at the same time. You learn to look at things from another perspective, especially if you dislike some products/ video games."
good,"You would walk in, clock in through the computer. Then you would mark, label, and put away any trades that was labeled from the other night.  Customers would come into the start wanting to trade video games, video systems, ipods for cash or for store credit, which you would have to do. You would have to organize and arrange all of the video games on the wall in alphabetical  order, as well as the ones in the bins on the floor. You would have to clean or wipe down any mess or just because."
good,"Overall, GameStop is a nice company to work for. They offer great benefits for their employees but sometimes forget that values come before sales."
good,this company is best for part timers barrow games for working there good discounts pay is low even for management management work LONG hours to keep up with demand of games little hours giving to complete tasks and company had outrageous standards on sales and pushing promotions
good,"Co-workers and managers are nice and helpful. The working environment is good, nothing really negative there. However, pay and hours are very low and that could definitely be improved on."
good,"Gamestop can be a stressful place to work, however it is only made stressful by corporate. The job its self is not stressful and is actually fun. I love talking to people about video games and selling them fun things to play. However I do not enjoy how much we are forced to push sales and numbers. Gamestop is a number's driven company with no compensation for the employee if they do get good numbers. However past that is a fun retail job."
good,"The typical day at work for me was helping customers, performing logistics, handling the cash register, and if I was the manager closing, I would close the registers and do the bank roll. What I learned while working at Gamestop included doing a better job with customers, counting money quickly and efficiently, and enhancing my logistic skills. My assistant and general manager were amazing and did their job well. My co-workers were excellent as well though some were lazy when partnered together with another co-worker. The hardest part of the job was when I became senior game advisor and had to work my college classes around my work schedule which has slowed my graduation. The most enjoyable part was the people that worked there becuase we all got along well."
good,If you want to work with high school kids and loves games work here...
good,"If you don't have a very overly strict manager your able to get stuff done as long as you follow the closing process. As well i wasn't really ""trained"" for this i had to observe and if i messed up they didn't help you they put all the blame on you."
good,Not a very exciting job but if you have great coworkers it can be bliss. Not much changes day to day but seeing the regulars and even meeting new customers can make the shifts fun.
good,"sales, customer service and cleaning. and had to organize store on a daily bases."
good,"the company is very unorganized, cant make up there minds, if they didnt sale a product that didnt sale its self they would go bankrupt."
good,"A typical day would be fun and challenging "
good,"If you are a video gamer and love to work and sell video games and merchandise then GameStop is the place for you. Management was great and the scheduling for you when you work is good and flexible. Unfortunately, If you want to make it a career or advancement, look elsewhere. You will find is that you will periodically loose how much time you can work a week. From approximately 8 hours a week to 2 hours every other week, it’s not even worth getting it. It’s basically a side gig from your regular job. Besides that it’s a good place to get familiar with retail."
good,"They start you off with minimum wage which is at 7 Dollar the hour as a sales associate. The hours are all weekend from 10 am to 6pm. It's good for a kid that need a summer job or something for the weekend but, not for a full time job"
good,Do not work here. Little pay & not enough hours to go around . Upper management takes all the hours. Not the place to work if you have a family. Only if your management is it ok.
good,I worked a seasonal position at Gamestop to help with the Holiday season rush and it was extremely enjoyable and productive. I gained invaluable experience dealing with a hectic work environment and customer service.
good,I learned all the mangagement skills that i needed to move on. the most enjoyable part of it was seeing all the different peopel that come into gamestop and helping them.
good,i would start the day checking the game racks and making sure everything was in alphabetical order then would check in with any guest that were in the store to make sure they did not need help finding a game or any advice on a video game such as if its safe for a 10 yr old child could play a teen rated game and what to expect from said game.
good,As a seasonal associate at GameStop I learned how to work in a team as a family. Everyone was respectful to each other. We all helped each other in each way we could.
good,I was at GameStop for 4 years. Great culture. I've been a customer and fan all of my life and despite being laid off I wish them nothing but success!!
good,"GameStop was alright. I believe that, if you want to have a good experience working for GameStop, you have to work for people who you can get along with. GameStop was my first job, the hardest part of the job was learning register. It wasn't particularly hard in the sense that it wasn't user-friendly. I just had a hard time remembering where certain things are."
good,game stop is not a bad company to work for if you have basic retail and or gaming experience. as long as you can survive their lack luster pay and sporadic hours
good,"I likes this job but I did not like being forced to constantly up sell reserves, subscriptions, and trades. since I was only part time I felt they asked to much of me for the pay they were paying me."
good,"It was a lot for walking and talking and trying to sell the best deal in the store. It wasn't hard persay, it was just a lot of the same everyday. But you do get to talk about things that interest you and try and inform customers."
good,"Overall, it was fine, just a little boring at times. The job ranged from cash handling to sales, to game organization. Management was very good and the workplace culture was very fun."
good,"Gamestop is a great company if your a game advisor. Once you get into management, or higher management, they start pushing you more and more to get the ""circle of life"" scores higher.  If you are anything other than the store manager or assistant store manager you get 20 hours a week tops."
good,"It wasn't hard to learn everything, The managers are usually very flexible with hours. I was able to go to school an work there for a little over a year."
good,"Som deltidsanställd på Gamestop har man varierande arbetsuppgifter, allt från vara kassa ansvarig, städa, fylla på butiken, inventera, sköta leveranser och andra vanliga butiks sysslor. "
good,"It was decent working at Gamestop during the holidays, and most of my time was spent helping parents and grandparents find the perfect gift, as well as restocking the floor. The only negative was I never got a computer login so I wasn't able to make any sales, I could only ever help the customers look for products on the floor."
good,"Fun job love the customers but the other employees kinda have like ""your an outsider"" mentality towards me for some reason other then that love the job and work environment."
good,"Working here was a dream job, I love video games and seeing all the new ones coming out made it much more enticing.  This job was only seasonal, they needed more people for the Christmas season.  When the season was over, sadly so was the job."
good,"As long as you love your coworkers, working becomes fun and less of a task. Though, be prepared because there is always a lot to do and get done in a timely manner."
good,"Honestly, Gamestop was a fun environment to work in, solely because of the people that I worked with. The company itself can be shady. Most of our return customers were great, with a few exceptions. Your experience working at gamestop will vary wildly, on a store to store basis."
good,Even though the environment is great to work in the upper management really only care about themselves and put their personal needs over the needs of the company or the needs of their workers.
good,"Working at Gamestop is like being employed in two totally different fields at the same time. In the summer, you're a bar tender who sells video games. In the winter, an electronics salesman and every day is Christmas.There are small, close knit teams wherever you go, and regardless of who you work with, you must make the best of it or the ship sinks. It may seem like the most interesting job, getting paid to talk about video games all day, but between the clientele and the company itself, most become jaded about gaming in general by the end of their employment. And if you're a (good) manager, you work far harder than you're required to to ensure productivity, and receive nothing in return."
good,"At gamestop you can learn how to work actively with your customers as if they are co-workers. You can both teach and learn new things from the customers that enter. It can be a friendly environment but of course there are always those that can make or break your day. The workplace culture is amazing as a whole, and you feel welcome from the moment you walk in. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to talk about movies, games, and other interests freely. The hardest part about the job is when there is a new product coming out, and the store line is filled to the street with customers, and you cant leave until they are all handled."
good,"Enjoyable workplace because the store leader is dedicated, encouraging, and knowledgable. Very accomodating regarding family emergencies and needs of staff. Offers extra shifts when bills get tight. Hard to deal with parents who don't care what their kids are interested in at all, especially trying to educate them on how they can save more money overall by protecting their expensive investments."
good,"Gamestop is a fantastic and safe environment for people looking to gain experience in retail, especially during the holidays. It can be quite stressful and difficult at times, but with that said, you learn a lot and gain the ability to work at a fast and effective pace."
good,"It is a good beginners job with marketing, sales and customer services. I enjoyed working there for two years. My only complaint was that the sales expectations that were set for all workers were always to high."
good,It's a good starter job to get used to the workplace. I would recommend for first timers but while you're working here you can advance your career. Some days are very slow and the tv gets repetitive. During the holidays it gets hectic and some customers will give you a rough time so be prepared for that.
good,"Management above the store can sometimes be aggravating. However, job was mainly relaxed unless you fall behind on numbers. Customers are the most important thing at Gamestop by far."
good,"my time at gamestop was probably my most memorable job experience, apart from the people that i worked for and under, it was the best,apart from that the culture is not what customers think it is,it is very stressful trying to make the weekely, monthly, and possibly the yearly plans especially with the location that i worked at and the corporation constantly breathing down your neck to make the numbers when you cant because you dont want to force customers to do anything they dont want to just to make plan, and not to mention the new manager that replaced the one that i worked for is not what i would considered a great manager, especially towards me. just about every time i shop there when she is working, she never treats me as a valued customer that ALL employees and managers are supposed to do with EVERYBODY former employees or not"
good,Company culture keeps changing. Many tasks and weekly goals constantly changing with a bigger focus on collectibles and toys. It's always an uphill battle but if you have a great staff it makes it much more bearable.
good,"Working at GameStop can be a fun place, depending on the team there and your manager. If you're really into gaming this can be a great place to work as far as retail. This is especially true if you are a key holder (some management privileges) or higher. Even still the job isn't simply selling and informing customers about games. The company pushes the employees to upsell customers on GameStop products, warranties, preowned games and more. This requirement isn't simply asking customers but going through full door-to-door salesmen style where you really give an attempt to in order for some of these customers to bite. This progress is tracked and if you're consistently weak at these upsells it reflects badly on you as an employee. There are some decent benefits such as getting some cool gaming attire and accessories and getting game discounts. The culture is usually pretty good, even though you'll have a 'know it all customers' and sometimes co workers who think they know everything and put you down for it. The hardest part is reaching the milestone your store imposes on you such as 15 game reservations and no cancellations in one week. The most enjoyable part is talking and sometimes demonstrating games for customers."
good,"It was a decent job for a part timer, the hardest part of the job for me was handling customer's who are hard to handle and calming them down. The management was great. Learned to use the cash register and how to handle returned items. Workplace culture was good, had no issues working with other employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was organizing the inventory and testing out games to be able to relate to customers."
good,"It's a fun place to work, and you get to talk about video games a lot. Customer can be nasty, but that's with retail anywhere. The big downfall is the pay, or lack thereof. Starting at 7.25, I worked there for 5 years and just got to 9.40. You would think the promotion to manager would make a bigger difference."
good,fun place to work if you know your games and gaming accessory's. not much hours and you will be on minimum wage without any commission. not a good career choice unless you want to work your way up to management but that will take a lot of time.
good,"Lots of menial tasks in addition to cash register. Coworkers and most customers were friendly and good to work around, but high ups showed little interest in our progression within the company."
good,"GameStop is really a great company when you want to gain experience in the customer service field. I have never had a problem with management and have never felt mistreated before while working there, everyone is provided with equal opportunity. A typical day at GameStop is a fast pace upbeat environment with very colorful and different customers who make the job easier and more fun than i already is."
good,"Only work here if you enjoy the gaming culture. "
good,"This job is great for those who are going to school or already have another job, but as an entry level job you should look somewhere else because the hours and the workload don't benefit the time you put into it. I have to find a different job as I come out of college because of how little amount of hours the job above me gives but yet they didn't want to promote me until I graduated from college. If this is your first job you are in the clear but don't try to apply here if you are needing to live a sustainable life."
good,They need to pay their employees better especially ones working in more difficult area. Hours are alright. The only way to motivate your employees to do an outstanding job is to reward them. Or give them compensation.
good,"This company is definitely out for the money with no real care for the people employeed under gamestop. However the people you meet as your coworkers, they are great people. I prefered to help the customers than make a profit off them due to the conpany demanding me to think of profits first"
good,I worked here seasonally. I worked about 8 hours the whole time I was there. They said it was cause I wasn't trained like the other employees. I would recommend finding a different seasonal job.
good,You will find lots of wonderful and amazing people as you work at a place alike this. Alot of co workers become great friends and bosses you might keep in touch with. The problem with game stop will always be the people behind desks that don't understand anything but theoretical numbers. I work at a mall store who's numbers bounce around and are unpredictable and instead of accepting that they try to plan and predict what is going to happen and it causes alot of stress and Unfortunitly affects our hours for when important things happen. I can't speak for self locations but avoid working at mall locations.
good,"While the individual location is great, corporate has little to no idea what is going on or how things work at a local level.  The customers are great and most of the employees are friendly."
good,"its a good place to work. the joyous customers that approach are great. the staffs and management teams that come together are great, the midnight launches are fantastic"
good,"Mostly depends on what you're looking for. If you want a fun part time job, it's great. Corporate atmosphere gets a little overbearing while moving up. Didn't feel as though there was any real potential for advancement after a certain point. Pay in OK started at minimum wage for game advisors."
good,"was a fast passed job, that allowed me to get on my feet after the marine corps. as a new veteran coming home it was not easy to find work. especially being a single parent with four kids, gamestop allowed me to being able to work, and have set hours which allowed me to pick up and drop off my kids from school"
good,Simply just not enough hours to go around and not much room for advancing to get more hours. I have however learned a lot about customer interactions making sure the customers get everything they need as easily and organized as possibly. The best part was learning a lot of cool ways to interact with customers and help the business all in one.
good,I have done all I can do at my level and there is no room to grow. I enjoy working with people everyday. I've work and run over 20 stores but can't grow to district manager.
good,My day started with the opening of the store and counting of the drawers. Then I would get my team ready for the day by talking about the product that needed to be highlighted. I would follow that up with a setting goals for the day. my staff would then proceed to offer suggestions on how to reach that goal. the hardest part of the job was keeping up with the ever expanding video game industry and the many developers. The upside to that is it is the video game industry.
good,"I loved working at my particular store - we had a great, friendly environment. The biggest thing I don't like about GameStop is how they have a set turnover rate, a quota, for how many people they have to fire by the end of the year. They tend to go for the most tenured people, and also go digging for information to try to find an issue that they can make big enough to fire you over. I promise that I am not over-exaggerating, and it's horrible that they do this to their employees. I have seen many dedicated employees come and go, and I just cannot condone that type of behavior."
good,This is a very laid back job. As long as you have basic video game knowledge and people skills this job is pretty fun. The only hard part about this job is helping people find something they dont even know they're looking for.
good,"customer service 100%"
good,As a game stop employee you learn various ways to deal with all types of people from gamer's to game buyers. the staff can be fun to work with as most staff members are gamer's with a competitive nature always a load of fun working at game stop
good,I got to apply myself as a manager and put a lot of my own ideas in place. The managers above me and associates that I trained we all fantastic.
good,"Great people to work with! Overall great environment, but entirely too many responsibilities for minimum wage. Most customers were a joy, and as far as most retail jobs go this one is great!"
good,"•	Accomplish administrative and operational duties as directed by Store Manager or supervisor."
good,"The discount is nice, as well as the other perks. It is absolutely NOT a job I would recommend, however, if you're looking to make a living wage as anything less than assistant manager. Hours can vary wildly."
good,"Gamestop is a decent company to work for, although they seem to be trying to hard to change too quickly to stay relevant in the brick and mortar industry.  The overall leadership is positive, but does lack foresight on how changes impact the entire company and not just small test regions.  Their benefit package as far as insurance is very good and the amounts of vacation and sick time are average for the industry."
good,"La mia giornata tipo consisteva nell'arrivo in negozio,lettura della daily aziendale per controllare eventuali novità o cambiamenti dell'ultimo minuto,controllo dei corrispettivi del giorno precendente rapportati al budget settimanale,controllo delle performance dei singoli colleghi e verifica dei progressi degli obbiettivi personali e di quelli di store,analisi e condivisioni della giornata precedente via whatsapp con tutti i colleghi in chat private,analisi della giornata precedente via whatsapp su chat di negozio."
good,"GameStop was my first job I ever had. I transferred to the Santa Cruz store that happened to be opening the same time I began attending school. It was very convenient. Most of my coworkers were kind and friendly,but some were inappropriate. The manager was wonderful. He was very understanding of my school schedule and made sure to create a work schedule to accommodate to everyone."
good,"A typical day at work starts out with standing in the entrance to the store talking to customers, promoting products, and helping customers find the product they want, towards the end of my shift, I typically put games on the shelf in alphabetical order. "
good,I was such a great place to work. everyone was so nice and customers always enjoyed my jokes. wish the pay was better. would work there again anytime.
good,"I come clock in, put display games back in alphabetical order so customers can find them with ease.  Help any customers with questions or concerns in a professional and welcoming manner.  I learned how to deal with unpleasant/upset customers, how to process transactions/returns/trade-ins.  The management was decent in how they treated you, my manager wasn't the most well organized, it took a co-worker and I 10 minutes to find the schedule that should have been posted and even then we had to call to make sure it was the official schedule for the coming week, but they were a cool individual.  The co-workers are awesome and we all love to talk about everything.  The hardest part of the job is the lack of hours and job advancement.  Corporate keeps positions locked down so tight that there isn't much room for advancement.  I enjoyed the customers most, listening to their takes on games that I personally might enjoy or dislike then giving each other recommendations for other games."
good,Ho avuto occasione di sviluppare l'approccio con la clientela. Ho imparato soprattutto  la gestione del carico e scarico degli articoli .Ottima integrazione con i colleghi di lavoro.
good,"Working at Game Stop was fun. I enjoyed interacting with some of the most awesome Customers about one of the things I love: Video Games.  Unfortunately , The Pay was sub-par. Granted I was only a temp and a regular sales associate, but still."
good,It is a great company to work for with many chances to advance. Everyone is passionate about what they sell and it is more then just selling. It is about bringing happiness to customers and fans. Gamers are a dedicated group of people and they appreciate the atmosphere in which GameStop provides.
good,Everyday I would sign in and start work. I learned how to better treat customers as well of how to handle money properly. Managers and coworkers had so much respect towards me. Hardest part of the job was taking a break because it wasn't hectic enough in my mind to need a break. Most enjoyable was making people smile when they saw i had the game they wanted .
good,"Working at the corp office of Gamestop is overall pretty good. The pepole here are like family and treat you as such. Some positions seem very overpaid while the others (like me) are very underpaid. Not much room for advancement, as they tend to higher from outside the company more and more versus from within. Great work/life balance, great benefits, annual merit increases and discount programs."
good,I did not work very long in this job but my time there taught me skills while working with people.
good,"Gamestop was very part-time for me. I enjoyed my time with Gamestop working over the holidays and my manager was very good at his position. Understandably, the pay was minimum wage and certain aspects of the job was geared heavily towards sales. I was employed at the time Gamestop was downsizing and exploring new product to sell to boost its stock so the company was also pressuring for better performance. The starting position is really easy and most of the other positions are as well so excellent scores and performance were not an issue at all. The company is well organized and working with Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo was an incredible experience. I loved the level of detail that you were shown into the industry and the exclusivity of working for Gamestop."
good,"Enthusiastic to promptly process purchases and returns via Point of Sale computer system."
good,"My usual workday consists of helping customers, cleaning, sorting and assist my co-workers with day-to-day problems. When I first started here i was very shy and did what I could to avoid conversation. I've learned that less that its easy to help someone even when they don't know anything about video games. I've been at Gamestop for about two years and love my co-workers, but there is one thing that we all agree should change. Pressure sales for loyalty cards draw away from the overall customer experience and I wish we were graded on their satisfaction. Aside from those weird pressure sales Gamestop is a great part-time job for any gamer."
good,"be aggressive and fun as far as sales go, I learned many best practices for tackling tasks for a company with limited payroll."
good,While its fun to work here and the additional discounts are nice everything else doesn't help. Stress can come from random schedules or low payments. Game stop doesn't have many employees so if you want time off you may be called in sooner than usual.
good,A typical day at work was filled with interacting with customers and discussing the new game titles that were coming out. the most enjoyable part of my day was the conversations about which game consoles were the best or which new game would take title of the year.
good,"There are a lot of good things to say. Gamestop is a fun place to work and being able take any game in the store home to try out was cool. However, the pay is not at all commutative and a time comes where one outgrows the basic compensation. Every adult I know who lives on their own and subsists on a Gamestop check simply are not happy with where they are in life."
good,"I love working with kids and talking to the hard-core gamers. If it wasn't for all the smiles that I get every day, I would have left for a higher paying part-time job."
good,If you're a gamer and are looking for a tiny part time job to supplement a full time job. I still had fun working here. Just couldn't live on 8.50/hr.
good,Gamestop is primarily a sales job. So if you can sell you wont last long. Its a good job for a beginner or a passionate gamer. Gamestop offers easy access to promotions through good performance maling it good for those looking to get into management. Its also alot of fun.
good,"Unless you are a manager or key holder, you won’t get many hours at all; maybe one shift every other week. "
good,Working at GameStop has made me grow as a person into being more responsible and mature. I went to school while working at GameStop and they were very respectful of my schedule and helped me achieve my bachelors degree by giving me the freedom to study and work.
good,"While my personal experience with management and work environment is better than others, honestly the only reason I still have this job is for the discount. Due to my school schedule, I'm only able to work one five-hour shift every other week, and I have reached the limit for pay raises, yet still make less than a starting employee at Wal-Mart."
good,"A typical day here includes neatly cleaning/organizing, taking in Distro, informing guest about upcoming releases, and counting money. I have learned to talk up/sell guests popular titles and accessories. Management is pretty lenient , understanding, and willing to work with your schedule. The workplace culture is fun and exciting but the hours are slim and pay is minimum wage. However working with and helping people who you share commonalities with is pretty cool."
good,"The atmosphere working here is laid back and fun. They want you to be you and express yourself, express your hobbies and joys. Most of all, express your love for games and everything nerdy."
good,"As much fun as it is to work here, I maybe get only one day a week... that is not enough to live on. Other then the icky hours and only making minimum wage as a associate, there is plenty of opportunity to move up. It is also fun. And relaxing place to work. If you have a passion for video games this is a great place to spread you passion."
good,"Management don't have enough time to properly train the new staff members or answer questions and typically place them on jobs they just don't want to do themselves rather than what the employee is being paid to do. You will also find yourself under fire for things you haven't done, things you've done according to your training or mistakes made by the management team themselves. Other than the management the job was super fun and laid back. Id do it again in a different location. I have already recommended this job to some of my friends who live in different states/areas."
good,"Gamestop is a fast-paced, fun working environment with advancement options available. Training is very informative and thorough. Guest advisors are taught customer service and marketing skills."
good,Game stop is my favorite place I've worked to date. I loved my nerdy co workers and my boss was amazing. The down side is outside of holidays you don't get many hours at all.
good,Great experience but the business is struggling so will not make your role easy. Be sure to not stay out of comfort but that you are expanding your knowledge base and are advancing your career.
good,"The company need to improve their management.  There is a passive attitude in every situation and every department of the company.  There is more focus and opportunities for store employee than corporate employee. Corporate employees support and help drive retail sales, but is highly unappreciated."
good,Typical work day it could go from being completely dead to full blown busy in less then a few minutes and then right back to empty. The most stressful part of the job were dealing with customers that are in a bad mood. The hardest part of the job is probably remember where certain products belong. One of the best parts of the job is also the people that you meet while working weather it be coworkers or customers.
good,"The job is fairly easily, with hours being extremely flexible. Pay was very low, but I had a fantastic time working there. Loved all of my co-workers."
good,"had 2 bosses at GameStop. One was amazing, one not so much. Entirely different experiences. The people and the games make it worth it. If the people you work with are great, the job will be too."
good,"Been here for a few months, GS is not something you want as your main job.It's cool if you want to pick up a day or two when your main job gives you day off."
good,Pays you minimum wage. You can get better discounts on amazon. Nice management. Taught you good life skills...........................................
good,"Coworkers are awesome, selling video games is a blast, benefits are okay, hours are sort of flexible, and store hours are reasonable. One o the only problems I have i that the company doesn't really allow store to hire a reasonable amount of people so you always feel under-staffed and over-stressed. Store leader and co-workers are all great, the company in general just needs improvements and to rethink some of their sales tactics because we notice a lot of the things they make us do and say to try to drive sales is obvious in showing the customer is getting annoyed."
good,"GameStop is a great company to work for in general. The guests make the job the best part. The store manager job can be the easiest or the hardest job for this company, it all depends on who you surround yourself with. The overhead management is the standard corporate management, nothing great."
good,Working at GameStop has a lot of great things! Its fun and the people are great! Unfortunately the pay and hours are horrible. You won't make any money unless you're a manager.
good,If you suck at selling stuff to people its not the job for you. Its not about talking about video games all day. Its a sales orientated job and you are really punished for not meeting goals.
good,"Manager was friendly and knowledgeable. "
good,I believe GameStop as a company is changing a lot. The culture has moved away from what built its foundation to begin with. I worked for 15 years and went thru a lot of change with the company. The last couple of years changed too much. They never said before with this company more than they do now how much the people at the bottom matter the most. The thing is however it was never farther from the truth.
good,Working at Gamestop you get to talk to people about their various interests and help them find the ideal product they happen to be looking for on that particular visit.
good,"Loved working at gamestop. You get to learn about new games coming out before anyone else does. A huge perk to the job is that you get to take a game home for free for 5 or so days and return it and bring home a new one. The environment is very gamey and nerdy. Many people think that all you do is play games all day...hate to disappoint but, you rarely play games at all while at work."
good,"Working at GameStop is a meaningful experience similar to other retail jobs. A typical day for a Game Adviser consist of assisting customers with questions and concerns, filing games, and assisting management with other duties such as preparing and receiving shipment and maintaining store appearance. Co-workers vary dependent on the people you meet at each store location but management hire people that are pleasant. Working with co-workers and discussing the latest games were great but of course the downside is the pay. GameStop is a fun company but when it comes to being able to survive is gonna require you to have a second job."
good,"If you want a job that could potentially turn into a career, then this a good place to be. It really all depends on the management you have, some places have a great manager, therefore everyone else has a better experience and some don't."
good,"A typical day would usually be filled with task based work as well as an emphasis on assisting every guest that walked through our doors. Interacting with our guests was always the fun part of the job for me, however at times, the amount of task work would detract from the full experience."
good,"A lot of sketchy things done by other stores, but store 4006 was very professional and great environment to work in. Doesn't make sense that you can be 17 to buy M rated game but have to be 18 to trade in"
good,"all gamestops were copy and paste, not much room for individuality.  close all cash tills, balance safe, organize stock."
good,"It was a fun place to work for a part time job. You would show up and talk about video games all day, pretty cool. managers a re cool people, co workers as well. The biggest downside is that it can get loud with all the kids running around. There (depending on where your store is located) are many armed robberies to get the large amount of cash and expensive game consoles that are available to them on holidays and such. It can be very competitive with other co workers at times because they reward you with more working hours for good numbers. There are no full time positions under the assistant managers position. The pay is low for the lower positions and without commission. A large downside is that with all the profit being made on a daily basis by the company that they cannot pay their advisors anything more than minimum wage. Managers, however, get all expenses paid trips to game conventions where they receive hotels, food vouchers, the newest game consoles and games for free, and so on. Thats the most frustrating part of being an advisor."
good,Learned how to manage a team and build my selling skills.The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers and being able to make my schedule.
good,Job is laid-back atmosphere however the company is headed in a new direction that is not conducive to its customers. Good first tie job but not very good for a career.
good,"As a game advisor i assist customers in which i enjoy and just help with management, some managers are cool. Co workers are fun to work with the hardest part is closing, most enjoyable is helping customers"
good,"Working for Gamestop is not all its cracked up to be.  The allure of working for a company specializing in games seems fun, but the expectations set by corporate seem a little ridiculous, and demoralizing.  If you are not a ""Key Holder"" you might as well look else where for a job.  I felt bad when I was only able to offer a person 4 hours a week at minimum wage. They got a better value out of the employee discount than monetarily."
good,"Day to day operations consisted of category counts, checking in shipments, shipping out product to other stores, interacting with customers. Management was pretty good, kinda varied on the location and district. Easy company to move up in as long as you are competent."
good,"A typical day at gamestop is no complaint. Customers are great to work with, even during Holidays. I've learned to do trade ins, returns, take reserves for games and stock. Management is great, very simple to get along with and if ever a problem we are helped to figure it out. The hardest part about working at GameStop is not gaining enough hours to work. Though the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to conversate with people about our video game passions and to get customers to understand video games as a hole."
good,great to work here if you love video games but compensation isn't that great
good,"pretty chill, didn't really teach me anything, your coworkers are usually pretty cool and they're very helpful when you're a newbie. The hardest part of the job was getting hours. Corporate is extremely stingy with their hours and whomever cozies up to the manager will likely get hours, leaving everyone else out in the cold. The best part was helping customers and talking about games all day"
good,"Management was good. Very good co-workers. we sold video games, accessories and systems. The hardest part of the job was fixing the back to what it was. The most enjoyable part was playing some for the games and the discount."
good,It's a great place to work but they do not have the proper amount of hours to keep all employees happy.
good,"I had fun working there, I would go there arranging game and other accessories. I learned to always to best work 1st and someone will appreciate it. The managers were more like friends that I could talk about games and such with."
good,This is a very fun place to work. It is awesome getting a discount on games and also getting the inside scoop on video games. You can also get priority on reserving games and collector editions of games. This isn't a good place to work if it is your only job they don't give enough hours. This would be a good place to work for someone who is in school or has another job and wants another job on the side.
good,"-A typical day would be greeting customers,helping them on video game choices,checking them out on the register,pushing sales,telling them to have a nice day, all while answering phones,doing shipment and inventory."
good,"This is a great place to work as a second job, however, not very sound as a primary source of income. Entry-level guest advisors seldom worked more than 9 hours a week, so unless you plan on advancing higher up you won't really be there much. However, the culture is unlike most other retail jobs, and workers are encouraged to build strong relationships with regulars. This is a great job for someone who loves video games, helping people, and wants a little extra cash."
good,"If you love video games and want somewhere to work where you are paid to pitch your sale for them, this is definitely the place. A typical day of work consists of working partially on a register while the other part you go around talking to everyone currently in the store. Many people enter GameStop looking at a new video game experience, so they appreciate a second opinion."
good,The job was very easy the management team was not trust worthy.  A lot of flavoring there. I try to learn more and there was always a excuse why that could happen at that time. I would really like to learn to drive equipment.
good,You won’t be able to support yourself if you’re not a manager because they cut your hours based on how much you sell. We’re currently at 120 hours a week between six employees which is the minimum they’ll give you and we’re a prestige store. I get 10-18 hours a week.
good,"Working for Gamestop is relaxed and not being to overburdened. The employees are nice and hold each other with regard; and the benefits cover a wide area of perks."
good,"Manager and assistant manager we're great. Not enough hours for lower employees, unless you're looking for part time hours. Great environment for balanced work and family. Embracing co-workers."
good,"A typical day here is just constantly organizing the games and shelves. Management is super understanding and try to help out. Hardest part of the job was selling the warranties and yearly subscriptions, as well as doing the online quizzes.  The best part of the job was being able to borrow video games."
good,"You can really learn a lot from this company when it comes to sales. It can be challenging at times, especially in the retail industry. When the situation arises, you tend to deal with angry parents and disgruntled gamers. Mostly you deal with friendly regular customers and people who are genuinely appreciative of you helping them. The job requires a great deal of multitasking and concentration with meticulous attention to detail."
good,"Start the day off by preparing the store for opening. Usually I would just stand behind the cash register (someone must always be posted on register) or walk towards customers who needed help. "
good,I felt that working at GameStop would be an amazing opportunity because I love games. Actually come to find out it was the most boring job I ever had. Speaking and greeting customer or whipping windows is probably the only real thing to do there.
good,"I did not work very long for them, as it was only a seasonal job. However, I had already been friendly with most of the workers and the manager at the time. They helped me learn things rather quickly and I was able to jump right into it given my previous retail experience. The hardest, or should I say most inconvenient part of the job, was having to answer customer phone calls with the same greeting every time. But the most enjoyable part of the job was the conversations with said customers, and it was great being able to help people find video games that they would like, especially if I have played them, and I'd get to tell them about it. I would definitely have worked there longer if I could."
good,I worked here a LONG time ago ! was nice but then again what teenager wanted to be home ! loved the hours never had an issue with that while I was in school.
good,"Management was good, but goals and standards have gotten high and strict. The overall work environment is nice and friendly. With recent changes, much more strict on making goals and numbers."
good,Gamester is not a bad job to have. They are however corporate and don't take care of their employees like they should. other than that i love who i work with and am very close with each co-worker.
good,I loved my workplace here the people were great.  We bonded like a family. The greatest part was the people. Getting to know different people and being able to impact them on a daily basis.
good,"I have worked at three different locations, under four different managers during my time with the company. This is mostly due to the shortage of hours allotted to each store. The stores are usually short staffed because of this. "
good,"I mostly restocked walls, organized them, and rung up customers. I definitely enjoyed talking about video games because they are my passion."
good,"A typical day is getting there and organizing the games on the walls in order, while constantly handling customer service. If you do not enjoy playing video games or have no kind of knowledge in that sort of industry you will be having a bad time and maybe not even enjoy working there. Management is great, always around when you need them and always making sure you are on your feet and the same goes with the co-workers, The hardest part is dealing with the customers (which I got a custom to) and the most enjoyable part is being involved in a great experience and meeting people with the same interest as you."
good,"It was great working for the company albeit some issues but overall it was a good company, but loyalty is not one of there strong suits and you dont get any rewards until your management. Some of the co-workers that you interact with can be very obnoxious and the constant demand for success can be taxing especially when not reaching your quota every week. Once you get used to the job it is good to place to work if your patient."
good,"If you work hard and show initiative you will move up quickly but thats when things get more complicated. The lack of employees to draw from (maybe 5-7 per store) means a heavy dependance on you and everyone else. If anyone slacks or calls out frequently it will hurt the whole team. The pressure to sell and get tasks done is immense and at times overwhelming as the company is so tight fisted with payroll that a hangman's noose could take lessons from them. This means you are constantly bombarded with a normal range of tasks in addition to selling 5 things and rearranging the store or some display because corporate thinks its the magic answer to all their problems in selling one thing. The reality of your resources to get things done when they want it never truly dons on them. Also emails out the ying yang. Most of it the corporate propaganda to keep you a happy member of the ""family"" mixed in with actually relevant information that honestly should be the main focus. The result is a scenario of ""didn't you get the memo?"". If you are looking for a job that's just very part time and is just a stepping stone than its honestly not too bad. Don't hold any illusions as to staying here in the long term."
good,"Working at GameStop molded the hard working individual that i am now. I was able to work my way up form a new hire Game Adviser to an Assistant Store Leader. Everyone there made it clear that the company was based on Team effort and making sure that the customers were treated like any other individual would like to be treated, with respect and making sure that you leave the store with a smile and wanting to come back again."
good,"Work was a high pressure sales environment with an emphasis on membership programs and pre-orders. Working with a small team (2-3 associates on average, including myself) tasks were delegated with one person helping customers on the floor, one handling transactions, and one preparing incoming and outgoing orders and shipments. This position strengthened my multitasking ability, helped me develop an understanding of product distribution, and gave me management responsibilities that established a foundation to learn how to delegate and manage a store during both busy and slow periods. The hardest part of this job was managing such a small team during busy periods and events, while the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with a specific demographic of customers that I could relate too."
good,It's very relaxed and you get to work around your favorite hobby (if it is). Customers can be a bit rude sometimes but overall the job is very simple.
good,It's a slightly above minimum wage job. This is a job so you will have to do things other than talk about games all day. Pretty straightforward stuff.
good,"Game stop was my very first job, I was so excited that I was hired there because I love playing video games. The manager that I had at the time was nice but when I had questions or needed help, she acted like she didn't want to be bothered and didn't have the patience to help me. I had to get used to being on the floor, talking to customers and telling them about sales and trade-ins etc. I couldn't catch on quick enough so they let me go. No hard feelings, it just wasn't for me at the time."
good,My personal experience was very chill and relaxed. My team was very helpful and professional. Can't complain at all. Just needed a change in pace really.
good,"its was really hard in the begining, then it gets  easier down the line.          "
good,"I get to work with video games and pop culture. Coworkers are always like minded, fun, and positive. It taught me how to run registers and organize, but most importantly it taught me how to talk to people."
good,Its was fun and relaxed. the hardest part about the job is probably the constant micromanagement by the higher bosses. i typical day i came in talked games.
good,"Answered phone calls and emails regarding video games and consoles"
good,"There is always something different coming into work, get to share your passion with people, build relationship with customers, build a close bond with fellow employees, and great benefits working there"
good,"Great position in sales if you love the product you're selling. Coworkers are also usually gamers so it's easy to get along."
good,"It is a very demanding position, company expect a lot out of you with no payroll to work with. on a typical day I will work about 10 hours and usually I work alone until my assistant manager come in at 3."
good,"GameStop was a great place to work, i did work there for six years. I met some great people and made most of my friends there. the pay was pretty poor considering new people could start at a equal wage as what it would take one to work 4 years to achieve. I would be wary of upper management however, they do like to take advantage of younger people who don't know any better, they'll have people work extra hours off the clock, promise compensations and promotions that never come. but this could be just my experience."
good,"I enjoyed my store and my team. I can't speak for all but I had fun working there. I was promoted within 5 or 6 months of being there and was offered another chance to move up after another 6 months or so. Yeah, we got overworked but that's retail for you. The discounts and perks were definitely worth it if you game/collect stuff. I left on good terms and I would definitely go back."
good,It is a relaxing and fun place to work. The employee discount is good. But it should not be a main source of income. It would be better suited as a side job.
good,Working at GameStop is fun but the hours aren't what you think you make friends you can talk to people really easy because your at a place full of games that you play like everyone at GameStop.
good,"While at times it was fun, after being a victim in two robberies I as done. My co workers were the best.  And most customers were awesome.  I wish the company would step up security, as law enforcement sees us as easy targets."
good,"Great company to work for and only of the best to work for if you have a love on video games."
good,i loved working here it was a fun and a learning environmental place. the management was fare. my co workers was very respectful and knew there work. theres nothing bad about this job.
good,This job is fun to work if you like games. All you deal with is games and customers. Sometimes management can be fun depending on who you work for!
good,great job to start somewhere and maybe grow in the company good for gaining work experience in marketing sales and costumer service areas of expertise
good,"GameStop isn't perfect, we all know this, but games are awesome. The issue comes with the workers there. They work too slow and they talk too much when customers need help. It's like they've become comfortable and have almost no drive. Maybe things have changed there since I've last worked there, but as it stands, that's pretty much every GameStop. Also, management always sucks. Always."
good,"I would work for the company again. It was a nice environment but managers can ruin the job. They get benefits, while you are doing all the work. As a manager it is a good job, however as a lower-level employee, it is horrible."
good,"Give you little hours to work per week when you are a game advisor, when and if you go up to ber an assistant manager you will get paid more but little hours as well"
good,"open store 10am and run store alone til 2pm, and then have someone call out, job security is terrible they are always demoting, and promoting different people without a reason."
good,- Talk to customers.
good,"I want to start this off by saying that 2 weeks ago, I loved this job. I was excited to go into work and was planning on moving up the employment ladder. At lower positions you cannot make a living at this job, but starting at Store Leader and up you actually make a decent amount and the bonuses are usually very nice gaming items."
good,"It's not a bad place to work, but unless youre management (which openings don't occur often, if ever) it's not steady and definitely will not pay your bills. I would only suggest this as a passion job and a side job."
good,Most enjoyable part of the day is working with video games. Worst part of the job is dealing with corporate. Never knew what to expect on a typical day.
good,è un ambiente lavorativo in cui c'è molta competizione tra i colleghi perchè si viene lasciati a casa in base alle vendite fatte.
good,I love GameStop. Its a great place to work. unfortunately they only hire seasonal. It is very tough to get hired full time.
good,"Stocking shelves and helping customers is fine, it's just that it is really hard to keep this job being that Gamestop cuts people as soon as the holiday season is over and it's back down to just 2-3 employees a store."
good,The job itself I loved. I only had a bad experience bc my store manager was a little flirty with me.
good,Assist customers and Supervisors. Stacked videos and supplies as requested.
good,"I was a seasonal worker this last year was hired by friend who is manager it was ok but didn't get told I was no longer needed I actually ran into manager while in the mall and she said omg I'm so sorry we didn't let you know etc etc.. meh no skin off my back the hours were poor I was only scheduled 4 hours anytime, this isn't a stable job go elsewhere"
good,"Started there as a part time job, became a closing manager making $9.60/hr. Got a new store manager and within less than 2 months she sunk the store to the point of it closing the location."
good,Not enough hours for lower level employees and no benefits other than a discount on the items in store. Love the company just wish there was more room for it to be a main source of income instead of a side job.
good,It just honestly depends on which GameStop you work at. There are some laid-back and chill managers and then there are other managers who are very strict.
good,"Great individuals to work with. New technology comes in and the employees all tend to help each other out when need be. Customer interaction is pretty simple in the sense that even when things aren't known, customers tend to be patient until another employee helps out."
good,Store leaders can make or break the store functionality and make things quite a handful . Overall fun working there and enjoyed the times with a doubt
good,though I had a lot of fun working for game stop i did not see my self being there very long went threw two three different managers there when only one of them should have stayed the last manager i had to teach how do do things
good,Place has its highlights when I was younger but as the corporate world took over after EB Games merged was never the same. Company is all about fake numbers and not driving real sales in the business. Constantly had to compete with stores that faked numbers in their internal system since was so easy to cheat it. They don't have a gasp of what is really wrong with their company.
good,"I knew what the idea of being a key holder was about so i felt comfortable in that area but i wasn't familiar with the games or ""gamer"" concept. I learned a lot about the game world, how the game systems work and how the significance of games mean to some people. It was a awesome experience for me and it taught me about organizing the games and how the reservation of new items worked."
good,Seasonal workers or even part-time workers rarely get hours much less get to work maybe two days a week. You may be off for two weeks before you work.
good,"Management is horrible. Scheduling is even worse, at my store you'd be lucky enough to get 20-30 hours; hours are scarce and it's a boring job. Not much to do but stand and be idle. Co-workers were good, that's about the only positive about where I work."
good,The management was wrong. The manager was having a  relationship with an employee. The store was always a mess. Unorganized with no sense of management.
good,"If only I got promoted and got more hours it would be cool but its whatever, I have another job that pays more, and I like being at waffle house more, in the time I've been with the waffle house I've made 3 times what I have at gamestop and I've been at gamestop for 3 years now"
good,"I loved my job, but Management is all over the place. For a job that is a business but also should be fun, it was very stressful. They change their policy every month."
good,"Friendly staff and mostly fun work environment, I wished I had gotten better training from my supervisors. A typical day at work included costumer service, cashier work, and sales."
good,Gamestop is a good place to work if you are a student or just wanting to work part-time but there is not really any room for advancement or pay raises.
good,Fun at store level. District to Regional Management drives goals aggressively and therefore hurts overall moral. Company promote customer needs but only coaches number results.
good,"-Holidays are the worst time for GameStop employees"
good,"I enjoyed my time with this company. I learned so much about myself and even more about different cultures and environments. The typical day in the retail setting includes ensuring store is ready for guest interactions, managing inventory levels, receiving inventory, interacting with guests, meeting and exceeding sales goals and hitting your performance sales goals(ie subscriptions and reserves), cleaning the store and ensuring the store is shop able and clean."
good,"I worked for GameStop for just over three years, it was one of my first jobs and overall a really fun part time job. But with sunlight always comes sorrow as the honeymoon period ended with the company so did my desire to stay. Over the years of not having guaranteed hours and barely being paid above minimum wage, daily sales goals that sometimes feel impossibly crushing to hit. And just working for a company that does not get it, that complains about losing business and struggling to expand into their new ""loot"" and apparel markets but doesnt understand why it isnt working, so instead of reflecting on this to improve they blame the low level employees who only do as they are told and taught."
good,The guest and employees were the best to work with. The work days went by fast and it was never the same thing twice. Always lots of sales going on for different products.
good,"Great atmosphere, minimal requirements during the shift.  Typical work day included organizing the video games, providing great customer service and video game promotion toward the customers.  I learned how to be a better sales man and manager at GameStop. A fun and carefree place to work at."
good,"Decent part time job if you need supplemental income. I work at a ridiculously busy store so sales are pushed harder here and can make the job quite stressful. Management is hit or miss. I had the worst manager I've ever had in my life at one store: scheduling issues constantly, coverage issues, inventory mismanagement, and workplace drama."
good,For most part time employees you will be lucky to get 20 hours every two weeks. Though the employees are good workers and make it fun. They are very helpful when situations come up.
good,"At Game Stop I was mostly a cashier. However, when the store was empty I had to do stock. While working in this job I learn how to handle money and costumer service. The management was a little off for the reason being it was mostly just young people manage the store. The most fun part about the job I could say was the co-worker.  But there will be time where they forget about giving breaks."
good,"GameStop provides a nice, clean atmosphere in which to work. The customers are great people, and managers care about the employees and customers. It is just not a very skilled job, so they do not pay very competitively."
good,Being a gamer myself GameStop is a fun place to work. I am knowledgeable of all the products which makes it a pleasure working there. Like all jobs it's not perfect; team work is not the best but I don't let that get in the way of my job performance. The hardest part can sometimes be the inconsistent hours.
good,"I didn't have time to really learn the position here because I was only offered seasonal and let go 2 months after being hired. It was fun working here though. My coworkers were nice to me, and my previous manager who was let go was nice as well. The new manager was quite of a pain though. He decided to let me go because of inexperience reasons, but after some snooping I was told he was let go because of stealing from the store. I guess karma does play a role sooner or later with things like that. I'd recommend."
good,Was always promised managment positions by my store manager but was always shafted with it. i wanted to move higher on the ladder and had the motivation but was always denied.
good,I love working here I just cant get the hours because they are not available. I flourish during Back to School and Holiday times.
good,"I was a Senior Game Advior Which is consider a ""part-time manager"" for gamestop I had keys to the store, safe code alarm code and workers under me. we had to put up marketing keep up with sales they had going on. basically running the store when the Store Manager wasn't there along with 1 other SGA. the most enjoyable part was just there talkin to the customers about games and selling them. the hardest part was just getting hours. 2 days 10 hours a week.. not enough."
good,"A fun place to work, though with a very high turn over rate, for sales associates and managers alike. Usually very busy during the day which helps to build strong relationships among co-workers. Meeting so many people interested in gaming and virtual reality is a plus, though sometimes the customers can be unpleasant."
good,"A typical day at work consists of inventory, data entry, pulling product, shipping, receiving, product placement, updating marketing material, sending out daily reports, balancing cash/inventory on hand all while providing customer service on the floor and at the register."
good,"GameStop is a video game retail store. They don't really respect their employees very much, but you do get to be around video games all day, and you get to talk to people about video games. Some Co-workers are cool others aren't. The hardest part of the job is that you have to sale magazine subscriptions and try to get game reservations. Your hours depend on it. The best part is that IF you have a good manager you will get a lot of training as long as you ask for it and again you get to sale VIDEO GAMES!!!! Being a gamer is a must for this position."
good,"I provided basically the same jobs as I did at Starbucks, including orders, setups and more. I just received a lot less appreciation for the amount of work I did."
good,A very simple and easy job. They work well with your schedule. All my co-worker helped me better understand my job. Never had any issues with my co-workers
good,Working for this company has it's ups and downs but it does create a team environment. It can be a double edge sword because if things fail due to a single person's percentage then it becomes very hostile and difficult. On the great foot it's awesome to meet new guest and develop new relationships and network through it. You can gain skills that can give you confidence depending on your own work ethic but can break you if you don't see results from working hard sometimes but that can byild character and give you valuable lessons.
good,I get like 4 hours a week. The new CEO is throwing most stuff into the garbage can which is really going to hurt the ability for us to sell power up rewards to people.
good,"The people you work with at a normal GameStop are fun and love gaming. District managers and above only care about profits. Sometimes it seems like they never even played video games, and will force you to push extra purchases on customers."
good,"A typical day at Gamestop involved standing around a lot, and taking in shipments. Occasionally i'd have to do a count or three some days during the week, but overall it was a good experience."
good,"Day to day the job was great. but any time corporate made changes to the way we were used to doing recent changes they would flip it on us and make us learn even more new things back to back while forcing you to break out of the recent pitch habit, made things very difficult with promoting the newer stuff since they pushed it hard on everyone to memorize and then forget it. Worst part is that most on the corporate ladder never worked in any retail stores, so most changes were useless or unnecessary. Plus the company was going downhill when I left."
good,Helping customers find what they are looking for in the gaming industry. Provided information on an assortment of games on many platforms as well as test gaming units and traded merchandise.I enjoyed games and gaming so this job did not really have any hard parts other than lack of money and hours.
good,I won't delve too much into details but if you only plan on working with this company for a little bit of time it is perfect as a seasonal hire as that is the only way you get hours unless you are a keyholder and the rate of keyholder advancement is very slim unless you brown nose your entire career. Do inventory daily. The hardest part of this company is keeping your COL appealing everyday.
good,"Gamestop is cool, it being Gamestop. I like video games and consoles and stuff of the sort so I figured I'd enjoy working here. Downsides are the hours offered and the pay is really bogey. Plus side is you get to work with people whom you share a common interest with."
good,"Game stop needs to update everything about itself, as a company and ultimately as a gamer experience you should feel more so than a blockbuster just video games instead. New technology, advance systems, and turn game stop into a lounge to rent out times or tryout new games and demos."
good,i loved the job until my manager got a new job and they brought in someone who had worked with the company for less than 3 months as our new store manager. she ruined the store while doing several things that was against company policy and drove the employees away.
good,"The environment couldn’t be more fun and the work is honestly enjoyable but the wrong people would be promoted who didn’t value the right things, causing the store to really lose its value"
good,"At the time I was working for this company, I did so because they offered health benefits for part-time workers; benefits which basically consumed my paycheck down to less than $50. The one time I actually had to use my health benefits, turns out they paid for hospital but not the ambulance, so I was stuck with a $1,000 bill while making $7.35 an hour. Speaking of hours, at the particular store I worked at, I either got 1-3 days a week but multiple shifts, or 3-5 days a week with 1 shift. My manager was great, so was the district manager, but the company does a lot of stupid stuff to shoot themselves in the foot and made our lives miserable. In fact, I was being trained as an assistant manager when I just told my manager that I didn't want the promotion anymore. $10 an hour wasn't worth the long hours and aggravation I saw the company putting their managers through - I'd rather deal drugs and risk going to federal prison."
good,Typical customer service job. I've learned customer service skills as well as social skills to help communicate with customers. Management is hit or miss depending on the region and store. Most stores are only focused on numbers with customer care coming in second. Hardest part is trying to balance numbers with more than acceptable customer care. The best part of the job was definitely helping and chatting with customers with the same hobbies as I.
good,Its not so much the work itself as much as it is the way your made to work. They act like your some super high end salesmen who who will have to stress their whole shift about numbers when they have a kid who is counting out quarters to pay for a eight dollar game. In what way is up-selling going to happen in this way. Overall they need to make HUGE company changes.
good,"Many interactions with customers are entertaining and enjoyable, but the overall atmosphere of the store was stressful and fast paced, and having time to actually spend with the customers was rare, compared to the time spent changing marketing and stock in the store 2 and 3 times a week in order to satisfy the DM."
good,"Die Arbeit an sich macht sehr spass, aber die Bezahlung ist nicht so gut."
good,Enjoyed the management and being able to go to work each day and see returning and new guests that I was able to interact and share similar interests with.
good,I loved the game culture there it was fun and rewarding helping people find the games they love. the pay was not a living wage and the work was endless because its the big companies that drive that company so if they want more wall space or more promotional space you have to rearrange the whole store for that. the perks are great when it comes to games but the benefits are horrible especially to a manager who will likely end up working 60 to 80 hour work weeks on salary so they don't have to pay overtime. but its a dying business because of online retail and developers selling there own stuff on consoles and phones and tablets.
good,The job itself is fun. I worked with a great crew. I had to manage several people and the day to day activities. The hardest part is when corporate wants you to push sales on regular customers who know what they want or push on elderly customers who have no idea. I loved this job and was great until I became part of management.
good,"Game stop was by far my favorite job I love video games so being able to bring personal and work life together was amazing, customers could sometimes be a hand full but the jb its self felt really rewarding when retun customers came and stated how much they loved  game we recommended"
good,"Occasionally great managers. Dismal hours if you arent the manager, assistant manager or the top 2 keyholders. Don't bother unless you are young, like video games and absolutely need a job."
good,Hardest part of the job is keeping track with all the new video game their features compared to past video games. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with coworkers and working together to accomplish task.
good,"I was a cashier for GameStop. This entailed ringing up customers' purchases, making returns, answering phone calls and customers' questions, cleaning, organizing, and being knowledgeable about each different gaming console."
good,"vendita e assistenza di videogiochi, conoscenza informatica"
good,This company has a massive inventory and horrible marketing strategies. with digital media platforms and social media creating a competitive edge it has to improve on current business practices.
good,"I got lucky and joined up with a really good store family, we all did our best to look out for each other and still do! My only real complaint is the lack of opportunities to advance. I've been at the store a year now and was passed over for and SGA position almost instantly."
good,job was okay the only thing is if you don't make enough sales your hours get cut I ended up leaving for the same reason but other than that management was very nice
good,"The co-workers I started out with were great. The typical day as an SGA if opening counting the safe, doing trade bin, beginning the day setting the pace for the day ahead.  For closing, breaking down the registers and making sure the store was prepared for the next day. The customers are awesome its just not much room for advancement and raises in addition to no overtime allowed or its grounds for termination or write ups."
good,As the store leader you are responsible for the store out come in daily sales. Which means you have the right people working to cover the store that way guest can get the best service.
good,"In my time with GameStop I had 3 different store managers in a 2 year span. the hours I worked when I first got hired were very few, but I knew that when applying, I worked hard and got to management in 6 months and regular hours. I didn't have time to learn the culture of the job, later I learned it but it was nearing the latter part of my employment. A lot of the overturn seemed to be more drama based, out of the people that were hired with me 2 years ago, I was the only remaining one out of the 2. the other was my store manager who had many years of management experience ahead of me, at that location."
good,"At Gamestop we spent most of our time on the floor with customers, stocking the sales floor, and working the cash register."
good,This a place where game knowledge can be beat out by opinion and customer preference. Being bias will have to be put to the side. To make sells it is best to be observant to the customer needs. Management is very help when there are problems and everyone will greatly act as a team. The hardest part is having to tell kids bad news about the game they want like they are either young for it or it has a lot of violence. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing what the families are into playing together.
good,"Dipende dal turno che si fa, la mattina è più organizzativa, cioè ci sono da verificare i prezzi, i giochi in uscita, la conta degli hardware esposti e quelli in magazzino, il marketing. Il pomeriggio essendoci  più affluenza di clienti ci si dedica maggiormente alla vendita, che ovviamente è mirata ad alcuni prodotti piuttosto che ad altri."
good,"I loved this job. I loved what I was selling, I loved how laid back it was, and I loved most of my managers. Some of the higher ups though were extremely horrible. One District Manager actually threatened to call my managers pregnant wife and explain to her why her husband no longer had a job. There were no benefits since I was part time but no promotion opportunities either. I learned that if a job is not willing to help push you forward, then there is no need to stay there. My co-workers were amazing. We all worked together nicely, joked around a bit, and always got things done. We were very well synchronized. The hardest part about this job was trading in games. Customers would come up to the register with a game they paid $60 for not even 4 weeks ago, and Game Stop would only give them $15. There wasn't anything I could do, and it was hard to explain that to the customer. I had to explain that I could not override the system and that there was not anything else I could do for them. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers. Each customer was unique and different with different preferences. I learned about new games and media info from customers and some customers became very dear to me that we were on a first name basis. To reiterate, I loved this job, I just wish there were possibilities for me to get promoted."
good,Typical day at work just compiles on coming in cleaning up restocking the shelves assisting customers in finding what they want or answering questions and selling them their items. Ive learned a bit from this place though more about the point of sales part of it and about the product. While being there I have only worked with the manager there so cant say much about anyone else but it is a friendly envirnment and manager does what he needs to. Hardest part for me there would be remembering the rewards program benefits after not much training or practice getting it down. Most enjoyable part is that i get to interact with other people and help them get what they want.
good,"La experiéncia propia la verdad fue un tanto rara, los supervisores o jefes nunca pisaban la tienda, muchas ofertas y obligación de vender las ofertas y productos en una tienda que casi no había gente."
good,this is a fun place to work except for a few things. They pay is horrible as a part time employee and once you get into management they money gets better but they start treating you like dirt. Your job is constantly on the line.
good,Gamestop was a great place for me to work during college. The company is not what made it great though. Being surrounded by people that had the same interests as me was healthy and helped shape the person I am today.
good,"I loved my job. I really did. Lately, it's been draining. Such a shame. I love my co-workers and most customers, but the people running the company are a complete joke."
good,"Working with games is always fun, and i quite liked the job. But the pay is so poor that you would literally do better at walmart. Pretty sad to be honest."
good,"lavoro inizialmente fantastico, poi subentrano i kpi e inizi ad essere frustato a livelli stratosferici dai tuoi capi, che se non fai tot vendite di tot prodotti al giorno sei morto, non si può obbligare la gente a comprare garanzie che non vogliono e che fanno benissimo a non volere."
good,GameStop is a good place to work for younger adults who are in high school or college. Its a very laid back environment with some room to move but would not consider it a life long career.
good,I knew it was a temporary job and i got the hours that would be expect of such position. Even though it was a temporary job Idid get a lot of experience working in retail.
good,"The higher up in management you progress, the less likely you are able to spend time with family including holidays. Guest experiences are great and if you have a real passion for gaming, this is the job for you. Just be prepared for the guests that often treat you like garbage for no reason, even if you go outside of policy to resolve the issue."
good,"As store leader, I am responsible for the growth and management of all operations at my specific store location.  I oversee hiring, inventory, store set-up and marketing, employee scheduling and the overall day to day activities involved with working within a retail environment."
good,"Ever since I was a kid I have loved video games and having a job to sell them was a dream of mine that started when I walked into a GameStop for the first time. However, don't think this job is just a walk in the park. Learning the product takes time and learning how to approach customers, asking them if they needed help and use my knowledge of games effectively to help them find what they wanted was not easy when I first started. Having a love for video games and meeting customers who share that love, not to mention my own coworkers who not only shared my love for video games but also knew the struggles of not having confidence in approchanging a customer, made learning the job enjoyable and a pleasure."
good,Pretty good place to work for a high school or college kid that needs some extra cash. You don't get many hours so its definitely not something you can support yourself on unless you are and assistant store manager or store manager.
good,The role I was given was a standard retail job. It has its ups and downs but the job wasn't enough to keep me for the long run. Lots of upselling and number reaching to the point where it contributed to how many hours you get per week.
good,My time in this company is a bag of mixed feelings. It was a great place to work due to culture and environment. Unfortunately the stress to get your numbers and the lack of hours at times was hard to deal with.
good,"The guidelines are constantly changing, so it's very difficult to help customers sometimes. The people who work there are mostly kind, but there are some bad eggs."
good,"The store itself is not too bad to work for. Management was less than professional and eventually lost his job. Overall, not a terrible job but not a career."
good,"I truly enjoy my time at Gamestop. A typical day at Gamestop consists of assisting guests, receiving/stocking product, inventory control, and training team members. For me the best part of this job is educating both kids and parents on the various products and services that they are interested in. With my tenure with company I have gained an extensive knowledge of various gaming products which helps me earn the trust of my guests. Since my employment with gamestop back in 2011 I have learned a lot about effective communication and time management. These skills are invaluable for any job and not just in retale."
good,"I love getting to help families find the games they are looking for, and to talk game with the customers. The dress code is ridiculous though - we're a game store, we should be able to look trendy and fun, not professional all the time. I also get a lot of flack for being female, every GS store I've worked at, customers comment on my gender. What's so special about being a lady that plays games?"
good,I worked for GameStop directly after I was finished with my service in the army. I was given may promises about an hourly salary and hours that I never received and in turn led to me almost loosing my car at the time. My hopes are that if i ever worked for GameStop again the experience would be much better.
good,"Gamestop is a company that makes you pull out your best just for any oppurtunity to work, only through proving yourself and patience will you get more hours of work each week"
good,The managers expect a lot  out of the employees and give them little time to do so its only with the team in the store it can all get done. Some of the best people you could work with.
good,GameStop is great for geek culture. I always felt a disconnect between upper management and the employees on the sales floor. The pay isn't anything to brag about for all the work that we do on a day to day. I love my discounts and free swag through out the year.
good,"The company is excellent to work for in terms of the work required and performed, but employees are undervalued. The work is not difficult, and is very rarely unpleasant to deal with."
good,"GameStop is a good company to work for if you are able to sell, manage and able to stay organized and articulate detail to the team. It also helps if you have an active interest in video games and entertainment culture! GameStop is always changing to keep up and even stay ahead other retail brands. The place is what you make of it and you can find yourself to be surrounded by amazing people."
good,I actually loved the job and the people I got to meet and work with. My only real problems were lack of advancement and the pay rate.... Everything else was great Fast paced at times.
good,"Before I was hired, the management couldn't hold down a time for an interview. Once I was hired, I received no training except from a friendly co-worker. Our store was plagued by frequent robberies, about once a week. I was eventually laid off because I had no training. Despite everything, I enjoyed working with customers and working with my teammates."
good,"On a typical day it's not busy at all in the morning, so I always got all the operational side of things done early so that later in the day the sole focus would be assisting the customers and driving for reservations, pre owned product, trades, and warranties on products."
good,"Although my training was 1/4 of the required training it was still a fun place to work. Awesome to be around games, and the people you get to meet are awesome."
good,GameStop was a great place to work a bit hectic at time but never a bad place. Management was fine till a new one came he was not fair to anyone in the store and was just a bit too over the top.
good,"I love video games, this was probably the only reason I tried to stick to GameStop. Most work days were very boring and pointless, as I was only a guest gaming adviser. My hours were very short and didn't pay nearly enough."
good,Always busy with no downtime. Would get moved from area to area able to work in almost every department. Would get told by lunch if you have overtime that day.
good,"it's fun to work at with many regulars and many new customer. the GA and SGA employee are amazing and kind, but the team leaders are lazy and irresponsible in following any and almost all company protocol."
good,Retail so I wasn't expecting much but I still had fun. Worked with good co-workers. Had a pretty good manager. Even now I go in and am friends with the new manager. That type of store. It's pretty relaxed. A really good..first job..but no life career. There's just almost no chance to move up.
good,"Decent place to work but advancement isnt and option and especally for women, NOT a place for women with children at all,"
good,"love interacting with customers, fun and relaxed enviornment besides the holiday season. loved working here for the holiday season."
good,"The culture and community there can be amazing but, much of the upper management puts far too much pressure on the staff below them. Upper management demands high performance levels from their staff to an unreasonable extreme on a regular basis. Be aware of this especially as a store manager. I refused to move up due to this very reason. My numbers were stellar, I loved my job, had high standards, and did well. But, the DM was so overbearing that I knew if I moved up, I would have ZERO work-life balance and be put under a constant amount of unnecessary pressure."
good,"During the early hours of my work day I was cleaning up the store to prepare for the more crowed later hours. I learned that finding a career where I can grow both personally and professionally wouldn't be an easy task. The management was poor, the scheduled would be changed more than three times a week, I wasn't updated, and had to call the store daily to find out if i worked that day. the most difficult part of this job was scheduling, however the most enjoyable part was helping customers I felt fulfilled when a customer was satisfied."
good,"Fun work place, with plenty of work to stay engaged."
good,"For a typical day things always changed, and it kept me on my toes. I learned management skills, great customer service skills, selling skills, and problem solving skills. As for management, and coworkers I loved working with them, but the management could've been better. The hardest part was dealing with the lack of hours, and pay. Other than that I loved working here."
good,"Game Stop is one of the worse places to work especially as a veteran, the company isn't too military friendly. Depending on where you work location wise also depends on what is going to happen. There's no real loyalty to those who are loyal to the company. Once you make it to the position of Store Manager it's either you're a target/pawn or a protected liability by the District Manager. There's no team, loyalty though the company may try to encourage that it's just a fairy tale. It's either you're brown nosing to secure your position or you're out the door with no warning or remorse. You can be let go for the simplest thing regardless if it was under your control or not. The goals that upper management set at times are unrealistic and they will expect you to turn it around over night."
good,"The people I worked with were great however management made so many poor decisions it felt as though they never walked into gamestop. Many times they would make changes and the majority caused a loss in customers. They promote based purely on how ""cute"" you are. IF they higher girls they will promote the cute flirty ones in weeks. I had some of the best numbers I was the only employee with no write ups and 0 late days, but in one week they hired and then promoted a girl who couldnt get the alphabet right and literally could not perform her job. They don't like logic but the lower level people are a blast to work with."
good,Cool place to work at. learned a lot about new and old game systems and games. Management was pretty decent and fair. co-workers were fair and welcoming. hardest part was learning the cash register. most enjoyable part was organizing shelves and assisting customers.
good,"I was young when I started at gamestop but my career ended abruptly because of one thing. Subscriptions and Reserves. This company is all about those two things. If you don't get them, you pretty much should be looking for another job. I would say that a typical day at work would be waiting around till someone came in to talk or ask questions about games and maybe purchase something. The management at the time were very friendly but also harsh when you didn't get any reserves or subscriptions. Though the environment was classic gamer friendly, always talking about games and releases, was great. The hardest part of the job for me was alphabetizing all the games in the store on the shelves and in the bins. This might not seem like something that is that hard to do but when you get a whole release of games coming out and how much you have to shift and figure out where to fit these new titles into the shelves, you end up getting confused and having to do it all over again. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I bought a game, i got a discount, that was pretty much it, otherwise they treated me like dirt and made me drive games all over the place or pick up games from other stores without additional pay or compensation of gas money and I was an IN STORE SALES ASSOCIATE."
good,If you love the games and want to help others all day this is the best job for you to be at and you can be a nerd without having to get laughed at.
good,A fun place to work. Great employees there but never a chance of advancement. A lot of favoritism.
good,A typical day is like most retail places but with a lot more items to help people to find. During the holidays it is a lot of knowing what microscopes and telescopes people are wanting for what age the rest of the year its testing motors and helping with science projects.
good,"You pretty much walk around on Eggshells in this company. You are totally expendable and they will fire you or threaten to fire you over tiny mistakes that can easily be fixed. I had one manager call my house instead of my cell phone to chew me out about an iPad i marked down as defective. This was something I did not fight at all. I owned up to this and said I am ready for what they want to do with me. Instead of threatening to fire me, They spoke about firing somebody else instead. That right there told me a lot about my job security, because one day I could go out on my break, somebody could mess up very badly, and I would get fired for something, that someone else did and was properly trained for and had nothing to do with me? So I chose to leave after that. They only offer health benefits to management  and nobody else, which is something else I did not agree with. You also will not get pay raises. You could work there for 2 years and you will still be stuck at minimum wage. They also refuse to give  employees unemployment, instead of letting you go, they will not give you any hours and they do this, so you will quit, just so they wont have to pay you unemployment. "
good,"I had a great time working for the company.  However, upper management handled the layoff I experienced poorly and the execution of the whole thing was poorly guided."
good,"I started working at GameStop just as the bought out EB Games, and it brought on a change to the company that may have ruined the overall understanding that ""we exist as long as we give people what they need."" once that was lost it became part of the ""bottom line"" mentality and that's when it became very hard to work there. The policy became all about saving money and cheating the employees and costumers. Even worse is now that everyone knows this they still do it."
good,"What I needed to accomplish during any regular work day:"
good,a great place to work although the pay was minimum wage but besides that as long as you do whats expected of you its a great place to work
good,"Everyday was definitely fast-paced-even more so with our store being located inside of a shopping mall. It was here that I learned the importance of following an order to the fullest, and to not let a co-worker fall if I could help it. The management at GameStop was wonderful. There were set guidelines and daily procedures to be followed. The co-workers made it fun and were also the most enjoyable part of going in to work. The hardest part of the job would have been dealing with the lacking amount of weekly store hours given to employees. One week you may be given 20 hours, while the next week you will be given 7 hours."
good,"Definitely a dream job for video gamers, and anyone interested in new and old technology. Day to day operations involved running a 1.5 million a year store, and responsible for loss prevention and many other daily retail tasks."
good,"Nice and fun plentiful work environment, though a little unfair with hours and constant hiring of new staff before giving already hired employees work hours. Learned cashier, stock, better customer service and money management. Hardest part of the job is dealing with certain customers, most enjoyable is dealing with customers who enjoy what they buy who we can relate to."
good,"Depending on the management it had its ups and downs. Some managers just gave a very negative attitude everyday, not really passing on important information about the changes in the company."
good,"A typical day at work included ensuring customer satisfaction, while maintaining a clean and productive working environment. Throughout this experience, I learned the ins and outs of opening and closing a store. I experienced how to effectively help and advise customers. I was shown the best ways to keep up with this changing environment. The hardest part of this job was leaving when a better opportunity came along. The most enjoyable part of this job was helping parents keep informed about the positive benefits of certain games on their children."
good,"store maintains cleanliness and organisation at all times, management was always friendly and customer drived. Co-workers were friendly. hardest part of the job was selling the game informer (store magazine) the most enjoyable part is talking about new and upcoming games"
good,"A typical day work was about production and different project, I learned more about leadership, and managing my work with different rapports, it was a team work with all my co-workers to attempt the goal of the company."
good,Was a good place to work but was only a seasonal job only. Wish I could have worked longer.
good,Great staff.
good,Gamestop is a fun work space. I learned a good bit about the store and how their deals work and why their lrices are the way they are. Working there opened my eyes to what the general public doesnt understand.
good,I work the was the most reliable and has alright number the management want to keep me cause normally the decide this time corporate took the matter into there own hands and made the store managers upset
good,"If you are full time, you will probably get enough hours. If you're part time, the hours vary wildly depending on season. Holidays are great but during slow season you don't get enough hours to survive. Better have some supplemental income"
good,Work is fairly structured with what is expected of you with numbers you are supposed to reach and quotas you are meant to achieve.  You are encouraged to take your own spin on how you interact with the customers and treat them like real people.
good,Trys to be fun and fast paced but is all about numbers no matter what. So it was fun people to work with and customer were great but upper management was bad
good,"Gamestop started out very fun and relaxed. However upon being promoted to manager, it was very difficult to maintain a life outside of work. They treat you as if you are the owner of the store. Responsibilities grew yet the pay didnt"
good,"Be ready for a high pace and expected performance goals. This job is about sales not video games so be aware and ready to work. You need skills that allow you to communicate clearly to guests and sell, sell, sell!"
good,most nights you do get to work. you only work nights for about 4 hours a day but only work 2 days a week. it is a failing business who can't keep enough hours for everyone
good,My very first job and I loved it! i would recommend any gamer to work there. Discounts aren't that great though. It was fun yet stressful at times working for Gamestop.
good,"Overall, working at gamestop has been so far my favorite place to work. both managers have been my favorites, and being around and talking about games is great. only thing that sucks is the tedious work, and the fact that unless you're an assistant manager or manager, it's always gonna be part time."
good,"I applied thinking I would be receiving good hours and looked forward to saving for the things I would need. The hours were decent at first but then it started becoming a, ""will I even get hours this week,"" type of deal. Management was a bit poor and that is a reason I left."
good,It is a friendly work environment where everybody cares for everybody. The supervisors are ready to help all the time with anything needed. I love the company.
good,"I love working for GameStop. My only complaint is that upper management expects there employees to move mountains.I had to work Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Christmas Eve, even though my Assistant Manager had all those days off as well as another Associate. I eventually moved and requested a transfer. It took a week for them to tell me I had to reapply in a different district and I had to contact them when they said they'd call me back. Upper management needs better communication skills with their employees and shouldn't work them on days that should be spent with family."
good,"Ottima esperienza, stare a contatto con il cliente e renderlo felice è un'ottima occasione di crescita"
good,"I've enjoyed working as a supervisor at Gamestop, the only really issues are with the guests, besides this, enjoyable environment. The circle of life/ selling culture can be a bit tricky and unfair at times, but if you get past that, it's smooth sailing"
good,"I loved the work I did at GameStop; speaking with customers, helping them find what they need and recommending games and products that would best suit their needs. I also didn't mind having to file games away in the drawers or alphabetizing the games on the walls."
good,"Meeting people and playing and talking gaming, this was a great summer job. Setting up in-store contests was a great experience for making it fun for everyone."
good,The main issue I have with game stop is that they don't give you enough working hours unless you are full time. But as a seasonal I did everything I expected to do.
good,"The typical day at work was clock in help with the customers. Had to tidy up the store, for example clean the windows of the store, organize the walls where the product placed at, and put away games in back counter. The work place was always fun due to the staff. Management was great also."
good,"è un ambiente di lavoro giovane e a contatto col pubblico ogni giorno,si impara a usare computer,effettuare resi di merce alla sede,si risolvono i problemi coi clienti per quanto riguarda console e giochi"
good,The company wants you to be a A+ employee offering nothing in return. Pay is terrible and the benefits... There are no benefits just a 15% discount in some things not everything. No complaints on the management that was great.
good,"This a fantastic job for youth to apply to. Whether video games are your passion or not, you can always learn something about our company. A typical day has me meeting goals while delivering the best customer service my store is known for!"
good,"GameStop is a wonderful place to work, up to a point. It taught me teamwork and time management. Managers can vary from locations. I've worked with wonderful managers who pushed us to have fun while working hard, making us all strive to be better and have had managers who are there only to collect their check and do nothing beyond set in backroom. The workplace is often a varying paced workplace filled with conversations with customers and fellow employees about games and pop culture. The hardest part of the job is the madness that comes with Black Friday sales and meeting the ridiculous goal of getting a quota of people to sign up for membership programs. (You are penalized for failing; up to and including termination.) The easiest part is building a working relationship with customers."
good,"it was fun, the co workers are cool and so are the customers.Easy job and sometimes slow except during the holidays.its a chill place to work at and the discounts were good."
good,It paid the bills. Its a fun place to work for a teenager or a young adult with no real bills to pay. The checking out new games for 4 days to try out was pretty cool. Thats bout it
good,"Very High paced environment throughout the year. A fun place to socialize and work with like minded people. The hours aren't great for starting positions nor is the pay. However as a place to keep you busy during the winter season for some extra pocket money."
good,"Fast paced store."
good,"It's a dream come true for the people who want to make some money and work around the things that they love, but the idea of the circle of life policies that had dropped, helps improve work-employee relations."
good,It was fun working their but the district manager was NOT a good boss. He was not good at encouragement or constructive criticism. But overall being able to work with something you enjoy doing in your free time is rewarding.
good,"The managers seem to always be on the staff to do more and more even when doing so is entirely impossible. For example, many managers will berate and out right fire employees for not being able to make a sales quota or will tell an employee not to sell a game to a customer because it is new. Everything seems to be all about numbers and not about ensuring our customers are happy. Not a bad experience but not one I would recommend for long term employment."
good,"A typical day usually entails ringing up customers while trying to balance daily operations. My workplace involved me dealing with other associates from the store manager down to the entry level GA. My immediate coworkers were great people and fun to work with. Sometimes the requirements from upper management made no sense, such as: increasing sales numbers in a plethora of areas while maintaining a slowly increasing operation load. That was honestly the most frustrating part. The best part was when you have regular customers come in and you get lost talking about video games."
good,"Sell protection plans and pre-orders every day. I learned to time manage. Everyone works well together. We are all friends, even new employees. The toughest part about the job is surviving a visit from the regional manager and selling so many good items away. The most enjoyable are the friends working alongside you and the power to hold onto a game before anyone else."
good,"As a shift leader, I was expected to get specific items done before the store opened most mornings, and then from that point take care of customers when we opened. Taking care of customers would be sporadically easy or difficult, but the surveys were expected to be perfect otherwise you would be in trouble."
good,If you need some extra money this is a good place for a person to go. They had barely any issues with customer service mostly because they make sure that you understand what to do in certain situations.
good,"Basically everyday is a different opportunity to push goals and initiatives amongst the staff in general. The business practically runs itself with the proper training of key employees. Performance should be more so merited with pay increases of at least $1 or $2/year especially if you bring a store from 3,6xx out of 5,000 stores ranking up to 867 for a 0.40 cent raise...RIDUCULOUS...GAMESTOP STORE #979 in DETROIT, MI"
good,"Expected to push non essential items, like over sized bags, to customers who did not want them. Most of the people were great but the manager at the time made things hard on everyone. Company itself deals in dirty marketing and made me feel dishonest."
good,"a typical day at gamestop would be selling merchandise such as video games, cell phone/plans, and other electronic devices"
good,"I'm happy I worked for this company, they have good benefits and great perks. But it is very demanding of your time. I do not recommend for people with families."
good,"I loved my job at Gamestop. Video games are my plateau, so it was naturally a great job for me. Sadly, the store in which I worked for had some issues in management. They often picked favorites and even went so far as to let one of their employees live with them. In the end, I was fired over an accidental policy violation and the person living with my boss took my job. "
good,"schedules are horrid, rarely ever working (great home time)"
good,"Performed daily on hand checks to ensure inventory accuracy. Performed an annual inventory count to check our loss/gain. Thrived on excellent customer service so that customers could have the best experience purchasing video game hardware and games. Trained new employees, created weekly schedules, and open and closed stores through the week. The hardest part of the job was trying to schedule and merchandise for the holidays. The most enjoyable part was being recognized as the top store in all the nation for the most reservations on Halo 2."
good,"Fun place to work"
good,"A normal day at GameStop consists of standing behind a counter or walking along the shelves making sure everything is in the correct spot about 50 times a day, it may get old but it keeps you occupied. The people you meet there are really what makes GameStop a good place to work, I had never met someone I was not really fond of working there and everyone I had met was very friendly. The difficulty of the job was keeping people, people were not just leaving they were being promoted so quickly or advancing or being moved around that it became difficult to manage a store. I'm not saying its all that bad dividing 40 hours among 2 employees rather than 4-5 but it can get hectic."
good,"Overall Gamestop can be a great place to work if you are looking for a sales person experience, there is a lot of pressure to sell pre-orders, rewards cards, insurance and now credit cards. If you don't provide the numbers they want, you probably won't be scheduled more than 5 hours a week.  This is not the gamer dream job."
good,You will learn and succeed with as much effort as you put in and how fast you can learn.  It requires a lot of work in the beginning to understand the culture and way of doing things.  It can very rewarding to work with employees and customers.
good,ran day to day operations. hired and trained all new employees. customer service and writing schedules for employed. maintained store cleanliness.
good,It was ok not really any specific ups or downs just a seasonal position management was ok but nothing to brag about same with work pay and benifits
good,"Working for Gamestop can be incredibly rewarding on a good day. Helping a consumer find something for entertainment purpose and holding discussions about future games and products can be exciting. You'll have the opportunity to educate customers and individuals about new aspects of the industry they might not have known about or learn things that you hadn't heard before in a consistently growing, expanding and evolving industry. "
good,Keeping the store organized.  Help customers with what they are looking for and giving them advise on what could be a better choice or help find something similar to what they were looking for.
good,"* Customer care"
good,"a typical day at work"
good,"è stato un lavoro dove la forza di volontà  e la capacità di lavorare in una forte pressione lavorativa sono state messe a dura prova."
good,"Overall, working at Gamestop is a fun experience as far as working in retail goes.  It's enjoyable to talk to customers about their gaming, as well as learning information about games and systems from customers and other employees.  The employee discount is nice if you're really into gaming, but the pay rate for the ""keyholder"" position is low compared to other similar positions that I've held for other retailers."
good,"A typical day at work was always fun"
good,"Rang out customers. stocked shelves, took preorders. God to work with some fun people and talk about something that I loved"
good,"Customer service is always rough, no matter what the gig, and Gamestop is no different. however one thing does stand out. The power up rewards program and reserves. the employees there bug the daylights out of customers for these things and i never knew why...after 6 years i know why....THEY WILL FIRE YOU IF YOU DONT GET MANY many many of these things per week average of 23-26% of all your sales must be in new power-up subscribers, anohter 19-26% Must be reserves of new titles....you hit thise and your good you miss them for a few weeks{even by 1 % like i did and your tenure and awards do not mean anything, your gone. plain and simple."
good,Wasn't there long enough to tell you the complete analysis of this place
good,"Fast paced."
good,"The best thing about Gamestop was that everyday had a different flavor. Daily duties varied depending on the customer flow, sales goals and company focus. Adapting to change was a key requirement, due to the fluid nature of the video game industry. Over the years I learned how to develop the team members to prepare them for the next level. I became a better manager by working to improve my skills and staying open to feedback from all levels of the organization. The hardest part of my job was when a team member failed to meet their goals after going through the coaching process. This would lead to further action and in most cases would result in separation for that team member. What I enjoyed the most about the job was dealing with the customers and finding solutions to service issues that would arise. I also enjoyed seeing team members grow and get promoted into higher levels. Having an impact on someone's life and career  was awesome."
good,"learned customer skill, negotiation of customer complaints."
good,"Easy but frustrating, the customers can be rude. the most enjoyable part of the job is learning about games."
good,"Skills I have learned include: handling a cash register, overseeing employees, enforcing sales goals. The hardest aspect of this job is to make help each individual customer find a product that they need, and most enjoyable is working with video games."
good,"Gamestop was my second job. It was okay, however I didn't get many hours, especially since it was during the peak of the recession. I loved my coworkers and manager though! They were pretty good at hiring friendly people."
good,"The company as a whole was fun to work for, yet there is very little room for advancement and some managers both district and local dont fight to keep their employees of over 5 years. Though the time I was there, the rest of the staff that I worked with were excellent. My time spent developing relationships with customers and other businesses was very rewarding."
good,"Strict, challenging work environment. During my time at Gamestop, I was in charge of many different things from inventory control/management to customer relations and sales. Due to rough economic times, our store had very little hours over-all to work with for scheduling other help, etc. and this made it very difficult at times to get everything that needed to be done, finished."
good,I would say this was a great job to have it was fun and the way to go if your video gamer. I would help my team and customer to find the right game for them or the game that they wanted when coming into the store. I would to over look inventory and check in shipment that was sent in from the warehouse.
good,"A typical day at work would be helping customers by providing them with information on the games, the gaming systems, warranty's, extra accessories. Helping the manager, assistant manager or the key holder with duties that has to be done at the store."
good,Typical day includes helping customers find and get the games they are looking for as well as keeping them well informed about the current sales and promotions in the store as well as informing them of upcoming game releases.
good,"This is definitely a great summer job, the job security isn't the strongest but there is a small chance of advancement in the gaming industry through this company"
good,"GameStop is a good place for a part time job, would be a good fit for high school or college student looking for some extra spending money, There habit of over staffing stores leads to low hours for each member and hard to keep an adult motivated to preform on 6 hours a week."
good,"Worked as a store manager for 3 years. Loved the work environment and all of the fun that came along with being the store manager. Could dictate my store functions and worked very close to the other managers in the district. GameStop is very stingy with payroll and expects the sm to work at least 44 hours a week. Not including extra time spent with inventories and extra stuff. Overall, I had a great time with the yearly conferences in Vegas and all of the added training. Wish there was a quicker way for advancement. Pay is also not determined by the amount of your stores overall volume which I find to be a poor decision."
good,"A great place to work, if you do not need much moneey through the summer or are extremely good at budgeting. At times, through the summer, down to 20 or less hours a week, but through September through December, 60+ hours were likely. Great group of people to work for/with. Benefits are excellent. Dental is covered as well as eye, health coverage is very well accommodated.. and options for 401K as well as legal benefits"
good,"Considering it was only PT it was still a great setting for sales ,because it is an interest everyone has this time of generation . I loved getting to know the customer as well as the games themselves . I've worked in Sales for more than 2 years and i think its the best way to get to know people more by interacting ."
good,only thing that would make it better more hours...
good,Can be a lot of fun to work for. Fellow employees are great to get along with. Too much pressure on meeting quotas. A lot of empty promises when it comes to advancement.
good,"È stata una bellissima esperienza. I ragazzi con cui ho intrapreso questo lavoro mi hanno fatto sentire subito a mio agio, ho lavorato bene. Ho svolto vari compiti tra cui allestimento vetrine, allestimento scaffali, gestione magazzino, utilizzo del misuratore fiscale."
good,They really tried here. My friends said dont work here you wont like it I actually loved my first few months here. My managers were cool and so were my friends and the discounts were the best.
good,Easy and simple work great place to start out and get experience with customer relations and business  expectations allowing you to learn and better understand what companies expect and how to meet or exceed expectations
good,Competitivo e stimolante GameStop ha rappresentato una tappa importante per la mia crescita professionale
good,Good place to work bad with hours. Kept us safe and helped with training kept work enviroment clean and very noce management but very stingey with hours
good,"Working for GameStop is a rewarding experience, especially for those who are passionate about video games and geek culture. Management is friendly and understanding."
good,"This is an incredibly easy and laid back job environment most days out of the year. Tasks include changing prices, unloading shipment, hands-on experience with customers and their tech, along with the pushing of drivers and membership applications. As long as you can meet daily requirements and enjoy discussing the culture of the business with customers, you'll fit right in!!"
good,GameStop for me was a great place to work. It worked with my work-life balance. But often they would give you more tasks than available to complete. On many occasions sales would be  changed or added  at  the last minute.
good,"Being paid to discuss and sell video games is awesome, especially if you play games! There's no reason to be nervous to ask questions when you just started because even the highest of employees have questions too!"
good,"New upper management is reorganizing the company. There is a sense of urgency with management. They have let a lot of experience in the company go in the latest round of layoffs."
good,"I enjoyed working there and for a while I did not want to leave. However, after months of being scheduled for only 3 or 4 hour shifts i needed to find another job. They will work with your schedule and is a good part time job but I needed more and there was nothing in the budget to give me more"
good,La giornata lavorativa passa velocemente ci si diverta ma si ha sempre un riguardo verso ciò che desidera il cliente.
good,"It was seasonal work. They did have a flux of customers. The store I worked at was pretty big so there was no short of customers. It was an experience, a short one, but an experience no less."
good,"All it is , putting games on the self while  making sure  the customer is token care of while  making sure they are happy  with  their experience  and with the game"
good,A typical day of work required a lot of helping costumers with the sales for the week and ways to help them save the most money as possible. The workspace itself is very open and requires to go to the cashier and sales floor.
good,"My experience with Gamestop has been pleasant thus far, just don't expect a lot of hours or pay (being minimum wage). Work and life balance with my personal managers are great. Customers besides a few bad apples, however, isn't a bad environment, unless its the holiday season. It's a great job if you are starting out or need a little something while attending university or community college."
good,"La giornata di lavoro era impegnativa a giorni e tranquilla in altri."
good,"Gamestop e un azienda che col passare degli anni e mutata molto e con essa i rapporti con i propri dipendenti, una volta Gamestop era l eldorado del lavoro oggi non più"
good,"very fun place to work if you enjoy retail and video games, great for first time managers, or people wanting to move up ( at a store level) job is sales and customer oriented but you are able to work your way up through GameStop as I did ."
good,Working for Gamestop is a lot of fun. You learn about new releases usually before a lot of the public knows. You often also get a bunch free stuff. Nothing huge but small 'swag' things. Plus discounts on games and consoles.
good,"Fun place to work, a little hectic at times, low pay and hours, but overall its the experience that made it fun. Unless your a manager you don't get the hours or pay needed."
good,"Loved everything about it,  but was there for almost 2 years and even though I had the top average performance of the store I was looked over for promotion to the assistant managers buddy who was the last season's hold over."
good,Great way to better Public speaking and working well with others. Helps promote more effective and efficient vocabulary and has areas for growth and improvement within the company.
good,The training was very comprehensive and the environment was fast-paced. If you are looking to get some hands-on with working with tech then this is the job for you.
good,Had a great work experience here. Made some friends and as a team was able to achieve high morale and work completed. Upper management was a little pushy but we remained a strong team.
good,"For the time I worked for Gamestop, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  But minimum wage for maybe 20 hours a week did not cut it for me attempting to live outside of my parent's home and finances.  It was a nice side-job paired with my primary.  But as a standalone it wasn't worthwhile."
good,"I know some people have a difficult time working at GameStop, but I had an enjoyable time, mostly due to my coworkers. If you are in a good and healthy working environment then you will be successful at GameStop."
good,"A typical day at Gamestop revolves around ensuring that store stock is displayed properly and maximizing sales profits. To achieve the sales, employees always had to up-sell. In my experience, even employees with virtually no video game knowledge could be trained to be adept at selling games."
good,"While working at Gamestop, I am often challenged on how to deal with high-stress situations, such as customer orders and refunds. It provides a great learning space and experience that I can use towards future jobs. The hardest part of the job that I have found is having to deal with explosive customers while maintaining a smile and a positive attitude."
good,I love it. I have a great team and even better regulars. I just can not continue to work there because of my medical issues. The hardest part of the job is being there alone during the weekdays because you never know how busy its gonna be.
good,I have learned a lot from this job and it has helped me become more independent. I have more knowledge about video games and retail experience. I do not plan on leaving this job anytime soon.
good,Ok place to work. Got work done on time and people who work there are also phenomenal at doing their job. Work recommend to work at for a first job or seasonal job
good,"It's a great and fun place to work, as long as you have a fun and understanding manager. The one I had was an ex Disney employee. You would think he was fun and full of creative ideas. But no. He wouldn't let us express ourselves through what we wore and was very close minded when it came to promotion ideas."
good,"I would work either alone or with one other employee as we handled the cash register, maintained the floor, and handled customer care. We would also deal with online orders."
good,"I started with the company because I was interested in a career dealing with games. The job is primarily a customer service and sales job. It is often juggling several different task and trying handle both customer service and other store tasks. I have always enjoyed helping people find things to make them happy. It can be hard to maintain a positive attitude in the environment. The brick and mortar sale front is changing and it takes a high level of adaptability to keep up."
good,"Gamestop as a whole is fun to work in, if you love games and talking about them then this is great! Don’t come into it thinking it’s a easy job. If you’ve never done retail then it’s a good entry company they do teach you a lot. Although saying scheduling is based heavy on sales forecasting. Which if you happen to be in a low volume and you’re not an AM or SM you’re screwed for hours. "
good,"If your Gamestop is located in a high traffic area, such as a college town, you are bound to have a wide variety of people to come in."
good,Hab mich sofort wohlgefühlt und wurde gut aufgenommen
good,"If you like video games and want to gain some basic sales skills, this is a great place to do it. The clientele are always very open to suggestions and rely on you for your opinions of games"
good,"This job was interesting. I've met many people and had the ability of discussing something that I enjoy and express great passion in, video games. From discussing new games with people with similar interests to helping grandparents or parents search for a game their child would enjoy based off the description of them. I wish the pay was a little better and the hours more consistent but I can't complain about it really."
good,"The company offers free game borrowing to try out new games, paid vacations, decent pay for the area, and opportunity for advancement from within with complete training."
good,"The typical work day consisted of talking about games and selling them to people. I learned there how to connect with customers, there's always something there that you can talk to someone about. The managers were really helpful and really fun. The hardest part of the job were the hours and the demand to sell pre-owned products, there's always too many people hired so they can't give enough hours and there is the looming need to sell pre-owned."
good,"•	As the Sales associate, I informed customers on the newest releases in the store, Greet customers, provided assistance in finding their desires, Alphabetize products on shelves so customers can find products easily"
good,I worked at GameStop for a few years and it was fun meet a lot of friends there and even meet my girlfriend there it was a very nice place to work but its also for people who are in school or getting out of school
good,"It was a very good job, would love to work there again. The hours were sadly short because I was only a GA but for the time I was there I had the most fun I've had at a job"
good,"i actually liked the job even with the pay not being all that great,because i just loved doing customers service being able to help people everyday gave me that extra push to improve myself"
good,If you have ever worked retail you know this job. You always need to do more. but the downtime is mostly fun. wasn't enough room for advancement within the company.
good,"GameStop is an excellent job choice, getting to meet new people and talk about games all the time. I just wish the pay increases on the annual basis were a bit higher."
good,"If you're opening a typical day at work would be clocking in around a half hour before open, alone, and doing a couple daily counts to ensure inventory and money was accurate. You'd then open and spend the first 6 hours of an 8 hour shift alone, putting up shipment that came in and helping any customers that decided to shop with you. At about hour 6 you're eventual replacement would come in and you could take your break. Closing was a little bit easier because you'd come in and have the opener for at least an hour or two, then be alone for another hour or two, then have your other closer to finish out your shift."
good,è stata un esperienza indubbiamente formativa che mi ha permesso di avere un primo approccio nel mondo del lavoro
good,"The absolute best part of the job is being able to build relationships with guests and other employees, some days it feels more like hanging out with friends or family than an actual job."
good,It was a Good place to work. I thoroughly enjoyed my customers. This is a job in which you have to work contrary to what many people believe. No we do not stand there and play games all day!
good,Work environment is great as you are surrounded by an amazing atmosphere. It's really fun being part of the gaming industry - you get to learn so much about the field.
good,"The co-workers were nice and the work was fast paced, but the employment was very short-lived (exactly two shifts) due too it being a seasonal employment."
good,"work hard to reach your production, with stress about management they chance o move supervisor and manager around in different department, workplace culture is ok. the hardest part is find part to repair your system and when you do not reach 100% in production you have a supervisor telling you that you have a verbal if you no reach Couching etc, to reach to final warning Stress and most enjoyable part are the Co Worker."
good,"I enjoyed selling video games, was discouraged by the pervy clientele and pay rate, coupled with poor amount of hours I wasn't able to make a living. Also, felt I got passed up for a manager position due to military favoring."
good,Working at Gamestop can be a great job at times however there are many times when you are encouraged to push promotions on those who do not wish to hear about it. This can be quite a challenge at times but you will get better at reading your customers feelings and learning how to navigate these transactions better over time
good,"Gamestop is a easy going job depending on your role you can either just talk to customers and recommend games or work the register."
good,I love video games and very much enjoyed my working environment but as I’ve seen it inside and out there isn’t much advancement opportunity at a certain point. With stores of only a few associates there’s rarely need for more managers and assistant managers so once you hit keyholder you can expect that to be just about the end of the line unless you maintain outstanding performance and someone leaves the company.
good,"A lot more work is involved than just talking about games and selling to people, so go into this company with the expectation of working hard and effectively."
good,"Nice managers, decent hours when the store could get them from the higher ups,and fair pay  for what the job was. Also a nice discount on products, which was good."
good,"My co-workers are great. Everyone tries to help each other. Depending on the day of the week it can be busy or slow, but it's not too difficult to find something to do. The manager takes into account what everyone has planned when he makes the schedules. Everyone is fun to be around, too."
good,My first job at Gamestop is one that I look on nostalgically. I love video games so working there as a game advisor and customer service agent worked well. I organized used and new games and kept the workspace clean.
good,"For the most part it was a great place to work at. I had very good management/ co workers that strive for success for yourself and the store. i can only speak for my staff but other locations were't the bets. Hardest job was worrying about persnoal number for reservations, pre owned product, trade ins, and reward cards. every transcation counted either against you or in your favor. it would be difficult to change a customers mind if a new product was cheaper then our used product but our number would look better if i sold  that used one. Also torn between having to help the  customer as well as having postive numbers. Mind you without any commisson or high pay raise. we also dealt with shipment and marketing every week which only managers can do. During store hours while dealing with customers all day."
good,"How to help out people , get everything done in a timely matter , the managers were really great taught everything that was expected in the job. You learned how much of a difference you can make"
good,"Ottimo team lavorativo, buon afflusso di clientela"
good,Fun job great for gaming nerds dosent get many hours or high wage. Management I am under is phenomenal. Depending on where you work and the store environment can change.
good,"I really did enjoy working at Gamestop! They had great team members and taught you a lot even as a beginner. I had the fortune of being teamed up with great people who showed me a bunch and the rest I was quick to pick up. The hardest part of the job was dealing with certain customers who sometimes acted unreasonably if the company's policies did not bend to them. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to interact with people and talk about something I was interested in, games! A downside is that they didn't offer more scholarship opportunities for current students unless you were a store leader or assistant store leader."
good,"Enjoyed the position and the job, however little job security and extremely low turn over rate. They care about their employee's better then other company's within the same area."
good,I loved my time at game stop i got to great costumers stalk shelf and work hard to reorganize mercy . only complaint is i did not get to work anuff this is no ones flat but winter flue and bad date night timing . i loved the team i loved working thar i  dug my boss he was a grate guy with grate energy give everyone a high five if your ever in . its a team and a cool one at that 10/10 would work thar again
good,typical day at work consisted of helping customers find what product they were looking for from systems to video games i learned to speak up my confidence boosted there as i was interacting with people as i was a very shy person
good,I would help customers hind out what they were looking for and answer and questions they have. Mostly worked on the computer and would alphabetize the product. It would get so busy you would get a little overwhelmed but most of the time it was pretty laid back. Almost became a manager but turned it down because of other job.
good,This was a very fun but stressful job at times. I truly miss the customers and people I was able to meet and interact with on a daily basis while working here.
good,"Fun job but not a forever career. The pay was very undesirable, the discounts were great but it doesn't make up for the minimum wage. A lot of late night closing."
good,"I have worked with a few different managers during my time with GameStop, and while the job can be very stressful, it could be a great place to work. The major downside of this company, are the occasional poor management that makes it way through the company, and can turn the environment sour fast."
good,"I loved working here as a seasonal, GA, and SGA (Sales associate/ Third Key). It became more stressful as an assistant but bearable. Now that I am at the store management level I find myself constantly up and down about my feelings of my job. Some days I love it and wouldn't think of leaving, other days I've thought about dropping my keys and leaving. At the end of the day it is retail and based on who your manger is you will either love it or hate it."
good,"If you're passionate about gaming this is a dream job. You befriend the customers, nerd out about your interests, and just in general play around with people all day. Its a perfect balance of work and fun"
good,Management is generally good and environment is laid back. Training was well done. It is a fun place to work but they do not have enough hours at the store to work everyone enough all of the time and the pay starts low.
good,"Ambiente di lavoro a contatto diretto con il cliente e con molte persone. lavoro stimolante che necessita di costante aggiornamento e studio ( offerte, gestione del negozio ecc...)"
good,"Working at GameStop has been enjoyable, which is rare for a retail environment. Usually I'd be very stressed out, but with GameStop most of the work is busywork. Filing, organizing, putting things away and ringing up/helping customers. I highly enjoy the atmosphere of working in a GameStop."
good,gamestop is a great place to get a start at but not something you can do for a long periode of time as a career. it is a family envirement its a freindly place to work and to visit.
good,"Coworkers are fun and excellent and the customers are always friendly; there are many regulars that come in and stay for a chat often. Easy work if your know your games and systems. Seasonal workers don't start with many hours and are paid $7.25, but full time workers get plenty of hours and make much better pay."
good,"Gamestop is a fantastic place to work and I would recommend it to people that are willing to work hard because there is great room for growth and improvement. If you work hard and show great work ethic and responsibility, you can earn up to 30+ hours easily working part time! Provided that everyone is working and helping each other, being a part of a team at Gamestop is amazing. However if your management is bad it will only set you up for failure. Consistent hiring of employees that don't want to work, Lack of proper training and employees with poor work ethic can hurt the store, causing some people to have to work harder than needed which can lead to unnecessary stress."
good,"Buon lavoro per cominciare da giovani, pieno di responsabilità e continui cambiamenti in base all'andamento delle vendite."
good,Depending on the day or season a typical day a gamestop is pretty laid back and chill for the most part. You get to talk about video games all day and hopefully set a customer up with one they truly love and enjoy.
good,Because of the holiday season I was hired on and it was a nice busy time. After Christmas however business dropped off by about 80% by the second week in January. Then there are no more hours left to give.
good,Gaining more experinces for myself in gamestop i again dealt with customers over the phone and in shop and showed them how to work the games and told them what its like and always worked on fixing broken consoles
good,"While this company is overall a good company to work for it along with most jobs doesn't come without its flaws. Most of the time stores are managed by themselves and this promoted a excellent working environment. You will also find that GameStop has some of the best customers as most are regulars and you will develop bonds with them over time. The grain of salt comes in when you begin to look outside the stores to a higher management and company level. There you find the company is all about making money and it will come at the cost of you and your customers. For you job security will be non existent and no matter how well you run a store you will always be viewed as a replaceable employee. For the customer it will come in the form of forced marketing and upselling to the point of harassment and bigger and bigger loses when buying into the GameStop ""values"" as the company increases there cuts to offset loss of business to online retail. If you can find a well managed store you will find it can be an enjoyable job but always know the true directive of the company."
good,"GameStop Inc. is a very high customer service skills having job. I loved working for GameStop and would not mind going back one day if applicable. Aside from the bad seeds that tend to wriggle their way in and up the ladder, overall it's a great place to work."
good,Great environment to work.  Remeber this is a retail store based on sales not just a store to talk about games. Show your hard work and dedication as a seasonal employee.
good,I enjoyed the opportunity of working at Gamestop. The environment was very peaceful and welcoming. I developed better customer service with the help of the manager helping me.
good,A fun place to work with opportunity to grow. I have learned the required skills to be an effective leader. Management is there to support and push individuals to be the best they can be. The culture is fast paced and business focused.
good,"This was a fun job that i tried to obtain for a long time during high school. Once i was apart of the team, i loved working there and enjoyed all my coworkers until our boss went on a power trip and nobody liked her. Being around gamers all day is fun though and at times it didn't even feel like work. Be wary of using your discount though since that is how this company will get you. They know that you are a gamer and surrounded by all of these things everyday. "
good,A normal day at work was filled with fixing shelves due to people moving things and kids wandering around the store. I learned how to be patient with all sorts of people regardless of their initial greeting and actions. The workplace brought on a diverse culture of people from various places both close and far. Waiting an hour on a customer to make a relatively simple decision was easily the most complicated but of the job but it taught me patience.
good,Everyone came to work in a great mood with a smile on their face. There was never any drama within the store. The days always went by so smoothly and full of positivity.
good,Never  seemed to be enough time to complete tasks. Not a stable environment in the department I worked in.  Other departments ran smoother. High turn over rate.  It seems Like I am always training new employees and new bosses.  Not much time to complete my assigned work.
good,Work was fine with awesome people but the store I was in was very hot. You learn a lot but it's very hard to get promoted and very hard for college students to work their
good,"Typically you have to make sure that you met your sales, preorder and trade-in goals. Not a bad set up until you look at the trade in program. I felt like a crook every time someone would bring in a stack of games. I would offer them $50 in trade in credit and the company would turn around and sell them for $300 plus. Other than that it was a over all fun environment."
good,If you're a gamer or really into the retail scene then Gamestop is a great place to work. The discounts are amazing if you're someone who's going to be buying the latest systems and games anyways!
good,"Working at gamestop was truly a fun job. My brother has worked there for a few years now and never had much of anything bad to say. Growing up, thats all I ever heard about from my brother was anything related to video games. So I had aquired quite a bit of knowledge from him about video games over time and it made the job alot more fun for me."
good,As a manager you get to do all of the everyday operations of the store. Helping guests with ideas for games for themselves or as gifts for friends and family. Great place to help other grow as leaders.
good,"GameStop is a good beginner job or an easy part-time job for students. There isn't much potential for growth in the company so it's not exactly a good ""career"" choice."
good,"Overall Gamestop is a good place to work. The environment can be very relaxed or very chaotic, it depends on the time of year and any specials that may be going on during that time."
good,"I enjoyed working at Gamestop for the most part. There were days where I didn't care for it, but I think that can happen at most places of employment. My fellow employees were fun to be around and we always tried to ensure the store was in tip top shape when it was slow."
good,"A typical day at work included helping anyone who would come into the store. Additional tasks included setting up marketing and sales."
good,"Its a fun place to work. Its a straight forward retail position with a decent work/life balance. Lots of responsibility with little time, but things have to get done."
good,Managers come and go like the seasons. Guests are a pain. Selling culture puts stress on employees that isn't necessary.  I will say I did have a great first few managers and because of them I was able to excel to an Assistant Store Leader. I don't agree with the stress they put on employees and the pressure to sell to guests and meet circle of life expectations.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job were my employees and customers. I don't think I've ever had a job that was more enjoyable than this. However, the company's pressure on selling specific items backed by Wall-Street and their shareholders made it almost impossible for the company itself to keep it's promise to employees which is to ""protect the family"". I could not maintain a healthy work/family lifestyle."
good,"The work is fairly simple but the management are always pressing you to sell certain items and will criticize you if you don't, even though most if it has nothing to do with your performance."
good,Great company to work for I enjoy the environment the customers management was pretty cool I learned a lot received an award  or associate of the month
good,"A very rigorous process to be accepted to work, but once employed. You will never want to stop working there. The people are amazing and being able to converse of everything coming allows you to connect with people and provide better service."
good,"I feel that this is a hard place to move your way up in, because there is so much seniority.  On the other hand if your just looking for some extra cash in during the holiday season, its a nice way to do so."
good,"I was only a seasonal worker there but my time there was great. I got to talk to a lot of new people and develop my social skills a lot more, and I genuinely felt like like I was helping people."
good,"A typical day at Gamestop is dealing with the customers while also keeping the store clean throughout the day. During this job, I have learned how to handle customer situations in the best way possible. I also learned how to count and maintain a register throughout the day."
good,While working at Gamestop you get to interact with guests and talk about similar passions in video games. It's a sales job at the end of the day though. There are goals that are implemneted in the stores that are constantly changing and must be met.
good,"The job, either as a manager or entry-level, is very casual. The expectations aren't extremely demanding, and there is a lot of down time during the shifts. However, when times become busy, you learn interpersonal skills and communication skills from talking with customers. You also learn how to meet customer needs based on what their issues are. As a manager, you learn how to coach and train others on how to achieve store goals on a weekly and daily basis."
good,Main focus is on providing the customer with the best value.  Very fast paced environment with strong drive to build loyalty.
good,Fun work enviroment but the company itself is not very appreciative of its employees.  Great learning experence good to get your feet wet in a retail enviroment.
good,If you like videogames this is the place for you. You will work with other individuals that have the same mindset as you. I would recommend having strong retailer experience before applying it will help you in promotions.
good,I liked working for the company. I have a passion for video games and working in a place where I could share my experiences with customers meant alot to me. However I was only a seasonal employee so my time there was cut short.
good,"Helping customer locate games for a variety of console."
good,"All smiles... if you love the challenge or competitive gamer kind of mind. if you the talking about the little details In your adventure of concurring every game, you'll love this job."
good,"Entertaining Marines and Sailors on base and learning about the newest toys that are out.  Management was not top notch but enough to keep sales going.  Young crowd, lots of fun.  Hardest part was getting in the conversations about contemporary video games etc.  the most enjoyable part was actually learning the information eventually and blending in."
good,what can u say when you only work there for a couple months. the people that work there are great and if you are a gamer. you will enjoy the benefits
good,I always enjoyed my chats with the customers because it's not only about selling but it's about being fans of the products you sell.  We always had our regular customers.  It made the job fun and tolerable.
good,Ottimo luogo di lavoro per imparare al meglio le tecniche di vendita e migliorare il proprio problem solving.
good,Great working environment for anyone who loves games. As long as you know about most games and have good customer service you shouldn't have problem. After that you just have to remember where the games go and learn the computer system .
good,"Team members help you and make your shift fun. Insider information about release dates, and direct deposit available. Team members are informative and if not will find out your answer."
good,"It was a good place to work with fun people to work with. I learned how to communicate more with customers and see what they enjoyed, I became a better sales person working here. The only down side would be he hours but I expected the hours to be small, I worked here for the environment and a love of video games that I couldn't at my other part time job. Don't get me wrong, I worked hard here and didn't slack off, its just other job was too stressful, and working here was like a breathe of fresh air."
good,"I have had a great time working at gamestop, I had excellent training and I always felt like I had support from management. I would spend my team helping customers, running shifts, and coaching new hires. I learned how to effectively close sales on my time"
good,"Enjoyed working with Game Stop, it afforded me a chance to learn and grow.  I would def. return if the right job opportunity was to present itself. Flexible hours,"
good,"You always have something new , i learned a lot and the team are great , they have different option and levels based on what you are looking for from your employer."
good,Gamestop is a great place to work if you love video games. You get to work around video games all day and talk to customers about them as well. The workers are fun and energetic. This job requires a lot of energy.
good,I enjoyed working with games and people who loved games as much as I do. Memorizing all the codes is a big difficult if you don't have the best memory.
good,"Friendly staff and fun environment. Great job for those who enjoy assisting customers and games. Apart of the management team typical day included handling money, inventory and customer service."
good,"This job s for older people, The management is great and everybody is like a family in a way. I loved doing my job overnight and a typical work day was long but calm."
good,"I loved working there, working with both other costumers and other employees. The hours were limited but opportunity for raise and promotion were great."
good,"Clock in, sort trade ins, talk with customers and employees. Constantly learned about new games and gaming culture. Not to mention other forms of entertainment and sub culture. The management was super friendly and accommodating with the employees as far as learning the fastest and most effective ways to assist customers with purchases. They always seemed actively interested in how our day was going and always found ways to improve it. Co-workers were very friendly as well, though they did more joking then having an active interest in the ins and outs of one another's lives. There was no real difficult part about the position. Overall it was just a supremely laid back environment with the opportunity to immerse ones self in awesomeness."
good,"Go in, clean up the mess the last shift left behind the desk and in the storeroom, assist customers, deal with the angry ones (and hopefully not get the police involved), and reorganize a library of literally 10,000 games."
good,"Fast-paced, but easy to learn. Able to interact amicably with customers. Easy but repetitive work-load. Computer systems old-fashioned and confusing, but employees are helpful and supportive to each other."
good,GameStop is a fun work place if u don't know anything about gaming you will soon learn about them.The employees are fun to work with and very knowledgeable when it comes to games
good,"Pros"
good,when i was working at game stop i didnt get any hours at all. since i didnt get hours i worked to two for the three months i was supposed to be going to work
good,The store was amazing with all the employees and managers until there was a manager change and everyone there was let go by the new manager after the old store manager transferred.
good,"A typical workday would be of clocking into your shift, take traded games check them into the system, and then take them out and put them on the shelf, we then help customers that if need help can get the help or if looking for reviews on games or to see if we played certain ones.  We also provide feedback to games that are similar."
good,"Rutina definida de trabajo, desarrollo personal, aprendizaje constante y buenos compañeros."
good,"A challenging but fun work environment."
good,Always looking out for the consumers to grant them the best benefit. Gamestop has been one to set a trend in pricing and one to establish their niche in this current era.
good,"While the job was a fun environment to work in, I just need something could do as a career, and unfortunately that wasn't something that was possible at that company at the time."
good,"A typical day at work was busy, and sometimes stressful. With the help of my coworkers everything got accomplished before the end of the shift. Game boxes were returned to the designated shelf. Floor was trash free and swept. Merchandise was put up for display."
good,Good first job if you're looking to learn communication and basic selling skills. Hours were not there unless you were a key holder. Management was not that great.
good,I enjoyed my time at GameStop as assistant manager. The only complaint I had were the lack of preparation for game releases and the communication between advertising and the store managers.
good,Overall Gamestop gets a bad rap but I progressed quickly and easily because I was a model employee and reliable. My management team got away with being alcoholics.
good,I learned how to read my P and L. I also learned how to effect change in the future success of my business. The hardest part of the job was not having enough dedicated development training. I did enjoy using my love for gaming to help recommend titles to my guests.
good,"In a typical day at work we are tasked to organize games, clean the store floor, organize inventory and take out the trash. During my stay at this job was I able to learn how to work a cash register."
good,"A typical day at work for GameStop would entail me opening the store, setting goals, and doing shipment while trying to meet said goals. I've learned great management tools, how to convey my needs as far as goals and requirements. My co workers were great, and very helpful. Always supportive and taking my suggestions as seriously as I took theirs. The best part of my job was the camaraderie. The worst part about my job would be compensation. As a manager for so long, the wages were very low, in comparison to  how much was asked of the staff; and how much stress the job often entailed."
good,A typical day at work is similar to hanging out at your friends house except you occasionally get up to clean and organize. I get to talk about video games with a lot of very nice outgoing people. My coworkers are very nice and helpful and we always work as a team.
good,"extremely fun work environment with excellent co-workers. not too good for pay, would strongly recommend for a summer job for teens."
good,I really enjoy my job. Every day is different at my job. I never know what is going to happen or what task is at hand. I have learned a lot at this job. GameStop is over all a good place to work at.
good,Our store was about Goals. Not just making Goals but succeeding them. My employees that worked for me knew on a daily basis what was to be expected. Regular meetings with each associate about their work ethic was done daily.
good,Fun and rewarding work experience. Working here has taught me a lot about management and sales. I found success in customer service through connecting with customers on a personal level.
good,It is a Fortune 500 company that is doing all it can to survive the changing video game environment. Most employees there are very bright.
good,"Game Stop Call center was a good place to work. Everyone I met there was friendly and willing to assist. The job consisted of providing technical assistance to Gamestop stores. I learned how to advise callers, and walk them through instructions in a professional and friendly manner."
good,"A day in the life of a Game Stop employee is, well its retail."
good,"Most days started with inventory. The rest of any shift involved processing shipment and trade-ins. If the managers were not doing these tasks, they were rearranging the store in some way. Fun coworkers and customers."
good,"I worked from SGA to third key and it took a long time to gain advancements. While the work culture was fun, retail quickly drained me and the fight on 'individual performance' was a bit much."
good,I would assist customers with any questions that had regarding release dates and promotions. I learned that this job is really great when you love what you are doing. Management can sometimes be prone to rapid change. Co-workers are very enthusiastic and thoughtful of others. The hardest part is staying patient with irate customers. The most enjoyable part though is having discounts on video games and products.
good,"Fun work environment , the customers were more like friends. I worked in a smaller location which i loved because i really got to know my co-workers and it helped with building a strong team."
good,Great work environment with passionate employees and management.  Was able to learn the basics of working for a company and understand management styles.
good,"An average day at work consisted of approaching customers and making sure their questions and concerns were met while advising them of current offers and ways to save money. I learned quite a bit over my time there on how to speak to all types of different people ranging from those who know what they want, all the way to those who don't have a clue what games were. For the most part I enjoyed that I was able to socialize and relate with customers as part of my job. My co-workers were all amazing people that I am now friends with outside of work as well. The hardest part about the job would be dealing with prank callers as we received a lot of them."
good,"Fun, enjoyable work if you enjoy the product, but growing too aggressive in pressuring customers to resell their old items and buy used stock, only for the benefit of the company."
good,Gamestop as a whole has good ideas and intent. The problem is mainly the lack of outside thinking. They do not embrace education at all and the only way to get ahead in the company is being nice to the right person.
good,"Overall good management, good coworkers for the most part, good team work. Its just like any other typical fast paced kitchen."
good,"The work was pretty standard as far as customer service goes. And it goes without saying what the job was all about, selling games. In that respect the job delivered as advertised, although during my time employed there I did find the staff to be moderately unprofessional."
good,Wonderful people.  Work is focused on customer service and networking with local business' in order to market to a broad range of current and future cliental.
good,I supervised employees and maintained a professional level to the store. I enjoyed the customer service aspects of the job and getting to know our regulars.
good,"I worked there very rarely due to the fact that I was working seasonal and they over-hired their employees, Willing to reapply sometime in the future. Fun atmosphere and fun customers. Definitely love working there. Worth going to work for."
good,I assisted with customers needs and answered any questions they had about the products in the store. I learned how to run a cash register and stock inventory .
good,The company itself isn't as fun as every gamer or employee would hope it to be but the customers you meet are the ones that make you stay. There are so many colorful people that it allows you to enjoy your job even more.
good,As a seasonal employee I have been taught the basics very quickly.  A typical day includes interacting with customers on the sale floor and processing orders at the register.
good,This will simply be the best place I will have ever worked. The atmosphere is amazing and the friends you make will last you a lifetime. It's not work when you love what you do.
good,A fun and productive part time job. I enjoy providing customer service and increasing sales. This job is a building block to help me seek to increase my potential as a person.
good,"Gamestop advisor "
good,"I was seasonal and worked hard enough to secure a regular position as a part time employee and eventually worked my way up. Not many hours for the low people on the totem pole, but it they're heavy on promoting within so as long as your availability is good and you're a hard working, you can go places with the company."
good,Being able to have a common interest with your customers improves your motivation and drive to provide better customer service.
good,opened and closed the store. Worked on inventory. Had to meet daily goals with specific instructions. Dealt with customer interaction and service very often throughout the day.
good,"This was great for a seasonal job. Only minimum wage, But it was seasonal so I get why. Its a great place to start, and it may be better if you are full time."
good,"Providing information to customers on various products and promotions"
good,"Customer service"
good,"Gamestop was enjoyable employment for the time. My main responsibility was game knowledge, for recommending existing titles and selling new ones on the way. Best part of my day was talking to people and finding a game that would fit their tastes perfectly."
good,Personally this was a very fun job and the people who work for this company are great. i would recommend to many needing a starting job.
good,"It's not a bad job persay, but every thing you do there feels like its under appreciated. The CEO's and Area Managers are completely out of touch wiht how the day-to-day opperations actually work and are constantly demanding you to unkeep ridiculous standards. Coupoe that with bad co-workers and just general customer service and you have Gamestop."
good,"My jobs requires me to serve each and every customer with whatever they need gaming wise. I usually walk around the store making sure they are finding what they need and answering any questions they ask. Since I've been working at Gamestop, I've learned a lot about customer satisfaction as well as useful techniques to making a sale. Management and my co-workers are very kind and very helpful. If I ever need help with anything, they will help without hesitation. The only bad thing about working at gamestop, is pour hours. I may receive only 3-5 hours a week."
good,"Slow and steady at times, learned how to be a retail sales rep in making our monthly goals. Had a great manager who will do what is needed and not push on others his work plus respected the employees in being fair. Everyone is nice and friendly great co workers to work with. The hardest thing about the job was when at times reaching the monthly goals couldn't be meet. The things I enjoy about doing this jobs was talking about video games with co worker and customers, as well in sometimes able to spoil kids with so many new games."
good,"Your knowledge of video games is expanded daily along with what you currently know.  The worst part was figuring out how to follow corporate rules when they didn't work in the actual work place.  Co-workers are fun, management is great, and the work was fun."
good,Fun and relax job to work with.  Flexible hours and environment.  You have conversation with the customer and you learned some tips about games.
good,Work is easy and simple. Leared more than I thought I would. Managers are sometimes greedy and selfcentered. Co-works are sometimes good.Hardest part is customers. Best part is getting to talk about games
good,"Gamestop was a wonderful experience. In the short time I was there, I was able to grow knowledge and customer service experience."
good,"GameStop does a great job at trying to teach all of its employees to be great leaders. As a company though, at times some of the expectations were conflicting. For a store manager it has its perks but you are expected to do everything as if you owned the business and are held accountable for everything, even what you may not be able to control. I loved this job. It was just really difficult to get the rhythm of things at first. Once you get it you will love it. I started out part time and worked my way up with in a year and a half. The company offer many opportunities and prefers promoting from within."
good,"We clean the store every night and keep it organized throughout the day."
good,Working here is all about being able to capitalize on sales. Relationships built with customers make the job worthwhile and you can make a lot of friends with people with similar interests.
good,"great people coming in and out."
good,"For the most part, my job was re-organizing shelves, and making sure that all the games people sold to us were accounted for. The management were very relaxed, but always had something for me to be doing. The job was not particularly challenging, so it could get fairly boring, however my coworkers were always willing to chat, which helped make the work feel much faster and enjoyable."
good,"As far as it goes for a job, Gamestop is a great place to work.  When it comes to benefits, compensation, and advancement, not to mention stress, it is anything but.  If you are looking for supplemental income, are an avid gamer, and know a good bit about current and developing tech, this is the job for you.  The hours are next to none, unless you are Store manager or assistant manager.  Senior Game Advisors are 3rd key holders and are only scheduled to work an average of 10 - 20 hours a week, with a possibility to get near 40 on busy holiday seasons.  As an SGA you will open and close the store (Sometimes and most of the time all by yourself) and supervise at least 1 Game Advisor (GA) each day.  Pay isn't too great for the responsibility you have.  My managers were great, and fantastic leaders.  I would not blame them for the lack of hours and stress, it is a corporate issue when it comes down to it."
good,All-round fun job. I would only suggest they take better care of their employees. More positive reinforcement needed.
good,"It's a great company if you are on the management team, i.e. Assistant Store Manager and above. For entry level employees, the benefits of a discount and being able to work with video games are the sole reasons to jump on board. As with any other customer service job, you take the good with the bad. Great benefits for management, as well as a yearly convention trip for Store Managers. Lower end of the pay scale, however, and work/life balance can definitely lean more towards the work side."
good,"Meeting new friendly people every day. Learn a lot of new information on video games and systems on a daily bases."
good,Durante mi estancia en la empresa aprendí mucho y el ambiente laboral fue bueno.
good,I really like Gamestop. I believe it is a wonderful place to work and the co workers are amazing and enjoyable to be around.
good,My experience at GameStop was one to remeber because it was a very home like feeling the employees treated me like family which made my time there wonderful. The work environment was really relaxed and during gae realeses we would dress up to get in the spirit. Manngement was very helpful and co-workers were kind it was a fun job.
good,"I absolutely loved this job. My former boss was fired(he deserved it). But the job was fun. The customers were great. No complaints other than that ONE boss. I loved my managers and supervisors to pieces though. I would go back if it weren't for one thing; THE PAY. You have to be 18 to work here, yet, they only want to pay full grown adults minimum wage. They make a bunch of money, and yet don't want to pay employee's anything. But if you love video games and MMOs and all the above and you don't mind if you get paid minimum wage, this is a GREAT JOB for you. You get a nice discount also."
good,"Had a lot of fun working here, great discounts. The customers were usually very friendly and the management was good. Very laid back place to be and we always had something to keep us busy."
good,"I ran and managed a Store for 3 years. Overall, my experience went well. I was respected among my peers and treated fairly by my district manager. My biggest complaint is pay and advancement opportunities."
good,come in. handle register.organize the store alphabetically. handle with new inventory. help out guest with what they need.
good,"GameStop is a great cross between an entrepreneurial, growth-oriented company and a large, established corporation (probably originating with rapid growth from the acquisition of EB Games)."
good,"Gamestop is a very easy job to do. You come into work and help customers find the perfect game to play. There really isn't much to this job. The management wants you to up-sell as much as possible just like any other job. You are expected to gain a certain amount of reservations for games, game informer subscriptions/power up reward subscriptions and add-on sales. "
good,"Smarco colli, organizzazione magazzino, cura clientela, cura dei conti e registri."
good,"I've worked here for 2 yrs, I've learned a lot about retail, costumer service, and business operations. I'm seeking further employment because of inconsistent hours."
good,"I've been with the company for sometime now and have enjoyed working for them. Thanks to my position, I have enjoyed many perks and benefits that I would not have otherwise. The environment in the stores is one of fun, community and enthusiasm. I've seen and experienced many bonds of friendship formed there as well due to the shared interests of most employees. If you have the opportunity to work here, I highly recommend it."
good,"The typical work day is having to share common interest of video games with different customers young and old. I have learned that in order to relate to the customers and the industry, you would need to keep an constant update within this rapidly growing industry. My supervisors and co-workers were easy to work with because we were supporting each other in both sales and grow within the company. The hardest part of the day was getting customers to agree on which game was better than the other. The best thing about the work day was getting to know each customer and befriending them in the process."
good,"awesome place to work so long as numbers are not an issue, numbers are the sales you get for products like game reserves and pro card memberships and the new store credit card... you have to push these products on people who are only looking for a game, looking to be entertained for a few hours and it can be a bit much for some... "
good,"I would sell games, maintain store, open business, close business, maintain cash flow, and maintained inventory control."
good,"Temporary at best, not a career. I got to work around something that i know very well which was fun."
good,"While working in the gaming industry may appear to be great fun on the outside, do not expect to commit to retail sales in this culture for the money. Expect a great deal of long work hours and tedious behind the scene logistics that may greatly diminish your quality of life outside of work. Specifically for the position of store managers with family. Given the type of culture the video game industry has created over the last decade, the product can easily sell itself. The very nature of the product being so readily accessible to the need of the consumer has created the urgency to maximize profits by any means necessary for the ""brick and mortar"" retail stores in the hopes of keeping the legitimacy of the brand from becoming obsolete. The industry is extremely fast paced due to the ever changing and advancing technology which can easily be fun and engaging for those completely ""plugged in"" to the culture, but also very stressful for those attempting to maximize a business in a very competitive demographic. I emphasize the importance of the demographic in order for any business to thrive because it's critical to cater to the needs of your customer base. Gamers are a very specific niche group of consumers almost of the level of a long time antique collector. The most important part of the job is relating to and engaging with the culture of the gamer. You may even have to be content with the sacrifice of your own extracurricular time to escape reality by fully immersing yourself into the digital fantasy worlds of the product you are selling and learn to live through the experiences"
good,Need to be able to work floor sale and high knowledge of games and products.
good,A typical day at work will involve regular work duties with occasional customer service.
good,"My employment at GameStop consisted of putting games back on the shelves, alphabetizing the games on the shelves. I helped customers with their questions. Also I made sure the games on the shelves were presented correctly on the appropriate shelves."
good,Wasn't awful just the district that I worked in wasn't great. Not a terrible company over all they just have super un-realistic goals
good,"company took care of employees with compensation and being a family friendly business. co workers were great, learned the best implantation of teamwork. store management is in touch with employees. customers were the best part of the job."
good,"Ho imparato tanto da questa azienda, stare a contatto diretto con I clienti, metodi di vendita di retta che portano il cliente a tornare o essere incuriosito, stando a contatto con la clientela il rapporto con il cliente diventa piacevole nonostante sia professionale."

good,"GameStop is a decent company to work for.  A typical day involved sales, cash handling, inventory control, receiving shipment, customer service, and managing employees.  I loved my customers and getting to interact with them.  I also loved training my staff and other stores in the district on Customer Service.  You learn how to multi-task at GameStop.  The hardest part of the job was the life/work balance."
good,manged skate parties and called different groups and schools to come and skate or bowl.
good,Come prima esperienza lavorativa non avrei potuto chiedere di meglio. A livello professionale e personale questo negozio mi ha fatta crescere molto. Il rapportarsi con un tipo di clientela molto variegata che andava dai bambini di piccola età a persone adulte mi ha permesso di imparare a comportarti in differente modo a seconda del cliente che mi trovo davanti e sapermi comportarte con il tale nella miglior maniera possibile. Allo stesso tempo questo esperienza mi ha aiutata a crescere anche a livello personale;il lavoro era un lavoro di squadra che mi ha portata a legare molto con i miei colleghi.Il nostro lavoro iniziava la mattina e già da subito ci davamo degli obiettivi al fine di raggiungere i risultati dell'azienda. la parte più difficile era il conciliare l attenzione al cliente con tutte le altre cose nei turni da sola di mattina.
good,"Greeting customers and assisting them with information and or prices for store merchandise, filing games and assist with replacing marketing advertisements. I learned a lot of things here, dealing with customers and co-workers to multitask, detail oriented, produce a better sales culture to influence people on the perks and benefits of current offers and promotions. The hardest part of my job is trying to convince people to buy or reserve store items, as a company they believe in sale sale sale and setting a sales quota as a daily goal, but they forget about the one thing that matters the most, the customer. I feel as though I harass my customers no matter how good my customer service and this is to be expected. Everyone is not into video games as the next person and do not want what we try to promote, that is exactly why we are promoting it. My co-workers  was efficient in what tasks they did on a daily basis due to the fact that have the time for it, they are also willing to help you on anything needed, well most were but there is some backlash with certain managers because they go strictly by the rules, but there are flaws in everyone and they tend to forget that, even when they make a mistake or they are unaware of the situation.I had two people that made certain mistakes, one influenced another and made himself to look like the victim in the workplace for not handling his workload. Another person left traded merchandise on the end of the counter, my manager stressed this to me a lot but not only did the person fail to follow protocol but the merchandise was stolen as well,"
good,The most enjoyable part of your job is working with your store teams.
good,"The reason I liked working here is because the staff was very friendly and explained things I need to do very well. "
good,A summary of this information is better revealed during an interview.
good,The people who work here are the best salesmen. Very friendly and well informed. Time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.
good,The environment was good but as is very common in retail the demands of the company became harder and harder to meet.
good,"I worked in the mall, so the store always had customers coming and going."
good,"I love video games so this is a dream job!  I get to help customers figure out what systems and/or games are best for their budget, family, and tastes."
good,"Easy work and not a lot of drama."
good,"productive company with good salary. We are working on games, iphones, ipods, tables and cell phones too. It's a fun job without stress."
good,"Management at GameStop was very high stress, long hours and on occasion 70 hour work weeks. I was solely responsible for hiring, coaching, reprimanding and terminating a staff of part time and full time employees in retail. "
good,"A typical day for me at this job would be to open and close the store,"
good,"great work environment, friendly co-workers, enjoy the overtime hour."
good,The overall environment was all about numbers so if you think this is all about games think again before applying. It is a good company to work for and great perks for gamers.
good,This position is not in my field of expertise and does not pay well enough for my current situation. I have nothing bad to say about this company or my experiences here.
good,"Quando inizi a lavorare in un ambiente nuovo non sai mai cosa aspettarti. il primo giorno mi hanno spiegato le cose da fate e come farle esemplificandomi il tutto con degli episodi realistici e guardandoli il primo pensiero è stato ""che bravi, sarò mai come loro?""  giorno dopo giorno inizi a capire che il passo per essere come loro è sempre più breve e che tutto l'impegno e gli sforzi che stai investendo sono ripagati. la parte più difficile è il dover pensare sempre nei panni del cliente che nel periodo in cui siamo cerca sempre di risparmiare e con le promozioni che cambiano rapidamente non sempre è stato facile coniugare il tutto, ma quando ci riesci e il cliente ti ringrazia perchè hai reso felice i suoi figli o lui facendolo risparmiare il tutto diventa più leggero."
good,"•a typical day at work"
good,cashier and sales rep. loved working with my team members and made relationships with customers
good,It's a great company to work for. The environment is stable and calm not like other places.
good,It is a great company to work for.  They have great benefits and are a consistently changing and growing company.
good,A job where I talked with people about video games. What's not to love!
good,"Always a busy job, overseeing and organizing a high-traffic location was very fast-paced. Worked with a lot of great individuals, but available hours for scheduling were always spread very thin, leaving a great deal of work for only one or two people, even during busy times."
good,"A typical day will be to open the store, count all cash registers and safe before store opens for business, complete all daily inventory counts assigned for the day, open and process all in-bound shipment, seal and ship out all out-bound packages, answer telephone calls providing outstanding customer service."
good,This is an easy job. Not a lot to it really. Just an extensive knowledge on products sold and able to sell up on items. Management can be fairly easy going and the toughest part is always upselling. But everything else is pretty simplistic.
good,"I work through the school and its a great place to work.Working at Gamestop was very rewarding. I expanded knowledge of great customer service. Management was very helpful, always there when I Had questions. Co-workers provided great team work. I learned how to deal with tough customers when unhappy with purchased customers."
good,"Gamestop was really fun. I enjoyed working when I could."
good,"I loved working there, because dealing with kids and seeing there faces everytime they bought the newest game only made me hapy."
good,"If you love video games, then you'll love working here. It's a video game place."
good,"A typical day at GameStop includes the organization and stocking of products, selling of Game Informer magazine, answering of phones and providing customers with information on games and systems."
good,"Great Benefits, Fun environment. Competitive if you want it to be. Its a great job over all."
good,"Working with Game Stop was a fairly easy job. Keep the game cases neat and alphabetized. Acknowledge Customers as they came into the store. Answer any questions to the best of your knowledge.  Keep your information about the on demand products up to date. Smile and be approachable. "
good,"During a typical day at work I will open the story for the day, review time punches from the night before, send and receive emails, perform inventory count, and review the day's plan. I keep other associates well informed and motivated, and keep them on goal for weekly numbers. I then work with my team to reach those goals. During this process I learned to better work with my team, making the hardest part of the job letting a member of the team go when they consistently do not reach goal. The most enjoyable part of the job is ensuring that the customer is well informed and that they leave with a smile."
good,GameStop is one of the most energetic places to work. A constant changing enviornment.
good,"As a third key manager, I was the only manager on duty when I was working. Customers didn't seem to understand that a 21 year old girl could be a manager in a game store. Customers were probably the most irritating thing when working. Loved what I did, but didn't really love the customers at my location."
good,"One of the few jobs I've had that i can say i didnt mind going to. I Love the customers, the job as a whole."
good,"•	Customer Service"
good,Open to new ideas and was allowed to implement own automation framework.
good,Gamestop is always expanding and improving their brand.  They dive all the way in when fulfilling a plan and do not just dip a foot in.
good,"A typical day at work consist of several things. keep the store clean and presentable, greet customers in the store, assist customers with any questions they might have such as price checking or even a preference of games for a certain age group, and lots and lots of alphabetizing."
good,the best part about this job is the customers i enjoy helping people. the co-workers are fun.  being about to help people was the highlight of the day
good,My typical day at work includes helping customers find the game that they want and answering questions that they may have and checking them out at the register. I've polished my customer service skills working here. The hardest part of the job is when we get really busy and I'm the only one in the front of the store. The most rewarding part of the job is when a customer comes in and says that they enjoy the game that i recommended.
good,3 month contract in a fast paced store in dublin city center over  the christmas period. gained value retail experience of the management team and how to target and achieve goals
good,Working here has been fun. Got to interact with other gamers and build relations with customers. Testing out the games and getting hands on feel to able to talk about it was spectacular. Everyone who worked here pretty much loved games.  
good,"During a typical day at work, I enjoyed interacting with many customers. It was nice working with and talking to people who had the same interests as I do. The managers were really nice and made sure their instructions were clear so no one made mistakes. My co-workers were also great to be around, having something in common to talk about made getting along so much easier for all of us. The hardest part of the job was working on busy days with so many people in such a small store. The best part about working at GameStop is that, as a gamer, being around so many people who also have a passion for video games is the best feeling in the world."
good,"My expectations about GameStop were not entirely accurate. I assumed that it would have been a fun place to work that offered decent pay for my position, so I ignored the warnings of my friends and went for it. I couldn't have been more wrong..."
good,"I always enjoyed my time working for GameStop, it was a fun job with fun people. "
good,"The experience may vary from region to region. But in my region you are never truly off work. Your boss WILL call you on your day off and berate you for anything he feels is out of line no matter how tiny. If you love video games going in, you won't even play them by the time you leave. You don't have time to play games with the hours demanded of managers. All Store managers are salaried and expected to put in at least 5 hours of unpaid overtime every single week. And during the holidays you will work several uncompensated 6 day work weeks."
good,"Great place to work, every gamers dream."
good,"Cash handling, scheduling, hiring, firing, interviewing, outgoing customer service."
good,"A day consists of a lot of customer service. And a lot of to do list organizing, cleaning, operational things, maintaining the store and maintaining the inventory. I have wonderful co-workers they are awesome and very helpful. The hardest part is getting used to a new store when you get moved and the most enjoyable is multi-tasking! I love having lots to do to keep me occupied!"
good,*always busy
good,"This company is the best i have ever worked for but the only downfall is the amount of hours part time employees receive, which is the only reason i no longer work there. Part time employees regularly get three to six hours per week. I think that if they improve this issue their turn over rate would reduce tremendously."
good,"GameStop gave me opportunities to grow as a person as well as a manager. I was challenged with sales goals, operational goals, as well as personnel goals. I appreciate my time with the company."
good,"Great place to work part-time, fairly easy to do on a daily basis. A good way to get into retail for those who are into video games."
good,GameStop is a great place to get your foot in the door for retail management. Great place to learn the basics of customer service and leading a small team.
good,It was good until I got bounced around by my former Dm and played ping pong between managers!
good,"Daily duties at work ranged from basic customer service and interaction to inventory checks, shipping/receiving, organization, store cleanliness, marketing, etc. Being an avid gamer it was a great place to work and gave me plenty of time to talk about and promote the hobby I love. Though I've heard mixed things from store to store, the staff and management at my store all had the same mentality and all got along extremely well. The job itself isn't hard, so it's tough to think of a ""hardest part"". The most enjoyable part though would just be getting to be around games and gamers all the time."
good,For being my first retail job I did great. I worked with costumers all day and enjoyed going to work.
good,I loved this job. It was fun every time I went to work. I definitely recommend applying here.
good,"A typical day consisted of many things, but the most important to me was the customer service. I was given the opportunity to help a variety of people with different issues or questions that they had. I learned that even though it is a fast paced environment I was able to manage all of my tasks in a timely manner. I absolutely enjoyed every single one of my co-workers and made friends with almost all of them. My manager was one of the best and was able to manage without ""talking down"" which is something I really admired. The hardest part of my job would be when I had exhausted all possibilities and could do nothing to help a customer, though I realized that sometimes, there is just nothing more you can do. I would say the most enjoyable part of my job was the opportunity to meet so many different people."
good,"Very big Warehouse with lots of different departments. Learned charging, syncing, drain testing, spider work, Refurb Tech work, and Labler Tech work. Fun team environment and great co-workers. Management are very professional and easy to talk too. Nothing really hard about working there. The most enjoyable part about the job is the Cafeteria, fresh food."
good,"Having the ability to bring in new customers as well as further developing existing customer relations all while talking about something I am passionate about; video games. At the end of the day, consistently meeting sales goals, assist in operations, and training new staff is what it takes, and more, to run a successful business."
good,"A typical day would involve helping customers in deciding which game, game system, gaming equipment, etc. that they should purchase. I learned several techniques of assisting customers understand the differences between gaming setups, systems, types of games, game content, etc. The immediate store management was amazing, they were very easy to get along with; very supportive of the employees under them; very informative if there as ever any question; strong leaders all around. That being said the corporate level management was extremely heavy handed with making sure that immediate numbers were reached regardless of the long term damage this would do with customer relations, there was also a lack of realistic goal setting by the corporate level management for tasks that needed to be done with the payroll given to each store. This lead to many excellent managers leaving or getting terminated. As for my immediate co-workers and underlings, they were an incredible group that rose to every challenge be it sales, customer service, information gathering, and work ethic. The hardest really was no hard part of this job. The most enjoyable part of this job was the customer interaction and getting to talk about games all day."
good,"I love to talk games and get paid for it! Job is easy. Customers are nice. hardly ever any rude customers, even when you make a mistake and admit to it. they are just so patient when you are new. I wish my position wasn't seasonal"
good,"Hours were scarce if you were not management. Free posters and other random goodies is a huge bonus, along with renting games. High pace, but only if you push the right numbers. You can screw everything else up, but if you numbers are good, you are good."
good,"GameStop is a great company, for people who are either getting into the workforce for the first time, first time in a long time, or just need a job for the small things while in school or etcetera. If I opened, I came in, scanned one of the sections of games on the wall to make sure that we had our visual merchandising done, count my systems and high dollar items in accordance with Loss Prevention, and then opened my store. When people walked in, they were greeted at the door warmly, and asked if they needed assistance. I learned how to manage my time better. Sometimes, things could get hectic. If there was a rush in the morning, I was, or whichever manager, the only one there, so it could get difficult and you had to handle processses a certain way. My management staff, including myself, was very professional when necessary, but we liked being able to joke in the work place as well. I like my co-workers and I enjoyed my time with them. The hardest part of the job is variable per person, but in my opinion, it was the enumerous tasks. I was able to get MANY tasks done, but there was no real designation of the tasks, if you had time, you did them. I was never done, which helped the days go by, but it would have been nice from time to time to say ""I'm done!"", and then focus only on customers.The most enjoyable part has to be the games. You learn about games to sell to your customers, you even get to check one out from the store once per week. You get all of the latest and greatest new before your customers do, so you pass it on!"
good,My work was fun because i always had something to do and they're always new people who come in waiting to create a conversation.
good,"Working at Game Stop got me in the door working with sales. I really enjoyed making kids happy everyday, and I loved the people I worked with. The hardest part of the job was during the holidays when we would be so packed you could barely walk around which meant slower customer service. The most enjoyable part of working for Game Stop was getting to know the customers and making them walk out of the store happy."
good,If you are a geek and don't mind getting paid pennies then its heaven. free game rentals and lots of nerdy people to talk to.
good,Always made sure the merchandise was stocked properly. Learned to keep in contact with customers.
good,"I worked there for 5 years and really enjoyed the job a lot. The corporation didn't treat their employees as well as they should have, and a lot of the work was ill managed and busy work."
good,"A typical day at work include but not limited to educating gamers and parents on new games, meeting a daily sales quota, training new team members when needed, interviewing new candidates. Through the aforementioned, I learned how to deal with people with different backgrounds and personalities, the importance of customer service yielding sales results, effectively training new staff to be successful. My staff was great, they were all very team oriented. The hardest part of the job will be not having enough time with customers in educating them about new games that we have. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to play video games."
good,"GameStop was a fun place to work. Seeing and making people happy and at the same time making sales. Technology is apart of our society and this makes people come in and enjoy their time, making the customers time great."
good,"Loved my job the pay wasn't great but for a teenager, the discounts were nice and I felt respected and enjoyed my team."
good,"Good environment, fun people to be around but not enough hours"
good,The company itself is always trying to do better and it shows through its' requirements for its' employees. I learned how to communicate individually with customers to gain their business and satisfaction. Learned how to push product and make sales and also learned a variety of shipping techniques. Learned how to work with co-workers under me and the general goodness of a retail environment.
good,"typical day at work starts by learning the business of the day. Management is easy to get along with, and it is easy to team up with co-workers to complete any task. Hardest part of the job is to meet sales quota for each shift. Best part is the benefits of learning the video game business."
good,"At this job I was an assistant store manager. I was able to do just about everything here, from learning to managing. All around this was a fun job to have."
good,"Right as you go in there is always work that need to be done co-workers aid and help customers as i a do the same, at the end of the day theirs is clean up and close doors."
good,Job strongly relies on your ability to get the store reserves and push certain products and subscriptions; this is the structure for your hours.
good,"Decent place, great manager, they take care of their staff well"
good,"Go to the desired work area, clock in, assist customers and increase job Revenue. While at Gamestop I learned how to appeal to customers of all ages, intrigue them in sales and possible promotions or deals the company offered and to satisfy them & their experiences all the way & beyond the close of sale."
good,The job was a great place with hardly any stress. The staff was very friendly and really didn't have any trouble. The bad thing about the job that it was a seasonal job and did not get any real hours.
good,what more can I say I worked with the public and there where good customers and bad customers
good,"I loved working with customers and being a part of the video game industry. However, for typical retail most employees were paid minimum wage and hours/shifts were limited. There is a lot of turnover and it's hard to continue up the ladder. As with any retail position, the customers can be trying at times."
good,"had fun working there, the hardest part of the job was when i had to take all the games off the self and then put them back up on the self but in A,B,C order"
good,learned how to work a register
good,"Working at a video game store is a gamer's dream come true. Like any retail store where you care about the subject matter, its easy to get pulled into long and interesting conversations with the customers."
good,"It's a hard company to work for if you are not good at salesmanship. But if you start to understand how the circle of life operates, and then master it, the experience that is received from the job carries into any field."
good,Is a company that will be around. It have great customers and it appreciate its works.
good,Great group oriented job with tons of benefits. Lots of district managers who are consistently working on training and development for new hires
good,"In my time working for the company those few years ago, although i was younger and was basically my first job, i thought it was alright for the most part even for a first job. day in and out was pretty smooth sailing even with the occasional bad customer. did not learn much expect managing myself and my team, in which the management it self was pretty standard and did what they had to do. The workplace was quiet small but it was in a mall so not much you can do there, oh and sometimes the place smelled pretty bad at times but very rarely. Black Friday's are probably the only time when the job was stressful but i still had fun regardless. Overall my favorite part of the job had to be the people i worked with and connected with in general."
good,"I typical workday for me, a gest advisor, is greeting the customer and making sure they have everything they need and more. Make sure they don't feel pushed into something but still offer out membership. must be familiar with gaming and the hardest part are customers. However, they can also be the best part of the day."
good,"Learned a lot about games and consoles that, I never knew! Enjoy the customer interactions and staff. Support if needed just have to ask! Learned how to be developed in my postion and sahre with my team!"
good,game stope was one of the most fun jobs I ever had but the only was paying 7.25 and I would barley get any hors and some time I wouldn't even hit 10 hours a week
good,"I was hired as a sales associate and trained on some things for people with a keyholder position, which I didn't appreciate because my pay was consistent with a sales associate's. Other than that, it was a pretty laid back and fun job. The customers remained patient when renovations took place and seldom experienced an intensity with the guest/associate dynamic."
good,"Ambiente divertente e a contatto con il pubblico , servono spiccate capacità di comunicazione con le persone."
good,"My brief time at Gamestop was probably the most fun I have ever had working in an establishment. The mood was always pleasant, the customers were demanding but very easy to work with if their needs weren't met, and the shifts went by quick. I would 100% work for the company again if given the opportunity."
good,"During the week it was very slow so much so that there were two of us for the entire day, one to open and one to close. You were usually trapped inside the building for about 5 to 6 hours at a time alone, but if you had your work completed that they had asked of you, you were able to pretty much relax. I was able to bring my switch inside and play it when ever it was slow and my work was done. I enjoyed how easy it was to get ahead though, how the system is made so that if you have the drive to you can move up in the world."
good,I was a regular customer of the store I worked at back in the day and got hired on for the Christmas season but was not kept on because they didnt have enough hours to give out after the season. It was a lot of fun and I loved the people I worked with.
good,"it was a fun experience at GameStop, even though its very busy and you have to put up with everyone. also it was a very clean and organized place with very supportive and helpful staff."
good,"Gamestop gives stores very few hours to schedule staff. In my experience, the assistant manager got 40 hours, two other ""key holders"" got about 10-15 hours each and then you had around 9 hours to divide between your lower level associates. Everything else has to be covered by the store manager, alone. During the holidays expect to work full shifts, 6 to 7 days a week, as the store manager. Most of the shifts you will be alone or understaffed and then after the store closes you will have to change out all of the signage, again by your self, and then be back to open the next day. Pay is low and the hours are long, but the people are awesome."
good,"Manager was kind and professional. Interviewing technique was creative and fun. Learning process is also unique, using a computer program called Level-Up. I had very few hours as a GA but that made it all the more manageable. Sometimes the customers were difficult but all in all it was fine."
good,"I worked there for 3 holiday seasons (september to jan.) They are allowed to hire usually 1-2 people on after the holiday is over. I was hired my 2nd year but there was no hours to give until mid year so I quit. Its fun if your into gaming. If you dont know the latest though you wont survive not because of the company but because of the customers. The company expects you to sell the used games not new even though new is sometimes cheaper because of sales. They also expect you to sell the discount card and offer add ons for every sale. They monitor that and will repremend you if you are not living up to par. "
good,"It's a fun, bustling environment. Especially for preorder releases and holidays. You will enjoy a team setting and plenty of joking around, but you'll still be working."
good,"I truly love the environment here and I love the employees and regulars, but we are not paid as much as we should be for the stress they put us under."
good,"If you play video games then your half-way there.  If your good at video games and can convince other people to play that game then grab an application.  It's that easy.  As long as you know your consoles, games and accessories you are good to go.  They will teach you sales, marketing and inventory management.  Great place to start if your new to the workforce."
good,"Gamestop can be a fun place to work IF you have a good manager. If you don't have a good one, it can be the worse place to be. I really into my time with the company until my later years with them. Management played a massive role in why I left."
good,They really don't care about promoting people that constantly bring back more customers. They only care about what numbers you have. A guy that worked there less time than me got promoted before me. Advandemt here is trash unless you can prove numbers versus happy and returning customers. The only reason I gave it a 4* is because my manager is like a friend to me and I appreciate him.
good,"Took trade ins, put prices on them, then put them in alphabetical order. Core job duties right there. Was simple and minimal training was needed. Little pay and hours tho."
good,Specific location was in a mall and it was usually very empty then a rush of people would show up but it would die down. Very busy during the holidays and during big sale events.
good,Da appassionata di videogiochi ho adorato lavorare in negozio come commessa e per la gestione del magazzino del negozio. Pessimo però l'organizzazione: mi avevano offerto un contratto di tre mesi e alla fine del secondo hanno deciso di tenermi a casa!
good,"I loved working with people who shared the same hobbies as me. While it would definitely get busy towards the afternoon and after school hours, there was always brief respite where we always working with keeping the store cleaned and organized. I found it fun recommending people games and talking about shared interest."
good,definitely requires attention to strict policy adherence as well as ability to engage and communicate effectively with any individual that come into the store.
good,"From my seven years of working at GameStop, I learned about management and what it took to be a good team leader. They taught me how to perform great customer service as well as how to meet my quotas."
good,The good thing about GameStop was being around the games especially when you're a gamer but then you tend to just give up on games. Being around them got me bored of games. The customers would sometimes get mad over something you had no control over which made it a bit stressful.
good,Wanted this job from the time I turned 18 finally got the job at 21. Started as a seasonal worker then moved over to part time. Great managers at the time I was working there. Very helpful if talking to the right workers in there. Dealing with rude customers that wanted discounts for everything.
good,"I only worked at GameStop for the Christmas season but the atmosphere was fun and inviting. The employees were knowledgeable and fun, I was sad when I left but it was a great experience."
good,"Fun energetic place to work. Management is great. Coworkers are fun to work with. Set schedule. Relaxed environment. A good stress free job, would be a great part time job"
good,I was a manager at game stop which was fun. There were times that we had to be at work to set up for midnight releases. And promote new and upcoming games.
good,My time at Gamestop was great.... mostly.... other than getting hired as part-time and then getting moved to seasonal it was the perfect part-time job.
good,I enjoy working at GameStop. My only complaint is there a plenty of jobs that would pay more. If Gamestop paid more there would be more people willing to work there
good,"I was hired, along with two others who had worked there and came back, for the holidays. I worked when I was asked to and not only did I meet the quotas, I destroyed them. Still let go after the holidays ended, the other two people stayed."
good,My time at gamestop was very fun. It was my local gamestop for many years before working there. Everyone was like a family and talking about video games was a passion of mine for many years.
good,"Going to work and getting ready to sale various items. Fun to converse with customers about games and related topics. Fun co-workers and managers. "
good,Really enjoyed the people that came in and got to know them on a personal basis. Corporate was a hassle to deal with but customer base was excellent!!
good,"GameStop can be a fun and exciting place to work. It also can be a very stressful and intense place to work due to high sales goals that are based on trends, seasons, and quality of products that you have no previous knowledge of."
good,"Wenn man Filialleiter ist, kann man sich viel rausnehmen. Man braucht dennoch ein gutes Team um alle Ziele zu schaffen."
good,"As a Game Advisor, my job was to keep my store looking nice and organized, and I would also make meaningful connections with my customers and help them find the merchandise they want. I would keep up on the news for that industry so I can give them the information they need to help make informed decisions to what they want for their entertainment purposes."
good,"I have learnd how to work with others and to focus , management is fair, the hardest part is the unknown hours in each day, no AC system its too hot in the summer. also there is no morning shift in my department and it too hard to move to another department . some times in season i have to stay till 3 am."
good,"It's an ok place to work. I was terminated after reporting my manager for taking games home. A typical day involves receiving shipment, processing shipment, scanning inventory, processing outgoing shipments, weekly conference calls, as well as greeting and selling to customers, pushing the preorders for specific games and the power up subscription/discount service."
good,Generally a great work environment due to the efforts of the store leaders and common interests shared by employees. Advancement is questionable and hours can be inconsistent. The discounts on collectibles and games are strong incentives to remain part of the company.
good,"It was fun while it lasted. It was the holiday season so things were admittedly hectic, but other than that it was cool. I'd go back, if they needed me."
good,"Being an SGA was great for personal development and learning how to run your own shop, however it felt like while I wanted to run things a certain way we still had to follow whatever the District Leader wanted to."
good,"I enjoy my work at Gamestop, my team and the extended IT and business folks. The data and analytics transformation and modernization roadmap has been a challenging and satisfying journey for me personally."
good,"It is a fun place to work short term, but there is more room for growth within other companies. I did appreciate my time there as I self taught a lot of management skills being placed in the position."
good,"it  was a really calm place to work at and it was fun the only bad thing was the amount of hours I would get per week, it would be around 5-10 and it was just not enough hours for someone to sustain themselves"
good,"Working with GameStop is simultaneously fun and relaxed while being competitive with sales. The job itself is phenomenal, however, management can make or break the work experience itself. Interaction with guests is genuine and always exciting and policies are fair."
good,"This job helped guide me to my current field of accounting, being in charge of inventory, deposits, nightly numbers. The such got me interested in the basics of accounting which gave me a reason to look more in accounting."
good,"I know how this story goes for most, GameStop has a bad image but is a generally fun place to work if you have the right managers above you. At my location I have an excellent Store Leader and District Leader. This has allowed me to continue developing my management skills and to progress my career. I have heard the horror stories of past and current GameStop managers and while there is some merit to their issues with GameStop, I feel that others expected to do less work for more pay. GameStop does undervalue most of their employees but not by the margins that other may have made it seem. I know I am underpaid but it is only slightly for my position. If I had a degree of some type then I would say I am vastly underpaid."
good,Everyday was exciting to go to work. I got to talk about things I loved and work with a great team. The only things negative about the job was salary and the advancement opportunities.
good,"I loved working for GameStop but there were some decisions I don't feel were the best for the teams that support the company. I did learn a lot on management, running a business and customer care. Engaging with a lot of the people and my regulars was always fun."
good,"I enjoyed working at GameStop but it had it's hardships. I was hired as a part time key holder, but I was working over 40 hours. I had no social life and I was constantly at work. I enjoyed Working with the costumers and provide them the games they wanted. I enjoyed my manager and fellow employees, upper management were questionable and the things they wanted you to focus on were ridiculous. Nevertheless I enjoyed my time with Game Stop and I saw it as a great experience."
good,"All employees welcomed me and helped me learn the system. I was never treated like an outsider, my work was always appreciated. It never felt like too much was asked of me. Always offered more hours. If I could've stayed there I would."
good,Working at Gamestop has allowed me to expand my knowledge of the video game world. It was a great experience that guided me through my first job ever. I would not have changed anything. My coworkers were very selfless and were there to help along the way as well. I would gladly work there again if I had the chance.
good,Innovative company with an opportunity to work with advanced technology.  Limited opportunities for career growth as people stayed for the excitement of the industry and technology opportunities.
good,This job was perfect for what I was looking for at the time: a laid back low stress job to pay my bills while I was in school. The management at my location was very good and I enjoyed my time working there.
good,"Definitely a very fun and exciting place to work at first. Hours can be very minimal starting out, 4-8 per week if any. Once promoted hours will rise and more responsibility is given. The workplace is typically calm and slow but can be very busy and stressful if not handled correctly. Learned a lot about running a store and customer interaction. Most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the guests and having friendly conversation about the mutual love of games."
good,"Gamestop legacy brand is failing and the company made it the fault of the employees on the bottom level. To combat floundering sales, introduced ""Circle of Life"" metric to try to motivate people. This ended up stressing out employees to the point where they made shady and underhanded deals in order to get numbers."
good,"My coworkers are the best part of working here other than the actual games. The customers and management leave something desired. It has recently been changed so that you are there by yourself mostly, and if you are in a slow store it can get very boring."
good,"I had a good time working for them. I met and had the chance to  socialize with customers about games. It's a retail job, so all they care about are sales."
good,As this was my first job I can say that this store is capable in teaching you all that you need to know about what to do and what not to do as an employee. I was able to learn many things while I was here and it was beneficial for the other jobs that I have obtained in the future. I am very thankful to GameStop for giving me employment history.
good,"The customers were the best part of the job. I learned a lot about other genres of games, some that I myself would never normally be into. Management was always very nice yet strict which I enjoyed. The culture was video games!!! The hardest part was probably Black Fridays and making sure that everyone knew their part. The best part of the job was talking to my repeat customers."
good,"The customers are great. Especially if you love gaming. However, sometimes the higher management in your district can be really hard to work with. The politics has to due with the churn this company receives."
good,its a good work environment but really terrible pay. could use more hours and a better room for growth. really positive environment. The only hard part of the job is put the game in Alphabetic order.
good,as a company i loved it  but at the location i was at the management wasnt good at all there was not much done for hands on training and at times it feels like you are set up to fail
good,Super fun working with the public.  Hours are determined by corporate not actual hours needed at the store.  Salary was advertised as 40k/year and was actually 23k per year MAX.
good,"Management gets treated like garbage. Low level employees have it the easiest; great customers, fun store to work in, and surrounded by games. Great place to part time or fresh out of high school."
good,"There is a lot of sales pressure and your typically trying to get minimum wage entry level employees to take the metrics seriously. "
good,It's cool if you don't need the money but if you got bills to pay then don't do it. You will be stressed by your district manager who will come in and yell about something then tell you to do it the exact same way.
good,"It’s a great place to work, just wish they would pay us more, to compisate for the amount of hours that employees don’t get. Most of the employees getting the better/ more hours a week are the managers; which is normal and expected. but also the people that have been there longer. Which isn’t fair to the people that just got hired on, we still have families to feed and bills to pay for too, just like all the other employees."
good,"Hours and benefits weren't great. This job is more for people seeking part time work. On the other hand, it is a very fun place to work. It is laid back and there isn't a strict dress code. (At least not while I was there.)"
good,its a great place to work. but don't expect good pay or more hours for a long time. was there for 5 months and didn't get a decent raise. starting pay is  7.25.
good,"The job was a lot different than I expected. It was actually more of a sales job, focusing on subscriptions and reservations than I anticipated. I spent a lot of time with customers and making sure we answered their questions and found the games they needed. I was one step below the assistant manager in terms of store management and that allowed me to do more than just sell. I liked opening the store, doing inventory and changing out the displays."
good,"Great company that values volunteering and giving back. The pay is fairly low and Benefits is not the best, but the brand speaks for itself and that’s why people come and stay."
good,"When i was hired at game stop it was a seasonal hiring, so although I was not on board for long I still was able to see the amount of fun and regularity a full time employee could have there. The discounts got better when being a full time employee as well."
good,It is a gaming company. There are always new things coming out and updating so there are always new things to learn and sell. It was always a fun time to be there and was rarely very stressful as all of the company goals are easily attained by simply being a good customer service representative to your guests.
good,Great environment for the gaming enthusiast as long as they can handle the pressure of a competitive sales floor. Must be able to at least know the key points of most titles or consoles on sale preferable with the ability to turn those into sales to the customer.
good,"The job is stressful sometimes but the most fun I've had was working for gamestop.  They want you to hit a certain number for sales, pre-owned sales, powerup cards, reserves. But they don't offer any compensation for hitting those numbers it's just get them or we'll find someone else who does.  I always hit those numbers but still it isn't the best way. I worked there when the midnight releases were actually at midnight.  I worked for the black Fridays late at night and had to come back in in four hours to work some more.  I don't mean to sound like it's a problem because it really wasn't for the underpaid job that it was I had a lot of fun.  They treat people for the most part well. The customer base is really snobby but it's whatever joke around with them and they will love you by the end of the transaction."
good,"Overall great job, however there is a lot of do it or else mentality from upper management. This does not promote a healthy work environment for the staff who runs the store. Being threatened to be terminated and being scared of managing is not healthy for the compu or it’s employees."
good,"My first job and I loved it. It lacked many things, but I didn't expect much then. No OT, benefits aside discounts, pay sucked, but my SM was great and helpful. If you do good and what you're supposed to, you can move up."
good,"Gamestop its a good place to get a job( good work place environment and very organize, but after some time you realize that a regular employee have almost zero to none benefits compare to other retail stores."
good,This was a great place to work. The atmosphere was great since we were all passionate about our products. Always enjoyed going into work since the people were super friendly.
good,"Great place to work, fun environment, awesome managers and diverse culture.  Only lacking competitive compensation and pay.  Great Managers who are flexible and fun."
good,Good Job for someone that is single and loves collectables and video games and enjoys sales. Hours aren't always conducive to a good work-life balance.
good,"The atmosphere is for the most part a fun place, but the benefits don'y really make up for the work I put in and the pay I got out. Numbers are a really big thing here."
good,Great experience but sometimes the manager was not specific when it came to helping us help the customer. It is very stressful during the holidays due to a lot of customers being in the store.
good,Great environment. Always meeting new people and happy faces. Great environment to be in. Not enough pay or benefits for someone with a family and bills to take care of. Recommended for people fresh out of school. Looking for something part time. Good for a first job.
good,A typical day is periods of time where there are no customers so the time is spent chatting about games and taking care of the store.  Interspersed with those periods of time are points where the store can be bustling with customers and you are busy helping them pick a game or finding what they came to buy.
good,It helped me be more patient with irritable customers. So many people have a negative opinion of gamestop and my team was pretty good at changing their minds about the company. I just grew tired of it i guess.
good,"Sales is the absolute goal, even over professional work ethic; there is this mentality that even if you go the extra mile working in your store to make it look nice and perform appropriate tasks that it is still not enough if you do not sell every single one of their products."
good,While the discount is nice the obsession with numbers and the extremely low pay makes it slightly depressing. It's not terrible to work at GameStop just be prepared for very low pay and low hours.
good,"In charge of all Cashier Registry transactions."
good,"Working at GameStop gave me great experience with guest services and also a deeper look into what I want to do with my life when I got a real job. I want to get out of retail because of GameStop, not in a bad way, but I worked so much that I am burned out. A day at GameStop at my location was varied, it could be an out of control day with non-stop work or a completely boring day standing around doing nothing. Management liked and treated me well and was very helpful in providing time off or working around my hours for classes. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping each guest find what they wanted and have them leave with a smile on their face while giving me a handshake and a thank you for my help."
good,What made working at GameStop interesting was the staff & the regular customers that came into the store. You never knew what to expect how the day will be going.
good,"GameStop was my first place of employment and I was lucky to have a very relaxed yet professional Store Manager and a super cool ASM. We we're expected to work hard but never felt as though we would be punished for falling just slightly below goals. This actually pushed us to work harder to meet quarterly goals for sales and card registration. The only issues I ever had were with overly angry customers and some problems at the corporate level that didn't directly effect employees at my level. Overall, there was a very relaxed atmosphere, fun employees, and a decent discount."
good,This was a government funded program that I was in so I could get work experience and it was only a temporary work setting.  A typical day was full of clients looking to purchase different games. Management was very nice. The most enjoyable part of the job was answering questions on the games. I learned how to organize inventory and some customer service skills which included direct contact and speaking to clients. The workplace culture was easy going. The hardest part of the job was not being able to speak to clients in Spanish as I only know a little bit of Spanish.
good,This job had a lot to do with dealing with people and helping customers have the best experience.  It really helped me work with so many different types of customers.
good,Gamestop was a fun place to work at but unfortunately i had to move because I had a baby and I did not want to raise my child in Philadelphia but I would love to work there again if I was paid fairly
good,"GameStop still stands as one of the best overall companies I have worked for. They are an adaptable company and work to stay relevant in their industry, which is a must for a company that is based in the technology field. There is a lot of thought that goes into their business practices and some of those practices can seem overbearing or unnecessary at a first glance, they keep the company communication, organization, and functionality on point."
good,Pretty nice place that I worked for.  Management was pretty chill and I got along with everyone there.  Holidays can get a little hectic but that's any retail store around that time
good,Fun I was in high school when I worked here so had to be a team player and all this was a seasonal job but good way for young and old to grow and learn in retail
good,"For working 45 hours a week to manage a 3 million dollar store, you put in a lot of hard work for relatively small pay.  The team you work with is great because you are all focused on the same things, but, it does get stressful because hours are managed by corporate.  Sometimes you will be the only one there by yourself and you will have to make tough decisions when your store is packed and no one is there to help you.  Make sure you keep an open eye on your merchandise or else someone will walk right out of the store with it."
good,"The company is in the interest of making more money and not really with new employee retention. First few months everything goes good and then you begin to see all of the faults and that makes it hard to focus on good things. Managers are interested in their personal gains and not yours. The co-workers were AMAZING and the management was too, well for a little while any way. Overall I would not recommend this as a more then just a job and not a career."
good,"It's a good job to get your foot in the door for retail. You meet a lot of cool people and make new friends that have similar interest as you. Depending on you're at, management can be good or bad just depends on the location. Holidays are crazy but you're able to get insider information that will help you better understand what's the come in the gaming world."
good,Most gamestops unless you are willing to relocate or wait till some one is fired or quits there is little to no room for advancement. The discount is nice but the pay leaves a lot to be desired.
good,"Taking care of customers is number one priority. Providing customers with good customer service, taking care of their needs and bringing smiles to everyone's faces was key to a good days work."
good,"I've worked for GameStop for over 3 years and I've had a great time. I learned about the products we sold and I also got hands on experience when It came to Retail work. I really opened myself to the place as well to customers and always achieve to maintain 100% customer satisfaction. After 2 years I noticed the company was a little harsh towards their employees, especially in ways that the employee had no choice but to either be fired or quit which is not good. I loved my job and I would work there again. GameStop itself is a great company but the people who are running it should make it a better experience for their employees."
good,"Working for this company for the second time was very thrilling for me but after a wonderful manager transferred over to another state everything went down the drain. It is sad that the company of game stop still hires people who are not game knowledgeable in gaming, nor care about gaming as much as a game enthusiast would."
good,Normal 8 hour workday typically worked alone for a couple hours until someone else came in to work usually just two at a time. The management can differ but mine was pretty cool. The selling culture of Gamestop can cause some stress but it was going though changes just after I left. Overall job wasn't too hard and most of our customers enjoyed coming in.
good,"Ho imparato ad aprire il punto vendita, aprire e chiudere cassa, gestione del magazzino, usare il pc in funzione del lavoro"
good,Can be a fun work environment if you can connect with management. Trying to connect with upper management is next to impossible. Also being so focused on sales sometimes it feels as though customers can be overlooked.
good,The staff is fun although the rules and promos change constantly or at least it seems that way. You meet really cool people and get to have fun conversations on a daily basis.
good,"-Receiving and filing inventory, informing customers on product quality, keep inventory organized and properly displayed"
good,"Working at Game Stop is a behind the scenes environment where you can not only get paid about informing customers about new promos, but an exciting environment where you can educate yourself to become a successor in the gaming field."
good,Great fun place to work and learn for higher level retail jobs. Most stores have the potential for a good atmosphere depending on local management. Advancement is nearly impossible and pay is lacking.
good,Easy work environment that has some simple task of organizing and keeping store clean. Holidays and sale days keeps you always on your toes searching.
good,"Loved working for Gamestop.  Honored to be a part of their growth,"
good,"If your willing to put in the work and commit to the best practices laid out by the company, you can become a store leader in short time. But it starts with you. Being able to achieve your sales goals and then turning around teaching your how your achieving your sales goals are the marks of a true leader and teacher. A job is a job and just because it's in videogames, doesn't make it any less than a job. We have goals to achieve just like any sales position. But doing it with integrity and leading by example are the best ways to build a team culture of winning."
good,It can be a very fun environment but with all of the goals that are set by corporate it can be much more stressful than it should be. If a goal is not met then you are almost sure to be written up. The guests are what makes it a very fun place to work but that tends to be it.
good,The people you work with in the store are generally great. Upper management tends to assign unrealistic tasks for the store and then gets upset when you don't complete these tasks. (As an example a store remodel  on black Friday.) If you do your job to the best of your abilities and are a nice person you should have a good time. Store mangers are looking to advance employees because it makes them look better but when you reach assistant store manager you can only move up when a spot opens up. This can be hard to do if you have a regional manager who keeps bringing people in from outside the company instead of promotion up the chain.
good,"I work at GameStop part time and its great, i really like it but there is not much room for advancement. They have strict hours to give, there very tight about how many hours to give but there will be extra hours on some days. The work place is fun and your coworkers are great, my boss is wonderful. the hardest thing is keeping your numers in sales up, like any sales store, no commission."
good,"Work was rewarding, but repetitive. I was in need of a higher paying job however. The hours, while flexible, sometimes mad it more difficult to spend time with my family."
good,"Gamestop doesn't have a lot of area for growth, but as a job to pay for college, or to retire to it has a lot of benefits. Mainly that most people who go into the store are there because they want to be and have an interest in the products. I can't remember a single negative conversation with any customer."
good,"Management could use work, I left because the environment became incredibly hostile, and it was affecting my health. However there are many friendly customers, and most of the Staff were awesome."
good,"*I worked at GameStop through Cornerstone Staffing Agency."
good,"Good experience for customer service skills and the register. Co-workers made work time a lot more enjoyable, overall had a nice experience."
good,Everybody helps each other out. Everybody get along well. My job is to cut boxes open and take whatever inside and try to stack them in pallets. I also help make boxes and many more...
good,This job is not one for someone looking to stay with a company and advance upwards. The pay is abysmal but co workers and customers are fantastic. The inventory can quickly get out of hand and the time crunches can be unnecessary tight.
good,"Everyday at Gamestop was an experience."
good,"Working for GameStop is a culture job. I loved every minute of this job. Working with people who have the same interests as you, and being able to talk with customers and see their excitement for the upcoming games is a lot of fun."
good,it can be a better run organization. Have some good managers but can improve on training of their management team. Can do a better job of innovation and roadmaps.
good,"Gamestop was by far my favorite place to work when it comes to the managers and the atmosphere. The customers were fun most of the time. The biggest problem was the fact that the one I worked at was way overstaffed. The result of that was VERY few hours each week. I would have as little as 4 hours some weeks. I was forced to leave because of the fact that I wasn't making anything. I was almost losing money because I wasn't getting paid but like $75-$100 bi-weekly. If you do it seasonal, however, you will be worked almost full time. The pay is minimum wage. It's expected, considering the fact that you aren't doing a whole lot."
good,"Gamestop is a really great place to work if you're in lower management.  Gamestop has a crippling problem of giving too many unreasonable requirements to its employees.  Many times I would find myself questioning the motivations of the company.  The company definitively does not have the customer;s best interest at heart, and it caused a lot of moral conflict. Overall, when you work there and don't have to be concerned with bad company direction, its a lot of fun."
good,"Worked during the Holiday Season. It can be a very relaxing and also a very stressful job, but can be rewarding for those who love the video game culture. If you have fantastic customer service skills you are the right fit for this job, especially if you know a lot about the video game industry and it's business. "
good,"Typical day at GameStop includes a variety of duties including handling sales with customers, answering phones, taking in and sending out shipment, training staff, making wall moves, among many other tedious duties. This job for the most part is easy to learn, however there isnt much space to grow once you become a store manager."
good,"Fun place to be working hard, as a manager I was making ONLY 9.60/hr, Management needs to step up promote from within, hire-ups never seem to have time to help with personal development"
good,"typical day , go in, make sure shelves are in alphabetical order, ring up customers purchases, pre-orders etc. management isnt great at all to be honest. barley any hours and minimum wage, was lucky to make it out with a little over a hundred dollars a paycheck after taxes."
good,"job was awesome to be able to be in the know about the latest and greatest in games and electronics, but the amount of work/ responsibilities that came with the job was not met by the pay even after a promotion and pay raise"
good,"I was only seasonal hire for a short time, but the little work I got was great. I learned a lot of new stuff about Marketing and Customer Service that has served me well since then. I'm much more confident at talking to people since this job was reliant on it."
good,"Not a bad job, the customers really made it worth it. Being able to be involved with a company like this was great but a lot of promises went unfulfilled or forgot. Company on a whole isn't bad but some of it's SM's in place are terrible."
good,Working at Gamestop was my first official job and it allowed me to work in a different environment other than fast food. Working in a retail environment within the mall gave me a different pace to working and interacting with customers. Also the gaming culture is something a person can really develop a passion for.
good,"I work  here much less than I used to.  Its not a bad job if you have a good management team.  Ive worked at facilities with both ends of the spectrum concerning strong management.  You're required to hit particular sales goals weekly, or your hours get cut. Bonuses don't happen and the pay is minimum wage.  You do get a yearly review for a raise, usually a maximum of $0.75.  Most employees range around the .40 to .50 cent per year range. You have to be management to get full time (shift manager does not count) and   if you are lower leveled than shoft manager, you typically only get 4 hours a week on average.  If gaming is your thing, the customers are typically great."
good,"A typical day at work involved helping customers with their needs, whether it be if they were trading in items or just purchasing in general or coming in to have a conversation about a new game. I learned how important organization is needed behind the counter, things need to be exactly where they should to efficiently help a customer. At the time, management was not the best, he did nothing but let whoever was on the floor and register do their thing while he sat in the back and slept. But that gave us coworkers the opportunity to bring up our own morale and get things done. The hardest part of the job was the lack of appropriate management. But the best part was the camaraderie involved in learning new things from coworkers and customers that would go to helping future customers"
good,While working at Gamestop I was thoroughly trained on my customer service skills along with other important duties. Organization was another key part of being a GameStop employee. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with customers. Being able to recognize regular customers and acknowledging them was one thing that I made a goal of.
good,"Its fun to talk about my hobbies as I work with people, however the hours suck here. To move up you better have the numbers and they might consider you."
good,I worked for GameStop for almost 3 years. The customers made it enjoyable to work there. The customer base was great. I've had great mangers and I've had managers that I questioned.
good,in the metro area the lack of growth suck and many good people get overlooked because they haven't seen much inside hiring
good,"It's a pretty simple job, its fun, you get a few perks. Down side its low hours and seasonal jobs. Mostly good if you can get a decent permanent position."
good,"Very hard place to work, huge inventory, managers have a lot of power over their store operations which in turn let them have a big impact on their PnL. Very good work ethics. Does not look like it but one of the most difficult management job out there."
good,"Basically you would just walk in, sign into your computer and start your day! it was very simple and everything was very organized. I learned how to use new software which I got a hang of very quickly and learned how to have a better understanding of great customer service. My managers were patient and very nice, they helped me with things i had problems with and even gave me advice at how i could do that job even quicker the next time. The hardest part of the job was just the trash, that wasn't even that hard though. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to socialize with new people and get a better understanding of what they are wanting from the company! i got to meet a lot of new faces and I loved making sales."
good,A typical day at GameStop as a Supervisor is coming in and finding out what has to get out the door that day. Once that is identify plan and execute the labor needed to make it happen. Once the daily task are done you start planning for the next day and or the rest of the week to try to identify any possible issues that may arise.
good,"most of the time you would be at the cash register, or sorting inventory, but it is a very calm and welcoming environment for the workers and the customers."
good,"If you like gaming it'll be fun to work here, just don't expect to make a lot of money. From what i remember they let you borrow games so you can test them out which is one of the coolest things about any company."
good,"I enjoyed my time with V-Tech because it helped me build on my experience as an equipment operator and helped me learn another new trade. On a daily basis, I repaired, constructed or deconstructed power lines both overhead and underground. Also operated excavators and underground boring rigs"
good,We are constantly marching forwad when talking about technology. And if you like the gamming world like do... this is a very good job for you.
good,"The job is fun and you create a family within the workplace. Its easy to learn, but very hard to advance. Personally an employee is not paid enough to work in the environment full-time, but if this is just a part-time job, then it is pretty fun."
good,Very fun and upbeat environment that had you constantly on the run to provide constant customer service and that was the fun part was seeing every customer and meeting new ones every time.
good,"Fun place to work as a gamer. A lot of focus on company products such as their discount program, credit card and pre-orders for upcoming titles. Advancement is generally very slow and they tend to hire management positions from outside of the company.  If you love games and know about the various consoles and systems, this is a great place to start in the workforce."
good,I've worked with 15 different store managers over the 8 years I've been with the company. A good store manager can steer the staff to excellent results. Stay away from managers that don't complete the work that assigned to them or ones that heavily micro manage.
good,I get to work and ask if there if there is anything new happening that i should know. I learned how to figure out what people are looking for. the management had weaknesses. The coworkers were very friendly. My feet hurt from standing too much. talking to customers about games and there interests.
good,Put away stack of empty game cases that have been bought back on the floor. They are pushy about getting people to buy reserves and scratch protection plans on games. Another then that not a bad place to work if you like video games
good,"When on shift one would help customers with the new games and help make selections. "
good,"Great people to work with, the job is very simple very hard to move from the inside as when the opportunity presented itself I should of been promoted but they hired a guy from the outside who never worked before."
good,"Working at GameStop was an interesting experience with plenty of fun customers to assist, good people to work with and positive encouragement from management."
good,"L'ambiente di lavoro in cui ci si trova è giovanile. Le possibilità di carriera sono minime, spesso ci si trova ad entrare come commesso e così si resta. La paga è normale , comune al contratto CCNL. Tutto sommato è un buon ambiente di lavoro"
good,If you are a fan of video games Gamestop is a great place to work. Most of my day was split up in to organizing traded in games and helping customers with anything they needed. The most challenging part of the job had to be how busy it can get during the holiday season. The best part Gamestop has to be working with like minded people who share a passion for video games.
good,"Normal day was just helping the customers in every way available, sorting the inventory so items were easy to find, answering phone calls, and point of sale services. Managers were ok, not the type of people I would go out after work with, but ok, as were all of the co-workers I had while I was there. A great place if gaming is your scene, as is mine, people are people, can't control all of what happens, but if you enjoy customer service and like gaming, then there really isn't a better option."
good,"Gamestop is a great place to work if you enjoy videogames! Management there is flexible, promotions are very common and helping other store as well."
good,"As my first Job as a general manager it thought me a lot, Was a fun job, great clients and fun to work with employees. On the bad note pay is extremely low"
good,"I was not employed long at Gamestop, but what time I spent there was pretty fun. The only gripe I had was the managment at my store, we were the only Game Stop in the city that was openly avoided because our assistant manager was over selling product to his customers, and would often be rude and over pushy. Our manager was not much better, she was stealing from the company, and taking advantage of her power as manager. I caught her stealing twice, reported her to LP, and the only thing they said they would do is look into it, which nothing came of it."
good,"Advising games to customers everyday , helping younger kids that come in the store that need help looking for certain items in the store. All the co workers i worked with were very respectful, and were very helpful ,and nice. The management was excellent. The hardest part of my job was getting to every customer in the store to see if they need help , it gets pretty intense when we have good deals the store gets crowed sometimes. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing happy customers walk out of there store with a big smile and a lot of items they have purchased."
good,"I have worked at gamestop for over a year now, the management there is excellent. The only downfall is the hours.... no set structure on hours so it is difficult to make plans outside of work as one week you will work night and next week mornings and then mixtures of both."
good,"A typical day at this job included helping customers find merchandise and answering questions that related to the market. I learned a lot about consoles, the gaming industry and what makes the community tick. The management, within the store, was wonderful but the district manager could get rather frustrating to work with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the sexism that came with being a female gamer but the most enjoyable part was being able to talk about something that I love on a regulr basis."
good,assist customers. working there with my co-workers were great. nothing but good times and great laughs
good,"Everyday is generally the same, in a good way of course, I come in and immediately get to work by talking about one of my favorite past times with our customers. I have had many jobs in the past and i can say that out of all of them working at Gamestop has by far had the best atmosphere to work in. All of my co-workers are great people that are easy to get along with and management has always been helpful when i needed it to be. The only downside to the job is moving up in the company can be very difficult and has thus far been out of my reach. Overall though working their has been great and our customers are great."
good,"15% off of most products plus an extra 10% with their rewards card made for a decent benefit, especially if one plays as many games as I do. Part-timers will usually get the short end of the stick in the off months of summer but come winter time when game developers start bringing out the big games for the Holiday Season, you will get all the hours you could want from a part time job. I had only worked there for 9 months before their offered me a promotion opportunity. They said that they were always looking for people who showed management potential."
good,"My typical day at work would be arriving as scheduled and performing the tasks a sales associate would do. Throughout the day I would work the register and maintained a neat, and organized showroom. Stock shelves and call or find specific merchandise the a customer needed. Management was friendly, helpful, supportive, and professional. Co-workers where fun, positive, helpful, and polite. The hardest part was going into the backroom and finding the merchandise. The enjoyable part was I got to rent out games and have fun."
good,"was talking to the customers about how awesome the video game was, and how the they would react back to you and get all excited."
good,"A typical day at GameStop is typically a great time. Most of the work there is what you make it. Yes we were required to meet over the top sales goals, but if you push and try hard enough eventually you would make it to the top. I had a blast a large portion of my time in GameStop. My major gripe with the business was its ""glass ceiling"" for improvement. It was always stressed that you could be the next Store Manager or ASM, but in reality only so many of those jobs exist and for the most part management stuck around in my part. That and their wages are incredibly low for the things that their employees have to endure."
good,"The quick and easy review is in the summary. It says it all.  Althought the pay could be better, the benefits could make up for it for the right person.  This job would fit well with a college student getting money."
good,Gamestop provided me with an opportunity to meet and befriend many people of different cultural backgrounds and ethnicities. Unfortunately the 3:45pm start and 11:45pm end of my shift heavily interfered with my ability to succeed as a full-time student.
good,"Gamestop was a great experience. Work days varied, but overall the job setting was fun. I learned many things, such as being a keyholder and the responsibilities that come with it. Made great friends with customers and co-workers."
good,"Great work place, underpaid, great people. Awesome place. Too dusty though."
good,"A typical day would consist of stocking shelves, organizing shelves, and helping customers. I learned a lot about game systems. The management was great and my co-workers were really friendly."
good,"The manager was great, super friendly along with the coworkers. Got to test out games and game consoles."
good,"It is very fun working here and you meet a lot of great customers, however it is very slow and there is not much work same days. A typical day there is organizing the store and waiting to help customers. Ive learned so much at this store because i was placed into management right away, it proved that i was able to learn in a very short amount of time. The management i felt was lacking, there was never really a clear goal or plan for the day, or there wasn't much information given about an upcoming event or sale which made it very hard to be prepared for all things, which was the hardest part of this job."
good,"Alphabetize games."
good,Ambiente di lavoro stimolante e con un atmosfera positiva. ottima predisposizione al lavoro in team.
good,Working at Gamestop was over whelming with long nights & a lot of stressful work .
good,Management was not always aware of the employees needs and not always want to get there hands dirty with the game advisor jobs
good,"With each day there is always a new challenge. This comes with a manufacturing environment. "
good,This is by far the funnest job I've had. The people are great and the job is easy if goals are met.
good,"Una tipica giornata di lavoro era composta dall'organizzazione delle attività lavorative quotidiane ed extra, da impartire al proprio staff, dallo stabilire gli obiettivi commerciali che il team in ogni giornata doveva raggiungere per ottenere il 100% che il punto vendita aveva come budget preventivato."
good,"I loved working at gamestop, it is one of the best jobs I could possibly had. perfect for gamers but is not all about games, sales is an important part of the job, and its not all fun and talk about video games."
good,We work hard to create a work environment of respect and accountability.
good,"I've worked retail for a while and I can say this was a good store to work in. If you love video games and like doing sales and customer service, then this is the place for you. There is room for advancement but not really much after you become store manager. The pay was not anywhere nearly enough for what a manager was required to do. The company gave each store very little hours additional keyholders. This was done based off the fact that the manager was on a salary and could work 70-100 hours per week without any overtime pay. The company had pretty good benefits and the employees were treated fair. My biggest gripes are the way corporate seemed to have zero understanding of what actual happens in a store and what the stores needs are. Pushing your employees o make high sales volume and to be 100 percent knowledgeable of all the current promotions with only giving them 4 hours a week to work doesn't make any sense."
good,"GameStop is a fine retail store that demands determination and hard work to advance. This is however depending on the supervisors you're employed under. I was fast tracked to management in less than a year and created a big enough reputation that many stores wanted my skills. However when it came time for my next advancement, it seemed the district manager brought in his personal (stress) life to work slowing down my progress drastically. Poor communication skills also did help the situation. Lack of communication seems to be a big issue for many stores."
good,"In a typical work day, you could expect a slew of customers of all ages. I learned how to deal with a very fast pace work place, which could go from zero to one hundred in five minutes."
good,"The company itself makes it difficult to move up, and the amount of top-down managing tends to muff up the day to day work environment. However the employees and the customer base are more than usually a delight to work with."
good,"GameStop has offered a variety of opportunities which has offered given me substantial growth in a business perspective. In my 2 years at GameStop I have learned coaching and leadership techniques to make my team both effective and efficient in sales. My store in particular is relatively slow, which means that I have an ample amount of time to spend with the customer. In the time I am not spending with customers I am either processing trades, distribution boxes, sending boxes out, restocking shelves, updating planograms, or store cleaning. My co-workers are relatively nice and make it a fun and friendly environment. The hardest part of the job is dealing with disgruntled customers, but besides that the job is relatively easy.The problem are sometimes are company standards and expectations and with no incentive to do better in numbers (other then to keep your job) it can be really discouraging or nerve racking to hit quotas. This leads to some unprofessional/unethical practices a lot of store in the recent years have been caught cheating, buffing numbers, and sometimes cheating the customer to get quotas. Although this is disheartening the truth is these standards put sales reps in very difficult situations. The other problem is that there is no guarantee that your performance will lead to more hours or a promotion in the company."
good,"Always there a little early so I can know what the day has been like, the manager liked my knowledge and know-how every since I started going in there.  My co-workers were their own comedians, just so long as they didn't quit their day jobs, just kidding.  Everything just seemed to flow there."
good,"A typical day at Gamestop is logging in then going through a book in which shows game news like new releases and pre-orders it also shows stock, sales and what needs to be sold. The information was very useful especially for a sale based job like Gamestop. my co-workers were very polite and easy to work with. The best part of the the day besides being around different genres of games are the different customers that come in, every sale is different and its great to see the different interest that each individual has with their own genre of game. worst days are probably slow days because slow days means little sales. "
good,"I would run the day to day operations, learned how to help guest and help them find what they needed and learn more about their likes and dislikes. "
good,very fun and customer oriented. Amazing staff and benefits.
good,Typical retail work. Learned that no matter how hard you work honestly to be the best at what you do people will envy you and bring you down. Co-workers were fun. Hardest part of the job were the constant scrutiny of mistrust from the company. Seemed like the better you did the more the less they trusted you which makes you feel like just staying a middle of the road manager is a better way to keep your job.
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with but retail is a very pushy type of work.
good,because the company was so big and worried about numbers and who had better sales i often didnt get enough hours
good,"I really didn't get a lot of days to work there, but when I did I really enjoyed myself there."
good,"A typical day at work for me was greeting the customer, restocking shelves, organizing merchandise and answering any questions. I learned a lot from the experience. I became comfortable talking and answering questions that a customer had. The managment was adequete. My co-workers were fun to work with while still being on top of everything in the store. I got to know them well and I felt comfortable around them. There was nothing hard about the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the customer, answering their questions, and giving my opinion about something if they asked."
good,"Just talking about video games and getting paid is every teenage boys dream. Gamestop was a great job for me and I love it, when I got promoted to Assistant manager that's when things changed. Employees never listen and ended up wandering away from their duties. The manager was very nice when they were having a good day but when they were angry it was like going in to a T-Rex pen with goat meat strapped all over you. Customers were really great people to talk to but a handful of them need to bathe. I loved this job and in the grand scheme of things I wish I never left. If your in High School you will get little hours and not the best pay, if you make it to management you will get a pretty penny."
good,Most days we kept a smile on our face and did our best to spread the good attitude to our customers.
good,"A typical day at work is filing away games and placing the empty display cases back up o the way. Greeting customers and answering their question about games, gaming consoles, and up coming games. I've learning the different gaming styles, such as, first person, third person, and opened world. Management makes my work day easy. We have a great team working system where as to all the Game Advisers helps the other out. The hardest part of my job is trying to get reservations on up-coming games and up-selling the Pro membership card because not everyone wants to do it. The most enjoyable part of my job is trying out new games and also learning more about up-coming games and gaming consoles."
good,"I enjoyed the general feeling and vibe when I worked there. Due to some cooperate management issues, I wasn't able to be kept on as the store was in a sort of crisis when I was hired on as a seasonal greeter. Ideally, I was going to be fully trained on the register. Otherwise, I did cleaning, organizing, and filled customers in on game information and products available. What I enjoyed most about the place were the people I worked with, but the hardest part was a shaky management that was too worried to confront one single person on poor performance, so we were all grouped in. I'd love to work in a similar setting again, all the same."
good,The most enjoyable aspect of working at the Gamestop DC is the people working there. Everyone is friendly.
good,"Although I've enjoyed working at Gamestop (I've been here twice now), it's disappointing to see not much has changed within the company. While the territory is familiar and never dull, the inconsistent hours and little to no guarantee of employment beyond the Christmas season made it hard to really grow within the company. Despite the atmosphere being fun to work in with considerate and respectful management, it was ultimately a let-down considering the process it took to get hired initially."
good,"I was in highschool at the time and it was a very fun place to work I always received free games that hasnt been released, free murchandise, and the mamagers always provided lunch."
good,Its A hard business but once you get use to it you'll have fun and everything seems easy also the pay is great
good,Working to assist customers on the normal day is quite enjoyable to the fact that im an upbeat person and really enjoy my job when it comes to someone interested in gaming like me. The learning process was easy how to make sales at a basic level however I want to learn a more advanced way to do things as my demeanor does not allow me to settle for as is compensation and placement for very long. Learning how to break down a sale in order to conjure up the next sale offering more than the last sale to improve the numbers that I have already aquired. Co-workers for the most part are on an ok level the manager wise awesome district manager not so awesome if you know what I mean everyone else gets into the gaming as much as I do and thats what make sme want to work with them even on a bad day. The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with a customer who feels ripped off to some point when they do not fully understand everything that is going on with the explaining so breaking down the sale and explaining every detail is hard when they refuse to listen. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you have that one customer sympathizing with you on a game of the same liking and thus making the sale easy with a smile on their face.
good,"Incredible place to work if you don't mind having a boss. The ability to move up fast, good perks and okay compensation."
good,I learned to efficiently muti task for prolonged periods of time and become an overall better leader and manager while working under tense conditions
good,- Easy job just organizing games on shelfs and drawers.
good,"One of the better retail environments to work in. Your experience will highly depend on your immediate supervisor - One of mine was fired for incompetence, the other was an improvement in that he could actually do the job, but was still slightly sociopathic."
good,Pros:
good,"As a sales associate, I was assigned on the store's floor talking to customers or answering any questions they may have.  I was also responsible for helping the store close in a timely manner by cleaning the floor, taking out the trash, or making sure the wall of games were organized.  The employees that I worked with were very laxed whenver it came to showing me what my responsibilities were during training which made it easy for me to understand.  Overall, I would recommend working at Gamestop at the Milpitas Great Mall!"
good,"Every day at Gamestop felt different, and that's not a bad thing. Some days, customers were less and I instead got to focus on my skills in arranging the cases and disks and making sure that everything was in the right order. Other days, it was much more hectic and I got plenty of experience working the register, getting faster at dealing with money and how to handle new hurdles that I hadn't experienced before."
good,"Working at GameStop is a fun job, and lucky for me I really enjoy working with my co-workers. The only problems I have is for working as a guest advisor you are a part time worker, so your hours are limited and only pick up around holiday season. The other problem I have is keeping up with numbers that are supposed to be hit weekly, it's not terrible if you get below them as long as you try to reach the number goals within the next week the store lead should not have a problem with it as long as you are trying, especially if you work in a store that has ahigh traffic with mainly regulars. So, it is hard to hit the goal for getting a pro card if you have customers who already have them."
good,"The fact that GameStop could go out of business. The money they have is shared with who they want to share it with. Other words, if your not like the managers; no matter how hard you work and have zero points you will only see at least 40 cents raise a year."
good,The demands are starting to become desperate. The communication from the top level tends to not deliver on promises as they struggle to keep the company viable and adapt to the coming digital changes. Unsure if the current administration can adapt fast enough to keep the company above water.
good,"Great place work for individuals needing a job, and steady pay. Also for persons trying to gain many varying skills and training. Moral and comradery amongst coworkers is unusually great."
good,"When I worked for Gamestop, it was an enjoyable environment. I definitely think this job is perfect for college students. They have flexible hours and work with your college schedule."
good,"a chill job , very basic job. everyone is friendly and a team player. not Enough hours but work with Your schedule. customers are cool some angry parents sometimes."
good,Job was a fun place to work at learned a alot from managers that work there and help a lot of life advice telling us what we should do with our lives.
good,"Game stop was a great company to work for. I enjoyed all of the people I worked with, and had positive experiences with all of my coworkers. The one downside to working there part-time, was definitely the lack-luster hours I was given. However, the training program for Game Stop employees is truly genius, and I don't know that I've seen any training program is good as theirs. Overall, great place to work."
good,I've worked at multiple locations and it really varies on who is running the store  on how your experience is gonna be if you like the store in your town I'd honestly say ask managers other managers are they usually are very honest
good,Don't expect to get too many hours as a seasonal BUT it is a pretty laid back job and most of the time the customers are very friendly and the staff seems nice too. The discounts are great
good,Management was very supportive. There were weekly sessions to receive mentoring from member leaders of different organizations. Each intern was given a project and presented to senior Management.
good,Management was supportive and was always there when I had a questions. The other employees also were there to help and I got along with them. We all did are parts to help each other and to correct the others when we made a mistake. I thoroughly enjoyed working there
good,"Despite not getting paid much, the amount of joy I got from being around my passion when working was worth it. I loved the flexibility of my shifts and discussing the latest trends in gaming with customers."
good,"My day would usually start with either a full store and line to the wall, or an empty store with my co workers setting stuff up around the store. I would then clock in to get to work and see what I would be doing or how I could help. Usually putting new stickers on game cases or moving boxes from the back to the front of the store in order to distribute merchandise. My co workers were usually a lot of fun to work with because we all loved video games and were excited for upcoming releases. The toughest part of the job was handling customers who felt entitled to whatever it was they were looking for. However, on the other side of the same coin, the best part of the job was always telling people about games they didn't know about and seeing the excitement build on their face when describing what it was and if they'd enjoy it."
good,"Great atmosphere to work in, but corporate management is out of touch with the stores and environment. Things are on an uptick with new management at corporate but it's a slow start."
good,"Typical day at game stop"
good,"Stores aren't too big so you have a more personal relation with customers, compared to the vast size of something like Wal-Mart. Your day can vary depending on the moods customers are in. You'll have your good days and your bad days, though generally the good happen far more often than the bad. Upper management is usually more hands-off unless there's changes happening in the company. The only management you'd have the most contact with is your store leader."
good,"Very difficult to move up from store manager, to much work not enough payroll. Enjoyed job throughout the years, upper management doesn't appreciate you."
good,"though it can be a fun job and sometimes the bonuses are quite fun, the actual pay is barely above minimum. Especially with the demands put on you between, sales goals, inventory counts, the amount of shipment also going in and out."
good,"I loved my job. I loved my regular customers and my staff, however the pay was not ideal for someone raising a family. Almost never had weekends off even if requested in advance. Great benefits and PTO."
good,"I have met many good people and now close friends at Gamestop. It is a great place to work. My managers are fun and responsible, and the atmosphere is overall enjoyable."
good,"Management provided support. Culture was nurturing. most enjoyable was making the customer happy. Hardest is meeting the quotes on pre-order games, subscriptions, and warranties."
good,It's climate contrived so that's a huge plus. In my experience management is usually pretty lenient about time off as long as you let them know. The benefits are great. The only downside for me is the huge amount of overtime required during peak season. August - January or so. The rest of the year is pretty relaxed. But during peak you're likely to be working six days a week ten hours a day. Way too much for me.
good,Working for Gamestop was a long time goal of mine. As a gamer I felt uniquely qualified to work for Gamestop as I could provide experienced reccomendations to our customers. The job was seasonal so I was only there for a few months but it was a good job while it lasted.
good,"I was a part-time seasonal employee during the 2017 holiday season for 2 months. The culture is what really appeals to potential hires, and I can say that being on the same page as your co-workers definitely makes the job more enjoyable."
good,"The biggest issue with this company is the lack of payroll support for training."
good,"A good place to work if you love games, but you need to have selling ability to succeed. Not a job where you just stand around and ring people up! Shy people need not applyh."
good,"A fun place to work for gamers, but it’s still retail and jobs need to get done. Need to ensure certain quotas are hit, organize the store and reset it constantly, on top of a load of other jobs. It’s very manageable work but it’s still work."
good,It was a fun place to work. The only thing is the culture was setup to encourage a new entrepreneur spirit in some decisions. It can be conflicting at times because of that.
good,First of all the compensation at this company is great.  As a store manager they don't budget enough hours for stores.  They expect store managers to pick up the slack as they are the only salaried positions.
good,"Gamestop is a fun environment, where you get to meet a lot of new people and talk about common gaming interests. Co-workers are like family. "
good,"Typical day at work would consist of restocking game title boxes on shelves and help customers pick and choose games for purchase"
good,Gamestop offre sempre nuove sfide e possibilità e l'occasione di lavorare in un clima giovane e a contatto con persone sempre nuove
good,"I wish i couldof worked there longer but it was so slow i never got hours and i really liked being there, it was a fun work environment and a pleasure to work at with like minded people"
good,"The day to day of the job was a customer service focused work. We would talk about games and collectibles to our customers and help guide their purchases. There was also the aspects of keeping the business running opening and closing tills, counting money, keeping inventory correct, taking incoming shipments, making sales plans and keep other employees on task. I learned how to work in a fast pace work environment that has new challenges everyday, working with the general public, especially during the holidays. The workplace culture is overall pretty good, there were some blemishes with higher management but nothing out of the ordinary for a corporate run business. The most enjoyable part of the job was bringing joy to my customers being able to provide them with the information they were looking for, and the products they wanted."
good,"Working at Game Stop is a lot of fun, even if it doesn't pay a livable wage. I haven't had a retail job before, and signing on as a seasonal employee over the Holidays gave me a crash course in how day-to-day operations work in a store. My manager has been phenomenal, and I've been welcomed into the store crew with open arms. My schedule has fewer hours than I would like, but whenever I do work there is always a new thing to be learned, or some form of training to be had. The hardest part of working here is definitely, absolutely, 100% the fact that it pays minimum wage, and only offers less than ten hours per week, on average, for Guest Advisers. It's cool to see all the different kinds of people that come through the store on a regular basis, and getting to learn about so much fun nerd stuff is fantastic. I just wish I got paid more than minimum wage for the more than minimum wage effort I put into the job."
good,"A day usual entails the use of basic customer service such as: greeting guests as they arrive to your store, interact with guest, inquire about their reasons for visiting, make recommendations, explain active sales, etc. Customer service and interaction is always top priority. If you are able to, between interactions with the customers, complete the tasks dictated to you for the day. Tasks range from cleaning/fixing up the store to alphabetizing the products both on the sales floor and behind the counter to making sure sale prices on products are accurate. The management team is pretty much a store-by-store experience. No two management teams are the same. Meaning, one management team may focus more on customer service in one store, while another may focus more on store tasks or organization, or you may find a management team that has different types of managers that specialize in their own field. Such as a store manager being better focused on customer service while an assistant manager is better working on tasks. I personally believe the hardest part of this job, as well as every sales job, is balancing what you are able to do for a customer that is not outside of the company's established policies. Many policies of which make sense, however there is always a few that seem ridiculous. The best part about the job is that, more often than not, you come across a lot of people that may be similar minded to yourself, both customer-wise and staff-wise. Making the job feel more like ""hanging out"" versus a ""long day's work."" The most important thing I think I have learned from this"
good,"You MUST be able to produce numbers if you want hours if you are in an entry position. If you try your best you will not struggle with getting hours. Unfortunately, as in all retail, customers and corporate can be difficult to deal with."
good,"Overall the people there are nice, coworkers are great. Boss man is a great guy. The hardest part of the job, personally was trying to get great big sales. The management was good, the most enjoyable part of the job, is working around something I love."
good,"It was a seasonal/temporary job but it was a great experience to have and it was nice to work for a good company that took care of it's employees. The pay was a bit low for the knowledge you have to have to work there, but I like that it was more than stocking and selling merchandise."
good,The job is fun so long as you and your coworkers get along. You'll get a customer every now and then who wants to make your life hard but that's just retail culture.
good,"If you’re willing to accept the low hours this is a wonderful place to work! The only downside is the low hours and the some late nights during holiday season, but it is extremely enjoyable."
good,"Gamestop may get a lot of negative thoughts and comments, but the people there really care about each other and the work environment has been the best I've worked in to date."
good,Loved working here during college. Management is pretty chill but customers can sometimes be really rude or gross. Be prepared to learn how to sell Pro cards because that is your main goal.
good,"If you like to fix and take things apart this is the job for you. Management is okay, certain supervisors will actually listen to you and some wont. Everyone is a team player, they'll turn into your second family."
good,"I love the atmosphere an workplace environment, but their employees just dont get the pay and benefits they deserve. The people you work with value you, but the company does not."
good,"Everyday was fun. Sometimes it could get a little down due to customers or work you had to do from the day before, but all in all I had a wonderful experience. You get to meet people just like you and even get your own set of customers coming to the store just for you!"
good,"I mainly stayed on register ringing up customers and making sales. I would greet each client, inquired them of their needs and when not on register I’d be on the floor assisting customers with any questions regarding our products, policies, release dates etc. with our company tablet at hand. My duties mainly involved assisting customers with their needs, restocking items and making sure the store appeared as clean, presentable and up to date as possible."
good,"A typical day at work for me was interesting, different everyday. I defiantly learned to be on my toes and how to multi-task. You need to be able to answer the phones and be clear in your pronunciation. The most enjoyable part for me was the family aspect and feeling of the collaboration with those around me."
good,"I absolutely love this job. Though it does have its downs (which is, quite often) I still enjoy it. The environment is fun, especially under the right manager. I'd recommend this job, but note that it does get annoying. Constantly having to sell pro cards and warranties aren't fun, especially when people quickly cut you off before you finish explaining. I enjoy the people I work with, but I wouldn't wish to advance to anything more than just a cashier."
good,I personally enjoyed almost all aspects of the role of an SGA. That being said one of the major downsides to the job is the numbers they ask you have to keep up are sometimes extremely hard to maintain.
good,"day to day I would go in and open the store and on the days when i would open i would be responsible for taking the deposit to the bank, all morning counts, inventory, price changes. "
good,"A typical day at work at gamestop was slow and entertaining, i learned a lot from the employees and computer based training like better customer service, and better charisma, the management was really good and they really take the time to know their employees and help them out when they can, the hardest part of the job was nothing, and the most enjoyable part was helping the customers and talking with the employees."
good,"I have only worked here, currently, for a short time. I can say that working here seems to always be a highlight of my day. My co-workers are friendly, the work area is clean and the management is fair. The hardest part of the job is learning how to come out of the initial shell and being open with he customers."
good,In questo ambiente lavorativo ho notato molta collaborazione tra i dipendenti ma poca comprensione da parte dell'area manager.
good,Worked this job while I was in college and I was lucky enough to work with people who understood my priorities. But that was when I was working there. I heard things have changed
good,"È un azienda che offre possibilità di crescita limitate avendo una struttura piramidale"
good,Gamestop was the best first job I could ever ask for. It gave me the environment I needed to grow & made me more responsible. Due to Gamestop being a video game retailer I was introduce to various product I would have never come in contact with otherwise.
good,Game Stop was a great experience for me to gain knowledge on customer based sales. The retail environment was welcoming but it is a quite a lot to work with. They are constantly changing their plans on engaging with customers so its something new every month or so. Its quite the evolution of ideas and plans to emphasize on certain upcoming projects. Being a manager there is a HUGE responsibility. You have to make sure that you are constantly communicating everything you are doing to your manager or it will come and bite your behind in the long run. The most enjoyable part of the job are the employees who undergo the same things you do. The most difficult part of the job is how often they change the store layout (planogram). Nothing wrong with it changing but its expected to be done during store hours whilst helping guests out so it can be a tad difficult.
good,Most days was selling and stocking and closing of the store by my self. Closing and opening registers/ counting. I learned a lot of very valuable manager like skills. My manager was really good and worked hard to keep his team striving and looked towards me to help. Hardest part of it had to be the selling of memberships but i really loved the conversations i had through out the days of work with my team and our guest.
good,"I enjoyed working for Gamestop, but you quickly realize that you have to love what you do to stay, as other retail management positions pay more than what Gamestop is willing to offer. Once you make it to store manager, that is where most people top out at, unfortunately. If you are a gamer, or an extrovert, you will enjoy the job, but pay will always be something that will gnaw at you."
good,Can't say too much about the company itself because there's so much to it. EVERY location is different and people that work there define the store. I personally happened to always work with a a great team and could never complain about much. I've heard from customers that other locations are horrible at times but my own store always helps people out as much as we can.
good,"Depending on where you can work it will be either hectic, or slow. The people who work there are generally easy to get along with, so working doesn't feel like work. Management can be good or bad depending on the store, but the upper levels of management are good at their jobs. The most difficult part of the job would be dealing with the odd angry customer. The best part of the job would be getting to talk about games all day."
good,Gamestop can be fun depending on your customers. But management drives you to the ground with unrealistic goals and expectation and constant meetings.
good,"GameStop was a great place to work as a seasonal sales associate. My coworkers at the time are friends I'm still in touch with today. The manager was great at explaining what needed to be done and how best to do it. The hardest part of the job would have to be coming in to work during a midnight release, but those were still fun and rewarding experiences."
good,Azienda efficiente scrupplosa giovanile stimolante e sicuramente intraprendente
good,As I got older I didn’t have a much fun with it.  I grew out of it. I did have a lot of fun and again worked hard. Learned a lot about business. Moved to other stores at least once a year.
good,"Basic sales experience, standing long periods of time and keeping the workplace clean and organized. It was in the mall so food was in walking distance."
good,I enjoyed this job mainly because of the kid in me and because I had young children at the time. I spoke to the customers about all of the different games. I learned about different systems and game play. I read also able to sample games for my children to play. I had fun with the excited children and adults purchasing games.
good,I loved working here but I was moving away and I needed more money. Minimum wage isn't enough when you have bills. The hours weren't great either. The management was the best I have ever seen and the customers and employees were phenomenal. The 15% off games was nice too. :)
good,This was a great job if you are a college student and love games. It was not however a good career option. Managers worked 60 hr weeks were overworked and tired. Forceful on the sales of cards and magazines that customers usually do not want.
good,"Being a gamer myself, I thought working at Gamestop would be the coolest thing ever! It was for a bit, but then after a while, the company focus you see steers away from customers to making profits. They want you to upsell, upsell, upsell, and that was just not my personality."
good,"overall very nice place to work. very understanding and helpful when it came to me having to focus on class. never treated me poorly, all the staff are great, even made some friends. big into video games so work was great."
good,"It was always fun working with the staff and everyone became like family. There is a lot of dirty laundry deep down hidden within the roots, but still a wonderful job to work at."
good,"Its a fun place if you like games and pop culture. No ill feelings or competition, just fun times had by good people and no issues with any customers unless it involves damage to equipment or something of that nature."
good,"I learned more about gaming systems & stocking experience"
good,"Great for a first job but I wouldnt stay there for a career. It seems like there is a limit to how much they are willing to pay employees, even ones that have been there a while. A manager shouldnt need a 2nd job just to get by."
good,"As much as I loved the idea of working in a video games store, I would have to remember that it was still retail. Although I loved the environment, my colleagues, and the customers, the company format had changed to much for me to stay much longer. Gamestop is a great first job to learn the basics of being responsible, tolerant, and learn to be a good worker, but it it isn't a career in my eyes."
good,"It was never hectic, for those into video games and the culture it a quite fun place to work. never a shortage of people to talk to. Huge learning experience as far as customer service goes, how to talk and remembering the sales/promotions."
good,"I did enjoy working in gamestop. The work was not difficult, and the environment was relaxed. However the competition between staff sometimes brought tension into the workplace. There was not many staff-benefits such as discounts etc."
good,The main problem I had with working here was that they didn't really take the time to properly train. This was my first job and I didn't have experience on working. I had to ask a lot of questions and felt that the manager was getting fed up with my questions. Instead of showing me how to do something he would do it for me. The other managers took had more patience and I felt were more understanding in the fact that it was my first job.
good,"My time at Gamestop was quite enjoyable, although stressful at some points. However, the overall experience was a fantastic time and I would recommend working at any of their locations."
good,Gamestop is a great place to work for however it is really hard to get higher then a store manager position. It's limited growth for area or district leaders.
good,it's a great place to work if you want to get some experience in sales as well as if you like video games. management can be unfair to employees and employees are underpaid and without commission despite the fact its a sales job.
good,"My management team was really enjoyable, I enjoyed my day-to-day job, the dress code was absolutely perfect for me (casual/business casual), and they encouraged product testing.  I loved the game check-out program that was available to employees, and overall, I'd return to the company if given the opportunity to manage a store again."
good,"Depending on the days, the work flow can go from a fast-paced and keep you on your toes to almost at a snail's pace with nothing to do because everything is done and the store is clean."
good,Working at Game Stop takes a lot of work. Customer interaction is of great importance to the company. Giving customers the best experience with friendly service in which they are offered all the current promotions and upcoming titles is expected. It is hard because as employees we are expected to meet certain goals within our sales.
good,"This workplace does offer a relatively stable work environment, but the Christmas season is demanding.  I wish there were more opportunities to advance and move beyond just 25 hrs/week."
good,While some of the managers are phenomenal people and great at their job. The higher up managers just had no care for the lower employees and had no passion for the business. I have no respect for someone who only cares about the numbers of what they are selling and not just what they are selling. So at a store level I think Gamestop is a good job for a teenager or a single young adult that is in school. As far as advancement goes I think its not for someone who likes gaming as a hobby.
good,Frequent management changes with the ability to bring in and fire any number of employees left a feeling of a target constantly on your back whether or not you would be kept around or not. Not having a constant set of people to work with left it hard to really mesh well.
good,"It has been many years since I have worked with this business. My experience was awesome until the business merged with EB Games. 50% turnover of SM was normal, not very good for growth & advancement opportunities."
good,"If you are a gamer, it's a great place to work for the discount and the relaxed atmosphere.  You are expected to do a great sales job without the benefit of compensation above minimum wage."
good,The job was great and my coworkers were great to work with but the lack of hours and the bi weekly pay wasn`t enough. Everyday tasks were cleaning the back counter and assisting customers.
good,"If you love gaming and pop culture this is the place for you. Its a great starting job or second job. The only drawback I ever really noticed was that each store leader does things differently so if you go from one store to another, it will take a little bit to adjust how you work."
good,it was very fast paces and you always had to be on your A game. they will be sometimes you will have customers none stop for hours and no chance to take a break.
good,Very easy place to work. If you're entry level this is perfect for you. You learn basic stuff but it is not hard to do. And you get discounts on the new games.
good,Gamestop is a good place to work as the managers and staff are really welcoming. The salary isnt the best but its a fair amount of money for the work you do. Christmas is a nightmare tho. You come across your fair share of rude customers too
good,"The job was decent when they would let us perform our jobs, however management would often set unrealistic goals with heavy punishments.  Day to day work would be a non stop grind to try to wring every penny from customers just to try to meet goals."
good,"I didn't get enough hours to live on at that particular location, otherwise it was great, had fun. Learned a lot about videogames and electronics in general."
good,"On any typical day I would either be out on the floor helping customers find what they are looking for or something to interest them, or I would be behind the counter organizing and putting up games. It was a great place to work for me, I just wished that they could have worked with my school schedule more."
good,"Very fun and awesome environment, but you get paid very little and there are little to no hours were given. We didnt get paid time and a half on a holiday, but if you were a senior GA you would. It's extremely unfair."
good,"The typical day at Gamestop was very relaxed but had its moments of unrelenting business. Especially around the holidays, Gamestop was a hub of customers. I've learned more about the system of how there's a ""circle of life"" in businesses. There's a very fine line of cogs that only work when they all mesh together, and I have a greater understanding of that now, since it applies to all businesses. The management was very relaxed but stern when they had to be. The workplace culture was very dynamic as there were people who I never, from an outward perspective would've guessed that they enjoy the same things we did, my coworkers and I. The hardest part had to be that you were required to be a super fast learner. The most enjoyable part had to be that I was around people with so many of the same interests as myself."
good,While gamestop was an enjoyable place to work it was still retail which can be demeaning. I enjoyed the people I worked with and most of my customers.
good,"Great job, although there was not many hours available for new employees as well as minimum wage pay. I was a seasonal employee who was asked to stay on."
good,"Great place to work if you have the right staff in place.  Very competitive and ability to sell is a must.  Moving up from entry GA position to store manager is possible but takes time, desire and consistency. Must be a people person and know about the products you are selling. Pressure will be on certain times of the year to perform and you must be able to adapt to changing environment as the business model is shifting due to digital downloads.  I suggest this as a first job or for anyone who has previous retail and/or management experience and is looking to bring their talents to a new company."
good,"Gamestop was very flexible with hours as well as great co-workers. Gained a lot of knowledge about gaming. However, it became stressful once the selling culture became competitive. There were 4 different types of profit and employees had to gain at least 2 by the end of the week which added stress. Also management was a mess and to many products were needed to be put away with little room."
good,If you love video games AND don't mind working for a corporate company and following rules and making sales then this is the ideal place. The discount should be a bit better but overall a good place to work.
good,"Worked here 1 year, 7 months and while I had my gripes here and there, I don't regret working. Hours could fluctuate annoyingly and sometimes with little warning, but mostly enjoed my time here."
good,I love the job and the people i work with. Upper management however is too competitive and has unrealistic expectations on daily goals. Great discount program if your a gamer.
good,"The environment is fun fast pace and warming if you are with the right crew."
good,GameStop is a very laid back slow paced environment.  This is also why they do not hire people to often because of the lack of business.  GameStop is mostly only busy on holidays or when there is a sale going on.
good,"as a teenager working it was a fun environment but also stressful, had to leave due to school. but as a part time job it was not a bad gig. if it paid more, I would think about going back."
good,A good place to learn but never stay for long. Easy job to do if you know what youre doing. Depending on who your manager is will be how you are taught it can be difficult but if you can thrive there you can thrive anywhere.
good,"Working with associates, and interacting with different guests everyday was a blast. I learned a lot concerning handling guests needs needs and salesmanship. Culture can be great if you have the right team in place with great attitudes. Hardest part of the job would be developing like minded associates, and figuring out different ways to exceed sales and profit plan each day. Most enjoyable would be interacting with guests that shop everyday."
good,A typical day was pretty easygoing. The work was not very demanding and very rarely required any heavy lifting. I learned how to help customers and how to deescalate upset customers.
good,This job was perfect for my time off of college. It was a relaxed job position but we still had to meet weekly/monthly goals set by the store manager. This jobs focused on customer service greatly.
good,"I was hired working 4 hours a week. By working hard and being dependable, I was given many more hours quickly. The company is great and rewards hard work. The pay is less than desirable."
good,"Helping customers"
good,"While employed with Gamestop, i had a lot of experiences that helped me become who I am today. This job gave me more responsibilities than i had received before, and made me feel productive on a daily basis."
good,"Is a fun place to work if you have a passion for gaming. Get to talk about games and help people find the right games that fit them."
good,"Gamestop was my first job that I was excited to go to. The co-workers that I was competing against weren't mean or rude towards new employees. They were open to new people and made sure we felt welcomed. The managers made sure we were happy with hours and also each other. The balancing of hours was hard, but I was overall satisfied with about 25 a week. The pay was low only 8.25 an hour, but even though it was so low. I would still work there, because I loved going there."
good,"Average day consists of assisting customers, organizing game shelves alpha-numerically, and cleaning whenever possible. Non-standard days were those of midnight release events, entailing preparation of the new games to be issued, helping customers finish paying off their pre-orders, and eventually calling groups to issue the games. Very relaxed but professional environment makes it easy to get the job done even on busy days. Hardest part is getting a permanent job since most positions are temporary part-time."
good,"Work schedule was fairly flexible and easy to work with, management was great to work with and coworkers were very easy to get a long with.  The workplace was very organized as well."
good,"I absolutely loved the atmosphere in Gamestop, it's an incredibly fun job in which you're selling an entertainment product, therefore doing ""research"" for work is perfectly acceptable while on the clock.  However, this is not a great career path as they generally treat their employees with little to no regard since the next person is easily available to hire."
good,Gamestop is a fun environment but the quota system is irritating to say the least. As a bottom rung employee it is your job to end the day with good pre-order and card subscription numbers. That is generally all management cares about aside from the store looking good and the shelved are alphabetized. The environment is quite nice if youre into video games however as a low level employee moving up is very difficult as you get few hours to even prove yourelf.
good,It was a fun job I was basically just keep stock of the game and helping customers whatever they needed. A paid well in the hours weren't that bad. My management also listened to what you had to say and offered any help they could give.
good,"Working for Game Stop has been an enjoyable, and fun experience."
good,"Working at Gamestop can sometimes be a challenge. There can be rude customers,sudden rushes and waves of work, surprise deliveries that take a day or two to complete, etc. The benefits aren't all that great if you're a part-time worker; you get a discount on games and sometimes free stuff if you complete certain tasks on the computer, but that is about it. Full time workers get more benefits, some of which I believe should be for all workers and not just one category. The co-workers can be great, almost like a second family. My particular store is really laid back, and everyone cares about one another."
good,"my typical day at work is very repetitive it involves answering phones about various topics, working a cash register, as well as ordering various products on gamestops personal website for customers. On top of that because of my position I has deal with a lot of money for the store, as well as inventory intake."
good,Starting out it's great for people who just want part time.  We never have enough hours to give out and the pay is super low and no overtime. Couldn't work more hours if you wanted to. Definitely not for someone trying to support a family.
good,"I loved working at gamestop,it was so fun, had great perks, and i loved the people and customers. My biggest complaint is management and the companies unrealistic expectations. You will get in trouble and written up for having low sales numbers which is understandable but sometimes customers don't want what we need which makes it difficult. In my store my DM was always threatening to fire you. overall it's a fun place to work but stressful from a management position."
good,"Each day was a breeze."
good,Worked in various districts and up until recently I have never wanted to part ways with the company. Nothing against the company other than the lousy goals that were at times unattainable. It is a great company to work for if you have a great team and great leaders. Current leadership in one particular district needs an overhaul or more good people will leave. Great for game enthusiast and those wanting to gain sales skills. My team makes me enjoy coming in.
good,"This was a fun job but most of your paycheck goes towards products you sell.  The holidays can be crazy because you are always understaffed; however, that means more hours for those who want them."
good,Not a bad job if you can get to at least shift lead. Basic entry level hours are very minimal. Oppurtunities for advancement are dependent on your district manager.
good,"With Gamestop being one of the nations number one retailer in video game electronics and expertise, you know what you get going into this job. Were held to a higher standard to know as much as we can to help our guests with whatever we can all the time. Unfortunately, since it is such a large company, with some very small stores, your room for growth and advancement isn't always available. Typically you'll see store managers and assistant managers in their position for 5+ years and that limits the amount of advancement you can make since there's not normally open positions. Your training is entirely dependent upon your leadership staff. Some stores have better leaders than others and you will undoubtedly have been chance of learning and growing with someone who enjoys their job and what they're doing. You just have to get lucky with your store sometimes. It's a great place overall with some minor issues sprinkled in."
good,"My first Gamestop position was a result of knowing a girl I went to school with that worked at the local store in the mall. Both of my temporary rehires lasted very briefly, i dont think i reached 40 hours total both times. In short: its a fun christmas job but do NOT expect any lifetime careers here. The company recruits from outside sources, rarely promoting internals. cheers."
good,The Game stop culture is sales driven. Customer service and knowledge of product is needed more then anything. Sales goals and pre order goals directly relate to how much your will work.
good,Job was seasonal and part time so not much time was spent in the workplace. Manager respected each employee and gave fair jobs to each employee. only issue was pay and work time.
good,"Everyone who wants to work at GamStop initially is looking forward to selling, talking about, and playing games. The company is very tough on getting reserves, membership cards, warranties, etc. It's more of a job as a salesman than anything else."
good,I mean its alright for a tiny side job and to work during highschool or college and they do work around your schedule. The discount and making customers happy is whats great about the job.
good,"Typical days varied as shift was assigned. I learned how to handle money, how to experience customers, and some marketing techniques.  The work place culture came very easily to me here. It was basically know about your products that you are selling and this was also the most enjoyable part. Hardest parts was that the hours varied. But for me I managed."
good,I very much enjoyed my job due to working in a gaming culture and enjoying games myself.  Did not enjoy Corporate decisions but still a great starting job.
good,"Visita a 2 punti vendita al giorno di media, appreso a sopportare e supportare la velocità al cambiamento, il saper approfittare delle occasioni, molti metodi di vendita e gestione dello stress."
good,A typical day was customer service oriented. Hardest part of job was meeting reservation goals that were at times unrealistic.  Fun place to work as you talked about video games all day.
good,"It was an enjoyable experience. I loved helping customers and seeing them leave with smiles on their faces every day. The employees were always nice to get along with, and customers were happy to see me."
good,"I enjoyed the work place and the environment. The customers were fun to talk to and learn the difference types of people. I could work over the phone or on the floor, or behind the desk. Management was good they wanted us to push a lot on to the customers to have the buy more products. The hardest part of the job was triing to get more hours for the job, as funny as that seems. The thing i enjoyed the most about that work place is the people I got to talk to and also the employees"
good,"The store was usually pretty relaxed, the workers were pretty good and the management was good. Customers were typically polite. Only downside was super long hours around holidays and A LOT of traffic increase and the occasional rude customer. (Closed Thanksgiving and Christmas)"
good,"GameStop stores are normally staffed with 4 people in management and about 2 other associates most would consider cashiers. As a Store Leader/Manager I have learned to be a loss prevention manager, HR manager, payroll coordinator, teach support, and much more. Over the past 3 years I have done that on a boarder scale as a Store Manager Mentor. I assist my District Manager oversee 12 stores. I would not have gotten to this point in my career if not for the district managers I have had over the years. All of them have seen my potential and encouraged me to branch out. Never have they limited me on what I want to do. Currently, the most hardest part of my job is knowing that I will continue to grow, but the company will not have positions available for associates with my skills."
good,"GameStop is a company that has a great working environment, but like all jobs, it has it good and bad days. One of the good thinks about GameStop is that you get to use and refine your ability to communicate in a professional manner. You also get to learn how to work in a team manner and on top of that you also get to learn more of the business side of the gaming world by seeing what sales and what does not this with this you can grasp what type of things people like to play."
good,"Everyday is an new adventure, filled with excitement and new task and new learning curves and adaptation. The environment is very relaxing and friendly."
good,"Gamestop as a company can be very demanding.  It is hard to balance work and life balance due to the demands of the position of a store manager, especially when a manager is running two stores.  Benefits are decent, health insurance, 401k, life insurance, even car insurance.  Downfall to benefits:  Health insurance is very expensive if decided to get it through the company especially if you have a family.  Job security was good, I was with the company for 13 years.  Hard to advance if not impossible once you hit store manager level.  Culture is pretty good on the most part.  Great team and usually work for a great boss.  Conference every year where you travel and free video games while attending conference.  "
good,I really enjoyed this job with the culture and everything like that but its pay leaves something to be desired. But moving up in this company is pretty good granted youre willing to relocate.
good,"This job is great with showing how well you are doing with sales and what you need to work on, but in alot of cases except mine you were disciplined if you didn't meet the sales goal regardless of your individual number."
good,"Overall, I had a good experience at GameStop. The atmosphere that my Store Leader set was a very welcoming and exciting one. Since it is retail, you will have difficult people, but it's nothing that can't be handled. Day to day there is opening procedures, incoming shipments of product, as well as keeping guests a priority. One of the biggest things I learned from GamStop, is learning to manage my time. Since you never know when someone will walk into your store, keeping on top of all of your responsibilities is very important. I did have some issues with a co-worker, but that was because of his attitude and characteristics. Once you befriended all of your associates, it feels like a family, which is what I love so much about this job. As far as difficulty goes, this job is fairly easy. Again, you need to manage your time well along with keeping an open mindset to always be learning more from your associates."
good,"Regardless of the social perception of Gamestop, the company was fantastic to work for. One of the only companies that really did value it's employees (at the full time level). The had a competitive salary, bonus potential, and room for advancement if you're willing to relocate. "
good,Constant attention to customers and sometimes there's a rush. Constantly keeping tidy and organized. Workplace respectable environment co-worker wise. The toughest part of the job is keeping up with the newest and trending upcoming game feature bonuses. The most enjoyable part is there is always a challenge in this environment especially trying to give our services to customers.
good,"I was a store manager.  I had a great team to manage.  I was in charge of payroll, all hiring and discipline, scheduling and more.  I dealt with customers on a regular basis, and in between would accomplish tasks.  The weeks could have long hours, 50+ a week especially during holidays. I loved talking with guests and my team, and it made the long days worth it."
good,"Really fun environment and enjoyable if you love playing video games. The pay sucks but the company is great and worth going to work for. Advancement is good, as long as you work hard and have fun doing it."
good,"Its the world of gaming what do you expect? your going to have your regulars, the families, the crazy children, but best of all is the cos-players & other basement dwellers who rarely never leave their house unless a new game releases, but that's okay because they probably make a good living off of twitch streams & youtube videos!. Gamestop is actually a great place to work they accommodate to any and most lifestyles (talking to you body builders) & like I said very fun environment the people I have encountered were all great! only downside is that it seems to be a pain to move up in the company seeing as once people get in they tend to stay in that position for awhile. you basically have to be transferred because of a move to a GS thats looking for the next position to hired in. Great place though!"
good,"A typical work day involves opening and closing the store, balances the cash register, interacting with customers and learning about new games. The hardest part of the job would be handling customer complaints."
good,"I've learned a lot there and made some really great friendships. It can be stressful sometimes, but what job isn't? You get a discount, check out games for free, and have lots of little perks."
good,"Generally speaking with customers to find their needs and ""up-sell"" every transaction. I learned many different perspectives of managing since I was in a management position as a key holder. The discount and renting free games was a plus,"
good,"a typical day requires being on time, being attentive and prepared. The team was friendly and helpful when it came to assisting the new workers."
good,GameStop is a good job for gamers who want to be around what they love video games of course. unfortunately the work load doesn't meet the compensation. You will have to do a lot of work but other than that you'll enjoy being able to goof and talk about video games. A certain amount of professionalism is required.
good,"Greeting customers, cashier, answering questions about up coming releases, answering questions about consoles as well as giving our personal opinions and experiences."
good,Great starter management positions with opportunities for growth. Difficult payroll to operations balancing. Fun environment and great customer base. Excellent and affordable medical and dental benefits
good,"It is your standard retail job, but you do get discounts and employee promotions, and get to rent games. If you have the right team it can be fun, and store managers get to go to Vegas once a year."
good,The typical day at Gamestop is making sure that each Guest has a great experience when they come into your store and you do the best you can to get them what they need.
good,My typical day at work begins with a short meeting where issues are resolved by management and work areas are assigned. Every day I learn more about possible internal failures on systems and peripherals. The management tends to have communication issues however they are quick to address most concerns that arise given the lack of communication between themselves. My co-workers are very helpful and we work as a team to solve issues and progress as a group The hardest part of my job is the daily production requirements given random interruptions by management and other employees while troubleshooting and testing. I enjoy being challenged to meet production goals regardless of interruptions.
good,"Gamestop is a best plac to work, great people,"
good,"The company's hey day has long passed and is no longer the go to gaming store; but the execs haven,t caught on and expect the associates to somehow make the same numbers with less tools and support."
good,"GameStop is a great place to work in, if you enjoy gaming and communicating with customers about games then its the job for you. The only thing that is on the downside is the hours and they don't work with your schedule."
good,"Very relaxed place to work, most employees are very friendly and fun to work with. Costumers are usually people who play video games on a pretty frequent occasion so they come in knowing what they want or are looking for, or little kids with their parents who you help give suggestions on stuff to play and just let them look around. If you are part time you get scheduled maybe one to three times a week if you are lucky and the shifts are relatively short."
good,"Working at GameStop seasonaly gave me more of an insight to the gaming world. I was able to learn more about what was in demand with customers and what customers tended to prefer. I was also able to speak one on one with a few of the reps from companies such as MicroSoft (Xbox 360/Xbox One), Sony(Playstation 3/Playstation 4), etc. "
good,"Get to know customers daily and talk with returning customers, carry on conversations with them and make new and regular customers feel at home and welcome in the store.  Learned a lot about people and how to help them find what works for them using probing questions.  Management is great at the store level, from the district level and up they seem to show no concern for employees, payroll is kept to a minimum and sometimes management work alone for most of their shift regardless of how busy the store is, reprimands are handed out if payroll doesn't meet their expectations, and overtime is a huge no-no, you will be fired if you go over 40 hours per week.  Co workers are great, like a big family we come together when we need to and help out someone when they need it.  Hardest part is the holiday season, it can get very busy and without enough hours it can be overwhelming.  Best part of the job is seeing a customers face light up when you are able to help them with an issue and make their money go farther than they thought, building that kind of relationship to know that we care about them and will go that extra mile without being asked is what we do."
good,"My typical day was different than most. I was game adviser who was kept on the floor 95% of the time. My job was pretty fun because I was able to just talk to people about games and make sales. Management at my store was like flipping a coin. One second they are the coolest boss ever, the next you are considering turning in your two weeks notice. My co-workers were also like coins, some were the coolest people you could ever meet, and just like any job there were some who you hated  to see on the same shift as you."
good,great time and place to work if you have a good staff and everyone gets along the work is pretty simple organizing games on shelves or even draws and both stay alphabetized shipment can be tedious based of no real organization also hours are never enough or consistent
good,"Great place to work, due to the staff. Very busy, especially around the Christmas season. In house training was provided on all machinery, management are great, but I think it's time for me to move on."
good,"sono stato store manager per questa azienda e partendo dal gradino piu' basso ho avuto la possibilita' di farmi notare e arrivare alla gestione completa del punto vendita. come store manager ho fatto due nuove aperture i centri commerciali , seguendo gli arrivi della merce, la sistemazione , i colloqui e le assunzioni del personale. Ho fatto crescere per meritocrazia i miei colleghi facendoli diventare a loro volta store manager."
good,"Only worked a day there so far as a seasonal worker but I work again Friday and I love it! I can't wait to work again, it's gonna be busy during the holidays!"
good,I had great employees and fun customers to apply my skills with. A typical work day was very busy between tasks and customer service. Many days went very fast because of the amount of work to be done.
good,"As a kid, Gamestop was always a dream job to work. I loved video games growing up, so why not work at a place where you can talk about them all day. My employment was unfortunately only seasonal help, and they were not able to keep me employed beyond that. The job was fun, the customers were great to engage with, and the manager was fantastic."
good,Was an interesting experience the managers where very understanding and nice and worked around my school scheduled. Always fun nice conversations with the customer with the occasional weird customer. Some of the co worker who've been working there for years where a little weird. defiantly an interesting experience learned a lot about customer service with them.
good,"For a retail job, this was a great work experience that I highly enjoyed doing.  I am an avid gamer, so I thoroughly enjoyed talking with customers about the product we were selling.  For the most part, the job was fairly laid back, unless it was the holiday season in which things could get pretty hectic and chaotic.  What really made the job enjoyable was the excellent staff that I worked with.  They were very fun and caring people who I still am friends with to this day.  "
good,"Aprivo il negozio, accendevo computer e registratore di cassa, controllavo la liquidità giornaliera, sistemavo gli scaffali al pubblico e il magazzino sottostante, servivo al pubblico. Colleghi pazienti e disponibili. La parte più difficile del lavoro era ricordare tutte le promozioni e le varie schede con omaggi e sconti abbonati, la parte più piacevole era consigliare i prodotti in base alle esigenze del cliente."
good,"I love working at Gamestop. My co-workers are awesome and our manager is one of the best. The company is very corporate and if you're looking to move up into the corporate environment, it might not be easy. Great for part timers though who may also be going to school."
good,A typical day at work would be to keep the store organized and presentable. Being able to quickly deal with the occasional rush of customers was extremely important. Closing the store for the day meant cleaning from front to back and making sure all locks were in place.
good,The most important thing I got from working at GameStop are the people I worked with and the relationships I've built over the year and  half of working there.
good,"Great Place to work as we sold fun."
good,"My daily regiment was to maintain sales, carry on customer care, delegate work to my co-workers while maintaining a tidy work place and an upkeep on store inventory."
good,Company does not care for its employee's and there is not much room to move up unless you prove can you have an extensive knowledge of various video game genre's and systems. Under the right circumstances the people can be okay to work with.
good,"The job itself was good, fast paced, and I had learned a lot on ow to deal with customers and to get product fast. Many of the coworkers are great people to work with, and other store managers at other stores are great people, but the manager I had wasn't the best person to work with, and was part of the reason I had left the job."
good,This was actually a great job for my early 20's. Customers were game enthusiast if you're into that. Customer retention is high so you make new friends and see familiar faces. Great overall work environment.
good,"A typical day at work included assisting customers and promoting specific items and sales, also included staging and maintaining displays."
good,At work I am very productive and fast learning. I like challenges and having to solve problems within the job that I receive. I don't find much hard win a work place because my determination to be better in every aspect keeps my mind at ease.
good,"Typical retail job, if you've done one, you've done them all. Just like any retailer, you will have a fair share of angry customers, and very likable customers. Your overall satisfaction with working at GameStop depends on your love for video games, and the co-workers you work with."
good,"I love doing what I do, and working with the people I work with, but the amount that I get paid and the hours I work do not compensate what we do and how we do it."
good,Everything at the job was tailored to make a teenage gamer feel at home though the work environment I could not imagine working in as an adult nor do I believe the company offers strong enough advancements to make the position worth keeping for an extended period of time.
good,"Each day at work was like a day with friends. It was never a struggle to sell anything, because the customers just wanted our opinion or to share theirs about a particular game or system. Each employee was a gamer so this knowledge came easily. We all played games when not at work so it became more like gathering more and better information that we could tun around and use to assist our customers."
good,As management we had to do quite a bit. Every morning we would get shipments and generally we didn't have the hours to have someone in the morning so we would do shipment by ourselves while still helping customers. Some days this wasn't so bad while others it was. We did random item counts every morning and also would make sure we had everything displayed for certain sections. The best part about the job at GameStop was the people I worked with. They made the day and job enjoyable.
good,"I loved my time at Gamestop what little of it I had. The reason I ended my time with Gamestop is because unless you are a manager you get 1 MAYBE 2 shifts a week which equals around 10 hours in total a week, it wasn't enough."
good,"A typical day at work is working with customers and satisfying their needs, stocking of merchandise, transactions and working as a team with other crew members to meet our daily missions. Learning more about various gaming systems and the broad selection of games to help customers find what they are looking for."
good,Not too much to do here but answer the phone and talk to the other co-workers. It wasn't a hard job but my supervisor wasn't that helpful when I needed it.
good,"An average day included ringing purchases, assisting customers and driving sales. All coworkers were exceptionally kind and helpful and every one of the 3 managers I worked with were helpful and understanding. Benefits were one of the better parts of the job (15 percent discount, 4 day game rental). The only downside is if you're the bottom of the totem pole, don't expect to see many hours come your way and assistance during the holidays to spend time with friends and family is very limited. Overall I had an enjoyable experience with my time there, but it definitely wasn't a career."
good,"Although it was a collection of long days and hard work it was still rewarding. I met a lot of great people along the way and was mentored to improve my abilities. It was an honor serving 50,000 employees and something I will always cherish."
good,"A typical day at GameStop is simply that. As a starting Game Advisor you only get to work one day a week (if you're lucky two days a week and on holidays more). You make enough money to fill the gasoline tank, but nothing really to start a savings account or make payments on bills or such. However despite these setbacks the experience is good for the soul and mind. I've learned how to approach many different customers of different personalities and create a sale and inform others of new or older products. My technical skills are more improved as well and allows me to get hands on with more technology. The management is good and my co-workers are excellent individuals. The hardest part of the job is being in the middle of a transaction and making a slight mistake (I take my own mistakes to heart and try my best to improve the next time). The most enjoyable part of my job is the great interactions with customers and making a great sale and improving my numbers."
good,"Backroom politics abound and drama from the upper field management to the store level, Gamestop is one of the more competitive places for a manager to work in. Hard to get into, easy to keep. Coworkers are amazing to be around, and day-to-day operations for keyholder level and above are a great framework for further opportunities of learning in a future field of work in retail. The hardest part of the job is living up to the unrealistic pressure upper field management gives to the store level with an idiotic pay grade for keyholder level and above. In summary; great entry level, but unless you're trying to move up from the store level, it's definitely not a job to keep."
good,A fun place to work with good people and a friendly environment.  Good job with steady work and great customer interactions. The hardest part of the job is the frequent price changes filing changes.
good,"-Balancing customers and operational tasks"
good,"Ambiente lavorativo stimolante ma molto intenso s stressante."
good,This a great place if you like to help people physically and to gain more knowledge about computers. You can also gain knowledge on knowing the equipment used for physical treatment.
good,I really didnt play games but I did learn about the business aspect of Gamestop. Fun place to work if you are a gamer
good,"A typical day at work for this company was quick but required patience as well. I learned that the best way to perform a task is to have patience and do it the right way. Even if i stumbled in the workplace, management caught my mistakes and i was able to learn from them for future reference. The hardest part of the job was learning to be patient while organizing the shelves. After a couple of days it actually became routine and I was able to stock the shelves flawlessly. My co-workers were very supportive and helpful. Without them I would've been lost."
good,Fun and friendly environment but low pay. Hard to make money once holiday season ends.
good,I loved my coworkers and my team. Being able to speak with customers and make them happy here was a great experience. There was a lot of systems in place to help customers leave happy and return as well as ways to control your business. All negatives came from upper management DM and higher. The DM was able to hire all of her friends when she was given the position and then did her day to day as she liked since she gave them free reign no one complained. Anyone in a high enough level that was able to make statements against her when then let go giving her a long length of time before she was eventually fired. Also the regional AP manager is given to much authority allowing him to belittle employees and make decisions based on how he feels rather than business needs. Without anyone checking on him or ever surveying his job he is able to hold the company back.
good,"GameStop is a fun environment, focusing on the sales and acquisition of games and the overall gaming industry.  The job consists of assisting customers with various questions and needs and ensuring to the best of ability that their needs are met.  This entails showing the customer the best deals currently available, demonstrating the use of the products we carry, and assisting with question and answer until we have a solid grasp of the customers' needs.  While the job is by no means a true career job at entry level, those willing to stick it out can find fast advancement and plenty to do within the company.  The store level consists of small teams that work in tandem with one another to stock, clean, and maintain the store's appearance while being readily able to assist any customers. The job affords many little perks, like the ability to check out various games to play, discounts on the games and accessories you purchase, and special GameStop only events. However, it also comes with a sense of exclusivity and limits one from doing much else due to the busy nature of the job.  Hours for part timers can be a bit of a premium as well, but can be remedied if GameStop is used as a secondary job or if you have the fortitude to ride it out in search of something more long term, like the management level."
good,The people are generally great and will do all they can to help you when in need.
good,"only part time as was in collage"
good,"6 hour shifts at a Video game retail fly very quickly. The paid was substantial and although I did part time, I was allowed a short 15 min break to go for a coffee half way through my shift. it was a very hard first job and required a a large knowledge of the products being sold. Not only did we have to sell it, we were required to help fix/repair as well as buy off customers. ensuring that there was no internal or external damage to the product. the most enjoyable part of the job was the actual selling the product, as i do enjoy a good game. customer service was also a important factor and was the first place i learnt to do this."
good,Corporate run and minimal hours. Managers tend to shift moods and change things unexpectedly.
good,"Come in and either hop on a register or start organizing the stock in the back or merchandise up front. Learned How to handle customers during busy holidays hours. "
good,"fixed at least 20 games systems per night"
good,Being a Game Stop employee takes a bit more then most people think. Yes my main just is to be there and talk about video games all day but there are a lot of customers who don't understand what they want or what a video game even is. Giving them a very good experience and seeing them come back looking for you is a great feeling and for me very rewarding. Game Stop got me out of my bubble and help me learn how to interact with strangers better. I work with a great team who always is on top of any extra training. I do currently work there right now but working one day a week doesn't pay bills and moving up in the company is extremely difficult.
good,My days basically included closing and opening the store. While making sure the store is up to par. Maintaining was key
good,"The employees were very kind."
good,Friendly customers and friendly as well as helpful staff make this a nice place to visit.
good,The day starts with the usual clock in and standing behind the counter waiting for customers to purchase or ask for assistance. I learned how to work cash register and attend to customers in need of service. Management was very fair and my co workers were also very helpful with my inexperience on certain jobs. The hardest part of the job was being on my feet for a long time but the best part was not having to do much.
good,"GameStop made it very well-known to me and my employees that we were cogs that could be easily replaced. This feeling of triviality made for a constant obstacle."
good,"Ever changing and evolving job experience. Every day was new and the company was always trying to expand its' consumer base. Customer interaction was always a top priority along with the daily duties of a store manager. Every situation was handled very corporate like and they made very few exceptions fro some situations. Overall they were a fun and exciting company, but at the higher levels they do not really care about their employees no matter how much you have done for them."
good,"Worked in multiple states for this company and each district I worked in had a different workplace environment. overall though, I would highly recommend this company."
good,"If you like video games, GameStop is the place to work.  Management there is great too!  Only downside is that even if you have a manager position, you won't be payed as well as comparable positions in other retail locations."
good,Gamestop was a good job for a while due to it worked with my school scheduling. The reason for me leaving was they wanted me to transfer to a whole different city and I had no transportation at the time. I open and closed the store. I dealt with all customer issues. I handled all the money and inventory. Multiple phone lines and marketing. I was the 3rd key manager there.
good,"It was usually slow but there was always something to do. I learned alot about gaming consuls, game types, why which games are more popular than others. My Manager wasn't there most of the time when I was working but mu co-workers were really nice when she wasn't there. The Hardest part of the job was honestly letting parents buy games for there kids that aren't meant for kids their age, but overall I enjoyed it I like video games so it was fun to talk about them with other people."
good,"Standard retail management position"
good,"Manager always joked around, get to talk about games all day to employees and customers, most enjoyable part was being able to check out games to play when you get off of work and bring that knowledge into work with you the next day"
good,"Ensuring customer satisfaction."
good,Love the environment and the coworkers. Pay rate for part timers could have been higher/more competitive. It was near perfect for what I needed while going to school.
good,"Sell new and used video game consoles, games and accessories."
good,"GameStop is a really fun place to work, but the pay is very low and unless you are in a Management position, you can't live on it if you have a family.  Great for a part time job though"
good,awesome place and good ppl surround you. you meet all kinds of ppl. you learn about new games coming out before its told to others and sometimes get to work at differnt stores which gives a perspective on how other places maintain the stores.
good,"The first thing I will do at GameStop is to enter the store and start organizing the store. I do this by picking up game titles to the shelves at alphabetical order in each video game section. I also manage the inventory load and clean up the store with basic cleaning tools. When a customer comes to the store I would always greet and welcome them to the store, I would soon then start to ask questions to the customer if they needed any support such as if they are looking for a video game title or if they need support for an accessory. Once the customer got the product he wanted I go to the POS computer to finalize the sale, I later then ask the customer about upcoming promotional sales."
good,"Fun job with amazing opportunity to advance. Overall, the people you work with are amazing and very hard workers."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of going into designated area, and wait for lead to give a meeting on what duties needed to be done that day or what/how we need to do the following goal. I was in the ""cage"" verifying that all iDevices (iphones) worked properly. The coworkers are all great and we all worked as a team to accomplish our quota. And the most enjoyable part was meeting new wonderful people there."
good,too many tasks assigned with not enough payroll hours and management are not well trained
good,"I worked here for three years and hardly ever had any problems. My fellow co-workers were friendly and the job environment was enjoyable. Holidays and certain days of the year were sometimes chaotic in terms of the customers and the displays around the store, but the registers and behind the counter were always in order. Management knew what it wanted and the day to day workings went by smoothly. The hardest part of the job was dealing with some (though few) irate customers. The most enjoyable part revolved around seeing how much enjoyment some people got out of the games."
good,It was a good first job. This is a great place to work when your young but not a place for anyone over 21 to work.
good,"This is a job that is not for everyone, it is long hours, on your feet all day, no set breaks, but you have to love it to do it, and I love it.  I have realized I am completely here for my customers' and my staff.  I have learned to develop strong interpersonal skills with customers.  By developing relationships with a customer the moment they walk in the door, asking probbing questions, making suggestions, I know I will make them happy with the purchase they make.  This is what makes them come back, and what I strive for.  I have developed a team that loves to come to work and perform."
good,"Great atmosphere, very humble, unique kind of company. Seems to not have a lot of room for advancement. At least in Portland Metro Area, you've devoted many years and many holidays to get to move up."
good,It's a nice feeling to be able to walk into a job and not immediately dread who you might or might not be working with that day. Everyone I've worked with though has been enjoyable and always makes time just pass by easier.
good,"A typical day at work would consist in achieving sale goals (reservations, memberships, and warranties).  Receiving merchandise, and making inventory counts.  I was also trained to maintain the store visual merchandise and set up visual marketing kits.  I was promoted to manager position and was in charge of store closings and openings.  As manager I needed to handle any situation in stores and manage my team to arrive sale goals."
good,"A typical day at work involves opening the store, cleaning and making sure the shelves have the video games in order. Checking the video games available to make sure that they are in stock and finally interacting with the customers either by phone or in person. I learned how to sell merchandise to customers and i learned about customers interests. Management was not well in that store and it changed about 4 times. My co-workers were friendly and knowledgeable. The hardest part of the job is when someone is waiting in line and they get aggressive because the line is not moving fast enough for them. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you get to learn your customers interests because they visit the store so much and you even make some new friends."
good,I loved the atmosphere. The most enjoyable part of the job was the Customers
good,"Great place to work I loved everything about it, if I was to go back I would rather go back as a manager not a GA."
good,"Gamestop is a great company to work for. It is a sales based job with great expectations of quotas to be met. The job is fun but stressful at times. A typical day at work includes counting many aspects of inventory, reviewing employee performance daily and creating great customer experience for customers to promote customer loyalty. The company has a great focus on customer experience and transforming with changing times to remain main stream and relative rather than falling like some other brick and mortor chains. There are times when customers are not fond of the company's return policy and that is probably the worst part of the job but as much time as I have invested I can handle any issues that come my way and let them leave happy. I have worked with a great group of people throughout my years with Gamestop. I love the companies emphasis on Ethics. During my time at Gamestop I have developed many loyal relationships with customers, my staff and my peers. It's nice to be able to sell something you know and you love to people that you are providing knowledge to."
good,It's okay as a summer job yet not enough hours. the management (depending on whose working or in charge) are very nice people yet some didn't know the difference between work comes first not gossip time. I do enjoy job as some benefits were good.   
good,"I was a store manager so my typical day at work was helping customer, processing trades, making the schedule, processing shipment, tracking sales, changing marketing and store layout, making sure the store was clean and organized, and making sure employees and the store were meeting expected goals, I feel I gained the most experience from this management position which included interviewing, training and developing employees while maintaining a successful store it was a welcomed challenge. The hardest part about the job was the hours during the holidays it didn't allow me a lot of time with my family which was difficult. "
good,Days could be stressful but overall it was a fun environment with the right staff.
good,"Learned Management skills as well as time management. Most enjoyable part of job is having the ablity to work with one of your hobbies, and something that so many people have passion for. Co workers and staff can be very immature unfortunetly."
good,"A typical day at work included talking about the latest video games with customers, buying old games as trade-in and selling Game Informer subscriptions."
good,I love electronics and I am a gamer so working at Gamestop was a dream come true. Staff and management was a pleqasure to work with. I learned a lot about the concept of gaming and on going development of the future of video games/electronics in general.
good,"- best store culture short of apple for product, specialty retial in the 90s"
good,A gamer's dream in every way. Very customer oriented. Upper management is helpful and reachable. You can't be shy since talking to customers about purchases is important. You are constantly challenged which is great for strong people.
good,"A typical day, get to work and always on the move, selling products or stocking up the selfves."
good,I enjoy every time I go to GameStop to work because I'm surrounded by great co-workers and customers who care about the products as much as the people creating the games! My managers have taught me a lot about working with customers & how to satisfy customers' needs with patience and concise decision making skills. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with high-pressure situations (like midnight releases) where time is precious to the customer & we try to be a quick with reliable service.
good,"On days that I worked in the morning I was responsible for opening the store in a timely manner. I would perform inventory counts on new and used systems as well as random items throughout the store that varied daily. I was responsible for shipping items to different stores in the company, as well as receiving product from the company and other stores. I worked closely with the store manager and assistant manager to ensure that the sales associates were properly trained. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and the ability to give them my opinion as well as my recommendation to help them find what was right for them. I also enjoyed working with the other associates in a friendly and young environment."
good,I loved working here because I got to be informed about new games and was able to share my knowledge with the customers.
good,Start your day packed with energy and excitement. There are daily non negotiable sales goals. I do enjoy the competitive environment. Game Stop taught me healthy time management prioritizing guest service first. There is nothing hard about working at Game Stop if your passionate about people. The most enjoyable part of the job is the cutting edge of video technology.
good,"Workdays would normally start with organizing and role checking merchandise while waiting for customers to enter the store or to ask for assistance, while at the same time throughout the day I would clean store or assist in tasks asked directly of me or of other co-workers when possible. My job helped me learn to become a much more successful sales associate and adapt to customer interfacing. My Co-workers were structured, task-oriented and charismatic people who were very good at introducing me into the retail sales gaming-industry while maintaining a balance with performing their own duties. The hardest part of the job would be the occasional 'F10' which was a role check on all particular games for a particular game console on display in comparison to what games were still available behind the counter. And the most enjoyable part of the job was having an enthusiastic progressive and charismatic co-workers, to be able to work in an environment filled with games and game-lovers, and to be able to interface with great diversity of customers."
good,"During the time I worked at GameStop I learned many new things about video game systems, games, and electronics. Luckily, I also loved to play video games during my off hours therefore making my job that much more fascinating. I would always know when a new game's arrival date was or learn about new updates for the game systems. I believe it was the best part-time job I've had."
good,"If you enjoy video games, you'll at least have some fun working here. I suppose I enjoyed it so much because one of my best friends was also working there, even though I didn't work with him that often. The actual working aspect was incredibly easy. The store we operated in is small, so up-keep and the day-to-day operations are generally straight-forward. My only problem working there had nothing to do with the store itself, but the customers. The town that the store was located in had a tendency to harbor some very distasteful, and often rude people."
good,"Normally work consisted of me cleaning up my work space and alphabetizing our inventory along with assisting customers with whatever problems they may have. I learned how to sell and provide customer service to all. Management was a dream, they gave you as much respect as one could give you and they showed you everything that could help you advance in the company. Typically all coworkers were easy to get along with and helpful. The hardest part of this job may have been inventory, so much product. The whole work experience was enjoyable."
good,"my day at work is always exciting,some days we get to check out new games. managment are cool my co-workers were always there to help when i first started. i enjoyed working at GameStop."
good,"During a typical day I was required to stock shelves, assist customers, handle cash register and answer phone calls."
good,"It was a great place to work at but sometimes a mix of demanding and routine. Management went to bat for me several times during my tenure there. Pay could be better, but the workflow was okay."
good,The job is pretty standard but feels more like a used-car lot as time moves forward pushing consumer-strangling services. And not providing those numbers looks poorly and is aggressed upon by upper corporate management.
good,"I genuinely enjoy working as a Game Advisor. My time typically consists of store organization and customer service. The basis of the job is straightforward and the more time I have to work, the quicker I pick up new responsibilities. Even more complicated tasks become easier with time. I also rarely deal with insufferable customers, something very commonplace among retail positions. Video gaming is my preferred pastime, and being an employee does slightly ease the burden of such an expensive hobby. My coworkers are very easy to get along with."
good,The work I was doing was just regular cashier work along with helping customers but the management was horrible about making the schedule and wasn’t very great at relaying important information either.
good,"Working on busy days was challenging but fun. I learned how to set and change prices, work the register, and stock. Management was alright, but there would be a couple of times where I didnt get the recent schedule sent to me ASAP when it was finished. The workers were always fun to work with and willing to help any questions that were asked and were always helpful."
good,"La formazione è ottima, in poco tempo sono riuscita a capire le necessità del cliente e a soddisfarle. Bisogna essere pronti e veloci, soprattutto nei periodi festivi. Importante è anche l'allestimento del negozio, i prodotti devono essere in ordine e in bella vista; era infatti nostro dovere assicurarci che tutto fosse a posto."
good,"The new manager had no sense of family."
good,"I did not enjoy the work enough to stay there considering the low pay and the fact that i had college classes to go to, but the managers there were great and helped me work around my school schedule."
good,I only worked seasonally at GameStop for 3 months. I really enjoyed working there because I’m always shopping at GameStop. I was kinda bummed when it was over but still I enjoyed the time I spent working there
good,"Gamestop can be hella fun to work at but the overall job was kinda boring but if youre into the culture its got nice bennefits, free games, free rentals"
good,I aboslutely adore gaming and adored working with my fellow gamers. organizing and mannning the computer was childs play especially with such a strong and supportive staff. In any job you should look to managers to determine if its right for you but i fell in at just the right place and am eager to look towards them for jon opportunities in the future
good,"Busy and enjoyable place to work assisting customer to find their entertainment needs.  Enteraction with adults, teenagers and children.   Able to relate to customers needs."
good,The only really difficult part of the job was ensuring your numbers and making judgement calls on trade ins. The irate costumers where not to bad in the area I what worked. It was about getting them to understand the prices were company based.
good,"Working at GameStop for the short time I have, I have been able to learn new things that I didn't know about helping customers. How it is impossible to approach every situation exactly the same."
good,"I had 30 hours the entire month of August. Went months without working sometimes, luckily i had two other jobs. My shifts were sometimes 3 hours long. Barely made gas money to get there."
good,"I have really enjoyed my time at GameStop. I started as a seasonal, and have worked my way up to a store leader in less than 3 years. My bosses have been very nice and sincere."
good,Working at Gamestop was fun but did have it’s difficult moments like any other place. The employees I worked with were fun and interactive with me. The managers there are also very helpful when answering questions.
good,"I personally have no complaints about my tenure at Game Stop. My managers were talented sales women and leaders and actively cared about their coworkers and store's performance. "
good,"If you love video games of all sorts, Gamestop is the place for you. I was able to discuss video games with my coworkers and customers and it was a fun environment."
good,"I had no complaints . I love working there , it’s a good business and fun to work. New management is taking sometime to get used to. Been their since 2012 and now seeing that it’s changing a lot not the company but the leadership it’s self which is disappointing."
good,"At GameStop you work hard, you play hard, in an environment with some of the brightest professionals in the business.  Sometimes that can be a bit intimidating but you will always learn top-notch skills to that will benefit you and your career along the way."
good,"New executive leadership team seems to be committed to excellence and has a decent plan for the future, day to day operations are consistent and currently evolving. If you love the gaming industry and are a passionate person you'll be great."
good,"Fun environment. People work together well and the managers are always cool. Hard to advance, must put in a lot of time. But you get to interact with people and sell video games all day"
good,The work focuses on guest engagement and hitting sales metrics. You have to find a good balance of helping the customer and selling products and services.
good,"All you see is people BAD MOUTHING GameStop and its really annoying. I had a great store, great managers, and great fun. I loved working mid-night releases to be 100% honest that was my favorite and i hated when we didnt do a midnight release lol. I worked there before i left for the United States Army and THEY HELD MY JOB FOR ME!!! When i came home i was even still in the computer. I couldve got the job back pretty much no problem but 1. none of the stores near me had the hours for another body, and 2. im married with kids i wouldve need much more then 10.75 an hour and preferably a different position then just ""game advisor"" As with every job you hear about changes happening and things being implimented and you disagree because those of us on the floor or in the trenches have diffrent views then the corprate bosses who just look at numbers. We know what changes help our individual stores and what we would like to see change but those ideas dont line up.. thats NORMAL lol.. as far the trading in goes.. look.. its the same rules as a pawn shop. We need to make a profit on it, we could just be like other stores and tell you to bad, tough luck, and not even offer you a buy back of anykind.. you dont like a shirt after you wore it for a couple days you cant return it. even though a lot of you gross people will do that.. Disgusting to say the least. you cant go to best buy and be like hey i bought this stero deck and i dont like it at all and have them pay you back for it..sorry dont work that way slick.. You cant purcchase a movie and then go i dont like it i want my money back"
good,The team I worked with was great. We were all friends and it was an easy going job. The company was all about the numbers regarding memberships and protection plans but our team was about customer experience.
good,I personally didnt care for the management and how they treated the other employees. Not all locations this happens but most. I loved meeting the people and working there.
good,"If you start out as a Game Advisor, you will not have enough money to take care of yourself and will hardly ever work. Making your way up the career ladder is the only time this job will begin to pay you for the time you put in. If you can stick out the super rough environment, and constant harassment of pushing numbers from corporate, it can be a very rewarding career option. The only downside to this once you make it up to a Managers position is you will have very little time to spend with your family as the required overtime is the same as a second part time job."
good,"Working with video games and surrounded by people who love them is nice, discounts and free game rental is awesome! However, the pay is absolutely minimum wage and even as a manager, they don't pay well either. There is also A TON of responsibilities that can rarely and sometimes never get done like shipment, training at a computer on new merchandise, inventory counts, setting up sale signs, price changes, meetings, and a lot of other tasks that need to be checked off. They rarely ever hire enough staff to cheapen out on their labor costs and leads to unrealistically ridiculous amount of tasks that need to be done. Luckily, management is pretty understanding and laid back about it knowing that as long as the majority of it is done, it's fine. It's a great place to work and really fun but is just too bad that the pay is so low."
good,"At this location in Bell Gardens, it was a pretty known GameStop for one that was kind of hidden. Everyday many customers come in and left with a purchase. Working hear helped me gain knowledge not only from the customers but especially the other associates."
good,"For a GA position, the work is easy and the people are fun but hours are very limited. I typically got 4-8 hours a week. The management was fair and made and effort to meet my needs but because of company rules, there were often more employees that hours for them to work."
good,"You have the opportunity to gain real world customer service experience, interacting with different situations that can be applied to later in life examples: in a corporate setting, in your personal life, and when being in public. If you love video games and can be passionate about pitching story lines, then this is a great job to work at during college and/or high school!"
good,A fun place to work while flexing your selling skills.  High guest engagement with great organizational skills required.  Good benefits if you can make full time.
good,It definitely wasn't a bad job. The only issue I can say that I had was how they pushed certain sales quotas and if you didn't meet the quota then your job security starts to fall a bit.
good,"This job is not for people who want to advance in their career, I'd say this job should be mainly for highschool students or people looking for experience in the gaming and retail business. Pay is bad, but its a good experience."
good,"I spent 3 years at GameStop and it was a blessing at a point for sure. Some of the lesser perks like taking games home to play were cool but as time went by and Online sales grew(Amazon, Steam, PlayStation Network, Xbox Market Place, Nintendo E-Shop), GameStop is losing money, losing hours, and making loads of adjustments and cuts every other week. Be prepared or shifting policies and Managers who are trying their best to do their jobs while (if they are at all smh)  their management role is going through loads of changes."
good,"If your a gamer and like inside info on all the goings on in the gaming world, this is the best place to work.  Great discounts, employee benefits, like first choice of limited or numbered released games and collectibles.  Free newly released games given to employees and boosted trade in credits for employees."
good,"Gamestop is my first job that I genuinely  enjoy going to, if your huge into games than this job is for you, helping customers everyday is usually enjoyable and meet a lot of great people."
good,"Even if I worked not so much, I learned many things."
good,"I know GameStop gets a lot of slack in the media about working for the company. I have to say that what people on the outside dont know or understand is that is not everyones experience with the company. There are a LOT of factors that go into peoples emotions about work and all sides are not always exposed.In my personal experience, I LOVE the company that I have dedicated 10+ years of my life to. GameStop is a FUN place to work, I mean we literally sell FUN and a way for people to escape. The company has provided me with many opportunities and has followed their motto GameStop Cares, not just for you as another employee but as a family. Being part of the GameStop family I have grown so much personally and professionally.I am so grateful for all the experiences that I had with the company."
good,"The company was easy to be hired on and the co-workers were always helpful. Followed strict guidelines with Circle of Life, though. Was easy to learn products and easy training."
good,Employees treat each other like family. Once you get into upper management that changes but I wouldn't trade my fellow SLs and ASLs for the world. We have a strong staff and group of people that we all care for. But DMs and RMs don't always feel that way.
good,"It was a good job to have, management was fair yet professional.  I worked as a seasonal so hours were fairly scarce and there was over staffing.  Typical work day was hitting the walls and making sure that all the video games on display were alphabetized.  I learned organizational skills as well as team work. The work place culture was very accepting, everyone seemed to get along and not have direct judgment.  Hardest part I would say, making sure all the video games are organized, because the influx of customers would always mean that everything would be unorganized again.  The most enjoyable was most definitely the work environment."
good,Gamestop was the best entry level job i can imagine. Perfect amount of hours and the responsibilities i had place on me due to an early promotion were plentiful but not difficult. The selling culture was very rough and cruel at first but as time went by they moved away from that model of management and the situation improved. I enjoyed my time there and am thankful for what ive learned.
good,"Working for GameStop you'll have an easy time getting to know the other employees and managers. Because it isn't designed as a full time job, I would suggest having a second job, or letting them know you are wanting to make a career out of your position. Even if it's only seasonal, if you do a great job and the manager remembers you, they'll possible hire you for next season."
good,"Helpful, fun and easy job to get done."
good,"There's nothing extremely special about working at GameStop. The conversation is usually pretty interesting if you enjoy games but your co-workers can be your largest hinderance at times. It is also highly competitive in terms of performance, to earn a meager 10 hours a week. Plus side there's a pretty generous holiday bonus and benefits."
good,"A typical day for me usually consisted of greeting customers as they"
good,"Having the passion for video games and pop culture is a key factor in having a good work experience with Gamestop. The pay is not good, the benefits for part-time are pretty minimal. However, if you find the right team and have the right manager. Working this job on the weekends is a lot of fun and can be very relaxing. It is a performance heavy company, but as long as you build relationships with customers and be respectful and knowledgeable then the numbers will come."
good,"I enjoyed working here because every day was something different. It is never easy pleasing people, but coworkers were always helpful. I also got the chance to always organize something during my time working."
good,Good work environment would recommend for gaining experience in a busy retail environment with opportunity to progress into a managers role...........
good,"Depending on your position you could find yourself mostly on the sales floor or behind the counter most of the day. Hardest part of the job would be handling difficult customer situations, But the best part is being in a lax environment with people that are interested in what you enjoy, If you're a gamer that is."
good,I have a great time at work and it is a great place to meet people who you can get along with as well as a great client base it is honestly one of the best jobs ive worked
good,Learned a lot about how to handle customer complains correctly and employees. Not enough hours to get everything done. Sometimes it was hard getting the right people in the right place
good,Had loads of fun and it was a pleasure to be able to discuss similar interests with employees and customers. You also get store discounts and dibs on merch.
good,"It's very relaxed. Great Job Culture. But it can be boring. Since the customer is moving toward online stores and getting things delivered."
good,I learned my managerial skills while working at Gamestop. Nice co-workers and managers. We all worked together to make sales. I wasn't a fan of having to reach a certain amount of preorders but its the job. Great discounts.
good,manager at the time was lovely and always helped to make sure you reached your goals. was a very nice place to work with good staff and good management.
good,"The store manager was very driven to meet company standards. In the short time I was there, i felt like a part of the team, not as a seasonal worker. However the boss had an ""I'm always right"" kind of attitude."
good,"To be a good worker at Gamestop, you need to be well-versed in games and game culture, both on the producer and consumer side.  Hours and customers aren't quite as abundant as you may like, but you still do a fair amount of work when you can."
good,"I loved working at Gamestop. There were some downsides, of course, but overall I loved my coworkers and the customers. It was a really enjoyable environment most of the time. It was sad when my store had to close."
good,I love GameStop. I’ve been a regular here since I could remember. Walking into the store gives me the same feeling I had when I was a kid years ago. Everyone is friendly. We protect the family.
good,"I worked for a few years with the company and overall I liked it a lot. Although the pay wasn't by any means high, the company did provide (in my case) a great working environment. I had a great team and my bosses were all amazing and great mentors."
good,"Grazie a Gamestop la formazione ricevuta come SM è un qualcosa che ti cambia radicalmente."
good,"While employed with Gamestop, I was able to increase my management skills and my ability to keep my stores fully functional for business. Great place to work and learn."
good,Had Fun working here. Put game cases on display and helped customers. Talk about thing you love. Flexible scheduling. Need be full time for any benefits.
good,"great place to work once u build a good team "
good,"Learned all about the gaming world, which is always a bonus. It did get hectic at times, having to push sales and such. But we worked together as a team, and kept it an overall enjoyable workplace."
good,"Personally i enjoyed where i was located, with very minimum amounts of drama within the work place. However being part of a big corporation like GameStop you heard what was going around in the distrixt which wasn't ideal."
good,"Other than the look on customers faces for the abysmal trade-in offers, it is a fun job to have if you play video games. Keep the store clean, sell products, and be friendly to customers is not a tall order."
good,"Its retail. The hours given are usually manageable but there is often a disconnect with the big wigs.  Having a good district manager makes a big difference. A lot of work and sales goals but if video games are your thing you will probably enjoy your job. Typical day at work consists of managing funds, selling products, cleaning, organizing the store, training employees, and controlling shrink. hardest part of job is finishing the tasks while still spending time with customers. most enjoyable part is the workplace culture. SMs are given the freedom to hire who they believe is qualified/compatible."
good,"I learned to have better communications skills with customers, assisting them in any questions they had, and figuring out what they were looking for as well"
good,"Everytime, I walked I felt welcomed and people were very kind and they showed me the ropes"
good,"Very easy job to have if you are knowledgeable in the video game field. Typical day at work consists of greeting every customer when the walk in, helping them with anything they need(answering any questions, giving recommendations, etc). Asking customers at the registers(after I ring up all the items they brought up to the counter) if there is anything else i can for them(asking if they would like to reserve any games, sign up for rewards program, or cover the games with GameStop's game play guarantee warranty). Keeping the walls organized by alphabetizing the games in each section. I would say the most enjoyable part of working at GameStop, would be making a customers' day by giving them the best service they've had and they thank you for all your help. It really feels good when you know you've done a good job."
good,"Not a bad place to work at all, but had very little room for personal growth. Was best as an in-between job. Didn't really go anywhere, there was no real opportunity for starting an actual career."
good,"Oerall, Gamestop is a pleasure to work for. Being around people who generally enjoy video games makes not only the day go by but it makes it easier. I can say though, that management isn't always the best,  but it can be worked out if everyone just communicates."
good,Working for Gamestop is generally easy going as long as you have competent managers working for the store. You don't work with many people so if someone doesn't pull their weight or drags things out the whole store suffers.
good,"Working at GameStop did help me grow as a person and I do not regret working there. That being said GameStop( like any retail environment) has it fair share of problems including hours for employees, heavy requirements for little pay, and a high turnover rate. Not a likely place to foster a career"
good,"Great place to work, especially for those who are looking for a place while in school or starting out in life. Very friendly and helpful team who are willing to walk you through what is needed, and help you think for yourself on what isn't."
good,Great setting if you like video games. You get to experience a lot and learn a lot. People are nice and you get a lot of loyal customers. Sometimes can be overwhelmingly busy.
good,"Gamestop is a great place to work if you enjoy discussing and talking about video games. Who doesnt? Customers are, most of the time, friendly and your fellow employees are normally cool and good to work with. Some lapses in management when there was things going on at other stores. Sometimes that would make it harder for you to figure out what was going on. But overall, not a bad place to work, fun, competitive."
good,"I had a good time working for GameStop, but there wasn't any future in it. GameStop has a good work spirit with events to create employee cohesion. They have good facilities for entertainment, and upper management give employees the attention they need."
good,"Job requires employee to be prompt when answering phone calls. You must be knowledgeable and attentive when relating to customers concerning products. Have the ability to sale products and services. Nice place to work if you like communicating with customers concerning video games, consoles, and accessories."
good,For someone wanting to get their feet wet in the employment world Gamestop is always hireing. Its a decently easy job that anyone with simple skills can preform if they keep their wits about them and follow the rules.
good,"After working with GameStop for 6 and a half years I must say it was fun while it lasted. If you are an avid gamer or have a love for pop culture Gamestop offers a unique way to interact with guests that share a common interest that you share. In this job it is very important to be able to relate to customers and be able to add additional value to transactions. Being a good salesman is key. All in all loved my time there would recommend if you have a mind for business, retail, and videogames/collectibles."
good,"I loved working around the games, but corporate became overwhelmingly aggressive and unfair as time went on. I left due to the lack of available hours, but I still love my GameStop family"
good,Working for the assignment at Game Stop Refurbishment Center was awesome! Fast paced but fun to work in. A big center where you met people all over the world. Great co workers!
good,"There was always something to do at Gamestop. Even on a slow day there's always some kind of cleaning to do. I was very awesome to get paid to just talk to customers about your favorite games, anime and pop culture. As a nerd this seemed like a great place to work. Although we had our fair share of difficult customers and management was hard on us at times. It was still an enjoyable job."
good,It was not a bad company to work for at all. The most obvious area of improvement would be annual salaries.  The environment was good to work in. Most employees get along and work well together. The brand is stable and the yearly trips for managers were quite fun and memorable.
good,"working at gamestop had generally been a positive experience for me, and i definitely have learned a lot about management from my work as an SGA. that being said, there are a lot of things that are required from you, aside from general retail duties. things like taking in trades for game system, phones, tablets, and other electronics and video games takes quite a bit of training, and can sometimes be very gross to handle. i'm talking systems infested with bugs every now and then. but, if you have a good team, good management, and nice regular customers, it can be a very rewarding job. only qualms i've had is the stress of meeting sales goals for membership cards, pre-orders, and other goals, and customers being angry about trade values for their xbox 360 games. also, get ready to work up from minimum wage. really best for people in high school or college, maybe not the best for a career unless you get started at a higher pay rate. but, hey, if you're in management you might get a free game code and you get that dank 15% discount."
good,Would go in the morning and we had a goal of 210 units to be tested and cleaned. Very fast paced and very little space for mistakes. I've learned how to work with a lot of different kinds of people all from different backgrounds. the hardest part of the job was they based everything on points and I did not like that. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we would all meet our daily goal and we would get recognized for our hard job.
good,Love it at gamestop. Very relaxed and fun to work there. My bosses all love a laugh and so do all the other employs. We allnmostly have a lot in common so getting along is easy.
good,"Problem solve with guests about about any gaming needs. Hardware, software, compatibility, new games, etc. "
good,The first day I worked there I felt welcomed and made friends with everyone. I enjoyed every time I came into work there they employes treated you like you belong there.
good,Coworkers and customers are wonderful to interact with but hours have been terrible. Upper Management is the worst since they act like they havent been in your shoes ever and expect you to be perfect and fast despite almost always being busy. GPGs and Pro cards are always expected even though tourists are a huge chunk of customers and its a scam to sign them up. If my manager wasnt a kind person I wouldve quit forever ago.
good,"Even though I didn't work there for long I thought it prepared me for what I had to do for it her jobs, I guess you can say I'm ready to take on other jobs now."
good,"It's been ages since I've worked there, but what I remember were good times mixed with responsibility. Aside from that, when Funcoland was bought by EB Games (later to become Gamestop), there was a mix of concerns regarding advancement, pay and benefits."
good,"Working for GameStop is an ideal place for anyone who enjoys games. It gives you the opportunity to keep up with current information as well as prepare for future releases. The best part is while doing all this you are also developing your skills such as prioritizing, communication, and accountability.  The longer you work there the more you start to see the small staff and regular customers as a family."
good,"I love my staff and the guests I talk with daily, but the company is adding more work for less pay with some of the new changes that have been made. As a store leader I feel I do not have much opportunity to move up further in the company."
good,Enjoy the inviroment and managment here. Great retail enviroment. They set you up for success and push you to move up in the company. Laid back and really chill place to work
good,Very collaborative environment.  Lots of management teams.  Can be considered very compartmentalized but the teams work well together.  Management is not stand-offish.Very friendly and open to communication.
good,"The warehouse operations are industry standard. It's not terrible working here. Although there does seem to be some favoritism, hard work and determination are rewarded. Being located in the same building as the corporate hq, you definitely see how operations favor the corporate employees. That said, it's definitely not the worst place to work for, and the corporate culture is based on community, respect, and responsibility."
good,"Strong goals, good working environment and positive management staff. Minimum wage at beginning and with strong support from management, advancement is possible."
good,My manager and co-workers were incredibly friendly and helpful. Work was sort of lazy but still productive. Hours and pay were great. It's an easy job.
good,Great place for gamers and people who enjoy electronic entertainment. Great place for me to transition slowly from military life to civilian life. The management and coworkers were understanding and tried to give hours as much as possible.
good,"Honestly even though you get paid 7.25, the discounts can get you a 60 dollar game to 10 or none on it. Its basically a free game if you play your cards right. I didn't work there much so i can't say everything"
good,"If your co-workers and managers are cool, fun people then it can be a blast, but if they are not it can be pretty bad. The community and customers are usually the most interesting part of the job."
good,"Was a seasonal worker and it seemed almost as if I only worked when someone else called in, so not really good pay, for some pretty consuming work. You are also expected to complete training on the computer on your own time at work, while also completing all other tasks assigned to you."
good,"the workplace is good. "
good,"This is a great job for anyone with an interest in Video Games. Upper management is a pain, but all local employees are great and so are many of the customers."
good,I have learned a lot on  my hardware position as a technician at GameStop and I had the opportunity to be among the best technician as far was production is concerned and accuracy on troubleshooting systems and working according to the quality standards set by the company.
good,Good entry level management position. Decent level of opportunity for advancement within the company if you are a hard worker. Strong push to get customer to buy into PowerUp program.
good,GameStop was a fun place to work. I love video games. So it was ideal for me to apply here. A typical day involved alphabetizing and organizing products. Making sure the customer was able to find exactly what they were searching for in timely manner. Also providing information on the up coming game and new releases. I learned how to provide quality customer service and extensive game knowledge. The hardest part of this job was the new releases. This would bring about rude and rowdy customers. the most enjoyable part was getting to try out the games.
good,Always a fun environment when I'm working. Everyone is happy and excited to be there the  manager is awesome she's hard working and she also drives everyone else to want to work harder to provide good customer service to everyone who walks threw those Gamestop doors.
good,Being a person whom loves to relax and play video games on my free time. I've the most fun recommending games to customers and having them approach me later to tell me how much to love the game that i recommended.
good,"The Hours for even Key holder positions are minimal, but the work is fun and engaging. Make sure you are able to communicate with your District Manager or Advancement can become very difficult."
good,"I have always enjoyed working for GameStop, because it's seemed like a ""family"" to me. Typical days involved interacting with guests while simultaneously completing daily/weekly tasks, checking in daily shipment, managing inventory, and developing associates. As a Store Leader, you have to wear many hats, and you are consistently busy without much time to stop and think. Hardest part of the job is keeping up with constantly shifting focuses and new sales promotions that rely heavily on extra leg work on the store's end. Most enjoyable part of the job is helping all of the guests who walk in leave with a smile on their face by getting exactly what they wanted and needed."
good,"Le mie mansioni nel negozio erano aprire o chiudere il negozio (dipendeva dall'orario)"
good,"A typical work day involves counting registers and safe, greeting guests on the sales floor, and identifying their stated and unstated needs. You have to implement elements of the ""Circle of Life"" in every transaction, which includes Reserves, Trades, Pre-Owned, and PowerUp Rewards Memberships."
good,All of my coworkers were a joy to be with and they honestly made the job worth it! There was never a day that I dreaded going in to work because I knew I would always be working with amazing people!
good,"I would have never left if they paid you a salary that was livable. talking about games all day was awesome, but the district manager was always breathing down your neck to upsell like crazy"
good,"This is the type of job you would take if your were going back to school or currently in school. Fun and many opportunities to learn job basics to be used in the future, but advancement is few and far between."
good,"I worked at two different GameStop stores while I worked there. As a female, it can be slightly frustrating because many of the male customers believe you to be incompetent based on your gender. Other than that, I loved my job. Some of the managers were my best friends. GameStop has the culture of everyone being close to one another rather than banning managers to hang out with their associates. All of my managers were invited to my graduation party. It's a great environment to work. I only stopped working there because I moved and the store I wanted to transfer to was being difficult."
good,"A typical day of work consist of interacting with customers, most who are regulars, who eventually become friends, or more like family. Working here I learned how to up-sale products, and be more attentive to customers needs, thru learning the products they were most interested in, and how to sale, and pre-sale them products like them that were upcoming products of the company. Work place culture was pretty great. its encouraged to have fun, and make it a place they would look forward to visiting again. The hardest part of the job was getting some workers to completely complete there daily task, while the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to see the regulars that knew you by name, and face, and looked forward to/hoped you were working when they arrived to shop."
good,"I would recommend this job to any gamer or entry level sales rep. This is a chance to work on your pitch, and salesman skills. You interact with customers of all different ages and races, so you will definitely gain some culture. It is a fun environment and a great company to work for."
good,"I really enjoyed working at GameStop.  The store manager I worked with at the time was really amazing at bringing people in and had amazing product knowledge.  The district manager was awful.  She was very rude and a total favoritest.  She would fire people for the smallest (or no) reason.  You get a decent discount there and it's really rewarding connecting with your customers.  Sometimes people just come in to talk, which can be obnoxious if you get busy.  It's pretty relaxed most of the time, though.  While I worked here I had another full-time job.  This made the experience way more enjoyable, otherwise I wouldn't be making enough money to survive."
good,"I really enjoyed working in this area, the only issue was pay is the minimum and seasonal employees who were told they could keep the job such as myself, only got a day off work per two weeks."
good,It's very happy enverment fun to work meet great people day to day i learn a great deal about new games great weekly deals love the job i have just wish i had more hours
good,"GameStop is a very cool environment no matter what location you visit. I was a seasonal employee but everyone is very down to Earth and will teach you everything you need to know. Work is slow unless it is during the holiday season. If you are looking for a first-time job, I would definitely recommend this company to start."
good,"While this is the ideal job for many gamers of my generation, this job is far from perfect. I was fortunate enough to have a good boss and work with friendly people, however the commission-styled work  template was a bit of a turn-off to me--not to mention the complete chaotic nonsense that was scheduling. There was never a month where my schedule felt regular and expected"
good,"Short shifts made it hard to really getting involved in the company. I wanted to work more than just 3-9 hours a week. However, loved my co-workers and enjoyed what I was selling."
good,"I have fun working at GameStop. Sure there are quirks about the job, such as people complaining about the amount of cash you can give them for their older games and systems, but overall the job is very satisfying. I get along well with my coworkers and if there is an issue, we are all able to work it out amongst ourselves. Management is quite easy to get ahold of , and also to become a part of. I was hired on as a part time manager and now I am a full time manager."
good,Overall they are a good company working hard to provide a product in a competitive market that is found mostly as digital content in the modern day of gaming.
good,Arrive and are given your daily tasks. You then get to work with other people who have a common interest as you. Video game knowledge is highly recommended.
good,A typical work day is pretty smooth and consistent. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers. Coworkers are normally pleasant and share responsibility equally.
good,"My typical day at Gamestop involved organizing games on the shelves, taking customers at the cash register, taking out trash, cleaning bathrooms, and overall making sure customers have a good experience at Gamestop.  I learned how to multitask, as well as how to ask open ended questions to find out what customers need. The Hardest part about the job is just dealing with irate customers. I really enjoyed being around other gamers that i like to work with."
good,The job was filled with many ups and downs. The manager was amazing and the other employees were funny and great. The negative was the small hours I got and the small pay.
good,"Working at GameStop was great.  I had the opportunity to work directly with upper management including the CIO and CFO, I was given the opportunity to try something different and expand my skill set and grow. The culture there and the people were beyond amazing!"
good,"Decent enough to work for, but don't expect a steady schedule. The environment can be fun but occasionally messy and may ask for you to lift things or climb to an uncomfortable height. Not a problem personally, but some people aren't into it. A lot of other associates are bad at social interaction, which can be frustrating."
good,Easy job meeting a lot of fun and interesting people. only thing that is difficult is meeting the sales goals set for the day and the week by management. great discounts and free rental games. really enjoyed the people and the job.
good,"If you're a gamer or enjoy nerd/geek culture this would be a great job for you. Most of the customers who come in will know what they want or will come up to you to ask questions and that is where your knowledge will come in, this is still a retail job so do keep in mind that their are some customers out there who do make things difficult. Working at Gamestop can be stressful at times due to rushes, especially if the counter is full of games from trades or even systems. the breaks were short but long enough for you to eat a snack."
good,"The job itself, and your coworkers as from what I've witnessed and experienced is all great. Even customers coming in to just chat also makes it more relaxed, everyone has fun and that's the one thing customers and employees alike love the most!"
good,"Working at GameStop was literally my dream but the reality is, they are obsessed with your numbers. You HAVE to have certain numbers to stay on staff, and they watch you very closely. A typical day would involve showing up to work and having to help customers. You have to do a lot of sorting in alphabetical order, and you really need to get good at it. When a customer wants a game, you have to dig it out of the drawer, and a misfiling leads to time lost. This job is cool because you get to meet people who like gaming, but it sucks that you can't really enjoy it. My manager once made me sign a piece of paper to acknowledge that my score was low for the week...which every employee could see. They try to scare you into doing better, and that is not okay."
good,Manager was awesome job was fun friendly people employees and customers great culture and great opportunity to move up fast good scheduling to work around others
good,The customers are always the best thing about the job I am super sociable so its was easy for me to build an relationship with customers. I am also at an leadership role so I granted the skills of leading my team to drive the business.
good,I've worked there for about 6 months now and I've figured out how to do most everything. Customers are usually friendly and fun to talk to and so are the employees. I've enjoyed my time there and still want to work within the company because they care so much about their employees and customers. They pay fair and listen to your concerns.
good,Good place to work.  Provides no free lunches.  Does not provide nap time.  Does pay on time if not too well.  Sometimes has you work on short notice.
good,"Seasonal position, I was only there during the Christmas season and it was fast paced and productive. I had fun, there is not much else to tell."
good,Good place to work if you enjoy video games and toys.  Fun environment where you deal with customers most days.  Basically your days consists of talking about video games all day.
good,"I worked at the DC/SSC location in Grapevine. The environment is relaxed for the most part. Most of the people working there are easy to get along with. Although I did interact with management, most of the personnel I came in frequent contact were members of the DC management team. Most of the leads, supervisors, and managers in the DC were more than willing to help with any inquiries made by the AP team."
good,"Got to work and walked out on the floor to provide aid to those looking for a game that they would truly enjoy. with the use of a tablet used information given to find the right selection for them. The culture in the workplace was great due to the variety of people I got to meet who were into the medium of product that they were selling. The work was always enjoyable to me so I never found anything particularly difficult, but if I had to say the hardest part would be dealing with impatient crowds with only a limited number cash registers available to utilize. The most enjoyable part was the conversations that I'd get into when discussing products with the customers."
good,"Well my day starts by logging in to the stores computer to get an update on the stores sales, promotional offers, and the daily requirement for todays sales. On the floor would be were most of my time took place. Organizing, assisting customers, informing them on everything we could do for the day. Workplace culture was nice and fluid everyone knew what they had to do, good social environment."
good,"I was only a seasonal employee, but this job was a good one. I only wish I'd gotten more hours."
good,"Good place to work if you want to learn about this particular industry, and employees are rewarded for hard work and dedication. There are monthly business meetings, where management discusses business needs and changes with the employees, as well as hold monthly drawings for Perfect Attendance and Employee of the Month. As long as you stick to yourself, and do what you're supposed to do, you have nothing to worry about. The workplace culture is disgruntled, which is why I say ""stick to yourself,"" or at least stick with the positive folks. I've worked for companies that were far worse, yet employees complain about the smallest of things. Work is pretty steady during slow season, and pretty demanding during busy season. Bottom line, you come in and do the task, and don't let the task do you..."
good,"You meet great people & enjoyable co-workers. a Fantastic company cultue and major learning experience. Only downside is if your entry level, hours are extremely limited"
good,"i loved working there. i meat a lot of people there. the only thing i would say they needed to work on is, management need to work on their communication and how they would talk to people."
good,"Gamestop is like any retail establishment. If its something you can do then you will succeed . Otherwise, retail is not for everyone and a lot of employees have come and gone"
good,some amazing people work at gamestop however the pay and hours arent the best unless youre a manager at the store.  The benefits are great if your a gamer or a store manager
good,I enjoyed processing the new shipment and seeing all the new merchandise that the store received everyday.  Also enjoyed helping everyone that came in find just what they were looking for.  I highly enjoyed working with my coworkers while at GameStop.  Management was flexible with last minute/ emergency schedule changes.  I learned some very creative ways to solve customer issues.  The hardest part of working for GameStop was the constantly changing allotment of hours.
good,"A typical day on the job consisted of alphabetizing walls and drawers of games, assisting customers to help them find their perfect game while also making sure they were shown everything they might need for the future in gaming. The only hard part of the job was being so close to other vendors who sold the same/similar product and not being able to price match for their deals."
good,"GameStop started off for me as one of two part time jobs I took out straight out of college. Hours weren't bad, the culture was fun as you got to paid to sell the premiere form of entertainment, but at the end of the day it was still retail. Being an SGA wasn't too bad as you had all the responsibilities as a Game Advisor with some of the managerial ones, but I saw enough of the company to realize I didn't want to move up more. I have nothing but respect and admiration for my bosses because they worked harder than most people probably realize, but it was apparent to both of us that it wasn't worth the lower-than-desirable pay. This place served me well as I continued to pursue my acting on the side."
good,"I've learned much from my time here. Everything from learning how each guest is different and how to fulfill their wants and needs, to learning how to aim a team of different individuals at a common goal. The hardest part of the job is having a rotating schedule and the chaos of holiday shopping, but it's always nice to see a guest come back and let us know that our recommendation made someones day! Being among the first to see and use the newest games and electronics is the best perk of the job. The staff is generally small so we get to know each other quite well and can use those bonds to help us succeed at our goals. Overall a great company and a great place to work."
good,"Work is average and the employees are very nice. I've learned very valuable skills in this job, especially when it come to customer service. A great place to start at especially if you are a high school student"
good,My time here was good overall. Nice people and a very fun and fast paced job. I spent most hours closing and the people I closed with were really supportive and positive people.
good,"The management and people I work with are very nice and easily approachable. The hours are not too great, but I still enjoy the community of people I can sell games to. Its a fun place to work but sometime you may get a mean or rude customer but if you have worked retail before you should know it comes with the job."
good,"I have worked at Gamestop for almost 4 years, between Lino Lakes and now, Mankato. I have had many different coworkers and managers come and go and have watched the business evolve with the release of the Xbox One and Playstation 4, in a first-hand view of the gaming industry evolving as well."
good,"This is a great place to work especially when it is with people you have a strong relationship with. As long as everyone does their part, there will be zero issues to deal with."
good,"Customer service, cash handling, inventory prep and training employees. Making sure that customer leave happy with what game or gaming system they are looking for."
good,"The job consists of typical customer service to friendly and interesting gamers. Tasks would include organizing video games, selling cosplay, and providing a positive shopping experience. The employees are easy going and management was handled well. I've learned how to make an uninterested shopper interested instantly. The only downside is the pay and amount of hours given as only managers will receive 30+ hours. Anyone else is looking at less than 20 hours per week not to mention the minimum wage."
good,"A work day is mostly sales and customer service, and I learned to had good communication skills and the management was really good for protecting its employee with the right guidance. My co-workers were really good, and the hardest part of the job was getting memberships. The best part of the job was making sure the customer get what they want."
good,"Gamestop is a fun place to work. You get to work around video games all day and talk to customers about them as well. Hours are tough because unless you're a manager or key holder you won't get many of them. I had the best manager I could ask for, he trained us all very well and held us to a high standard."
good,"*A typical day at work would be going in about 2 hours before opening the store to take care of inventory counts and deposits. Once the store is open, you will be continuously busy with the influx of customers coming in and many tedious tasks to do in the store. When ringing a customer out, there are many add-ons GameStop likes to advertise. At the end of the day, the store is a mess so we clean it up."
good,"Gamestop was fun to work at, but the management was not always organized. They focused a lot on Attach rates for warranties and selling more pre-owned than new. If you did not meet their requirements by even a percent, they treated you like a child as apposed to a mature adult. punishing you by humiliating you in front of leadership instead of actually working to fix the situation. Coworkers were nice and customers were friendly. There are a few regulars that make your day when they come in, but by far the cons out weigh the pros."
good,Not a bad place to work at if you enjoy videogames and fellow videogamers. Only problem was the pay and lack of opportunities to move up. Other than that I truly enjoyed it. Only left because I needed to make more money.
good,The job is fast pace... it has its ups and downs and constant changes as most jobs does. learning about business P&L and how to articulate to the team and come up with weekly strategies to achieve our goals.
good,You come in everyday at 7 am and you get a certain amount of boxes per zone. The crew works as a team to get the boxes filled with products and shipped off.
good,"Easy to come in, just log in and get started on the day right away. Helping customers gets pretty easy. If you don't know the answer to a particular question, there are many ways to find out and help satisfy the needs of said customer. Management, at our location at least, has been very accommodating and incredibly helpful. Staff is always willing to help and will bend their time so that everything gets done. Fun environment to work in. Some people you meet may not be the best, but you come to know the regulars and that makes work even more enjoyable. Opening, closing, processing transactions at the cashwrap, all easy and not much of a trifle to do. The job feels like it gets easier as you go on. I'd recommend it."
good,"Coworkers and customers were the best part of the day. It's like treating patients almost, however they are not sick. Interaction with many people was also amazing."
good,"providing great customer service for everyone that walks in the store, cleaning up games and putting them away in the right order,"
good,typical day at work nothing really exciting a lot of inventory great co workers and nice management not really a difficult job or tasks
good,"GameStop was a fun place to work. Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to discuss games to guests and help them find games to enjoy. It was hard to advance to a higher position and receive that promotion. Post-college, I was really looking forward to move up to Assistant Manager, but no positions became available in my area. GameStop does not pay that well due to few work hours for non-managers, but balances out with the great discounts employees receive as well as free shirts, lanyards, posters, and sometimes, free games."
good,"I started working at GameStop for a part time job while I attended college. It was extremely fun to talk about and help people find video games for a living, but the pay was very low and there were no health, vision, or dental benefits available."
good,"I loved working at GameStop, it was a very fun experience and the managers always were fun to be around and they were very easy to get along with"
good,Gamestop changes with the times to meet business needs. There is room for personal growth and development. Good employees and easy to follow guidelines for the job.
good,"If you want to work in a place that promotes in house this is the place to work. Great environment, a great business experience. if you love constant change this is the place for you"
good,"Manage typical day to day operations, account for payroll, scheduling for all store employees, demonstrated superior customer service skills to ensure their needs were met, and coach and mentor employees for future success. Depending on which location you work at you will always have a diverse group of employees to work with, the employees at my store are a fantastic hard working group of individuals and operate as a great team."
good,"It was a retail job so it was a lot of organizing and restocking but there was also great interactions with costumers. A lot of the older clientele where my favorite to work with because a lot did not have a good understanding of our products so I would spend a good amount of time informing them about our giant variety in products. When it came to the younger costumers a lot of them already knew what they wanted so I would find the product for them and sell it to them. "
good,"The average workday was cool. Have had some great managers and also some lack luster ones as well. Your coworkers make or break the job. Fortunately, I had great coworkers."
good,"I have grown and learned much from my time with GameStop. This company created an environment where I was able to hone my customer relationship, service, and sales skills. In the past four years I have been able to develop my leadership and managing abilities to drive a sales team to great success. The hardest part of my job is maintaining a job work/life balance with a retail schedule without a lot of payroll support from the organization. The most enjoyable part of the job is hiring and working with the team to develop them into top performers and leaders within our district in sales and customer relations. I also have thoroughly enjoyed creating an engaged, service focused, and fun culture within my store."
good,"Game Stop was a great place to work at, the manager is a good guy, as well as a work, we always had good customers. Working with this company taught me how to work as a team with others and how to properly stock and inventory items."
good,"Aiding customers with any and all questions they had about games, accessories, or subscriptions. Kept the store in a neat and clean fashion by alphabetizing games as well as pick up any debris on the floor. Always something new and exciting to talk about whether it be with co-workers or customers."
good,"Typical retail sales. co-workers are great we all are close knit like a family. District management lacking in needs of the stores. "
good,"GameStop is always a fun place to work, but the compensation leaves a lot to be desired. The best thing about working at GameStop is the people and the freebies"
good,Gamestop is a good first job or second job for someone young and charismatic about meeting people and video games.  I learned how to count and check registers after closing and the importance of organization and efficiency. The managers were good but were still in as immature about certain things. My co-workers definitely had a team attitude and we were taught well to develop that. The hardest part was the flux of what was important in quotas but the most enjoyable was selling to the customers and objectively selling and only up selling when it is actually beneficial. My customers always came for me and even some followed me when I went to work for another store.
good,"Easiest, funnest job I've had, but the customers were garbage and the pay wasn't great. Co-workers were a ton of fun, but it had poor management. There wasn't many perks. However it was a great place to get a lot of experience and learn what to do in many situations, and I had a ton of fun."
good,I decent place to work where you can learn different things about customer service and business management. Has opportunity to move up in the company.
good,"Compensation is minimum wage, hour are very flexible. Management is easy to work along with. Money and customer relation skills a must. Great place to learn about gaming systems and games."
good,"This was definitely one of my favorite jobs I've had, the hours and wages could have been a little higher, but I still enjoyed it regardless. The team I was with and the customers really made working there great."
good,It is a pretty fun Environment especially if you enjoy gaming. You have goals to meet as well as tasks such as fixing up the store and replenishing game cases on the sales floor.
good,"Gamestop is a fun business to work for. The team builds the environment and all share the same love for games. Work usually entails helping customers find the right games for them. The management for the company helps ensure that family comes first and try to be flexible. Hardest part of the job is dealing with incredibly high traffic during the holidays and the recovery afterwards and the lack of hours during the off season. The most enjoyable part of the job is sharing a love for games."
good,Wonderful company just not a great balance of home and work life. Pay was not up to par with work load either. Still a great company.
good,"For the most part, Gamestop was a great place to work for. AP was a little bit rude. It's rather difficult to get management to do anything. While I was doing my job, parts for consoles, as well as consoles themselves would run short quite frequently. When consoles and parts were actually in stock, my job was quite easy."
good,On a normal day i would help customers find the games that they wanted and try to up sell on item that would make that game they were getting better. i learned that patients no matter how over the top customers can get is key. I was apart of management so i would have to say we made the work experience for anyone under us enjoyable.
good,"Great company to work for, promotes people from within the company and cares a great deal about their employees. You go above and beyond to help customers there."
good,I was hired for the Christmas season. The job was very enjoyable and if i wasn't already work a full time job i would have stayed with the company. I learned how to better handle stressful situations.
good,"Can be a bit repetitive. Every day I've worked, it doesn't feel like work. It's a pretty fun environment to work. Management could always use work. Hardest part is advancement. I've been with GameStop for a little over a year and am still at the entry level position and have switched from two different stores. The most enjoyable part, is that it doesn't feel like work if you know what you are doing. Management is always switching up and you never know what is going on some of the time. For part time, you don't get many hours to work during the week."
good,"A typical day of work focused on cleanliness of store front."
good,It was the best job I ever had because the people that I worked with. The low pay was a downer though. Management was great to me and the other employees as well.
good,"Best experience ever"
good,"I worked at Gamestop 3 years seasonal and about 2-3 years fulltime I've always had a good time going into work for Gamestop, the people I got to work with made it that way, The customers we're usually always nice and I had some many regulars came in that I knew by name that added a special connection between us all."
good,"The team I worked with was very good, they were forgiving of the aspects of games I was not alright with and appreciated the knowledge I was more at home with. I wish that its hours were better, if so I would probably still be working there."
good,"This job was one of the best retail job to work at. It was both fun and felt good to help customers that was trying to shop for either themselves or for their children, friends, and family. the holiday season was the best time for me to work even though it is one of the  busiest day of the year we just focused on customers, sales, I would have more hours to work and the time went by fast."
good,I enjoyed the atmosphere at Gamestop because I felt that I was well appreciated at the company. Put in the work for the reward that you deserve. Though to be completely honest the only aspect that I disliked about my time there was how hard that the push you to get customers to subscribe to their magazine and the reservations for up coming games.
good,"La giornata tipica di lavoro in uno store Gamestop inizia con la lettura delle e-mail della sede indicanti informazioni fondamentali per lo svolgimento del lavoro."
good,"The company is a fun place to work, always new people to meet and fun experiences to share."
good,A typical day at work is usually eventful. Have customers that are so excited about games and then there are those who really just don't care.
good,"Working at GameStop is definitely not like what one would assume due to the nature of the business and its products. While it is very fun to work here and be amongst coworkers and customers with similar interests, there are always many tasks at hand and duties to perform.  The flow of customers is constant and there are always systems to trade in, products to file away, and questions to be answered. I definitely always see a push for advancements for associates; whether it's an actual promotion or just a friendly nudge to take on more responsibilities. "
good,"I learned everything I know of excellent customer service from my Gamestop. I worked with many different managers as they made their rotation through the store. They taught me to treat people with respect and to help them find the best option for themselves, even if it wasnt initially what they came for. "
good,"We had great patrons who were awesome to interact with, but also had new customers who were open to learn and hear about new things."
good,"Gamestop was the longest retail company I have ever worked for. I loved the job, the customers, the discounts, and management. Very understanding company for the most part. However I left the job as an SGA and refused to be promoted only because all of the store managers I knew hated their jobs and it was mostly because of corporate."
good,"•	Cash Balancing"
good,"Customer Service is key here. Get 'numbers'! Just another way in saying, get people buying more of your product. You dont get any benefit from it other than job security and props. Be honest to the customer no matter what."
good,"From the time you start begin the workday, its a wholesome workplace, with knowledgeable staff and a passion for the gaming community. they are very organized and the customer service is great."
good,"The sales pressure is insane with this job. You work minimal hours and are expected to get maximum results with no incentive. Minimum wage, bad hours, and management that sympathizes (sometimes.) That's what you get from Gamestop."
good,"I clock in, and work on organization of the games and merchandise around the store. I perform purchases, returns, and trade-ins with customers at the register. Co-workers are easy and fun to work with, and we are open to helping each other out. I've learned how to answer the phone at work, how to work a cash register, and how to properly greet different types of customers (according to age and how often they come into the store)."
good,"This job by far was my favorite, My coworkers along with my store manager were amazing to work with, as well as very supportive and were eager to answer any questions I had.This job taught me how to really open up to people and strike up conversations with someone I didn't know. It really brought me out of my shell and helped me to be more sociable."
good,Catering to customers specific tastes was a fun challenge. The only real issue was for the amount of work that needed to be done the amount of hours allotted per store weren't enough.
good,"Not many hours but definitely builds sales experiences, reaching sales goals, etc. The customers are very genuine. The tasks on the job are not hard at all."
good,Slow days but with good loyal customers. Work days were usually fun. Corporate instituted unnecessary policies that drove employees crazy.
good,Gamestop is a good productive workplace my job consists of starting my day breaking down product and zoning the product out to the picking zones after all is zoned out go into the zone and pick the orders for all our Gamestop stores . After all that is done we pack out make sure boxes are organized and load the trucks. Which with my co-workers is a easy process through the day we all understand teamwork and help each other out . Our supervisors are very understanding and helpful . The hardest part of my job it does take a big amount of my social life away i work 2nd shift so a lot of my life has to wrapped up into getting things done in two days on the weekend . And the funnest part of my job is being around my co-workers we make the day a lot more enjoyable .
good,"Complete normal daily routines. The company used to be more performance based. Now it is more developmental based, which could help for getting promoted or finding a new job."
good,Filing games away on the shelves and in the back room. the people you work with are nice and easy to get along with which makes work go by faster. the shifts are short and you don't get many hours tho.
good,"la giornata lavorativa viene divisa in più fasi: in mattinata si fanno tutte le varie attività riguardanti la gestione del magazzino ed esposizione del prodotto, nel pomeriggio si gestisce principalmente la clientela."
good,Gamestop can be very hectic and problematic due to the many services it is currently expanding its company into from partnering up with cricket wireless to looking through someones electronics or software they wish to trade in. Luckily I'd been fortunate and worked with many great people in this company who help ease the burden of monumental tasks and overbearing customers. Organization skills is a must to maintain a profitable and productive store.
good,Numbers mean a everything at this job. Go in work on the register and restock the walls with the cases or put up games in the cabinets.
good,"learned the PSP and PS3 game repairing things. Working with co - worker as a team was very productive, not only in a work. Learned how effective the chain system when managed and calculated for high production using same resources."
good,"A typical day involves opening the store, doing daily counts, price changes, taking in and sending out shipments, aiding customers with anything they require. We like to go out of our way, if possibly, to help our customers at this location. Customer service is what keeps us going!"
good,During my time at Gamestop it showed me a lot of responsibility and making sure tasks were done before the day ended. Co-workers and management were good to me in where they taught me a lot in how to lead others by example. This job was fun because making sales and having the competitive drive is what I like in a job.
good,"My typical day at work is basically just going into work and talking with the customers and hearing their thoughts on what games or systems they should get or buy. "
good,"Every day i ring up customers and great them and advise them games to buy. Im required to tell them the latest deals going on in the store.If i have a trade license,which i did then i do trade in.I open and closed the store. Closing pretty much was, me vacuuming, straightening the games back in alphabetical order and putting trade up on our trade wall and taking trade down for the next day.Management isnt good.I wont say it does for every gamestop but for the store i worked at it did and still does to this day.Co workers were friendly, funny and kept the day going by with jokes or game talk. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking to co workers and/or customers about games.There was no hard part for me. Maybe if you are short you might have a hard time putting up trade and that could be fairly frustrating, but we have ladders.What's bad is Gamestop is very cheap so if the store you work in has cheap ladders,draws, computers,vaccums, ESPECALLLY cheap printers, dont expect a replacement any time soon.they dont like spending money on replacements or their employees.You can get a raise once a year but they dont wanna give it to you. If you worked too long and got a high raise under a certain position they will try to find a reason to fire you. This was not my experience but the experience of those around me whom ive worked with and have seen come and go for reasons such as this. I personally know a ga=the lowest will get 7.25 an hour and a manager starts off at 8.25.. asm starts at 9 dollars. next to the store manager who will make a salary. over the years you could get a"
good,"Working at Gamestop was one of the funnest things I've ever done. I was paid to be around video games for hours on end. Helping people pick the right game or system for them was a challenge, but an enjoyable one."
good,"Arrive 45 mins early, and relax. Sometimes get asked to start early, work anywhere from 4-8 hours. Ring customers, take inventory, stock and manage walls."
good,"I usually put games in alphabetical order "
good,"The customer is the number one in this place, talking about products and games with them is the best part of working here. The environment in this place is great since, I have the best staff employees working for me. The store performance is great cause everyone is working in their potential."
good,"A typical day at Gamestop is helping customers, making bank deposits, verifying marketing, setting and reviewing goals, delegating information and duties to staff. I've recently learned how to design  marketing tactics with demographic challenges. My staff is a solid group of sales focused individuals, with great communication skills. The Hardest part of my job is helping my staff adjust to the constant change and expanding of the business. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping my customers have an enjoyable experience while shopping in my location."
good,Very fun job with flexible hours. Good job to have if attending school or etc. Great environment which enables you to meet very exciting and interesting individuals.
good,"Good, "
good,Gamestop was an awesome job. The Hardest part about the job was not having a steady manager so there was an imbalance inbetween coworkers. I learned a lot about the work of associates and how important they are to a company. An average day was not always steady but my coworkers always made the best of tough situations.
good,Fun shop with demanding goals in sales and reservations. A very organized and energetic shop with great customers! Open/closed shop as well as train associates.
good,"I loved working for Gamestop by the management was very unorganized. Every few weeks district would come in the stores and change the store's set up and rearrange everything. I loved my coworkers and the environment. I did not enjoy working inside a mall. I can work at an extremely fast pace, but big mall pace is becoming too much for me now a days."
good,"A typical day at work includes helping customers out on their gaming needs putting everything in alphabetical order and at times a type of technical support on systems and other merchandise. I've learned how to work with customers and it really helped me learn how to talk to people and sell a product that needs to be sold such as memberships. Management and my co-workers are great, they're fun to be around and keep the day from being dull. The hardest part of the job I would say are the hours, they get cut often. Enjoyable part of my job is being around all the games, the fun atmosphere, and the customers that stop by and talk to us."
good,fun work environment...got to interact with the customers a lot. Learned a lot info about games and gaming systems.
good,"Monotonous"
good,"Fun job, you meet lots of great people . But corporate will work you to the bone if your a store manager."
good,"Most days consisted of organizing the store alphabetically, and by relevance, checking in new stock and pricing old stock. Goals for sales were realistic, but the expectations for reserving new games and getting subscriptions to the customer loyalty program seemed a bit ridiculous at some points. The management varied from store to store that I worked at/visited, but many of them simply had no zeal for the job, or expressed any genuine interest in the gaming industry. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to connect with my customer base and provide a great experience, as well as help tailor a gaming experience to fit their needs."
good,"Every day it consisted of helping customers, taking in any traded games and systems, and running the register. I learned how to use a cash register and how to up sell to customers generously. Management was always there to help and give great advice when talking to customers and any time you needed help finding something they would help. The co-worker that I worked with mostly was with one of the managers but with there being three managers they were all great at doing their job well. The hardest part of the job was making sure that any traded in games and systems were working completely fine, weren't scratched or damaged. Having to tell the customer that you couldn't accept something that was too scratched put them in a bad mood, even though they assure that it works. The thing I enjoyed the most was being able to have a common interest with the co-workers and most of the customers."
good,This job offered plenty of opportunity to grow and explore different cultures but offered little room for advancement and very few hours. This is either a good high school job or a second job.
good,"It's a very fast moving company. In my time there it seemed like people were constantly being moved around, in and out, up and down. It's a fun place to work."
good,"Organizing games, helping customers find games, recomminding games for various systems and  or players. The most enjoyable part of my day is putting a smile on a customers face. Hardest part of my day is is saying no to kids."
good,"My day would involve breaking down boxes of gaming systems and organizing them so they could be moved to the tech area all of which was timed. There was also significant time spent boxing and shipping refurbished equipment."
good,i have learned how to talk to people treat poeple and to be the best custmer service agant love to help my customer
good,"it was the best but not good enough how to fix stuff I learned to work in computers   cool "
good,"•Placing outbound calls to stores for scheduling purposes, or performing installation / upgrade activities."
good,"Customer service is very important, along keeping the store cleanly and organized. Connecting with the customers and discussing video games with them is enjoyable. The hardest part was the pressure of having to sell the subscription/membership cards to the customers."
good,"There were never typical days at GameStop.  With the consumer electronic business changing so rapidly everyday was a new adventure.  But, for the most part everyday consisted of inventory counts, receiving and shipping of merchandise, stocking, payroll, development planning, scheduling, coaching, conference calls, and Sales and Customer Service management.  I lead a rather large team throughout the year ranging from 6 to some 21 employees.  In the beginning taking over a team who had just lost a supervisor was a sore spot.  But, in the long run we became the ultimate team each part working in tune with its counter parts.  The hardest part of my job was when the company was having some financial woes.  Do to this they cut hours by 45%.  Even though the traffic at our location did not slow down we were operating with less than minimal staff.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the return business.  Customers telling me how they used to dread coming into GameStop but that my team and I have made their experiences something worth returning for."
good,"Gamestop was a really fun place to work. My co-workers were friendly, professional and helped create an overall comfortable work environment."
good,The only issues I had was that it was nearly impossible to advance. There were not many positions and too many people wanting them. I loved my job and working with the people.
good,A normal day at work would consist of standing behind the counter filing games or helping customers.Then throughout the day it would consist of putting up cases and assisting customers with their questions etc.The management was good everybody communicated for the most part and knew what was going on and had the respect of co workers.The hardest part of the job was to stop working and also not being able to help customers fully due to policies etc.Enjoyable parts were being around games all day and talking to people about one of the things I'm most passionate about 
good,"Working at GameStop was a good experience overall, especially when it came to working as a team with my other co-workers. There is a good management staff there, the only thing I would have to complain about would be that they transfer people to and from different stores with very little warning. I learned a lot about telling customers the correct information that they needed to know in order to be a smart consumer and be satisfied. The best part of working there was the staff, all of my co-workers were always enjoyable to be round and made work more of a passion than a chore."
good,"For the few weeks that I worked at GameStop, I was able to experience the process of assisting customers with game purchases, as well as the details about product preorders, and how to suggest them to customers."
good,"The company is not bad to work for, but pay is on the low end and raises are only once a year and small."
good,"A typical day at work consists of managing the sales floor, greeting and providing customer service, organizing and replenishing the sales floor, and working the cash register while attempting to accomplish sales goals."
good,"I have to say I was rather shocked. As it was my first job, I expected tremendous pressure and cracking under the work I would receivce. However, this was far from the truth as I would come to find. The employees held a professional, yet friendly tone and frequently offered advice and help in the tasks brung up along the workplace."
good,"I would handle sales, stock, inbound calls, monetary transactions, and customers on a daily basis. I learned how to sale different types of video game consoles, video games, some electronics, and gaming accessories. Hardest part would have to be not always understanding certain video games or the consoles. Most enjoyable was making the customers happy."
good,"Same fortune retail company feel as anywhere else. Gamestop did a very good job of learning a way to utilize gaming to grow and it works like a charm. Stick with the position, constantly go above and beyond and you will be sure to go somewhere in the company."
good,"GameStop is a fun, hard-working, extremely fast paced environment that asks for you to give your 110% dedication. I've learned how to proficiently manage a very busy and demanding retail business and stand behind the company while still trying my best to make each and every customer happy. I love the opportunity to develop a positive and close relationship with a good portion of my customer base."
good,"L'ambiente lavorativo molto bello, il lavoro al contatto con il pubblico mi piace molto, purtroppo avevano bisogno di me sono per il periodo natalizio. Quello che ho imparato oltre a conoscere meglio il mondo dei videogiochi è aver miglior contatto umano con i clienti."
good,"Because this was my first time working at Gamestop (I had worked Media Sales at Best Buy prior), I was somewhat familiar with what to expect but still a bit surprised on occasion. In particular, though I enjoyed the opportunity to provide sales and customer service solely based on the gaming industry (one I'd grown passionate about), I was a bit surprised and saddened to suddenly be left unemployed at the end of the Christmas Season. I'd come from Best Buy's environment where they often keep employees based on performance despite their status as a seasonal hire, and to see that expectation completely crushed was a bit of a jolt. Nevertheless, it taught me a valuable lesson, and my time there was adequate enough to give them a positive review. Though my duties were primarily focused on providing sales and customer service, I took the extra time to build relationships with customers in the hopes that they would become repeat customers. There wasn't too much to complain about other than the inconsistency of the hours given and the lower pay, but I wish I'd been given a greater chance to grow within the company."
good,"Gamestop is a job like anything else is; however, if you enjoy discussing video game ideas, technology, etc. with customers, it is very interesting and delightful to work there."
good,"GameStop is a cool company to work for, who does not want to be in a store full of video games, co-workers are fun they are like family. The hardest part of the job is getting customers to reserve the next upcoming games, you have to be very good at persuading to get the most reserves. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to fool around like friends , but at the same time keeping it very professional with customers. The downside is the company puts more attention to number and stats of all the employees instead of providing more utensils such as faster computers, new vacuums, and better cleaning supplies to keep the workplace clean."
good,"Gamestop is a fun job where you meet a lot of new people and get to preview new games. A job for beginners in the workforce but it is not a job you can rely on to support a family. Although there is room for advancement, the pay rate is very low."
good,Game stop if a fun and caring place to work. Managment is friendly and work is fun.
good,"It was a decent job. Not something you can really live off of but as an ""extra money"" type job it'd be good for. I worked seasonal so I had a decent amount of hours, but after that I had little to none. The people there were pretty great."
good,"We focus on customers and meeting goals. There is great communication between management and associates. Management takes care of opening and closing the store, shipment, and floorsets. associates aid in customer service and maintaining the look of the store. This place has an awesome work environment"
good,"Work involves mostly working register and filing games, and at higher positions you get into inventory and conference calls. The best skill to be learned over the course of the job is the same as any retail position, dealing with people. The others you work with tend to have the same or similar interests that you do, you would really have to go out of your way to not make friends in this company."
good,"The pay is minimal and the sales expectations are high for a small boutique-style store. The competition puts pressure on employees with required sales pressure of their paid members card and magazine subscription, as well as game reserves. The discount on products is very minimal and the hours are often unreliable and greatly reduced in the slow season."
good,"I was entrusted with opening and closing procedures, while managing several other employees, and conducting daily procedures including servicing customers and maintaining store stock. I learned a lot of management level procedures and obtained a high level of responsibility through hard work and determination. My co-workers were a great part of the experience and a fine-tuned team with all objectives in mind. the hardest part of the job was managing the multitudes of people for midnight releases but also the most enjoyable, because it allowed for opportunity for creativity. I was able to introduce innovative new ways to keep customers happy while waiting in line, and was able to produce a personal first name basis with the majority of regular customers"
good,Gamestop is a great place to work I have experienced many ways to communicate and manage different parts of the work place also how to give unbuyist reviews about videogames. Also to go that extra step to make my client happy
good,"While the average customer thinks of working at Gamestop as sitting around playing video games all day, that's hardly the case. It's retail in a small store environment, with everything that entails: cash handling, solo shifts, and processing shipment, all while keeping sales numbers up. While developing one's own taste in gaming can be helpful, more important is getting a feel for the general preferences of your customer base. It beats flipping burgers, and is a solid foundation on which to learn and hone a wide variety of organizational and customer service skills. The payscale is a bit low, but it's a low-margin business, so it's fair."
good,"Good hours and decent pay, but the customers and management could turn your day upside down quickly. Rude people and no advancement opportunities ever. They only hire from outside the company."
good,"Open the store if i worked the morning shift, greet customers, answer questions about the current video game. Answer phones."
good,If you are a gamer and need a nice part time job then this is the place for you. You get discounts on video games and what else do you need besides a check every other week.
good,They make you feel like if you don't meet the current demand your job its at risk you can have 9 years working here because seniority means nothing to them and they will let you go without hesitation or hire temps who will do the same or more work for the minimum all this just to meet their numbers
good,I feel blessed that I had the opportunity to work at Bancario because it gave the experience and knowledge for delivering an great costumer service and to be able handle difficult situations.
good,"management will work with you. decent shift times, pay is ok for a young adult."
good,"I have enjoyed working with this company. I feel they try to be as fair as possible, however I do feel they forget that demographics play a role, and an important one, in some of the expectations they have. As most corporations do, they want everything done with almost too much detail, and never want to invest the hours for it."
good,Over all a decent place to work. Generally very flexible for schedules that vary.  A very diverse workplace. And generally a fun environment to be in with other gamers.
good,It was overall a great job due to me loving video games and location wasn't to bad. Hours I could use a little more but was still good. Co-workers were great in both company and help.
good,"All in all, I’ve loved working there for the most part...but it is customer service and that’s not always a fun time but I don’t regret choosing this place as my job for my college life."
good,It goes without saying that the team you have can make all the difference and its no different here. Gamestop was an amazing place for me to work and develop but only because my team was well developed and felt like a family. This varies with every store though and you may not always end up in this same environment.
good,"People often mistake working at GameStop as simply ""Oh, I play games, so I can definitely work at GameStop!"""
good,"If you're into pop culture at all, Gamestop will make a great entry job for those looking to get into retail. Especially, if its motivated by a love for video games. There are seasonal and guest associate positions that require less from you that'll give you the space and perspective needed to grow in that specific field."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of going into the crammed up back room to grab an item or system that was needed and tripping over a cardboard box on the way there. It was also lots and lots of alphabetizing the games; but we can't forget the best part-- the customers. If you enjoy video games you'll really enjoy the people that come into GameStop. At GameStop I learned how to communicate better when I felt something was wrong. I also learned how to become a little better at sales. The management I had was lovely, very helpful and kind. My workplace culture was personally not the best but I feel like that's only because of the coworkers I had at my location. The hardest part about this job was not getting many hours and not being taught everything I needed to know from the beginning. The most enjoyable part of this job was the customers and the cool benefits you can get as an employee."
good,"Gamestop has its ups and downs. Most of the time its really simple each day to function and get tasks done. A lot of the time all you really need to do is focus on the guests and then if you dont have any in the store then do your tasks. Sundays are in my opinion the bain of all days. You have what feels like 50 tasks to do and no time to do it. The moto is ""From 12-6 focus guests; No tasks while guests are in the store."" Mind you the store is only open from 11-6 and most of the tasks are to be done after close. You have to maintain hours for the week as to not go over payroll. You have to get the tasks done so that the sales merchandise is displayed for the week. There is no leeway for doing most these tasks unless you do the tasks while guess are looking or going. But all in all its not a terrible place to work."
good,"Gamestop is about inclusion and diversity. A laid back dress code, allowing people to be themselves and still represent three company in a positive work space"
good,Gamestop distribution is a good job to work with there is alot of over time to make around the holidays if u willing to work....the people is friendly
good,"People will mostly be asking questions about specific items or looking for a suggestion for the person they are buying for. Not that much foot traffic during normal days, but holidays are very active, with the store having to have a line outside."
good,"I had an amazing work crew at my job. It was positive, and welcoming. Unfortunately the opportunity to make money was not there due to the lack of payroll and hours resulting in me making pocket change."
good,The pay wasn't the best but it was one of my first jobs and I quickly moved up to a manager position. All my coworkers were great to work with and we all got along great. Still friends with many of my former colleagues!
good,"I genuinely enjoyed working here but if your management isn’t good then you’ll probably hate it. A little pushy on sales, but that’s how they make their money so I can’t completely fault them."
good,This was a decent job. Never had any problems well working there. The management was very relaxed which made the work environment less stressful. Good for people who know there games
good,"Great coworkers."
good,"The job is not at all difficult, You just make sure everything is stocked properly and in order. I love interacting with the customers. The only real issue is that some of the other employees lack customer service skills and are a bit rude at times."
good,"A typical day at work for me(currently) is sign in, placing display game cases on to the shelves. Then put new and preowned games with CDs into the drawer. Then I organize the games on shelves in alphabetical order to make sure it is good for display."
good,Before working at GameStop I was extremely shy and very nervous of working with people but thanks to this job experience I am much more confident about my future interviews.
good,"Gamestop is a really good place to work at for a starting out job, they offer a very flexible schedule and they help you Interact with customers better"
good,"My Day starts at 4a.m. I get there so I and have a decent parking spot on the street Because the lot is for tenured gamestop employees. The shift starts at 6, I go on grab the things i need to check and clean the retro consoles or I'm assisgned the the support team that day and help them with inventory until 2:15 comes and it time to clock out"
good,"I genuinely enjoy working for GameStop. I have an amazing team of co-workers and one of the best managers I've ever worked under. As with any job there are good days and bad days but that's to be expected. My only real complaint is the compensation. Even with a company wide raise in base pay it's still not livable in lower positions of the company (GA, SGA level). This is made worse by the nature of a retail environment in which your hours are not guaranteed. It's a great side job and probably a good job if you can manage to make it to the ASL, SL, and above positions."
good,"The management and team at GameStop work hard to make sure that there's a healthy workplace environment. It makes it fun to work there. The only hard part of the job is always going to be the customers, you never know what's going to come through that door. But overall GameStop is a pretty great place to work."
good,"Geile Mitarbeiter"
good,"easy going, fast paced environment most of the time. hours vary on your job title. The employees are easy and fun to work with. The location is easy to commute to."
good,"I have been working at gamestop for years straight and I Love my job because of 4 reasons its Fun and easy , My staff is amazing , I love video games, and the people that interact with is just so funny its like a stage production."
good,Great job while in college but the pay is low. The job is easy and not that hard of a job in general but it is very hard to live off of the pay you receive.
good,I’ve worked seasonally at gamestop cod around 3-4 months. It was an ok job and helped me with my customer service skills and helped me break outta my shell.
good,"Ho lavorato in uno store Gamestop per due mesi circa, durante il periodo di Natale. Mi hanno assunto con un contratto a somministrazione come rinforzo durante le festività. L'esperienza è stata nel complesso positiva. Nel mio store lavoravano due ragazzi, i quali si alternavano nei turni, anche se avvolte erano entrambi presenti. Uno di loro ha il ruolo di sponsabile del negozio, il quale gestisce i turni e le attività. Ho avuto uno splendido rapporto con loro ed entrambi sono risultati molto cordiali e corretti. "
good,"Depending on the seasons there were changes in the pace of business. During holiday's especially Thanksgiving-Christmas was typically fast-paced which could get stressful, but was always manageable. During the Spring-Summer periods the amount of business was generally slower pace due to the lack of interest from the influencing gaming industry."
good,Game stop is an amazing job they made me feel comfortable. When I first went in I knew nothing about games. Since then I have learned more than I ever knew about games and how to effectively get work done while having fun.
good,"Gamestop provides a culture where if taken seriously is very rewarding, if not take seriously is a day to day grind. The mentality of the employee, whether he or she wants to succeed or just to ride the clock, determines his or her suceess or failure in the company."
good,"Customer service, shelving cases, receiving shipments, RSB's, Seeing the newest games, pops, figures. talking to customers about introducing games to family."
good,"it is a good place to work , i have a lot of fun made a lot of friends my coworkers where the best always support each other my boss was very organized and always teach us how to complete our goals for the day and week."
good,"Not a bad place to work for. They are in a transitional phase so work is spotty at the moment. The people there are super nice and you are able to communicate with management. Pay is okay, I think it could be better. There is room for advancement as long as you work hard and learn all that you can. Benefits are pretty good."
good,"Overall its a great place to start retail, the environment is great and so are the employees. I've worked a lot of different locations and didn't have a problem with any of my managers."
good,"This job should only be considered a part-time position. It is a ton of fun, but the pay is garbage and there is little to no room for improvement for advancing. The hours are super flexible, but good luck with getting more than 10hrs a week consistently."
good,"An average day at GameStop is usually really good. The people I work with are really nice, and professional at their jobs. Whenever I need help from my higher ups, I never have to beg for their help, they're always right there and ready for whenever I need them."
good,"La giornata lavorativa in Gamestop, da store manager, inizia la mattina presto e termina la sera tardi. Devi far fronte a parecchie problematiche e altrettante attività da svolgere in store. Lavorando in Gamestop impari a relazionarti con le persone, a lavorare in gruppo, a trovare sempre una soluzione a qualsiasi tipo di problematica, a gestire un magazzino, la merce che arriva e gli ordini."
good,"ottima relazione con i clienti, perfetto per chi vuole imparare a vendere"
good,"Gamestop is a very relaxing environment to work. You learn how to sell things through promotions and advertisements which is thrilling. You don't have to go to work in a suit and tie, which helps relax a lot."
good,"I have  learned how to work  under pressure ."
good,"I liked it a lot, get paid o talk and play video games, easy job, some customers can be a pain, but that is all retail. video games and of course the discaounts."
good,GameStop is not only a great company to work for but it is any game lovers dream.  You get the opportunity to work first hand with other gamers and associate with customers with the same needs.
good,When you have or work with a great team from my experience it can be a great place to work. The interaction with your fellow co workers as well as the customers makes it pretty easy to build a rapport and that by itself makes the job a lot easier.
good,"The employees are all gamers that get along fairly we4ll despite some different opinions on game systems. The manager is very friendly and understanding of personal life. The downfall to the job is you may have to work closing shifts that can go to 10 pm at night. It's hard if you have children, but they try to accommodate."
good,"There's always something to do and people to talk to. May not always get to just be about games but I still get to be enthusiastic about upcoming releases and put that towards my sales habits. It can be stressful at times but it's not hard work, just tedious"
good,"I was fortunate to have a boss that was straightforward and no BS, easy to work with so long as you were being reasonable. Many of my employees are easy to get along with and I don't hate going into work."
good,"Its retail. You cater to the customers, nothing more nothing less. Daily tasking requires you to be flexible with time management. Work goals are attainable."
good,"Nothing too big to write home about. Company is nice, manager is nice. I've heard the horror stories but luckily, none of that has happened to us. The company pushes you to get sales, even if it seems impossible, but that is how our paychecks are made at least. Customers are nice as well, although some come in without a clue on what is going on. Certain policies concerning the refund system is a bit outdated, but understandable at the same time, considering that a new product should be returned as a new, unopened product to be resold as a new, unopened product. Only real gripes would be that, since a lot of customers would come in trying to refund a new item and there isn't much power we have over it. Oh well, other then that, the company itself is actually pretty nice."
good,I enjoyed working here. But don't expect it to be just about video games. Its a work environment not a collectors store. But would recommend to any gamer to try at least once.
good,"Work at GameStop was very casual and enjoyable, although with unpredictability of customers workers often found themselves with nothing to do. I learned a lot about how to run a register, handle phone calls, angry customers and how to make cash drops. Management was excellent and relatable to any crowd young or old. Daily workplace was very relaxed, talkative and daily goal oriented. Hardest part of job was keeping customers happy. Most enjoyable part of job was talking to customers about their gaming experiences."
good,"It's a fun job, and typically it was a pretty easy going job being there for eight years there really wasn't much troubles.  I learned to be a role model to my peers and a better leader in the position.  Being able to talk to different people everyday allowed me to approach our guest differently in every interaction.  Sometimes there was hardships being able to please most of our guest with some problems.  Other than that the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to further my career and make friends both co-workers, and our guests."
good,"As a young adult i couldn't have asked for a more fun job, working in the bay area, getting to talk and play video games as well as meet many people in the games and tech industry"
good,"I loved working at GameStop as I am a huge nerd, the only drawback was that there were never enough hours to go around for everyone. Even after being promoted to an SGA (Senior Game Advisor) position, I still didn't get more than 25-30 hours a week on average."
good,"A typical work day at Gamestop looks like this:"
good,"You get to talk about video games all day, except during holiday season you can check out games to play at home. As store manager you go to a yearly conference to learn about games coming out for the holidays and any new accessories as well, plus some games that will be coming out next year and best of all the vendors give you all kinds of free stuff including games and even consoles."
good,"If you ""game"" its the place to work. It will grow your knowledge of games. It gives you an understanding for how the market works. The best part of the job is the culture. That can range store to store."
good,"The entry level of this position is a Game Adviser which is fairly easy. It is all about learning and getting your feet wet with company values and methods. If you say you are ""bored"" in this position, you're not doing everything you can to keep yourself busy. "
good,"If you love games and retail, this is the place for you. I loved my time at Gamestop, if only for the employee discount. I met some great people and learned a lot about the gaming industry."
good,"Ambiente lavorativo abbastanza impegnativo, ma sempre stimolante!"
good,"Working at Gamestop was the best introduction to retail life. My manager was kind, my hours were reasonable, and I had the chance to engage other people who shared my passion with gaming. I always made sure to do my best during work hours and provide customers with an enjoyable experience. I only wish I had the chance to learn more despite being a student worker at the time."
good,This was a great place to start my work career. It was challenging but always rewarding doing something I love to do. Sometimes I wish I never left the place
good,"Most people look down on Gamestop as an evil company, mostly because of the trade values, and how employees are expected to get great numbers. I enjoyed my experience. It was a great environment, I was able to manage my store without feeling like I was under a microscope. The holiday season always brought great stress, but thats any retailer during that period. Being able to work in an environment that I knew a great deal about, and help guests who had no clue, that was very enjoyable."
good,"A good place to work and experience front line retail management.  A great way to learn and adapt to new challenges.  A great way to stay ""in the know"" with the industry and receive nice bonuses too."
good,The environment at GameStop is quite fast paced so you will usually find yourself busy stocking and organizing or getting to help a guest find the best product that suits them.
good,I really loved working here. I loved talking to people about video games. I got to relate to a lot of people and was able to contribute a lot during my time there. the people there were awesome and I love coming back there.
good,"Laid back, fun place to work, great people to work with and the manager is easy to get along with. The manager makes sure that you are trained and cares about your well being"
good,"Working at GameStop is fun with the right people and as long as everyone is doing their part. Customers can be unruly, but that's Retail Life. The type of work is tedious and deserves more than $7.50/hr, but again its retail, don't have high expectations. Corporate is running the company into the ground and driving away customers as well as employees."
good,"Mostly part time. This isn't a forever job, they don't pay well and well, its retail. They let you borrow the games which is probably the best part of the job."
good,Start off getting the invoice for the orders. Grab a hand held scanner and log out products to fill orders. Move down the line print out a bar code label to ship box.
good,had fun on the job talking about video games and helping customers was great. the competition was also nice. workplace is very relaxed and calm. most annoying thing is there is one video that loops all day long.
good,Working at Game stop requires you to be on your toes at all times in order to maximize your sales approach. You have to be good with people and at least have some knowledge about video games to keep customers invested in the store. When in doubt do your research and always smile and you will do fine.
good,I had great management while working for Gamestop. I learned a lot about the customer service and sales aspect of being employed by Gamestop. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to talk with others about what i enjoy the most which is games.
good,"Working at GameStop was a good experience. On an average day, I would help customers find games and make sure they were getting the right game for their needs. I left due to medical issues, but I would return given the opportunity."
good,From the moment you open the doors the customer service experience begins. Its fun and enjoyable to work at Gamestop. Its rewarding because there is a ton of opportunity to move up. The hardest part of the job is the amount of turnover that happens on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing people grow into better positions in a short amount of time. Being able to make a difference with someones life with a  passion around gaming.
good,"I worked with game stop for 10 years and never had a problem with other coworkers and managers, we always had fun and the work day always flew by, customers always good attitude do to great customer care."
good,"Gamestop was a great place to work... in the beginning. As the company pushes it's ""Cut-Throat"" agenda, it becomes a headache. Never hitting your target numbers can have lasting consequences for hourly employees..."
good,"It's a fun workplace but has little hours to offer anyone who is not management. Unless it is Christmas time, you will work once a week. It's unfortunate."
good,Easy-going atmosphere. Encourage relationships development with customers to help sales numbers. Management was knowledgeable and nice to work with; coworkers and culture make for enjoyable shifts.
good,From helping guests to organizing games you can find yourself meeting some of the most interesting people with a common passion while getting paid to do so.
good,"Working for game stop is no what you would expect, but it is rewarding and fun. I wouldn't say that the retail route is the way to a career, but, especially for a job during college it was great!"
good,"As a store manager I worked very hard and missed out on a lot of family get togethers especially holidays.  It is expected though since it is retail and Christmas is a very busy time of the year.  I did gain a lot of experience and they provided tools for me to learn more about the business end of things including profit and loss reports that I was trained to read accurately.  The people I worked with over the years have been great and I never had an issue with anyone of them.  The hardest part is the hours vary week to week sometimes and it doesn't pay that well for the amount that you are putting in.  The most enjoyable part of the job was taking care of people and the fact that you talk about video games most of your day.  I really enjoyed working there, but as I am getting older and trying to build a family I cannot do this schedule anymore.  I need something a bit more stable that pays better.  Great job though and had a lot of fun."
good,Helping customers with their gaming needs that includes not only the games themselves but also systems and accessories. A knowledge of gaming is highly recommended in order to succeed.
good,While I love my job at GameStop it is very hard to balance a personal life being a store manager. Retail has a very high turnover rate so the constant need to train staff can be over whelming.
good,"I work with a excellent team, well diverse in the understanding of customer service and knowledge of the workplace. The pace is steady, laid back, and relaxed."
good,"A typical day at work was going to work sweeping the floors,stacking and making sure all the video games and other items are on the right shelf's."
good,"Very fun healthy workplace, I learned about games and consoles Management was always great they made me feel right at home from the beginning. The thing I enjoyed most about the job was not only was I free to be myself with customers, I got to meet all types of people with the same interests."
good,"working at GameStop is contingent on one things, who you work with. if everyone works as a team and are all friendly like family, it'll be the best and most fun job you have... just keep in mind that it is first and foremost a job, customer interactions (good and bad), general cleaning, stocking, organizing, with a big emphasis on sales and numbers."
good,"The job was only busy on special days like new game release, holidays, sales, etc. Very slow paced but keeps you busy with work. The management is very understanding and relate-able. The only hard part of the job is that you have to be able to be on your feet for your entire shift. Very good culture and fun."
good,"You're most definitely not going to find a better job than this in the video game retail space, just be sure to realize that it's definitely a sales job."
good,It was a good place to start out and get a feel for the working world. Challenging but also rewarding all at the same time. Would recommend it for anyone who needs a first job.
good,"If you're a gamer, it is obviously more fun to work at GameStop, discounts, new releases, etc. Extremely busy on holidays, but if you have a great team thats a plus."
good,"Would have liked more hours, more clear management, and more opportunities to improve. "
good,"Game stop is a fun place to work at as a side job, but if you're looking for a main job to support your life, you'll need to become a manager of some type. but I would highly recommend Game Stop to any and everyone."
good,I enjoyed working here at lot. It was once of the jobs I wanted to have since I was little kid so it was a dream come true in a way! It felt strange being hired on as the lowest position in the store but I was offered a promotion pretty early on so it was all good.
good,This is a really good job to obtain experience. The only thing that I did not like about the company is that since their motto is customer first the forget about the employees.
good,"It's a good starting job for someone who wants to get their foot in the door. good starting hours, teaches you how to work in all kinds of enviornments"
good,It was alright I was a winter seasonal in a mall GameStop so my experience is skewed. I worked like 8 hours a week and the people were cool. Super busy during Black Friday. I liked my coworkers and my manager was extremely nice and understanding of my college schedule.
good,"You get in, have a meeting about the day and prior. You stretch out, and do your job. Depending on the department you can be asked to go help another department out. The thing I love the best from working there was how strongly team oriented tasks were focused. It helps make friends faster and feel comfortable sooner."
good,Working here was alright.  The job really helped me improve my communication skills.  The staff was friendly and was always willing to lend a helping hand
good,I love working at Gamestop because I definitely feel like I belong here. All of us coworkers are like family. Management is wonderful and work hours are flexible here. My only complaint is that the hourly wage is quiet low unless this is your first job.
good,"I worked at gamestop to acquire spending money and have a job. I was not a good fit for the job at the time, my personal life was a mess so I wasn't ideal but I enjoyed my work while I was there. The people were fun, assisting customers wasn't typically too difficult, and I learned my love of cleaning and organization."
good,A typical day a work includes starting my day by checking-in with my supervisor and getting my position and seat assignment. Once there I would get call from customer that had questions and concerns about their experiences at Gamestop locations in United States and Canada or about ordering games and related materials from the Gamestop online web shop.  The atmosphere was very conducive to growth and management was very direct and hands-on with employees.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the quotas set for calls per shift because I received many calls that needed management assistance or extra details needed with the order process.  I learned a lot about customer service and was able to get a great feel for the gaming industry.  I liked the relationships I made with the staff outside of the workplace and because of the incentive and social functions that were given  to employees for exceptional service and performance I was able to meet and befriend many stall members outside of my field in the company.  I enjoyed almost every aspect of my employment at Gamestop's customer service center and I would suggest it as a great jog for anybody looking for a customer service position in the Arlington/Grand Prairie
good,"Gamestop was a great place to work especially for video game fanatics that find joy in helping customers get what they want. Management was strict on the daily tasks and goals but relaxed in helping their staff achieve those goals. The hardest part of the job was reaching your weekly goal for sales, especially if the store was having a slow period (no big releases, etc.). The most enjoyable part of working there was being surrounded by popular video game and movie characters/products all the time. It was a very relaxing environment."
good,In my time working at GameStop was a blast.  I was a keyholder so i was able to open and close the store.  I am a big gamer so i loved working there was able to talk to others about games we were all looking forward to coming out.
good,"I loved my time at Gamestop. As an avid gamer, this place is heaven for me. I really loved getting to take home and try new games. Being able to help customers find games they would love gave me a great feeling."
good,"I worked for Gamestop over a long period of time as holiday help, and it's was the best job I had, but the pay was not great.  I met a lot of great people and learned so much."
good,The people at Gamestop do very much care about the work that they do but the pay is lacking. You do far more work than what you get paid but if you enjoy the environment their it can be worth it
good,"All in all, it's not a bad place to be. I work at a mall location, so traffic is relatively slow outside of the weekends. The customers that come in and out are nice, and show up often enough that we've developed friendships. The goals the company and my manager set every day keep things tense to a certain degree,  as it makes sure that we work to maximize every interaction with the customers (even if we don't see very many throughout the day). The other employees are extremely friendly, and we work to support each other and help us reach our goals if one of us is lagging behind. While I've heard horror stories of working at Gamestop, I can say that at least I've never been through anything terrible."
good,"I only worked for GameStop for a short time as I was seasonal, but I had a blast during that time. I was able to step out of my comfort zone and really engage with people and help others out with the information that I had. I am saddened that My time working with them is up, but I am super grateful that I was given a job with them and I look forward to working with them again!"
good,"A typical day working at GameStop isn't too slow, nor too busy. There is a healthy balance of caring for guests, organizing games, and sorting collectibles. Unfortunately, there is not much I can say about management, except that I never personally worked with my boss more than a handful of times, due to the hours (or lack thereof) provided for me. I can say that he was swell person, but have nothing to say about him as a manager. The workplace culture might be hard on someone who has a hard time meeting weekly sales goals, namely selling the right amount of membership cards and pre-orders. The hardest part of the job is working holiday rushes, while the most enjoyable part of the job is working with the like-minded people and customers/guests."
good,"The job is very dependent on you selling game warranties and pre-orders and things along those lines. If you don't sell enough, they eventually dwindle down your hours until you don't really have any. Fun place for younger people, though.`"
good,this job was fantastic the company itself is supportive of all lifestyles and encourages associates to look out for each other. The small team makes it feel like a family. However the up-selling is the pushiest I have ever experienced and the pay is way too low.
good,Good relaxed job with nice people to work with and decent starting hours it gets hectic around christmas time and midnight releases but thats about it
good,"A typical work day would be interacting the customers, sales, restocking inventory, cleaning crew."
good,"Seasonal work mainly deals with being on the floor and assisting customers."
good,easy day at work with great employers. i was utilized by every GameStop in the area that i worked allowing for mass recognition and have the capability of moving up at any point.
good,"Trabaje todo un año en esta tienda de juegos electrónicos. A pesar que este trabajo no tenía nada relacionado con fotografía y arte, aprendí mucho en cómo tratar, escuchar y asistir al cliente. Fui seleccionada como la mejor Servicio al cliente en toda la Florida basado en las reseñas que dejaban los clientes."
good,"I truly do love my job, as both a gamer and a young adult trying to get into the workplace. My shifts are short and sweet, I'm enthusiastic about our products, my co-workers are great, and even working the floor is a breeze since customers generally know what they want from us. I couldn't ask for a better entry-level job."
good,When I started working there it was like walking into a room with family. We all knew each other and helped one another to complete our goals. The experience is one I will cherish and enjoyed very much being an employee there.
good,"I actually enjoyed this job, I didn't like the safety issues that occurred in the less fortunate area and lack of equal care to those areas but other than that the job was good"
good,"This job has been a lot of fun and I don't intend to leave any time soon. Even if I stay at a part time I enjoy the people, atmosphere, and clients. Pay could be a bit more but there is plenty of room for advancement in the company and throughout the stores."
good,A typical work day would include managing inventory that came in while up selling customers and preventing shrink. Some customers make you cringe some make you so excited when they come in its like your not even working
good,I love the workers but the pay and hrs are never enough. the times you work are flexible and sometimes they may call yu for more hrs or on other days they may tell you they are over and have to cut some
good,Management was flexible with my work schedule so I could further my education as a HVAC Technician. When I started as a game advisor I was able to move forward to third key manager
good,"Over the course of 2 years working with this company, I can safely say that it has it's up's and down's."
good,Gamestop is a great company for those in school that need a flexible work schedule.  They really teach you about how the business works and how it drives sales so you get a good understanding of how the business model works.  The downside is the amount of hours that you get if you are not management but overall a good company to work for if you love video games.
good,If you enjoy video games and the culture that comes with it this is the place for you to work. I loved working for this company because I was passionate about the products. This is a fun laid back job where as long as you do your work everything is good.
good,"I was accepted for the position of a seasonal sales associate, and in my time there it was stressful. I had to stand around the majority of the day, which was painful, and my job was to organize the shelves and assist customers. now I love video games so seeing as how I got discounts and got to work in a place I love it was worth the tasks."
good,Fun place. I  get to talk about games with my coworkers and guests who come into the store. I am very passionate about games so it's always a fun time to be at work.
good,"Like any employer, Gamestop has flaws, but I would rather work here than in any other retail job. There's usually a very positive atmosphere, and you learn a lot of skills that can easily be transferred to other jobs. It definitely has it's ups and downs, but in the end you're a retail associate who gets paid to chat with guests about video games and the like, while having to meet a relatively relaxed individual sales goal."
good,Gamestop was an environment that allowed me to connect with customers everyday. Each day brought in different customer with different questions and problems. The Manager at the moment was very professional and caring.
good,It was a fun environment and had numerous fun opportunities. From ranging working midnight releases and having fun with my customers to working with my co-workers who i got along with.
good,"As long as you only focus on the going on at store level and you have a great team, it's a great place to work. The problem comes from corporate pushing things down the line that stress everyone out. It's fun to talk about games all day but there is more to this job than that."
good,"I'd have enjoyed my time at GameStop much more if it weren't for the preorder/rewards card quotas. I have nothing against anyone who can pressure sell, but it's not something I feel comfortable with. That aside, it was a decent place to work, and didn't come with as many of the negative customer interactions typically attributed to retail work."
good,gamestop has some of the most amazing people i have met in a long time. the management is very willing to discuss hours and which shifts you can do. i would love to work there again.
good,I really liked gamestop cuz they were super nice to work with and i learned so much there. I learned to become confident  in my self and  how to mange my time. Also i learned so leader ship things as well.
good,Gamestop is a great place to work at and has a great work atmosphere. The team that I work together with make me feel like I am home and we all work to a common goal while also being semi-competitive to keep each other on our toes.
good,"I worked at Gamestop for 4 years, and I must say that it was a great 4 years. The team that I worked with, was very innovative and supportive, in addition to being a team that had great synergy. The store manager was very laid back and understanding, and the employees we had were excellent and diligent in their work ethic."
good,"As a Key holder of a GameStop, a typical day is usually packed with projects. We had to reset marketing on prescribed days, manage inventory (such as counts and shipments, displays, organization, etc.), keep up with the weekly focus (be it a game or a sale or what not). There was never a moment when there wasn't something I should be doing. On top of all of that, we managed our guests and provided  them personal experiences, recommending games or accessories when needed, advising on different consoles, and resolving issues with products. "
good,I didn't work at Gamestop long enough to build a detailed impression of it. That being said the time i did spend employed there was extremely fun and rewarding. The management is easy going and easy to talk to.
good,"Fun day with fellow employees, but pay is absurdly low. Shift is spent mostly cleaning and chatting with customers and having fun with fellow workers."
good,"My store manager was one of the best I've ever had the pleasure of working with.  Biggest complaint was the sheer number of things we had to upsell.  Basic powerup memberships, Pro powerup memberships, pre-owned, GPGs, extended warrantees, strategy guides, DLC, pre-orders, collector's edition, Gamestop credit card, etc, etc."
good,Started each day making sure that the racks were organized while helping out potential clients that walked into the store with advice that suited their needs. Hardest part of the job was to maintain organization from customers who didn't return items to their place. Creating bonds with frequent and new customers as well as coworkers let the environment be a pleasant place to work.
good,"As a gamer, being taken on at GameStop was very exciting. Working there was enjoyable; a nice atmosphere, interesting and friendly coworkers, and especially the benefits of discounts and deals on games, et cetera. Aside from that, it was standard retail."
good,"Work is enjoyable, with a friendly staff and constant guests to interact with. culture is very company oriented. Management is nice and there is room for flexibility."
good,"I had fun working there, but if you want job security its not the place for you. You get a great discount for working there and the managers are cool,"
good,"Working at gamestop is like answering questions for people who dont know anything about video games, if you your self dont know anything about video games you will learn a lot about them. And your shift will consist of alphabetizing video games, fixing the store, and ringing up people. Your day does go by fast when you enjoy it and like video games. Management is great, they are very friendly, and know alot about business. They stay very connected and help each other out with any questions that they have."
good,"Overall, an amazing experience for me. Hard work was rewarded and recognized. Interacted with all walks of life and the prevailing subject was video games and video game accessories. Whats not to like?"
good,"A typical day at work as a key holder consisted of Opening and Closing the store, prepping adds, counting cash & meeting new people as well as wringing them out. I learned how to do Scheduling here as well as proper management skills and more! The Workplace Culture is great depending on which store you work in. The hardest part of the job I would have to say is the Constant Organization & Tagging of everything but that's expected. The most enjoyable part is playing new games and enjoying yourself when working with new clients and customers."
good,i loved working here but sometimes the load was too much and the hours werent very good. My coworkers were very kind and my store leader was excellent. the hardest part of the job was maintaining numbers.
good,"The job is fun and the co-workers are helpful and supportive.  The environment is what you would expect for a retail employer.  The hours available are not enough to support yourself,"
good,"Usually, you will be helping customers and getting your numbers met. In down time you are filing games and put cases back on the wall. I have learned that you must be outgoing to be able to talk to customers in a confident way. Friendly environment the ability to meet new people and friends."
good,Great place to work.  great benefits. chance to visit different locations. and always give excellent customer service.  Everyday life in gamestop is different someday are slower than others but it was an awesome place to inform cus tomes of the latest and greatest games
good,Game stop was a fun place to work coming in contact with all sorts of friendly people and helping people to know what's games are good and not and really being able to laugh and talk to customer
good,"This is a great job to start with, and start building your future. It has taught me a lot about patience and management. The hardest part is the income, with a better income, this job would be amazing."
good,"Sempre sotto pressione, bisogna dare sempre il massimo, vieni costantemente spronato a dare il meglio di te, però se sbagli o sgarri vieni (giustamente) ripreso."
good,"I would go back in a heartbeat right now, except for the low pay and no health care.  But I really enjoyed my time.  Lots of learning opportunities, wanted to advance people and get them into management.  Truly a great place to work, especially for someone starting out in the job world."
good,It was a fun place to work and I liked working with the other employees.  Only real flaws that I had was that pay was low even when learning higher pay job points and that advancement was given to friends more than workers WHEN I was there.
good,"Great for any lover of video games and nerdy collectibles! If you are familiar with the product this job comes naturally, you get to talk about games with gamers. It's very rewarding to suggest a game to someone and have them come back to you for more!"
good,I really enjoyed my time with Gamestop. I came on as apart of the holiday rush and stayed on past that. Work days went really quick and the coworkers I had were great and some became long time friends.
good,Customers really appreciated the help put in by all the staff to help them effectively find what they were looking for.The most helpful thing I learned from Gamestop was how to upsale items.
good,"Great and fun environment to work in. The job is always fun and exciting but the pay isn't good at all. You start off at minimum wage and only get a raise at most twice a year, but only by a few cents. Worked there fir two years. Started off at $7.25 and left at $8."
good,"Gamestop was a fantastic place to work at. The management was very easy going and taught me quite abit on the computer and with customer service. I'm not much of a gamer myself, but I was able to easily sell and trade games and my customers left satisfied. Unfortunately, there weren't many hours available, and the pay was low. But I got along amazingly with all of my customers. It was a light-hearted and exciting company to work for."
good,"Everything was fine, except they didn't pay enough or give enough hours, and I wasn't really patient enough to advance too high in the company."
good,Working for GameStop was enjoyable for the most part. I was able to have fun conversations with customers about different games and consoles. Was definitely stressful during the holiday season.
good,"Most days included attending to all guests who walk through the door with a smile to inform them of all the great deals that will help them save money.  Along with all purchases employees must also be able to multitask with answer all questions or requests that are put through our online store and through the phone.  I learned many things from working here including: taking on a lead role, people skills, multitasking, obtaining deadlines, and keeping inventory in check.  The hardest part of the job was only reminding yourself to not leave out any deals when talking to the guest or saying the wrong thing for the phone greeting.  Most enjoyable part was making a connection with the guest where you make their day and they make yours."
good,"this company is fun to work for part time if you like video games. most customers are nice and the management is usually enthusiastic. however they are hard pressed for high sales but do not pay commission, I was given minimum wage"
good,My work involve with checking inventory and assisting customers with any questions or concern they have about a product. I learn about how GameStop policy with used game and how they manage to keep in business.
good,"Gamestop is a great company. They are completely flexible with the hours and days that you want to work or not work. The experience you get from the management there is in depth and if you are willing to learn they are more than willing to teach you. Job advancement is fairly easy, just to show you are competent in your position and that you know your policies and how to sell the merchandise and interact with the customers. It is always entertaining every shift I work with both my co-workers and managers. It was fun balanced with work. Selling video games and consoles all day is fun only if you are into that hobby."
good,GameStop is a wonderful niche environment to work at if a store has a dedicated team. The company does its best. The opportunity for hours and advancement may depend on the area. As I am in a rural community there are simply not enough granted hours to go around during any time but the hectic holiday season.
good,Assist customers in resolving game system/computer-related issues. Excellent customer service and problem-solving skills.
good,"Gamestop was a fun place to work at, and I gained legitimate skills with stocking, cash handling, returns, and exchanges."
good,"GameStop as a company is a blast to work for. I enjoyed my time working for them. If i could change anything i would go back to what worked well for them and that is the games. Not the credit cards, not the phone services, just games. I liked the coworkers, i liked all the upper management personnel that i met."
good,Very corporate ran business. Strict guidelines and procedures that had to be followed. Sales goals were a crucial part of the job.
good,GameStop is a fun work environment that is full of kind people but the hours are terrible. As a Senior Game Advisor (shift manager basically) I was lucky to have around 20 hours in a week.
good,"Expected to be able to balance both the tangibles and intangibles of business while achieving expected sales and profit. Must be able to handle guest interactions while maintaining a solution based mindset, anticipating future needs and complications."
good,"I've been working for the company for years. Normal retail expectations, with normal retail pay. Which is a lot and not enough. My life would be completely different without working here though. The people you meet, and the experiences it provides are priceless."
good,"I worked for GameStop for most of my working career and it was great until I had a wife and child. The work life balance for a store manager is very difficult on the family and the compensation does not cover the added strain. "
good,"I enjoyed working at Gamestop for that season. Although there were days I felt nervous because I didn't have the right information to help a customer out, but overall I enjoyed the experience and being around others who share an interest like me."
good,"Great, exciting company to work for with a strong belief in empowered leadership. Requires a lot of nights and weekends, especially around holidays. To work within this company you must be very open to change as procedures, culture, and products are consistently changing. You'll also need to manage a very diverse staff of individuals so flexibility is a must!"
good,"great place to work."
good,"A typical day isn't bad, it is retail though so learning all the ins and outs of buying and selling to customers, and trying to find out their needs. I've learned a lot over the years, from shipping and receiving to hiring and firing, there really is a lot to learn there. Management is all going to depend on store but for the most part I'd say management is going to be overall helpful, and useful. Same with co-workers, I have a great staff, but there are some stores that aren't as well staffed. The hardest part of the job so far is still dealing with difficult customers, but it can also be the most satisfying when they leave happy and understanding that you did everything you could to save them money and make their day amazing."
good,"That pretty much sums it up. It's a great job, but unless you are looking to manage a retail store then there is no moving up."
good,"Great place, fun atmosphere. Great perks for management. Is easy to move up if one is motivated to do so. Also, if your interested in pop culture Gamestop is the place to be."
good,"A typical day would start about 9 a.m I would knock on the door to be let in because my manager would be counting the registers and depositing the money. I would start by logging into my account as the employee then start organizing the wall in alphabetical order of games again since we just got a shipment of new games in the morning. Then filing away the sleeves which is the term used for the used and new games. Most of the day we had a very active days throughout the week but on game releases or midnight releases it was a whole other monster in itself but as a gamer as a sales associate a sociable person I loved every minute. I learned the importance of customer relationships, sales pitches but making it your own to where the customer doesn't feel like you're just selling them a product, you're giving them the truth about that specific product. The power of persuasion & multitasking was key speed was very important in that line of work. Management was very steady for awhile until my Assistant Manager got a Manger position at another store. That store was doing well but then the pressure was really on my Manager for awhile until we got another Assistant but that took awhile because our Regional Manager was pretty slow when it came to certain responsibilities. My co- workers were really cool to be around the environment was a relaxed place even we were jammed packed we helped each other to the up-most but never slowed in our own production. Probably the hardest part was learning the computer and how it worked but it took me all of 2 months to learn the ins and outs of the computer."
good,"I would come in to work, everyone would be talking about new games, I loved speaking with the customers because the topics were always about games, we got to check out games like a library, we also got posters etc that the store would throw away, it was amazing."
good,"I am in charge of training Game Advisers (sales associates), processing daily shipment, keeping track of our goals throughout the day, week, and month,making sure customer leave satisfied with their shopping experience, opening/closing store procedures, and handling our bank deposits and cash registers. Everyday is enjoyable and I get to converse with people about what products their interested in and answer any questions they may have about those products. I enjoy helping customers and being involved in a team-based environment."
good,"Working here is awesome for a gamer like myself because I get to talk about something I enjoy doing, while making a connection with each individual customer. I had a great opportunity to meet lots of fun people, whether through coworkers or customers."
good,"E' una buona soluzione lavorativa, ma necessito di un lavoro full time."
good,"The goal of this job was to try and retain returning customers. This was done by selling memberships wish allowed discounted prices on used goods, which was a large percentage of the companies profits. The management team was excellent and there was constant contact between all levels of management to ensure business runs fluidly."
good,Come in the morning restock selves with our new games. Place the money in the register. Do our daily inventory sheet. An be prepare to have the daily meeting with my employees.
good,"Typical work day consisted of Sales, Trade-ins, and engaging customers and advising them on new games and consoles. Would highly recommend."
good,"Working as a Store Manager entailed daily processing shipments, inventory of games and systems, handling customer issues, sales meeting the daily plans. I learn a lot about myself working in the management position in regards to character and motivation. The company hand clear cut goals and it was our job to exceed them. My co-workers were typically fun to be around, as we challenged each other daily. The hardest part of the job was to meet the set goals. As goal orientation is important, a lack of traffic flow can hinder your goal achievement: and that was the case many days. But, I loved the ability to lead my team and help customers out everyday. Seeing someone leave your store knowing they are well kept, happy and will return made it all worth it."
good,"Working at GameStop is a very relaxed job to have, the computers do everything for you and the product sells itself. Honestly it was probably the best job I've had yet, my coworkers were some of my best friends, and being surrounded by video games was ideal for me. The only real struggle of the job was meeting company number quotas, other than that it's a very cushy job where you can meet new people, and forming regulars is always rewarding."
good,this job was hard. pulled a lot of hrs. but it was so much fun. we truly valued our customers. some would stop bye not to bye anything but just to talk about releases and upcoming DLC. I loved doing the marketing. always had first dibs on the old posters.
good,Keep yourself busy! always a cool place to work at but no matter what stay busy people. Co-workers are nice people to work with and don't be afraid to ask questions to improve your skills there.
good,Typical day at work would be to know about all deals and special going on for the week and the newest game titles that have been released as well. I learned how to become familiar with the customer. My co-workers were great as well as my manager. The hardest part of the job if there was one would be enrolling the customer in the power up rewards membership. The most enjoyable part of the job was being around all the up to date gaming technology out there.
good,helping customers with games and other problems. handling cash. restocking games and other items and cleaning bathroom
good,"GameStop was a fun, but highly stressful company to work for. days included helping customers, inventory counts, price changes, and keeping the store neat, clean, and organized (NCO). Meeting goals was a very integral part of the job, Co-workers were the most amazing part of the job and training and hiring new employees was a delightfully fun and tricky experience. Through GameStop i learned solution selling behaviors focused on asking open ended questions and learning from customer responses in order to present them with the best solution to their shopping needs."
good,This particular place has a pleasant atmosphere and competent co-workers. Helping the customers is what I would consider both the hardest as well as the easiest part of the job.
good,"Typical day at work included opening store, organizing shelfs and making sure everything was back in its place from the previous day."
good,"So far with my experience at the current store I'm working at, it is a mixed bag of beans with some of the customers I get to work with.  This allows me to think on my feet on what kind of tailored experience I need to give each individual.  The staff is good to work with and are flexible with problems as they arise.  Just don't expect to live off of this job, especially as just a Game Adviser.  They need hours for the management so part-timers will get two to three days for only 3 to 4 hours max."
good,"I loved working at Game Stop, the co workers were awesome and they have the same interest in video games (obviously). Only reason I left was because there was very little advancement opportunities and not many hours. When your getting minimum wage it's very hard to have money with little to none hours. Overall if you have the patience to work your way up in the company it is an amazing place to work if you have a passion for the video game industry."
good,"Game Stop is a Fun store to work for. Local management at the store level are great! Higher management continually make questionable demands. If you like to sell a fun product and have a passion for video games, this place is a great fit."
good,"Buen trabajo en un ambiente dinámico. "
good,I really enjoyed working at Gamestop. I walked in one day when the new management was putting the final touches on the store.
good,"A day at work at GameStop is sporadic with so many things to tackle that it'd be difficult to place down on a review. As a Store Manager, you are the jack-of-all trades. One is more of an Operations/Sales/Store Manager all at once. You are helping customers, bringing in sales, upselling, keeping watch on inventory with daily inventory scans, developing a team and constantly coaching for results, all while managing payroll against an ever random flow of traffic due to GameStop's ability to buy sell and trade."
good,Normal day is helping customers find games and talking about games job is easy as long as you like helping customers. Co workers are really good people and share the same love for games.
good,Its a fun expiriance.  You can interact with the customers and help them choose the best for them.  You can share what you know to them and can create a more personal envitroment with each and one of the customer you interact.
good,Management at the store I worked at was great.  We pushed each other to excel in our sales techniques.  There was no real hard part of the job besides not having the hours to work.
good,Gamestop is a fun place to work. One gets to talk about games and upcoming merchandise and generate regular customers. The manager was an amazing and direct honest worker as well as my coworkers.
good,"A GameStop game advisor provides exceptional and efficient customer services to patrons throughout the store. Customers look to GameStop game advisors for information on the electronic gaming industry, including popular titles and consoles. A game advisor needs to possess a passion for video games from every genre. Other abilities required of a potential game advisor include the ability to work in a fast-paced environment, patience with every type of customer, and operating a point of sale system."
good,"You expand your horizons and multitask very quickly, there are a lot of diverse customers so you build your customer service skills quickly. You learn the retail industry very quickly since many other companies compete with Gamestop when it comes to video games."
good,During high school and college working at EB Games was my dream job.  Finally got hired here as a temporary employee and was kept on.  Flew through the ranks and had my own store within 9 months of my hire date. Then EB was bought out by GameStop and things changed.  The culture changed.  Focus was less on the customers and more on the numbers.  Payroll was cut back and I found myself working 80 hours a week because I wasn't given the payroll to cover my store.
good,"Good for someone not needing many hours, who loves gaming! It was  a simple job that was fun while it lasted."
good,"Fun working environment with minimal customer issues. In all of my time working for GameStop I have rarely encountered an upset customer. Employee's are courteous and understanding and while the benefits may be lacking, there is room for growth and advancement and the management is understanding and kind. Great opportunity to learn more about the growing popularity of games and what is going on in the technical world. The allowance of checking games out really helps to keep employees on the ""in know"" of the latest games in order to accurately relay to customers their experience to help with sales."
good,The days were usually slow but it gave me time to learn the new policies on trades and sales. i learned a lot about myself as a manager as well as a person and how to treat irate customers/employes with professionalism. the co-workers were easy to get along since we all took the job for the same reasons.
good,"A typical day at work involved opening the store, running the deposit, counting items, processing transactions, and handling customer service. Most customers are generally inquisitive and you will be answering a lot of questions. Power Up Cards and reservations are a large part of your job. Management is typically only 3 people, though some have more or less, and they are the usually the only ones who get full time hours."
good,"fun work culture, good people, good on site management."
good,"This company is an ok company to work for depending on what position you get and what volume store you are. If you are going for management pray you get along with the other manager and that they are hard workers. Managers are responsibal for just about maintaining everythnig. Part Timers maybe have about 4-5 of them and eac one gets about 4 hours a week. That was in a store of the future. Also part time is minimum wage. But you can barrow any game you want as long as there is at lest 4 other copies in the store. Also you get a 10% discount on all games, but nothing for systems."
good,By far the best working atmosphere I have had. I started at the lowest rung but withing 3-4 months was able to work my way up to a manager position in the company. My role was to supervise day to day activities like restocking games and merchandising along with customer service and conflict resolution. other duties was taking in shipments and also training other employees.
good,"I was in the sale and resale of software licenses. I interacted with customers on a daily basis, and was often the only person left in charge to complete the managerial tasks such as inventory control, monetary management, customer satisfaction and retention. I learned valuable workplace skills such as product sales, time management, and singularly completing tasks set before me regardless of the help around me (or lack thereof)."
good,"I loved working here, my work family felt like a second family altogether, but the way the corporate structure was arranged was baffling. Worked here for 4 years"
good,"-Train new employees on product information. Cross-training to provide back up support for all departments."
good,"I learned that I would never be a car salesman in my lifetime. Working at Gamestop was the closest I would ever get. Unbelievable pressure was placed on securing game reservations and selling Gamestop membership cards. Sales goals were never unreasonable, but I was not poached from my previous job for my sales prowess. I was hired to clean up inventory at a location that continued to fail at living up to its goals. When that endeavor became successful I was moved to another location for the same reason. Again, I succeeded in my role to tighten up the inventory. Despite having success in cleaning up numbers that were well below spec, my sales numbers barely lived up to the goals management set. Since there were not any other locations for me to help fix inventory number. I was asked to resign."
good,"Typically the job was fast paced but on a slow day there was time to relax and just organize. I learned a lot about different games coming out and promotional sales. I learned how to work a POS system. My Coworkers were the BOMB. the hardest part of the job was when someone asked something i didn't know the answer to. and selling power up cards (gamestops membership card) was difficult at first, but i got the hang of it. Most enjoyable part of the job was when we would get cool prizes with the new games coming out, and you could check out games and try them."
good,"Open store, check day-planner for opening tasks, check registers for correct opening balance, deliver bank deposit.  After opening, provide great customer service while processing freight, and maintaining clean and organized sales floor.  Track specific sales markers throughout the day, check emails for tasks and store updates. Close store, organize and clean sales floor, count cash in registers to prepare bank deposit before locking up."
good,"If video games are your thing, and you have experience in sales, then Gamestop is a great company to work for. Very competitive environment, as long as you keep doing what is asked of you it is a good time. Once (If) you are at management level you do pick up more responsibilities, but it is still are great work environment."
good,"GameStop was a great experience for me. I enjoyed my coworkers as well as the environment, as I love electronics!"
good,Training was fun and informative being this was my first call center job.  Co workers were willing to answer questions and easy to work with.  I found that the calls where I was able to actually help someone and hear them say thank you and Hear them smile really felt good and it made me strive to get those results on each call.
good,"Buona esperienza lavorativa, colleghi disponibili anche in questo caso a insegnare il lavoro nonostante il periodo molto affolalato da clienti."
good,"A typical day consists of providing customers with customer service, along with knowledge about video games and consumer electronics. Day to day I work with the team to process shipment and control inventory, as well as complete daily operations. I learned how to be patient and do what is possible to please customers while still abiding to the store policies. Management is efficient and help with the productivity of store procedures. My co-workers are fun and easy going. The hardest part of my job is ensuring that all tasks are complete as well as finding compromises between the needs of the customers and specific store policies. The most enjoyable part is interacting with customers and co-workers that share your passion for video games and the gaming industry."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is helping out the customers."
good,"L'azienda ha molta cura dei suoi dipendenti e dei clienti e si comporta sempre in modo da non lasciare insoddisfatto nessuno."
good,"My typical workday will soon consist of inventory management, intake of deliveries of product and marketing materials. Constant communication with the district manager by email daily.  Sales and customer service.  My co-workers are fun and energetic, but with a great attention to detail and very knowledgeable. The hardest part of my job would be to be able to accommodate every customer timely during big rush times so that all customers have a wonderful experience.  The most enjoyable part of my day interacting with the customers, and learning about each person that walks through the door and building relationships with them to keep them coming back."
good,Game stop  is a very great company to work for you get to learn about all the up coming games and releases.Also you are able to make midnight launches exciting depending on what game is releasing at the time.
good,"Working at Gamestop is like playing with a double-edged sword; on one side, it's awesome if you're a gamer (like I was) because you really know your stuff and what's more, so do your co-workers. Never a dull moment when you know what to talk about in your spare time. Too bad they try to drill up-selling into your head and make it seem like that's all that matters.... I always thought it was about the customer, not about how much money we can get them to part with; I dunno about them, but I don't like being bullied/persuaded/repetitively told how to spend my money. If it weren't for that singular aspect of selling as much as we could, it'd be the perfect job."
good,"Gamestop is a very niche job for me. If you like making sales and gaming then it is great. Although, the entry level positions leave much to be desired, the atmosphere is nice and work conditions are very good."
good,Above store management can be tough to deal with sometimes and company policies are randomly enforced
good,i enjoyed working at this place alot i was sad when i was told they had to let me go
good,Great company.  Great work environment.  I worked for this company for close to 8 years and loved it.  Best professional experience of my career to this point.
good,"very fun atmosphere but needs strict advice to manage well, workers needs to to work harder, and be nicer to customers."
good,"A typical day at work for me is clocking in and starting with a customer if they need assistance or starting to pick up the store. For example, putting games away, checking prices, vacuuming, checking for new games on reserves, reviewing sales that are going on, helping out with marketing, and selling product. "
good,"Very positive work place."
good,"Great products."
good,"Excellent co-workers, great customers, and a solid schedule."
good,"Working to meet strict sales goals of:"
good,"While it is not all about playing games all day, you do get to talk games all day which is a great thing in its own right. You work as a team, while I was apart of the management team, all management where fair"
good,Signed on as a temp/seasonal worker. Management was great and co-workers were great on a personal level. Great place for someone who likes video games and someone who has a great deal of patience. The shift schedule is poor and I would wish corporate pumped more money into stores so a majority of temp workers can make adequate pay.
good,"I got to meet new people and constantly exchange opinions on gaming systems. I work with people who understood their job requirements and met expectations. However, the management over hired and favoured themselves with the hours."
good,Game Advisor responsible for regular cashier duties. Friendly work environment promoted working together to assist customers in making good decisions when picking out products. Sales driven workplace that provided bonuses based on production. Most enjoyable part was communicating with co-workers and customers about our products and what game types they liked. Not many hard parts period.
good,"Very hard work long shifts very few days off, learned how to work with a very fast pace and pay attention to your surroundings learned basic warehouse skills. The hardest part of the job was having to work in the freezer. The most enjoyable part of the job was the benefits like incentives and overtime."
good,I was only employed through the winter season so i didnt get to enjoy a full time perspective but the time i did spend there was enjoyable. The cashiering and stocking parts were mundane but the customer interaction was the best part
good,"I loved working at Game Stop when I first started. It was a group effort to keep the store organized and the customers happy. But once the Powerup Reward cards came out, they became the most important thing. It was no longer about making the customers happy. It was about competing with your fellow co-workers to see who could shove more cards down more customers' throats."
good,having customer wanting to come in my line to speak to me that made my day
good,"company is great to work for,"
good,"Customer Service, Cash handling, Staffing, Organizing, Staying above company average so that the store performs well."
good,"Gamestop is one of those places that feels like home,everyone knows everybody it was a excellent place to work. The management was awesome always made you feel comfortable and is to talk with. My co-workers were one of a kind everyone was always made me feel like I was one of them. The hardest part of my job was when i became manager I had to learn how to be a more agressive and firm as a manager versus me being a game advisor ."
good,A day at Gamestop is like working at any other customer based retail store.Its all about the customer and maximizing all sales.The managment was great.I did my best to keep a loose and focused staff.There really wasn't anything not to like about the job except maybe pay.The best part was being around that type of atmosphere.
good,"Only working in a seasonal position, they were very informative on how to do my job."
good,A typical day of work would involve dealing with customers searching for games and accessories and accommodating them as best as possible. Management was very flexible and always encouraged and helped us work to our full potential.
good,"We don't make commission, but our schedules our based off sales, i meet the sales quotas, and either get free lunch or a gift card. i make sure our customers are well informed on return policies and the product that they purchase is the right one for them. The hardest part is when it is really slow, and no customer is interested in our discount program or reservation of top future sellers. Even though i some days do not meet the quotas, i still look forward to the rest of the week to complete sales. The most enjoyable part of the day is meeting new customers and helping them out with an problem, and making sure they leave with a smile."
good,"It's a customer focused job, mostly typical retail stuff; register, stocking, sales."
good,"But there is no room for advancement. Low pay, but the atmosphere is very nice."
good,Good company to work for but if you are looking for a career not the ideal company.
good,Very standard retail job. Heavily dependent on your sale of membership cards and subscriptions.
good,It's nice in the way that each individual store is usually very small and everyone works with everyone.
good,if you enjoy video games and like helping people find what they are looking for when it comes to video games this is the place for you
good,"Exciting knowledge with all gaming category and age group."
good,"Fast paced, lots of customers would come in throughout my shifts. I worked there on Black Friday so it was a little hectic there but I loved it. 10/10"
good,Ambiente ideale per stare sempre in continuo movimento.
good,"If you're a gamer through and through then you'll enjoy this job as long as it's something you can survive on, since it is minimum wage. You're allowed to chat with the customers as long as you're helping them find what they need, and just the workplace is generally friendly. Definitely a job I would return to if I needed"
good,"in a world where you seemingly become an automaton, GameStop allowed me to be more of myself. Keeping within the boundaries of proper customer service, I enjoyed being able to address my opinion when asked."
good,Communication is key. She working with this company it is very important that you are able to communicate a good level. You will constantly have to communicate with others from diverse backgrounds and be able to suggest and  sell products.
good,The customers and employees you deal with will ultimately be what makes you stay or leave the company. The company needs to improve employee salaries and update their old ways of running the company.
good,It was an enjoyable experience when working with the coworkers and getting to greet the guest coming through the door. It's fun to categorize their stocks and viewing the merchandise they have to sell.
good,"If you love talking to people about video games and playing video games, this is the place for you. Usually a typical day is pretty slow unless its a holiday or a sale on a weekend. There is no hard part about this job unless you have dyslexia, cause you have to o[put things in ABC order. The most enjoyable part of this job is the connection with co workers."
good,"I loved my 5 years at GameStop. If they paid better, I would have stayed. The store managers were all wonderful and I have become friends with pretty much all the SLs in my district. I loved the people, working with gamers, and the discounts you get for working there. My district manager and regional manager on the other hand were terrible. My DM hated my only because I was a girl and climbed my way to Store Manager quickly. He was very sexist and the other SLs in the district quit for similar reasons. I would have stayed if it weren't for him and they pay"
good,GameStop was my first job and it was very helpful for the rest of my working career working with people and my superiors help me learn and move forward  in my careers. The only downside I would say is that some people would treat me unfairly even though I wasn't directly the problem but working in sales that cannot be helped
good,If your not willing to pressure people to get a pro membership it will be tough. Other than that its hard to stay busy during slow days but other than that its a very relaxing job.
good,"If you love video games its a lot of fun. You don't work a lot unless you are in management so this is a side job. Fun and repetitive, You also have to be willing to deal with irate customers."
good,I have had a good experience so far at GameStop. I was able to move up somewhat quickly within the company. I started as a seasonal and now am a key-holder.
good,"My experience at Gamestop was a really good one at first. My manager was really cool with us, being laidback and chill at some times but also serious when it was time to get down to it. Towards the end, my store got a new manager but after that, things werent the same and he started to slack off, leaving the shift leads to finish all the work for the store."
good,"It was a good place to work, learning about the home video game industry, and the type of games and game systems that are popular. I enjoyed working with the staff at the store"
good,Everyday is a new day working at GameStop. Meaning that you don't know what to expect when customers come in. Everyday there are new updates on all products in our store and many interesting upcoming items.
good,Have good people both working in the store.and management. If you love gaming this is the job for you. Allow you to bring games home and play them. And also at times rep's will come in and offer free promotion items
good,"Gamestop is fun to work for if you enjoy games and collectibles. The work is about 90% customer interaction, so It's great for people who enjoy talking to and helping people. The employees are great people who are easy to talk too and management is more relaxed than you may think. The toughest part of the job was when the shop was empty, as you had to find small things to do to fill time (organizing shelves, checking stock, etc). I personally enjoyed talking to people about the newest games and collectibles the most."
good,"The daily routine would be get in the store and get everything ready before open. Example would be make sure registers are ready, check emails, and do any counts that needed to be done before open. During business hours you would have to balance between customers and doing your daily tasks. When the next shift would show up I would go over the daily goals with them and what is to be expected for their shift. The management was good, they also kept us informed on how we were doing. The workplace culture felt like a family, employees from our and other stores would communicate a lot. The best thing about the job was dealing with the customers."
good,"I absolutely loved this job. The only thing that stopped me from working there longer was the fact my local store closed. My immediate management was wonderful, very fair and always willing to help if I had any questions or concerns. It was such a fun job, laid-back, being able to essentially talk about one of my favorite things in the world, video games, for the entirety of every shift. I didn't work there long enough to know anything about any benefits or advancement opportunities, but this was easily one of the best jobs I've ever had."
good,This was one of the first jobs I got out of high school and still boasts one of the best teams I've had the pleasure to work with. My coworkers were always willing to help me with anything I had trouble with in a fun way and management actively encouraged improvement in positive ways that drove me to do better. Unfortunately the hours and opportunities for advancement were never there. Great place to start off if the staff is good to ease into the workforce.
good,customers come in everyday asking the same question and some come in to pre order games or items and other customers buy games and game consoles and other things.
good,"Great team environment. We were in a highly competitive area, however, our district always pulled ahead by pulling together. I learned how to properly hire and manage staff members, review quarterly performance and earnings and make adjustments to meet company metrics.  The hardest part of the job was keeping everyone on pace every day to hit our metrics; the best part of the job was getting to interact with my customers.  I loved being the store leader that customers came to because they could trust me and knew that they would always be treated properly and taken care of.  I was proud to have the reputation that I held there."
good,Learn time management and leadership skills at a brisk pace. Very welcoming atmosphere at many locations. Surrounded by like minded people (both co-workers and guests).
good,"Only worked there for a short time in one location under one manager, but nice people and fun environment; nice perks if you're a gamer (testing out consoles/games, previews, etc.)"
good,"It was a preety fun place to work, my co-workers were fun to talk to and work with. Some of the customers were pretty cool, and some didnt know what they were looking for."
good,The company is great for the most part. Things have been great for the past two years and really its a great job.I would recommend it to anyone looking for a part time job to learn how to drive sales
good,"Whereas corporate management itself is stressful, each location is filled with it's own unique staff; ranging from friendly and cooperative to pushy and often competitive."
good,It's a fun job: people come to Gamestop because htey're happy and have money to spend. Poor pay and hours. % off merchandise and always in the know for games. Great for part time as a student or even just to hold onto for that discount as a gamer and work full time elsewhere.
good,In most cases working at GameStop was a good experience. I worked on the floor primarily helping out customers and encouraging them to buy products or making them aware of current promotions or sales.
good,"Working for gamestop a manager can really make or break your experiences within the company. "
good,But only if you get the right managers and team mates the short hours don't seem bad. The discounts aren't the best cept during the holiday also you get first pick.
good,yes games are a critical part of the job but there is so much more. the job is more serious than you would think. its is a sales job more than people would think.
good,"Gamestop is a fun place to work, but the negative thing is they don't give many working hours to the employees. In overall, learning how to do and working in the store system is pretty fun."
good,I actively miss work at Gamestop for the unique culture and the awesome benefits of renting out games. Generally a bad day at gamestop is talking to someone about a video game you don't really like for slightly longer than you would like.
good,"Sehr gutes Arbeitsklima für jeden Nerd, Geek oder sontigen freund idgitaler Medien. Leider sind die kunden hier umso eskalierender."
good,Please note that I was a seasonal employee so i dont have more than 3 months experience. Everyday we would meet in the morning or afternoon to talk about the new products that were coming out so we could offer them to customers. Other than that all you do is talk to people about games and other things that you may have in your store(my store had anime figurines). It was pretty chill. Wish there was more hours for temporary. But people don't seem to go to gamestop like they used to.
good,"Ho lavorato anni presso gamestop, rimpiango un pò di essermene andato."
good,"I'm a gamer and have a decent head for business management. Although the pay was not great, it was competitive to my previous position, I got a lot of free merchandise as a manager and was able to attend events that I would never been able to experience as an outside citizen. As a fan of the industry, this more than made up for the 2% pay discrepancy.  I very much enjoyed my superiors (who pushed for excellence while always being open for new thoughts and ideas) and my cohorts (who were always willing to share success) as well as most of the customers I would interact with on a daily basis. If I had not had a passion for the product I would not be so enthusiastic about my time there but I had passion and loved my time there.  My biggest complaint is holiday season is complete madness and schedule flexibility is almost non existent but in truth, that is what you should expect in any retail management position."
good,"The Job its self is fun, interactive and Interesting. The part of the job that will make the job or break it is your Coworkers. the Managers That I had are some of the most fun, kind and interesting people i have met. They are the managers you hope to work with. I have covered shifts in other store and have realized how great the managers in my store are."
good,The store I worked at was pure joy. My manager was understanding and took care of her associates. The other associate and managers at the location i worked at were a pleasure to work with.
good,"I am part-time an do not get enough hours, I need a job that can give me the time and money I need."
good,"If you love video games as much as I do you will definitely love working at Gamestop. On top of that, I would get video games at a discount and was able to reserve games"
good,I worked for GS for 2 years and it was a fun experience. The management is fair as is the way they help you fix mistakes. You’re very rarely written up as they work with you to make sure you’re doing things properly. Hours are very bad. I once asked my DL about why a store gets so little hours and was told it’s because that store does better so they need less time to complete tasks. You do get promoted quickly if there is a position available but you do have to show you know what you’re doing and are serious about it as well. You learn a lot from working here and would definitely recommend it for a small part time position or full time if you’re able to work as a sga or store manager. ASLs (assistant managers) are paid just under a store manager but have almost all the same duties.
good,"A typical day was a descent mix of relaxed and busy jobs of using the cashier, stocking and organizing shelves, helping customers and more. It was enjoyable for me due to my personal interests and i would happily work there again."
good,Very fun if you're looking for a temp job. Discount is pretty awesome too. Hours aren't that long and don't have to work a whole lot.  Customers are friendly and the people I've worked with made the job very enjoyable.
good,Relaxed atmosphere. I learned a lot working there on NOC environment. The teamwork really has been very good. The managemenet is proactive and listen to us carefully and with attention when we present an issue that needs prompt attention.
good,Cool to be around so many games but no hours. Just like any other retail job where its all about sales and not really about the customer. Co workers are friendly
good,"The environment is great if you're a gamer or a fan of any pop culture. Manager is nice, as are the other associates. Overall a solid retail experience."
good,we are so over staffed that we don't have enough hours to accommodate the workers we have. Its a fun place to work with great guys to work with. the guys are the best to work with I really feel like I'm one of the guys when I'm with the guys.
good,I loved working with everyone employed there. The corporate mandates how many sales and trades and subscriptions you must get every week. Sometimes its almost impossible to meet those numbers if youre on the sales floor and someone else is on the register. especially if you dont have that many hours a week. its rediculous some times.
good,"Ever since I started working for Gamestop, what kept me coming back was the people i work with and the regular guests that come in and have long conversations about anything with us. Yes there can room for improvement, but that takes time. I'll keep this short, one thing that know no one ready for is the possible hard decisions you to make regarding a situation. You'll feel bad about it, but you know its policy and there is so much you can do. do let it get to you. I get those type of situations at least a few times a month."
good,The Gamestop I worked at was a very relaxed store. We worked hard and did our best to help customers if needed. My manager were great people and my co-workers were always fun to talk to.
good,"I am an avid gamer so it made for a great place to work. I enjoyed the management team, as well as the customers that came into the place as well. Would recommend as a place to work."
good,Fun place to work and a good experience to anybody that wants to learn more about games. Management willing to help you move up in the company. Management is also willing to work with you schedule.
good,Everyone is easy to get along with. The employees there understand how to appropriately talk with customers and not breathing down their necks. They showed a good amount of personal space.
good,"It took a little while to get used to all the ins and outs of the cash register, location of items, and policies of products, but once I did, I really loved working. My coworkers are great, and I love interacting with guests about up and coming games and systems."
good,"Great work environment and  fast paced.                   "
good,If you have a passion for video games this job is a good fit but the pay is low. This would have to be a side job because there’s no way this could be a main form of income. I enjoyed my time here and it was fun while it lasted. Management is very helpful.
good,Great time working there. Unfortunately I had to move right after working there so I didn't have a chance to get as well acquainted as I wish I would have
good,Great company to work for. Can move a lot within the company and supportive staff and mangers to help you get through it all. Also the discount and perks are pretty good as well.
good,"Ambiente lavorativo stimolante e flessibile, giornata lavorativa molto impegnata."
good,The Job provides many training and and allows you to grow especially if there is interest in retail. Fun job to those who love pop culture and enjoy speaking with people.
good,"From the beginning of orientation to end of my time there, it was an great learning process and entry level for the world of sales. Fun and interesting place to work at and my coworkers helped when can."
good,A typical day is stocking shelves and helping customers find products. I learned how to better sell a product. The management has a nice vibe. The workplace culture is nothing but a bunch of nerds freaking out over video games and other related products.
good,Login in to work computer print out label to start order. Go grab a scanner to start order by scanning first the label the scan out product to order. Down the line until all order is completed.
good,The most fun i have had in the two years of doing cashiering and customer service. The workers were great and friendly. Management was a bit wonky but the work place culture was vast. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers. The part about the job i enjoyed the most was being in a place that i am familiar with everything sold.
good,"GameStop is a very fun place to work but it takes more than just a interest in video games. Like any retailer there are a number of factors that will contribute to making you successful beyond interest in the subject matter. Advancement from within is likely if you're interested, however, compensation could definitely be better."
good,"This job was one of the best job I worked. It helped me with the customer skills I had, helped advance them more. It was the fast pace and it made working fun."
good,Working at GameStop was great because i enjoy playing video games and i got to talk about them all day! You get to have your regular customers come in everyday and get to know them as friends versus customers.
good,"Gamestop has decent management to work with, unless you have a stickler. An okay employee discount that does work with their promotions and rewards program. They do offer a good amount of incentives."
good,"Working in the corporate office is generally great. Thorough annual reviews & recognition. Decent opportunities for advancement. Mentor programs & coaching. Many diversity and volunteer programs. Great on-site cafe with decent pricing, rec areas, and plenty of employee discount programs. Decent benefits packages, though they deteriorate a tiny bit each year, but that seems more due to national changes. Benefits are generally competitive. Parking generally sucks, unless you arrive very early. Management is generally supportive & listens to feedback, at least in the HR department. Very laid back culture, with business-casual dress code."
good,"It is a great place to work. must have strong interpersonal selling and suggesting skills Must be a person who is into the gaming world, I learned to be after. Product knowledge is not something you can learn unless you are using them."
good,"This can definitely be a fun sales job for people that strive to hit numbers and please upper management. With that being said, if you are not the sort of person comfortable selling in a highly competitive market, this is not the job for you."
good,It was a 3 month contract work. The work place was great and the work was fine as we were updating for the retail stores. I would tell a friend this could be a good position.
good,I have fun coming into work and I enjoy being there. Its been one of my dream jobs ever since I was little. I love this job and would recommend it to anyone.
good,"I did not work there very long, was for holiday help. i do it every once in a while for extra money during the holidays. they employees and the management are always welcoming."
good,This place has a great job culture in which everyone gets along with there co-workers and their customers. Unfortunately the hours are not ideal with sometimes getting only 6 hours a week.
good,Gamestop is a fun company to work for but they stress the membership program and I hate it so much! It's unbearable to bug everyone about the membership program and then have no commission or reason to strive besides the threat of losing your job.
good,"I mostly worked on the weekends because it was Christmas time . I love going to work  interacting with the customers and employees.  GameStop was my dream come true the reason I say that I’ve been playing games ever since I was to your 2 years old."
good,"very relaxed place i mean its a video game store i would wear gaming shirts there is no set uniform just be appropriate "
good,"Hate to be so bland here, but this is a retail job. For me this is the perfect job however because I enjoy playing video games as do my co-workers and the customers do as well. There had been times where it was so dead in the store we played Uno with some of the customers because we had completed all other tasks. "
good,War manchmal stressig aber sonst ok. Könnte viel lernen.
good,"its a wonderful place to work. Great atmosphere, good people and a quick passed work environment. The job was really not a hard job but very time demanding."
good,"-Very organized and and the management is really outstanding"
good,"It’s a great place to work if want to sell games and help people with any question you may know on systems or games you personally have/play. But keep in mind that working for GameStop you have to tell customers and the pro cards membership, the reservations for games, and the saving for going on Pre-owned. They want their employees to push that out more then anything. So if you thing you can sell all those three plus give great customer service I would definitely suggest to apply."
good,"I liked working here, I hardly ever had any problems with staff. Customers on the other hand, can be all levels of bad. At the time I was working there, I was the only girl and I've had to deal with customers, cat-calling me, making sexist or inappropriate remarks, belittling me, and challenging my knowledge in sales and retail. "
good,this job used to be a bout customer service and repeat customers. now it is all about the bottom line and average sale. for a multibillion dollar company they pay the average person $8-$11/hr but pays corporate triple that for less work
good,"It was a great job and I don't regret it, but corporate dropping hours didn't allow me to provide for myself. I would have liked to stay and move up in the company but I wasn't able to commit to that at the time"
good,"Gamestop was a fun place to work for the first few months, but as management changed, it was getting harder and harder to get any positive reinforcement from the new management, despite they're pushing for positive attitudes and feedback from the store level."
good,Gamestop is a great place to work. it is a great learning experience along with fun co workers and even better customers. everyday is a new adventure and youll always learn something new.
good,GameStop was a great place to work and with the crew I was with was amazing. Everyone worked together and helped each other out. The training is at your pace and is easily explained. I would say that it was one of the best places I ever worked. I am glad I made the choice to work there and loved my co-workers.
good,"I have fun learning about new tech and games coming out, while talking to customers about it. I would recommend it to others, especially if you have a passion for the field."
good,i had a great time working there in the seasonal year of 2017.  i also had great managers co workers and hours. i was fortunate to have the hours i did for seasonal though as apparently you usually have far less if you work seasonal than i did
good,"GameStop can be an amazing place to work if you know how to tune out the noise.  There can be a lot of corporate garbage that happens from time to time and unless you move to a high position it could be difficult to support a family but for a side job, early job, or for someone with the interest it can be an amazing place."
good,Gamestop was an awesome place to work it was a seasonal job everyone was very helpful in training me and answered all my questions when asked in a polite way i miss working there.
good,"Gamestop was a entertaining place to work, being part time there i was able to get hours that worked with my school schedule and also was able to talk to the various employees and make some life long friends"
good,"GameStop is a fun work environment where I get to pitch my passion on a daily basis. My manager at this time is a remarkable person who makes sure that the job is done right on time, as well as making sure we have a relaxed and stress-free work environment. That being said the corporate manhandling of most cashier positions at GameStop is completely absurd in the completest of ways. You're forced to up-sell up sell up sell and work for as a commission based cashier with the only extra benefit is maybe one to two more hours at most. If you don't up-sell or attach all the bells and whistles ,which most customers don't want, then you are threatened with your job or hours forcing you to seek extra employment."
good,Typical day was selling games and accessories to customers.
good,Its can be a fun place to work and you learn about alot of different games and systems and you get to work with alot of different types of people. The worst part of it is you have to push alot of different things and it can be hard cause people dont always want what you are pushing. plus the pay isnt great for what you deal with sometimes.
good,"This was a seasonal job. Unfortuantely, I didn't work enough hours to be able to give a decent review. The times I was there, it seemed like a pretty easy job to have. I did work the Xbox One l;aunch, and that was pretty cool."
good,"Though some people think working here would be cool, the job is actually really stressful. You have to be very detailed on every little thing you take in and have to make sure everything is right or you could cost the store a lot of money."
good,"Buon ambiente lavorativo, molto stimolante e organizzato"
good,A normal day at Gamestop you will help guest with product (New or Preowned). Guest can come in looking for help with any game related problems. Gamestop has a very open culture with different paths from all walks of life. Most enjoyable part of my job is talking to customer about their favorite games.
good,"Good experience for customer service learned from working there"
good,I felt that working at gamestop was a positive experience the people who I worked with were nice and helpful and it really did feel like a team there.
good,The pay doesn't match up for the Job but the company values its associates. There is not much room for upper management advancements. The management is relaxed and easy to work for. There is constant change within the company. Low turnover ratios.
good,Typical day at Gamestop was pretty good it was relax and managment was fun to work with. I was the most enjoyable job that I had was trying find better
good,I enjoyed every aspect of this job. I couldn't complain. They gave you hands on training. I love the benefits available and its discounts. It was fun and very open to the diverse gamers. I would definitely work there again!
good,working at game stop is good experience its a friendly and relaxing environment with flexible timing. The employee are very understanding and friendlyk.
good,I would have loved to have more pay but it was okay working there was fun and they had a cafeteria which is great. I also had metal detectors I couldn't wear a wired bra but that was okay.
good,"Some fellow employees are gamers just like you, they like to talk about their favorite titles or systems. When I worked there part time in highschool I enjoyed every minute of it."
good,Buena compañia pero en refurbishment dificil el trabajo sin material de trabajo
good,"One of the best jobs I've ever had, I had fun there and even moved up pretty quickly. Though the manager I was under was not the best and didn't coordinate things well. Hours are never set and you're never guaranteed those hours either."
good,Job itself was fun and entertaining. Never felt like I was going to work. The room for growth isn’t really there though. You could be there for 2 years and the person who was just hired two months ago could get promoted before you. If there were better opportunities with better pay I would’ve stayed.
good,"Every day I would make sure to greet customers while keeping a good posture and eye contact. I would then ask what specifically brought them in today and, if it is there, show them where it is. Whether the item they are looking for is there or not I would then make other suggestions based on the item. Ie: decor, accessories, consoles"
good,"Gamestop has a great training module, plenty of work to be done, and working around Video Games and their culture is fun and low-stress. The sales number requirements are important as well as obtainable"
good,"Gamestop, specifically, the locations I worked at, were phenomenal. Extremely easy to get along with co-workers. Customers in the area were also incredibly great to get to know. To the point of having regulars who would come in and we all slowly became friends. "
good,"I worked for gamestop for over 3 years. I advanced from a game adviser to a senior game adviser in about 3 months. I had a great team who all got along and actively worked with each other to ensure tasks were completed either ahead of schedule or on time and that no one person was receiving the brunt of the work load. I can't speak for other stores, but I enjoyed my experience at gamestop. I do feel that corporate its self is out of loop with individual stores, and that they've stopped putting the well being and need of the associates AND customer behind their want of revenue. However, a great team can make up for the short comings up a corporation with no face."
good,Greeted customers as they entered the store assisted  them if or when they ask for help. Cleaning up the store or putting away games when there are down time. Checking guest out when they're ready with there items.
good,"I am a really big gamer so getting a job there is a lot of fun for me. It started as a holiday gig, but now I am training to be a part time key holder. So I have been growing in the company pretty quickly"
good,"•	Certified board-level repair technician for various Sony PlayStation, Microsoft XBOX consoles, and accessories as well as Nintendo handheld gaming systems."
good,"I enjoyed my years working for GameStop. The job is fun, the customers are great, the team is my family. I wish it was better for long term or for workers with family. The pay is typical of a high school job. Once you need to support a family you are forced to leave because they can't provide enough hours to work or high enough pay. It really is unfortunate, I've never enjoyed a job more in my life, or cared so much about how a store made the company look. I would have stayed there for life if they made it possible."
good,"It's a simple retail job, good if you're currently in school but unless you intend on going for a position in management, you wont get paid much. The job itself is pretty easy at times especially if you are into gaming, specifically on console. You only have a good experience if you have good people to work with. Got a cool manager? You'll be alright."
good,"A typical day at work would include showing up at the required time of normally either 8:30am, or 12:00pm and leaving at 6:00pm or 9:30pm. Daily tasks would normally include..."
good,Great place to have video game interactions with customers that enjoy the same things you do. Easy going work place with weekly goals. Always cool to be the first to see whats new coming out.
good,"My typical day was going into work to greet customers, sometimes reminding them of our discounts and hand out flyers where we could let them know, also, what is on sale."
good,Very fast paced work place that is very numbers oriented. Customer service is a number one priority!You must have great communication skills and knowing a second language is a plus.
good,Overall this place isn’t too bad to work at you get a decent discount but you get paid minimum wage which to be honest isn’t too great get to interact with other video game lovers
good,A typical day at GameStop would include answering calls from customers and guiding customers through the store. The management were very helpful and understanding when I had questions regarding or when it came to my schedule. The hardest part of the job was dealing with troublesome customers and the most enjoyable part of the job was helping parents find the perfect game for their children.
good,"giornata lavorativa con orario variabile in base ai turni stabiliti, nonostante il periodo caldo del mese di dicembre, l'ottima collaborazione tra colleghi permette di evitare il panico di fronte a un negozio pieno di clienti."
good,It is considered a dream job and the climb to turn that job into a stable income is hard work. If you start off as an entry position you will be making less than 10 hrs. Even then only being a store manager makes decent money. It is a retail job that involves video games and connections can be made and you con have some fun.
good,The work environment at GameStop was very family oriented which is good in most case. This group of people i worked with understood my needs and was always there when I needed a hand.
good,"How much you enjoy your store will be directly related to your manager and team. As far as the work you will do, it's very fast paced, wether you are stocking the floor or assigned to register. Heavy emphasis is placed on taking care of the customer by offering Gamestops products and services in order to create loyal guests and returning buyers. Overall it's one of the most fun jobs I've had, and there's a lot of opportunity to learn, grow, and move up in the company."
good,"I love working here and i still do, its a lot of fun working here, sharing my love for video games and connecting with everyone who shares the same passion as me."
good,Gamestop is all around but get do have a nice environment. It changes and depends on who take charge. But over all great place to work and there no uniform.
good,Game stop was one of the better jobs I have held. Days went by fast and I was able to learn new things everyday. The managers were very helpful explaining new policies and procedures.I loved the work environment and the customer base. This position was something I was pretty knowledgeable in and was able to connect well with the customers.
good,"I am passionate about all things to do with video games, and if you share that passion and enjoy discussing them, then this is a great job. The pay is small at first, though."
good,"Everyday I woke up and went to work, I would think ""Life is great. I work in a video game store!""  Obviously being a retail store, some customers were unruly but most of the time, people just want to get in and out."
good,Open the store and review day funds .cash balance registers. read any emails and act upon them in a timely manner . set daily goal and keep behaviors of staff consistent.
good,A fun job if you're looking for something while going to school. Not the place to be if you're looking for a career though. Management was awesome and discounts on games is nice.
good,"I enjoyed working for GameStop immensely; most days were simply handling register sales and restocking the floor with game cases. They do promotions and pro weekends often, so setting up the store after-hours is quite common. My manager was a phenomenal woman who made sure we all got as many hours as we needed, though she herself would often work 50+ hours a week. The ""Circle of Life"" is the worst part about their sales culture, but I have heard that since I left, they have been easing up or removing their person-to-person and store-to-store quotas. I loved my coworkers and was very sad to have to leave them; I definitely advise applying if you enjoy video games and can handle a retail environment."
good,"I really liked my job there, as an assistant manager fast paced and always something to do but VERY UNREALISTIC marketing due date times. Emails are always going off with a lot of unrealistic sale goals."
good,Very fun but stressful at times. It can be relaxing but during holidays it gets very stressful due to all of the sales coming in for the season especially Christmas time.
good,"I enjoy working for GameStop, just the hours aren't there if you are a part-timer. "
good,I opened/closed the store including pulling tills and making sure the money is correct. I did inventory checks to make sure everything is priced correctly and in stock. On a daily basis I would greet guests and ask if they needed any assistance and ring them out while providing excellent customer service. I met the goal requirements on the day and planned out how I’d achieve them.
good,"Having not known much about video games when I started, it was fun to learn, and my coworkers were very helpful in teaching me. My manager was very proactive with schedules, and schedule changes."
good,"My employment at GameStop allowed me to demonstrate my knowledge of video games by promoting it to the customers. It was a rewarding experience, as I often worked on the floor, cash register, and maintenance."
good,"I started out as a Game Advisor and worked my way to a Senior Guest Advisor. I loved the people I worked with and I loved the majority of my customers. The atmosphere working there was amazing."
good,Gamestop was a good employer. Not a lot of skill needed and no experience needed to be effective there. Gaming knowledge was preferred but not necessary
good,Good environment to work in.thought there should have been alittle more training then they gave. it was a good experience and also fun work. Needed more hours.
good,"A typical day of work is more relax,What you i did was restock the games and organized them alphabetical order.Greet and help customers with their needs."
good,Typical day at work involves creating reports and receiving product that arrive.  I learned the functions of distribution and shipping.  Management is good.  Workplace culture is welcoming.  The hardest part of the job is the hours.  Most enjoyable part of the job is mobility if you like to stay active.
good,"I worked at GameStop for over a year and a half. I made long lasting friendships. I felt valued within the company. It was sometimes difficult and tedious work, but it was often broken up with customer interactions. The management is pretty strict on certain things. There is constructive competition between stores and dictricts to reach and exceed metrics. Depending on the area, some district and refional managers do not understand the mechanics of a customer interaction because they do not interact with customers on a regular basis and are biased when put in the customer role. Overall it's a fun and satisfying job."
good,"Very fun and productive company to work for.Family oriented, compassionate about the associates and a great career move. I have learned so much from being employed with Gamestop. They have equal opportunitiy employment."
good,Gamestop helped me in many such as building building a better work ethic. My only problem were the ability of not getting paid for what I was doing. But overall I was a good job.
good,"Depending on what you would expect in a job, this is just like any other customer service job there is. We deal with customers, need to exceed sales, and also need to make sure that you provide outstanding customer service."
good,It was a very friendly and fun place to work at. My coworkers were all very friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend working at Gamestop since it was a great experience for me.
good,"I've really adored how encouraging and motivational my crew at Gamestop has been for me since I've started. They all have their own goals and ambitions; and at my last job this would really frighten people and they'd be petty and unsupportive. Here I feel like my opinion is valid, my voice is heard, and in turn I'm able to service people of all ages comfortably in my own store. I love getting little kids in because they are so very excited to see everything. Just warms up my little gross heart! Figuring out our SKU system has also been very satisfying to learn about because it seemed so complicated at first, but I know I'll get it all down in time."
good,"Great, fun place to work. The environment is always exciting with new releases every week. With this job, I really get to geek out with employees and customers about games, movies, and other memorabilia sold throughout the company."
good,Healthy workplace culture within the District level.  Very exciting place to work if you are passionate about gaming.  There is an opportunity for the company to address staffing needs and employee workload.
good,I got to learn what it meant to be patient and deal with people that are not always going to agree or understand what you are trying to explain to them. I also had a great staff to work with that made every day interesting.
good,"It was fine i dont get why i need to fill this out, it seems like a waste of my time to fill out my review of a location that no longer even has the same manager. Thanks for the help?"
good,"Being a gamer myself, I can say that talking about games is something I'm keen to. Selling video games would of course be easy if that's what you love to do. But working for GameStop can be tricky because of what you have to keep up with. Pushing the idea of sale to a customer is the key part, convincing them to save money while spending money. It taught me how to communicate with the customer and keep their attention on saving money."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Gamestop. I worked at a great store with fun coworkers. It was fun to work with video games and assist customers on a daily basis. However, Gamestop is still a retail store and sales goals have to be met on a daily basis as well. You must be strong and confident in your speaking abilities if you want to succeed. I also did not agree with many of the corporate actions and practices sent down to us. I felt a lot of them were unnecessary and did not help the stores or the individuals working there. It is also a lot of tedious work, and the days can ether drag on or be extremely busy, especially on holidays or big market events."
good,"A typical work day was organizing all games in alphabetical order, unloading new inventory, and ensuring customer satisfaction. I learned to give it my all with any and everything I do, because you do not know who is watching. Management was good, and also very wise, not only when it came to video games, but also with cars, life, etc. The workforce culture was very relaxed; everyone I worked with taught me something that I can apply to my own life. The hardest part about the job was dealing with customers who were more knowledgeable than myself, but the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the smiles on the faces of all satisfied customers."
good,It takes up a lot of your day and they expect a lot out of you. It's worth it if you love video games. If that's what you enjoy then it's a great job.
good,"Working in a store that specializes in video games is a dream come true for a lot of teens but when you are an adult that loves it, you will enjoy every second that you are working here. I met some very interesting people at Game Stop"
good,"Even though this job was seasonal, it was an amazing and fun place to work.  The management were really great with not only the customers, but the employees as well."
good,"I enjoyed the job, it was fun and interesting experience. I was only a seasonal hire though so, I had very few hours. I would only recommend ​this job as a second job because of the low pay and hours."
good,I was asked to organise and check stocks and help customers find something they need in the store and what i learned was to be patient and how to respect difficult customers.
good,Best part of working for Gamestop was the discount on games. I enjoyed talking the customers about the newest game systems and games. I would recommend anyone who loves games to work there.
good,"Great Atmosphere, people who came brought new personalities which made the job exciting. Management was good. Hours were short. Co-Workers were fun and share same passion for games."
good,"Gamestop taught me how to sell video games, which helped me learn that I can use those selling techniques to sell anything in future jobs. I enjoyed the company very much."
good,"work days normally are around 2.5-3hr shifts typically in the closing time frame."
good,"aiutavo i clienti a scegliere i prodotti, consigliandoli"
good,"It was fun starting out, but after being there so long I just figured its time for something new. I have a family now and its hard to spend a lot of time with them."
good,"I greeted customers on sales floor and ask certain make, model  and quality of merchandise desired"
good,"Best company I have ever worked for. They value their employees & do whatever it takes to keep the culture a family vibe. The compensation is amazing, and there is plenty of opportunity for growth."
good,"amazing people an culture, great experience just wish i could have had more hours. met a lot of people an made some good friends and connections. great company."
good,"- growing, learning and mentoring opportunity."
good,"This is a job that almost any kid or adult can perform, but is very fun if you are into video games. I loved working at GameStop. The managers were loads of fun and were very helpful, positive, and fun."
good,"This job was amazing. It was a laid back job. The pay was low, but it was very easy work. The most difficult thing to deal with is the unruly customer every now and then (honestly rare). Management was always helping as if they were just entry level themselves. It was nice to build a relationship with the customers and enjoy the talks with them."
good,if you are into electronics and video games and can talk about it all day and push the sales to people then you will do great here. not a lot of hours but such a fun environment
good,"La giornata lavorativa comprendeva 8 ore con due pause da 10 minuti e 1 ora di mensa, ottimo ambiente, colleghi e capi disponibili."
good,"Good place to work."
good,I felt like a valuable member of the staff and worked under a manager that I really enjoyed working for. I enjoyed helping people find the products that they were looking for as well as dispelling the misconceptions some costumers had about the products that we sold.
good,"I'd alphabetize the video game wall, tend to customers, attend the cash register, and clean when we are closing the store. i learned about cleanliness and order. It was a bit strict. everyone was cherry and were well with the customers. hardest part was it just being my first job and not having any work experiance. most people were very energetic and friendly as were the customers"
good,What would usually be easy like running a register turns into a chore when people try to fight trade in values set by corporate that we have no control over. Corporate values customers over employees in every way. Managers have been fantastic and have tried to teach everything they can but the short hours given by corporate don't allow full training as I know there are things I should know to do that I still have no idea about. Coworkers support each other and will assist with anything I have questions about. The only thing I can say I dislike are the rude customers that try to fight corporate policies that we cannot control.
good,"This company was not only a great learning experience, as I was able to work with the public, it was also an opportunity to with inventory and solve daily problems"
good,When I worked at GameStop it wasn't as great as I thought it would be. I didn't expect much from it but the way corporate set up how they wanted sales was overly complicated and pretty much pointless hoops to jump though just to sell video games and and video game related products.
good,Great environment great coworkers great management a pleasure to see customers excited buying what they were looking for exactly and there is no hard parts to this job
good,"All the games. Tournaments, people, accessories, systems, customer service. Was a great place to work, it was also close to places to eat and Walmart."
good,"The best part about working at GameStop is definitely being able to (and encouraged to) talk to customers in depth about games they like and things that interest them. That allows me to learn more about our clientele, and therefore sell and suggest the appropriate items. Spending time with the customers really made it seem less like work. Most of my coworkers and management team were friendly and easy to get along with!"
good,The company is fine to work for. The store leadership is fantastic but the upper management will treat the store leaders like chikdren if they deem it required to make more profit and will not consider outside situations.
good,If you are looking to move up in this company you're gonna have to work for the company for a very long time. Only raise you get is once a year at the begining of the year around February. But if you are looking for a decent past time extra job it's a perfect place to work.
good,I love working at gamestop. The people I work with really make me feel welcome and like I am part of the team. They teach me what I don't know and always help me improve my position in the store.
good,Everyone is nice and very friendly. Helping customers find the right game is an amazing feeling. I'm sad I had to move and quit the job.
good,"This job was a dream job. I loved working with the co-workers, and even the bad days were great. Really wish I could have kept working their. After the new manager came in she started cleaning house to put people she wanted o work there."
good,Love the place sad I had to leave but it just lacke hours. But I've learned techniques on how to use a gamestop's transaction computer system. I've also learned of how business work together like a family.
good,"GameStop is fun to work at, especially if you like tasks like alphabetizing and organizing. Staff are so great to work with. The computers might not be great but they are easy to learn. Training for new releases and policies are on the computer and really helps to keep updated on the products and requirements. Hardest part of the job is remembering all of the sales and promotions. Best part of the job is the customers. Most people who come in know what they want and are easy to help find what they need. Helps if you have prior gaming knowledge. Most days consist of cashing out customers, organizing shelves, taking in trades, and welcoming customers and asking if they need any assistance. GameStop tries to give back to their employees, once I got a year subscription to Xbox Live. The discount is good too."
good,"Game stop made me gain experience, if you work the right way is a company that you could grow in it. it would be worth it. my first job and i feel like an expert after."
good,"as long as you can deal with crazy customers from time to time and know how to put things in alphabetical order, starting out at this position will be easy, have a good and hard working attitude and you could move up in this company. its really fun if you like these types of things."
good,i learned alot of things from Gamestop and met great people. I cannot take from granted the skill I acquired there and will always cherish it.
good,"Great entry level place, great leaders and associates. Can be stressful due to lack of payroll at times, but everything works itself out. Out of the years I've spent doing different promotions and sales, it can be a welcomed challenge for up-and-comers."
good,"Worked as a student for free, part of a program for work experience. The job was fun and taught me a bit of working. Helped get me experience to find a job on my own."
good,"During my time there had its ups and down. When i first joined it was very hands on, i always had someone there to help me when i needed questions answered. but as time went on i eventually got promoted but with no interview or level up training. i was just thrown into the postion with really no training and sometimes i was left on my own to figure things out. When this started to happen i decided it wasnt the best fit for me, so that's when i left gamestop and decided that it was time to for me to go back to school"
good,"Check daily goals, organize games in drawers. Alphabetical order each games in there category. advise customer on the latest games and accessories. get pre orders on up coming new items."
good,"Work was a fun and creative atmosphere. You are able to have genuine conversations with customer to help them make decisions for purchases. The Management was positive and helpful and it helps you enjoy what you are doing. "
good,Management was great as well as other co workers. I learned how to listen to the customer's desires in order to better suggest a product they desired.
good,I've very much enjoyed being with this company. All of the staff and management are kind and understanding. It's easy to get along with coworkers due to common interests.
good,Great job if you looking for a first time job in high school or college that has potential to become a possible career. If you have the right attitude and are motivated!
good,I organized games for Four hours. They taught me how to set pre order games and how to look in the updates. The management was cool everyone was very professional. There was really nothing hard about working at GameStop or Maeshalls. Best moment was it was calm cool and melow.
good,Great company to work for. Very friendly co-workers and management. Very positive work setting. Anniversary and birthday parties for corporate employees. Two thumbs up!!
good,"I had love the gaming culture and it fit well with me. I love when as an employee, you're able to take home games 4 days at a time to enhance salesman and product knowledge."
good,"further, some organizations try to adapt and apply their performance appraisal rating scales to the selection process, which generally does not work very well, as these two human resources practices are quite different, both in intent and format. Performance appraisal is looking backward at actual experience over an extended period of time (generally a year); interviews are looking at behavioral examples from different jobs and experiences and projecting forward trying to predict future fit in a particular job."
good,"Overall GameStop has been a huge growing experience for me. The last 8 years have taught me discipline, time management, patience, and most importantly that the customer is always first. I've developed close relationships with many co-workers and managers over the years. I'd say the hardest part of my job would just be the randomness of my schedule, I don't have the same days off consistently. The best part though is the atmosphere of the job, it's a very inviting and friendly place where anyone is welcome."
good,Would consider it a most excellent job for those in high school as well as those in college looking for work. Although the management may very in terms of success it is a great way to take a step towards experience in the job market.
good,GameStop was my very first retail job. I learned a lot about working in that environment during my time there. This place is great for starting out in retail due to the small team and very specific customer base.
good,Working with video games in general was a job. The costumer service is spot on and everyone always seems to leave happy. The game organizing system is a little outdated and definitely needs some work
good,"Min tid på GameStop var en fantastisk erfarenhet där jag fick lära mig så oroligt mycket om säljaryrket, hur man bemöter kunder, att hålla sig uppdaterad inom det senaste och att ta initiativ."
good,"very organized structure always willing to make changes to better their customer service, taking constant feedback from the guest"
good,I would work for them again they are good company to work for and they treat there employees with the upmost respect and make it a family type environment
good,"I worked at Gamestop as a seasonal, so I expected to work once or twice a week. However, I wound up working only four days over the course of three months, and went one whole month without working before I was laid off. "
good,I like work at GameStop because I like working in customer service. I learned a lot current and past video games. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people what they are looking for.
good,"GameStop higher ups are really cool, but, of course, expectations are always high. If we do not uphold everything to perfection, then the repercussions tend to be severe. "
good,"I learned to always pay attention to your surroundings,  kids come in after school to play the games, the adults who bought the games flipped them and came to trade them right back in."
good,It was a very cool and collected environment even around the holiday season. I loved my job as a seasonal hire. The job was simple and the people it attracted i loved to serve. I really loved my coworkers they were very accepting of me as a new worker and helped me learn everything i needed to be successful in doing my job. They encouraged me and they also kept me on my toes so that i would not do anything wrong. According to the manager our specific gamestop was within the top two percent in the company as far as sales and production goes. I was even impressed myself. overall i loved my job and i would definitely go back given the opportunity to advance in a career.
good,"I only worked here for a very short time, but I had a great experience that I wish could've lasted longer. The work schedule changed weekly and revolved more around the employees than I thought it would be; management was very flexible in how they set up the shifts for the week. At first it was difficult trying to figure out where everything was, or how to properly assist the clientele with all of their needs, or remembering to clock out on time (though the last one is probably because I loved working there). After my second week there, however, I started to get into the rhythm of it all. I thoroughly enjoyed helping clients figure out the best games/consoles/accessories to buy for themselves or their children or as gifts for others. I also learned how to better manage my time when dealing with multiple customers at a time. My coworkers were always kind and treated me almost like family. I think the hardest part about working there, for me, was ending my shift."
good,"Fun Job, Not to stressful, Entertaining environment, I had a fantastic manager and assistant manager while working there."
good,Working for Gamestop isn't what it seems to everyone. Its actually quite mentality demanding as far as what is required of you on a day to day based. You talk video games sometimes but most of the time you're trying to sell products that you don't believe in. With the Gaming Industry moving towards Digital format for games Gamestop won't be around for the years to come.
good,"I enjoyed my time here. We were given quite a bit of enjoyable work, and the customer base was great. I loved being able to discuss products and services with customers, and I truly loved my time with my coworkers."
good,"It was a Great Job, and they were a great company to work at. I'd still be working there happily if it wasn't for the fact I was hired seasonally."
good,"Great job, great people, had fun doing it, just wish that there was some sort of, you're not being kept on after seasonal talk"
good,Working at gamestop has given me alot of customer service experience as well as retail. There are somethings that can be addressed such as the low pay for anyone not management and the lack of payroll.
good,"Long Story Short."
good,"Great place to work. Fun, fast paced environment. I loved the people I worked with. I always enjoyed going into work everyday."
good,Fast-paced work environment with a lot of moving parts.  Great company culture with a strong organizational structure.
good,Working for GameStop is a good environment to be in for great retail and customer service experience.  Most of the customers are nice laid back people who share the hobby of video games.  The staff is fun and friendly while also maintaining an acceptable level of professionalism in the workplace.
good,GameStop is a fun place to work and the Management is fantastic.  my personal favorite is that you are exposed to all sorts of different people and you get to learn about them while helping out
good,"Working at GameStop taught me many new skills like working a register and I was able to meet a lot of friendly people who made me feel welcomed the minute I started working with them. There are times when I have to deal with rude customers, but I always make sure to keep a cool mind at work and remain calm. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I'm able to help a customer with their problems because I always love to help others and it gains loyalty points with them."
good,management is willing to work with those who are willing to learn.  Also they are looking to progress rather than doing the same old thing everyday and failing at it.
good,On a typical day as i started my shift i would make sure all customers were helped and made sure everything was organized.Checked inventory making sure what games were needed to be restocked.
good,"GameStop has changed for the better over the years and so long as your manager cares, your time on the job will be enjoyable. It's hard not to like the job, so long as you can handle the customers."
good,worked for 3 years loved working there but they started to get rid of the old staff to move in new staff cause that's what the district  management wanted. luckily i found a better job before i ended up quitting
good,"I loved my job at Gamestop, but there were never enough hours to go around for my coworkers and myself."
good,Great work place. Learned a lot about different games. The management are ok. I have wonderful co-workers. It's easy can't complain. Fun working with my co-workers!
good,"I genuinely loved working here and it gave me so many opportunities to grow professionally and personally.  It does have quite a bit to do with numbers, but if you know and listen to your customers, then the numbers will follow.  "
good,"organizing games, handling customers, not a hard job, time goes by fast when you can talk to people about the games, hours are a little scarce"
good,"A standard day at GameStop entails a number of responsibilities. Main tasks include processing incoming and outgoing shipment, interacting with and assisting any customers in the store, accurately maintaining the tills, completing inventory scans and price changes, ensuring a clean and organized store, and supervising/directing my subordinates while working with my superiors to maximize our store's sales potential."
good,Game Stop is a very nice company to work for and works well around the demands of school and family especially if you are brought in at a lower level position. Managers still get some of the time that they need but they are full time employees so there is a little less wiggle room. There is ample opportunity to move up if you are a good hardworking employee within a couple of years but if you are a slacker you will not move forward as there are always hard workers looking for management positions.
good,"GameStop Corporate is a busy environment supporting domestic and international stores. The IT department is a tight knit group that demands the best from their employees, but treats them like humans with families and lives outside for the office."
good,The job was enjoyable for the most part and I loved my co-workers but being a shift manager for 3 years and only getting paid $8.50 an hour wasn't cutting it or paying the bills. I highly suggest getting a second job while working for GameStop.
good,"fun, usually a fun and exciting place, loved going to work everyday, managers were fun, benefits were good. great job overall loved it"
good,"I LOVED working at Gamestop.. the 12 hours a week that I actually worked. I dont know if all Gamestops are like this but where I worked, I was only there 3 times a week, 4 hour a day, and you are started at minimum wage. IF THEY WOULD GIVE ME MORE HOURS it would be an amazing job, but they are really cheap with hours for some reason. Even after I was there for 6 months. The most hours I worked in a week was 25, but that was only with 2 midnight releases on the same week."
good,"Fun job "
good,"Working at Gamestop can be a fun experience if you're into games. All of the employees are pretty lax and the job isn't high stress. Also, unlike most retail, the customers aren't bad outside of a few stray cases. It is a minimum wage job, but for what you do, it's a reasonable pay wage. The only bad thing for me was having to gut games which hurt a little inside, other than that, all was well."
good,"Unfocused business model. Consistent change in focus for driving sales and profit almost daily. Management gives unclear directives and has too high expectations for how unclear they are. Co-workers are incredible, customers are great as long as you know how to give good customer service. Hardest part of the job is keeping corporate happy. You can get the highest attach ratio to sales, highest reservation numbers in the district, get great customer surveys but there's always something they come up with that makes you a bad employee. Everything else is great!"
good,A second family to me. This is the place that gave me the opportunity to improve myself in all possible thinking ways as human being and as a professional worker.
good,"Fun, but aggressive sales will push out the weak.  Gamers will love it and non-gamers will hate it, a lot of work but still can be quite fun"
good,"The only stressful part was dealing with multiple customers at once. For the most part, it was very relaxed and everyone wanted to help out everyone. Managers were willing to let you make mistakes in order to learn as well as answer any questions you may have had."
good,Very good structured internship program. Learned a lot and felt like a regular employee. Was part of a small team and everyone made sure I was included. Big Company but never felt too big.
good,"I would work anywhere between 4 and 9 hours 2 to 5 times within a week.  The coworkers were enjoyable to work alongside.  Management was helpful and firm about the rules.  The most difficult part of the job was making recommendations to non-gaming customers, being the holiday season.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to discuss with coworkers and customers about current and upcoming games and find out their own experiences with a common hobby."
good,enjoyed my time there great workers and environment it was easy and free flowing i would love to work there again at the age i am now.
good,very good place stock games pack games etc.very detail place learned a lot about video games and stuff .workers are nice
good,Typically you were talking to talking to customers if they were looking for something in particular or had questions about what was in the games themselves.  Many parents want to know what has their kids so interested or what the ESRB rating/warnings are all about.  Really a great place to work.
good,Accepted incoming products and opened the store before the first customers started to show up to look for games and gaming systems. Continued to maintain store cleanliness and sell the perfect product for the customer's needs.
good,"Definitely fast paced. if you're going to school and want a part time job, GameStop is a great place. Plus you get to know the latest in the gaming world."
good,"Working at gamestop for the first time was interesting to a point, that it helped me to become a better Sales associate. Gamestop has helped me become more confident and organized to where I can multitask, getting customers into buying are products and keeping the Retail store fresh."
good,"GameStop, Inc. is a good job for either a high-school student or someone interested in pursuing a career in video games. The job itself offers great hours and is great for developing customer service skills."
good,great pay. fun environment. upper management was great to work for. hours were very inconsistent. Pay was great along with management was good to work for.
good,the work day was long and from time to time very repetitive. i learned not everyone has a videogame preference but has a gamesystem preference. the management was excellent. my coworkers were passionate about the products. the hardest part was seeing all the games i wasnt able to play due to work. it was very enjoyable i mean who doesnt love to be surrounded by the lastest and greatest videogames and gamesystems.
good,"very fun place to work if you love video games, a great place to interact with customers and give them your opinion on what games you recommend"
good,fun place to work but i'm looking for something new. nice people great customers.good perks of working as a manager for this compny
good,"Great place to work if your a gaming fan. Great discounts, great customers, great atmosphere. Fun employees to work with."
good,I enjoyed working at Gamestop. even though my time with them was short I had a wonderful experience. The workers were great and considerate. They were willing to teach me when I did not know something.
good,"Good place to work"
good,"every day is a different day, some days you will have to file and sort out received games and some days everything will get done early so we will have to clean the entire store. but one thing was always the same and that was delivering an engaging customer experience, ensuring that the customer leaves happy."
good,I love working for gamestop. During the holidays it gets hectic but overall a great staff to work with. Regular gamers including some baltimore ravens players make the day go by quickly.
good,"All around this place is great to work at. it has great benefits, Excellent ways to get to know the product and plenty of opportunities to move up in the company, traininng can feel obsolete so you have to learn fast"
good,Working at GameStop was exactly what I had expected it to be. The co-workers there were very nice and awesome people. I learned how to sell products to customers for the first time. Although it was hard to sell iPods to customers that were thinking about buying one. GameStop was my first retail store that I've ever worked in and I enjoyed my time there.
good,Excellent store support with some of the greatest staff I've ever worked with. Management loved their employees and treated them with the utmost respect. Minimal hours on the store side left Store Managers often running things with single coverage and a long list of tasks. More often then not the Store Manager will be staying late most nights trying to complete them.
good,"•       Help customers with games."
good,I really enjoy the time I have while working at Gamestop. The staff is easy going and are always willing to help.
good,"Each day would start off with the morning price changes followed by the daily cleaning of the store and processing any left over stock from the previous day, I got on well with both management and other members of the team, the hardest part of the job was all the extra insurance and loyalty cards we had to attach to each sale"
good,"Easy and fun sales driven job. If you like video games,  this is the job for you.   An in between job for older people.  But perfect for teenagers just starting out."
good,"This job is great for those who have a deep love for the video game industry and sharing that love with other fans. The pay and benefits do not stack up against other companies that i've worked for, but the engagement you can have with fellow employees and customers can be rewarding. Retail will always be a game of numbers and customer complaints no matter how good your customer service is, but a strong management team at these locations can bring a rewarding place to work. Good place to begin learning about sales techniques."
good,not to bad first time job not what I was expecting and management sucked
good,"Il mio lavoro alla Gamestop è stato molto produttivo e soddisfacente."
good,"Nice Place to Work"
good,Gamestop works to promote forward thinking in their company
good,"Honestly if I could work at Game Stop again I would cause honestly it was a good work experience. There was only a couple of things that made working there bleh and that was pretty much the district manager. It's honestly a good job and you have potential to get promotions pretty easily as long as you are determined and get a great amount of subs. "
good,"An average day at work is an overall productive, busy and fun time. The co-workers and management were easy to get along with, extremely respectful and help each other when needed. It is very enjoyable talking and helping out the customers with their questions, however the duties get more strenuous during the holiday season, making Christmas time the most difficult time of the job. Even so I enjoyed the experience and learned much from it."
good,"good perks "
good,"Considering my college interests, this job provided me very useful information and experience.  I stocked shelves and helped all customers that came in the store, advising and selling video game products. Management and coworkers were all reasonable and easy to work with, smooth work environment all around.  The job didn't really strike me as hard at all, I enjoyed it thoroughly."
good,"Being a retail job, I was a little worried. However, being a gamer and working with 3-4 others with the same interests everyday made it easy to feel comfortable at work. And seeing as they sell games, I have a good amount of knowledge of the stock without any specific training on the subject. I would have to say being surrounded by co-workers and customers all with a similar interest really made the job much easier for me. One of my all time favorite jobs that I have had."
good,"Work was fast paced but enjoyable. Some times during the year, specifically holidays, could get stressfull."
good,checked inventory and restocked. Helped customers with their decisions on different products to buy. Helped reserve products that were coming out. The most enjoyable part of the job is customer satisfaction
good,loved working there only thing is they require you to get preorders and that is based on store hours but they do not do commission which would be a better benefit for the workers.
good,"Fun place to work, if management did not keep changing I could have made it a career."
good,Spoke to different people across the country daily in which I enjoyed over the phone.Team work and support was available when resolving customer issues. While working there I've learned that both men and women can be passionate gamer and that games are not just for the children but for everyone.
good,"My coworkers all enjoyed the product we sold, and were an energetic, hard working group of individuals. The managers were always there working alongside the lower level employees, giving advice and helping when needed."
good,If you are a people person that enjoy video games this job is for you!  You sell loyalty programs more than video games.
good,"Working with customers helped with strengthening people skills a normal day making sure inventory was organized and store was presentable. excellent co-workers and management, hardest part was dealing with upset customers, but the enjoyable part of the job was no strict dress code."
good,"When i was working at GameStop i enjoyed helping the customers find the games that they are looking for and talking to them about their game experiences. I learned how to restock shelves, Re-label, cashier and customer service.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with upset customers with non trade in items. The most enjoyable part was talking to my co-workers about games and consoles."
good,"- A typical day at work can be fast or slow, but still be fun working with other employee about topic relevancy. "
good,"Since this is my fifth week in, it's still hard to fully grasp a full day's work.  The most important part outside of best-in-class customer service, is signing people up for Pro Memberships and reserve upcoming titles.  It's fun, but you still feel pressure.  I was hired in as an Assistant Store Manager, so I had to be quick on my feet to learn everything from the ground up. I'm finally there, but now I'm moving on to managerial duties such as marketing for the following day, setting up for new game releases, etc.  My manager has always been helpful and continues to be great leading the way and never getting annoyed, no matter how much help I need or questions I may ask."
good,"As someone who came out of working retail for a couple of years, this has to be the easiest and most progressive retail job I've had. The management is set to help you and not just get on your knees for the customer. Advancement for myself has been rewarded quicker than any position I've ever had anywhere else and the tasks aren't difficult and life slaving."
good,"This environment was extremely fast paced and was actually more of a sales job than a regular retail job. We were very focused on customer service and having a positive attitude no matter what. "
good,"Described use and operation of merchandise to customers. Received and processed cash and credit payments for in-store purchases. Opened and closed the store, including counting cash, opening and closing cash registers and created staff assignments. "
good,"The products that are sold in store are always changing, so every week is always something new. You meet new people everyday making work fun and productive because social experiences are never the same. Here at Gamestop, I learned valuable customer service experience which is my personal favorite aspect about working here, as well as handling money transactions ranging from $20 as high as $2,000. I learned fast and everyday gets easier and easier."
good,"What I learned while working at Game Stop was the different kinds of people I'd be getting used to in the retail industry on a daily basis, the mom's and dad's, the core gamers, the casual players, that sort of crowd. I learned the register and how to keep the floor presentable on a daily basis."
good,If you're a gamer working with games is great. I worked there for 3 years and the experience working with my co-workers was amazing.
good,"I was hired on as a shift manager/Senior Game Adviser A typical day was for me to open the store alone. I would go in at 9 am and set the registers, then take the bank deposit. During the day I was to count inventory, and take in any shipments. We are to keep the store at all times alphabetized and up to date (marketing). We were also in control of the marketing in the store. We also had store to store transfers and contact with our DM at all times to discuss weekly goals. Once a week I would be included in a conference call. If I was to close the store I would shut down the store/registers. Balance out the day for the deposit to be made the next morning. Then would lock up and head home."
good,"At Game Stop, I worked as a sales associate selling and trading games and games systems. I was required to help customers find the games they were looking for and keeping them notified of our current sales and deals. Game Stop was a good fit while I was in college because I had so many duties at school and Game Stop was flexible with hours. I worked on average 20-30 hours a week and made minimum wage. With all the hours I had at Game Stop split between school, radio, and reporting I definitely learned to efficiently manage my time. I enjoyed my coworkers at the store and the manager was really cool and always willing to give me more hours when he could. The hardest part of the job was just dealing with the sheer amount of work. since the payroll was usually small at Game Stop, shifts were long and only two people would close the store. this means that while these two people are busy helping all the customers, there is no one to clean up the mess that accumulates from all the trades we get and games we sell. This would lead to us staying an hour or so later to clean and organize the store for the next morning."
good,There isn't much that I can say about this employer. I was only here for about a week. I was only filling in for someone who wasn't back from maternity leave.
good,"There is not really a normal day at GameStop. I enjoyed this aspect of my job because I was never sure who I was going to meet or what was going to happen before the end of the day. There are weekly assigned task that need to be completed by management. As a manager I would need to do daily inventory counts, answer any emails that were sent out my upper management, and help customers who entered the store. During my time I learned how to better my customer service skills. I also worked hard at becoming a top quality manager to insure a promoted within the company. My co-workers were very helpful and knowledgeable people. I really enjoyed working with all of them on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job could also be one of the most rewarding parts as well. Dealing with a customers who is unsatisfied with a product that was sold to them or the help they received the previous time they were in is always difficult. It was very rewarding when I could listen to there problems and help them find a solution, thus gaining a new regular customer who I enjoyed seeing on a regular basis."
good,"This job attracts high energy, technology savvy individuals. Most staffs are between 7-12 employees in size. Average workweek could range from 45-80 hours. most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with people who are passionate about their entertainment. Worst part is the inability to maintain a work/life balance as a salaried manager."
good,"A typical day at work starts with jumping right into transactions with customers and greeting and offering help to every customer out on the floor leaving no one behind. Then when the customers have all been addressed I log in to our workday browser to check the objectives of the day and begin working on what needs to be completed by the end of our work day. Most days require multitasking skills in which you go back and forth between maintaining a clean counter behind the register in which to process trades, addressing customer questions and transactions, while completing  whatever new marketing and stocking objectives that have been set out by the corporate office."
good,"As an assistant store manager my job was to ensure that the day to day operations of the store where kept at peek effectiveness. I oversaw the actions of several measures of my staff to ensure that they where following company policy and providing excellent customer service. My favorite part of the job was the variety that the company afforded me in day to day operations. I was given a weekly time frame in which to complete tasks and was more, or less, allowed to complete the tasks at the time of my own choosing allowing me to balance excellent customer service and effectiveness. While this was an enjoyable part of the job, it was also one of the most difficult as the difficulty of weekly tasks to vary from week to week."
good,"The Louisville, KY GameStop DC is a great place to work a few months out of the year. From September to December, the place is absolutely packed because this is when they do the most of their hiring. Most work days will be 10 hours long and Saturdays are mandatory November through December. However, the paychecks you'll be taking home could be upwards of $2,000 every month. The work is very physically intensive, but the people are great and helpful. Benefits range from insurances to discounts are GameStop stores and partners. However, outside of the few months posted above, the place is dead and unless you have someone else to split your bills with, money quickly becomes scarce. A good place for some quick cash, not a career foothold."
good,"I've learned the basics of software development and testing.  The agile process is new for the organization.  A great place to work, but the pay is below industry average with no real opportunity to advance."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of meeting the customer's satisfaction, meeting our daily sales goals, and keeping the store presentable for every guest who visits us. As a Game Advisor, I learned how to persuade customers by becoming members with us, along with keeping a relationship with each one to ensure they come back and shop with us again. "
good,Great place as long as you can work fast and always are willing to do overtime. The lunch breaks are good too.
good,"Friendly and fun work environment. Took care of customer needs and answered questions to help them find what they need. Sent out and received products. Open and Close the store including bank deposit, counting cash register, product management."
good,"A typical day would consist of daily interactions with customers as well as filing of important documents. I further enhance my customer service skills. My co-workers showed as much passion and dedication as me while at work. The hardest part of my job would be not having enough for the guest, leaving a sad face on somebody's face is always the hardest part about a job to me. The most enjoyable part would have to be realizing you've done all you can for the customer and leaving a smile and a warm welcoming to your environment."
good,Basically had the best team line up for our store. Worked together as a team and did not have arguments 99% of the time.
good,"selling games to customers, talking about something that you like to do whats not to like"
good,"A typical day at work for me (I was a Store Manager) consisted of receiving and processing shipments, assisting customers of all ages, setting up displays for new marketing, ringing customers up, up-selling, etc. A pretty typical retail job in a lot of ways. I really did love my job with GameStop and do miss it a lot on some days. I'm a huge lover of Video Games so it was perfect for me. My District Manager was helpful when I needed her with difficult tasks. The hardest part of my job was meeting monthly sales goals as the gaming industry started suffering when Farmville and the like started becoming more popular and magazine subscriptions weren't as popular as they had once been. The most enjoyable part of my job was finding the right games for customers and having them come back to tell me or a member of my team how much they enjoyed our suggestions."
good,"Work life balance in the Human Resources Department was great. The entire team worked together to ensure a job well done.  A relaxed dressed code was invited, however professionalism was definitely present.  It is wonderful place to work. My Mondays were not dreaded when I worked there.  The down side is that compensation was very low."
good,"Only worked here as seasonal employment. What I witnessed were happy customers and it was always busy all the time until closing, and even then it still seemed busy."
good,Grazie all'esperienza fatta in questa azienda ritengo di aver migliorato la gestione e il rapporto con la clientela innanzitutto. Quindi ho acquisito maggiormente quel concetto di responsabilità che a livello lavorativo è fondamentale sia per te stesso che per l'azienda per la quale lavori perchè tutto proceda per il meglio. Ho migliorato poi le mie capacità organizzative e infine ho avuto un buon rapporto con la maggior parte dei colleghi.
good,"I had great co-workers, and a awesome management staff, basic day to day operation. Midnight releases were surprisingly entertaining. Every once in a while, we get a unsatisfied customer. Hardest part of the job was the end of day clean up. The thing I enjoyed most was interacting with customers who loved games."
good,"Pre orders is what working at Gamestop is all about. Making that sale before the game itself comes out. It's easy if you're outgoing and have great customer service skills. Most days are a breeze if you know how to make a sale. We'll take trade ins and give you store credit or cash. When we don't have customers in store we organize games on the shelves and behind the counter, and clean. Co workers are fun and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is getting pre orders, because thats what the job basically boils down to. Its how you get your hours at the store, earn raises, and move up.   The whole job  itself is really enjoyable, though occasionally the upset customer or two may shake things up and make things tough, I've always been able to deal with the patiently and leave them satisfied and staying with us."
good,"Great people with good insight into sports marketing."
good,"A typical day involved reviewing and understanding promotion and sales goals, ensuring outstanding customer service, and assisting team members. GameStop taught values of efficiency and effectiveness with a focus on customer service. Management was supportive of customer and employee problems alike and co-workers were friendly and hard-working. The hardest part of the job was also the most enjoyable: meeting and exceeding company standards, customer expectations, and sales goals."
good,"Sold games and consoles, answered guest questions about anything in the store, also signed many customers up for ""rewards"" programs"
good,"Good company, room for growth. Always somewhere you can advance too"
good,"If you enjoy video games, then this is the place. Very easy going work environment with an easy level of difficulty. The hours are fairly typical retail except for the occasional midnight release, which depending on location, can be a very enjoyable and sociable time."
good,"The jobs a blast"
good,"Big company, fun to work for but not a lot of room for advancement. At the store level its very bias and it could be very difficult to work there."
good,"I was in charge of my teams production numbers, coached those who didn't meet expectations. I trained and cross- trained employees. Data entry. Management and co-workers were helpful. The hardest part of the job was meeting goals but I made sure they were met. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing all the different games and systems."
good,Generally the District Managers are great to work for. Most that I have met take pretty good care of their employees and do a good job at grooming them for future promotions.
good,"Very often, it feels like a sink or swim scenario. Payroll is tight and there are always new challenges thrown your way with little to no notice. This makes it an interesting environment with the days going by very quickly."
good,"Helping customers and providing them with information that they didn't know of about a particular product. Our store supervisor is great, he works around my schedule and all of my co-workers get along well. Nothing to hard about the job, if you have good knowledge about the video game industry then it's wonderful to work there."
good,I get to talk to customers about games and why would anyone think that's work. 
good,"An ever changing position. Any day would include opening, selling, inventory, recieving shipments, scheduling, etc. The best part of the job was the Customer interactions. I fully enjoyed working with a wide range of employees. "
good,"Honestly not too bad of a place to work.  It truly depends on your management though.  I was lucky in that my store manager and my district manager were both very good people.  I've visited other stores that weren't so blessed. "
good,i loved this store! the managers were great too! i worked for the holiday season and i had a lot of work! i loved working hard for this company and helping customers! 
good,I was payed to sell video games and play them. Who could complain?
good,Nice place to work.  Fun job if you are a gamer and have an upbeat attitude.
good,Starting the day off with a line of excited customers as you open the door and discussing the hot new games they were interested in was fun but often challenging due to the ratio of customers to associates.
good,"My days would depend on wither it was an opening or closing shift"
good,i ran the store with 3 other employee. prossed trades and learned alot about games
good,A good company overall. Depends on your management. Room for advancement depending on your location
good,Great fun. Great atmosphere.
good,"Typically, I will review sales goals and performance summaries at the beginning of every shift to allow myself and my team to know what we are up against. I will do a rolling inventory of new and used consoles. After the store opens, the focus is entirely on the customer... meeting their needs, making them aware of promotions, and providing outstanding customer service."
good,"I enjoyed the fact i was given the opportunity to work with video games everyday. Because it was my first job, I felt like I was good at it because I actually knew what I was talking about to the customers."
good,repair console to like new condition in a timely matter. Management and coworkers are all great to be with.
good,"If you want a easy to keep but highly demanding job this is a great place to work. Anyone who tries, stays positive, and is willing to change how they work on a weekly basis will go far within GameStop."
good,"GameStop was a very nice place. they are respectful, very strict and laid back at the same time. I was able to interact with the customers and not worry about NOT doing my job, because that's apart of it."
good,I loved this job the company was great but the compensation could have been better. I was young when I worked for this company and the dm took advantage of how naive I was and my manager knew what was going on they didn't step in .
good,"1. Long days, a lot of internal theft investigations and interrogations"
good,"Anyone can tell you of retail, what you don't know about GameStop is that they are a competitive and high valued company. They put forth their best efforts in customer satisfaction and employee wellness. Pushing on additional items on customers can become tedious and relentless but its what drives each associate to compete against one another for further advancement in the company."
good,"Work typically consists of selling video games, identifying target consumers through open-ended conversations and using a variety of sales tactics to maximize profits. In my personal experience the majority of supervisors, assistant managers and store managers started out as sales clerks and were easily able to explain sales goals and assist employees in reaching them. The hardest part of the job is customer interaction, knowing how to tailor your pitch based on the consumer's specific needs, but utilizing open-ended conversations tends to yield positive results. The most enjoyable part of the job is having access to a vast library of games and getting an opportunity to converse with both coworkers and customers about a product you are excited about."
good,Interacting with coworkers and customers was enjoyable. Very rarely did we have problems with customers or employees. Did not pay very well. The managers I worked with were amazing. They knew how to have fun but also set goals for the store.
good,"Good place to work. Boss isn't a tyrnat and a cool relaxed guy, which makes things easier. Horrid problems with Corp. sending us games that NO ONE plays so we have 20 copies of it( literally )and no one buys it because they can't stand the game. Also Boss has NO control over total amount of hours he gets which is not good at all. Otherwise, its not a bad work place as I have no problems with my fellow associates nor the corp. that i've met."
good,"A typical day at Gamestop would be a lot of trade ins. I've learned a lot of things at Gamestop since it was my first job such as working a register, how the business operates to keep sales, and how different systems operate. We had great management by preventing a lot of thefts and making sure our store return 100% profit back what we sold. The hardest part of the job was when customers would bring games that wasent even released yet, which means they were stolen. My co-workers and I always got along even if we had a strong belief about something. The best part of my job is knowing that i did a good job and that customers were 100% satisfied."
good,"Working at GameStop has given me more joy in a job that was never meant to be permanent. Within in a typical day, I do inventory counts of both new and pre-owned systems, iDevices within the store, tablets, and new games that have been released. I check in shipment that the store receives every Monday-Friday and send out any shipment that needs to be sent to other stores. I talk with customers about video games and give them advise about what would be best for their child and why."
good,Gamestop was a very vibrant friendly place usually. There's alot of hands-on situations and lots of confrontation with customers. The people at work were generally comforting and enegertic although it was a small number of people that worked at each location.
good,"If you love video games, this job is amazing. Employees can rent games for free. Coworkers all work together to help you and customers with any game related questions you may not know yourself. Customers seems to come in waves. By that I mean it can be slow with only a couple customers in the store one second. Then an army of people come in at the same time the next. The only thing I dislike about this job are the scheduling and the lack of hours. You never know what days or hours you work until the Friday or Saturday before the next week."
good,"A typical work day for me included cleaning, stocking, greeting customers, and sales."
good,"When I worked at GameStop I was only a part-time worker, I helped customers find what they were looking for, rang them up, sorted the games on the walls and helped keep the store front tidy."
good,"On a daily basis, I organize the store and the game walls. I ring up customers and help with customer service. Lastly I conduct closing activities like maintenance and counting the register."
good,"a great place to work, nice environment, good supervisors, nice pay."
good,Great job. Worked in a/c had weekend off.get to get discount on games
good,I loved working there benefits were great and you get to talk about video games all day.
good,"As an associate at Gamestop, inc. you are responsible for greeting customers in an environment that completely focused on fun and entertainment. As one of the largest retailers of video game/electronic entertainment products, every facet of this companies operation is centered around producing sales and creating repeat business. That is accomplished through several unique strategies such as: taking in trades toward new products. Customers may bring in video games, and systems which they no longer use and trade them for cash or credit toward the purchase of newer products, or used products which they've not yet played. Customers are also offered the opportunity to pre-order games that have not yet been released (which often include perks/incentives for pre-ordering) and may apply their trades toward pre-orders for bonus credit. Customers may also purchase subscriptions to Gamestops publication, game informer magazine, which comes with a membership in gamestops rewards program where customers will receive a card which grants them discounts on used products as well as additional bonus's on their trades. Employees are required to suggestively sell these services to customers in order to create repeat business and must encourage/sell subscriptions to gamestops Game Informer magazine."
good,Great company to work for.
good,"I was only there for a day but, you can begin to realize that working at Gamespot is both hectic and enjoyable too. A typical day at work would begin with appearance arrangement: making sure that all the games on the shelves are in order and visually appealing. You have to change advertisement from the ceiling to the windows once and a while. You have to make Gamespot look good to customers visiting so personality and customer service are a must. Management at the time was great and he never gave any of his employees a hard time, including myself. My co-workers were impeccable and they helped me with how to ring people up and how to assist others with efficiency. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the massive inventory and a complicated network. It is a daunting task to look up certain games and making sure you do not make mistakes in selling products that are not cleared yet. The computer system is complex and often complicated but, I probably think that because it was my first day on the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was probably being around the things you like: video games, electronics, and of course, other employees."
good,"The day of a Gamestop employee truly is not a difficult one. It's one filled with educational growth in the knowledge of what you're selling. You are explained the latest and greatest in games, hardware and technology. You organize walls and games and you speak to customers almost every second you're there. Depending on the employees is where it comes down to, normally there is one of two management types. A manager who fully understands the working man and then one who is there for the power rush. That's really all there is to it."
good,"Managing heavily numbers based sales environment through setting expectations and one-on-one conversation, using motivational tactics and developmental training practices."
good,"I love helping and working with people that had the same passion as me towards video game. A typical day at Game Stop was not difficult at all. I had a chance to hold conversation with people about video games, make recommendations to customers, and also play the games. There was always things to learn in gaming community such as learning about the different consoles you have to sell and the accessories that comes along with them, and of course you have to keep up with all the games. I enjoyed working with my coworkers they were all respectful and met the requirement of their job subscription. The hardest part of the job to me was dealing with unsatisfied customers. Some would try to tell u how to do your job or they feel as though customers are always right. But even on those days I still loved that job. The most enjoyable part of the job was playing the games and interact with all types of people. But sadly as much as I liked the job I had to leave. I wanted to fulfill my dream in working in the medical field."
good,"The higher ups expect us to get a million things done EVERYDAY without giving us extra payroll. We are usually working by ourselves while trying to process daily UPS shipments, or weekly store to store shipments, or do daily and weekly inventory counts and they still expect us to give the ultimate customer service by never being behind the cashwrap and always on the sales floor and they expect us to meet our sales goals. With the amount they give us to do it becomes VERY hard to not just get angry whenever a customer walks into the store. Store managers work on salary so they end up staying late and working more than their required 44 hours a week if we have a busy day and can't finish a daily task before close. Ontop of all the tasks they expected us to spend all of our time with the customers, to meet our sales goals and achieve the best customer service. As stressful as this was, from a customers standpoint I would say GameStop is the most trustworthy of all the video game stores. Corporate sets all sale and trade-in prices so every store has the same prices and one customer can't get less than another just because they aren't liked or the employee is in a bad mood. GameStop really tries to be all about the customers, and I love the idea of it because talking to my customers and making them happy was my favorite part of the job, I just think it's really hard to accomplish with the mass amounts of side projects they give us. I met some amazing people while working there and I would definitely work there again, just not as a Store Manager."
good,just make sure that the customers know and understand about the differences in the games and systems
good,"Clock in, meeting, work on game consoles, meeting, clean up, clock out,"
good,the team i worked with was always great helpful and made me feel appresheated even during the most stressful days if i ever needed some kind of help it was quickly provided
good,"My time with this company is memorable.  During my years I was able to develop in to a strong, independent Store Leader, who built and progressed several store team.  My only disappointment was in the edn before my time ended with them."
good,Gamestop as a company needs to know exactly what works and what does not work for them. It needs to listen to it's employees when it comes to individual stores.
good,"Talking to the customers and interacting with them is really fun and enjoyable, but you end up just standing around most of the time. The only benefits were a small discount."
good,"Grazie a Randstad, ho avuto la possibilità di poter intraprendere un'avventura lavorativa stimolante e competitiva! L'approccio che ho avuto con l'agenzia è stato brillante, sempre pronti a chiarire ogni mia difficoltà o dubbio! Nell'azienda dove ho lavorato, lo staff è stato in grado di farmi sentire a casa e ho maturato in poco tempo le fasi di vendita da loro descritte al meglio. Grazie ancora!"
good,"I loved every moment of working at GameStop, I just couldn't stay due to pay. My original crew back in Marion OH became lifelong friends of mine that I still talk to today."
good,Un'ottima esperienza soprattutto per chi non ha mai lavorato
good,"I’ve worked at GameStop for two years. And honestly, it’s pretty fun if you have the right staff. You get insurance and discounts. The inside scoop on video games. However, you don’t get any holiday except Christmas Day off."
good,"Apertura Store, svolgimento delle attività della daily, come variazioni prezzi, cambio del marketing da parete, check controllo prodotti magazzino, accettazione ritiro colli, apertura colli e sistemazione dei prodotti, il tutto durante la vendita in cassa. La parte più difficile, stressare la clientela ad acquistare prodotti e servizi supplementari all'acquisto da loro effettuato. La parte più piacevole quando eravamo in doppia copertura, e la complicità con i colleghi."
good,"I enjoyed working for Gamstop in the time I have been here. Have developed strong relationships with my guests, coworkers, and vendors. Getting to talk with gamers on a daily basis is fun, and enjoy the challenges that arise. I have learned a lot from my time here, and have been taught much from my peers."
good,"If it wasn't for the lower pay spectrum I would of happily stayed with the company. While working here they offered MANY freebies to employees as well as vendors of other systems and company's. Was even offered a free refurbished PS4. Not cost, only had to do a quick survey on the system. Thanks Playstation. My manager was amazing in all the right ways and our midnight releases were ALWAYS a hoot to go to. I miss those days."
good,This is a really nice place to work for. Compensation is not competitive though. Seems like the company is going downhill so chances that you get promoted are very slim.
good,"Though the pay isn't high, it's an enjoyable place to be should you be surrounded by the right people. There are mixed feelings from other employees of gamestop, primarily focused around what Gamestop's values are and how hard corporate pushes them upon their employees. However, I've found over the last couple of years especially they've tried to make it as enjoyable for the common employee as possible."
good,I enjoyed working at gamestop because it was like working with a bunch of my friends. And I love video games and we learned about the newest gaming hardware that came out.
good,"This is a good company to work for that has changed it's business model to stay alive.  With that said, change is constant and can be stressful but the growth opportunity is always there."
good,"If you’re a gamer yourself you’ll probably enjoy working at GameStop. The environment at my store is fairly relaxed and laid back, you receive employee discounts on games and collectibles, and it’s fun nerding out with both customers and other employees. This company gets a lot of flak but as far as cooperations go there are far worse places to work."
good,"It was a really fun place to work and everyone was pretty helpful. Not many hours though and the pay was only minimum wage, but still wasn't a bad job"
good,"I loved every second working at GameStop, from the game releases, to meeting new customers every day and finding some connection to them. The best thing is when you start to get “regular” customers, which are at that point friends you could say and having that gratification. The pay is t the greatest, but it’s worth every second and penny earned.!!"
good,"If you love games and pop culture as much as I do. You would love to work here. As long as you do well, they like to promote and see people succeed. They work very well with your schedule as well."
good,"Overall it was a pretty awesome place to work, everyone there is really nice, Customers were cool, Work was super easy once you get it down, Only problem is the hours, if you work season you wont get a whole lot but beaide that, Great place to work, I give it a 9/10"
good,It was a pleasant experience working there. The hours wasn't bad and the time felt like it flew by because you were always busy.  It is an awesome first job for someone.
good,It's a pretty average retail job. We had fun on the job and got to borrow games so we knew what we were talking about. Experience really varies from store to store.
good,"Gamestop is an amazing place to work and I love it, working with and around people that love video games as much as myself is great. The work load is not too much but can be hefty at times."
good,"Every day we help guests with what they are looking for. Any guests that may have some problems with a product that we have or from another store, we offer a replacement for what they have or another solution. When there are no guests, we work on tasks such as inventory, fixing the floor (the store area), go backs, etc. Hardest part of the job is getting used to it, but gets easier overtime."
good,"I remember when I was little, I always wants to work at GameStop because I thought I would be playing video games all day but that’s not the case at all. It can get pretty hectic sometimes but I believe it’s based on what kind of people you work with. If the work environment is good, the whole experience can be good. It’s on how you make it for yourself"
good,Great place to start learning about customer service. Not alot of hours to go around so the schedule is very flexible. Love working with and for gamers.
good,"I was only a Seasonal employee, but I enjoyed working at GameStop and my coworkers were great and we were all able to relax around each other once we had completed our tasks. The most stressful part about working at GameStop is that there will always be that one customer that walks in and asks you a question you may not know the answer to. However, it can get extremely frustrating when there is a customer that walks in and treats the place like it is their own little kingdom and becomes super demanding and expects each employee to know EVERYTHING. Other than having that one customer, the place was overall welcoming and had no problem taking someone new to the working industry and teach them the ropes."
good,"If you go into this company looking for a laid back place to talk about video games and have fun then you will not be successful, but if you go in knowing that you are there to preform a job and service, and set goals for yourself then you will flourish."
good,"Fun, eventful retail job with business growth and opportunities.Must know sales and be driven to succeed and accomplish comapny set goals. Lots of game bonuses for working in the industry"
good,GameStop is where I grew into my own when it comes to management skills and workplace problem solving. Patience and teamwork were a huge part of the work environment.
good,"I love GameStop and am excited to relocate to another store. However sometimes the needs of the company are put over the needs of the employee. While that isn't always a poor characteristic, in terms of bereavement or school, management isn't always very understanding. There were plenty of times a customers words were taken over mine without consulting with me first and I was in trouble for it."
good,"This is a good place to work if you're okay working two jobs, generally friendly staff. Aside from the occasional bad customer it's a good work environment."
good,"Ambiente aichevole, colleghi predisposti al lavoro di squadra."
good,At Gamestop the company was constantly evolving.  That is a good thing.  When I started we would take games and consoles in trade.  When I left the company we had begun to take in phones and ipods. This shift allowed the company to remain profitable.
good,"I love this job, but it doesn't work well for mothers with new babies. The work life balance is a bit tough. The leadership team is excellent, and the perks are great. I truly love this job and wouldn't leave it, but I need to find something that better meets the needs of my family."
good,"Lavoro su turni. Ho imparato a gestire il registratore di cassa, gestito la clientela anche in singolo, gestione di ticket, soluzioni e riparazioni, consulenza gaming e IT. L'unica situazione impegnativa era gestire i day-one dei giochi più richiesti (AAA), la parte più piacevole era lavorare in team e vedere i clienti andare via soddisfatti."
good,"If you're interested in games you'll enjoy work here, is still a sales job at the end, but talking to customers about the videogames that are coming out is a great bonus"
good,"I greatly enjoyed working for this company. I grew exponentially as a person. My coworkers were professional and hardworking. All in all, it was a great experience."
good,This place was the first job I've ever had. I enjoyed my time there although it was difficult because of the low hours I had. I couldn't even pay for my gas because I wasn't working enough hours. I communicated with many customers and had to educate myself weekly to be able to help them find what they wanted at the end of the day I would clean up the room and make sure the games were listed alphabetically. If I showed better potential I would have been easily promoted to get more hours and better pay.
good,Like all jobs you will find favoritism but the management is laid back so long as you do your job every day. People are allowed to talk in the workplace and it is easy to move up in the company if you show the initiative. The hours can be long but they work with you if the hours are too much for you to handle.
good,"GameStop will be a great Part Time job but not a Full Time. The environment and managing was great but the company, in my opinion, is not heading the direction I feel like it should be going."
good,It’s a new experience. You get to in to so many other topics. I learned a lot of new workplace technique and banter. The register is quick and easy to work.
good,Working here was usually really fun sometimes meeting your sales goals could be stressful. I was not trained to advance myself with this company. I think I would have done better under a different manager.
good,The fellow employees make working there a blast. It can be fast-paced at times but it is still a great place to work. plus the discounts aren't too bad either.
good,I enjoyed working for this company and the perks for working there as well. The only thing I didn’t like was the company goal and their overall mindset. The management that I worked alongside is ultimately what ended up pushing me away. Not bad for a summer job but can exhausting otherwise.
good,"If you like games, and can handle social interaction gamestop is not hard nor difficult for work. Its actually fun. Can be a very enjoyable workplace!"
good,"Days were spent stocking shelves, helping customers find what they were looking for, exchanging customers old games and machines for in store credit or money and selling video games (primarily used video games as that was the best value for customers). The day would also be spent full of interesting conversations with customers and fellow employees."
good,"As an employee I found that most other employees were passionate about gaming.  This enabled the work environment to be positive and fun.  As long as we sold memberships and preorders, the company was happy with our performance."
good,Typical day is busy with many tasks to do and helping customers. There are quotas that are there to shoot for and will have an impact on hours. The hardest part of the job is talking to the many customers that come in or call. When all tasks are completed and business is slow you get to organize the game drawers and cases on the walls. Best part of job is talking about and being around games. Fun place to work at.
good,"Typical day was opening the store and helped when need "
good,"I have been satisfied working here. Only concern of mine is that more often than not, you'll be subject of hour cuts which means way less money than the little you already receive. I greatly appreciate the fact that they worked with my schedule as many don't. However people need money and the job sometimes doesn't feel too rewarding or simply worth it. I tend to go in with a smile but slowly it deteriorates as the day goes by. There's not too much opportunity to move up, even then that's still part time. I would say if you're looking for some pocket change or something flexible and not too demanding, this is it. I'm very grateful for the time and opportunity provided."
good,"A typical day would mean observing your staff and having a positive conversation around improvement and missed opportunities, as well as making sure your presentation of your store is up to company guidelines at all times. I learned that every store is different and that you must find your own way to deal with the onslaught of clashing company memos in the way you see fit. The one thing you can always count on is your regulars. You depend on them to be your voice to other guests when trying to push a new item or explain a benefit of a program offered because to your everyday guest you are "" just salesman"" . The hardest part of the job is trying to combat the negative reputation the company has built for itself while not coming off as insensitive to guests. The most enjoyable aspect of being a manager for this company is having your name on the front of a successful store and guests seeking you and your store out specifically because of your stellar service and attitude."
good,Gamestop is not just a company but a family with a respectable environment. Gamestop provide opportunity for employees to learn earn more as they learn. The management is innovative and always looking for a way to keep the company growing.
good,"The work at Gamestop is pretty easy and all the staff are real friendly and easy to get to know. However if you are looking for a job to live off of steer clear because this is more of a part-time, student kind of job."
good,"If you're looking for a gamer job that's part time and offers advancement, this is the job for you.  Pay is low even for supervisors and lower management.  Job is relaxed, sales focused and competitive in nature.  Management was alright, no complaints, but every store is different due to the small number of employees.  Each store will have a different feel, so if it's not working out transfer out and move up."
good,"Honestly the job is fast paced but worth it, you will be asked to learn some new things/information but its reasonable. Its all about helping the guests who walk in and hitting your numbers like any other job honestly."
good,Good place to work if you are knowledgeable about gaming and electronics. It is very fast paced and you will have to be on your toes. Management is there to help if you need it.
good,Working for a company that sells video games is great. The work environment was great as all my co-workers were friendly and easy to work with. Great store leader and managers.
good,"A typical day at work is you clock in you check any and all messages that where posted. After that check to see what task need to be completed. Check in all the boxes that come in for ups or fed ex. Also greet every guest that walks in. I learned how to multitask while also prioritizing the guest. Management is great as long as you get you work done in a timely fashion and check off all task given to you, culture was laid back at my store but we always beat sales every month. Hardest part of the job was the operations that they had you do juggling that when prioritizing guest was a change especially when you are by yourself during the night. The best part of GameStop is when your regulars come in and they make your day,"
good,Although Game-Stop is a rather nice place to work at in no way is it perfect. Unless you work as ASL or SL your hours and pay are pretty weak. Although it's a rather nice place for a starting job if your looking to gain work experience.
good,I really enjoyed working at Gamestop. My manager was awesome to have around while you were working. He never let anyone get discouraged and if an employee had a question he was always there to help. Would recommend working here.
good,Gamestop is a fine place to work at the environment is semi-pleasant when you don't have rude customers which in its self rarely happens you also have to know the products that are carried in the store.
good,"As a seasonal assistant, my hours were limited but I didn't mind that due to how many people you can greet and have a casual conversation with. While I was there, the staff was very friendly and the environment wasn't hostile at all. I would say probably the hardest part about this job is just dealing with a upset customer but other than that. It's very simple!"
good,"It was a real easy job that would have been much better if the manager was more professional. You get to talk about games to people all day. Discount was pretty good plus sometimes the company would give you a new release for free which was cool. I got the top tier COD Infinite Warfare. The hardest part  of the job was being alone in the mornings because there is not much to do. Once you finish your tasks, just make sure the counter is clean and thats pretty much it."
good,"my time,though brief, working for game stop was all positive, my coworkers did there best to train me up on the things that the company needed from me"
good,The GameStop I a great company to work for in terms of balancing your own life and working for the company. All workers are always friendly and helpful and overall management is usually great. On the down side the pay is very low especially once becoming apart of the management team as I believe store managers start at only 16$ an hour salary for 40hrs a week. Overall not a bad first job but not somewhere really to move up the chain and make great money.
good,"It is really cool to be able to help out customers and be able to connect with them. Also, good place to get to know your mangers or coworkers more. They can also be flexible with your schedule."
good,Balancing act of several items that if perfectly managed can create a engaging and intense sales environment. Not for the feint of heart as you will be required to maintain various entities with excellence.
good,Normally I would get to work and go to the bank to handle the money for the store. Then I would assist guests with all of their transactions. I would rearrange the store and do all the price changes on a weekly basis. I would take in shipment and monitor p&l reports for the year and yearly quarters
good,"Had a great time at Game Stop. The people were nice sometime, but if you listen to what they are looking for it helped to get them in an out. As an employee we were able to borrow game so that we can better help the customer"
good,"I had an amazing time with Gamestop.  Could be that I'm remembering it fondly after being away for so long, but I generally enjoyed the ability to have fun at work, talk about things that interested me, engage people with those same interests, and plan and follow through on some real cool stuff.  My team was great, so honestly I have nothing to complain about."
good,A day at GameStop was a productive day. We had to do an inventory check and put any games or products away or organize the game shelf's. My manager was a very cool guy and i learned a lot from him. i learned you have to be fast and know what to say or talk how to customers.
good,Amazing environment and atmosphere. Always a chance to move up and prove yourself. Flexible scheduling makes it ideal for students or people seeking part-time employment.
good,"Cool job for young guys. Not really what I was looking for at the time. I was promised advancement opportunities that never came. Didn't get enough hours so I found a full-time career with another company. Really enjoyed the job, would've stayed if pay and hours were better."
good,"The only thing about this job was the fact it was a christmas job, therefore I didn't receive too much training, I really wanted to be trained on the tills but sadly there was never enough time for them to teach me properly. That's really the only issue. Other than that it was a great place to work"
good,I have worked at the ROC for 16 years and have enjoyed the people and management. For the most part everyone gets along very well and upper management is trying to improve things.
good,"I loved working at gamestop since it wa around other gamers. It made me happy and feel good about myself. If you like video games work at gamestop. The LAUSD college program at Los Angeles Highschool, helped me get this job."
good,Work environment and work culture is very good. Lot of work compared to the compensation given. Job titles provided do not relate to the educational background. This helps the company to pay less salary and be benefitted.
good,good place to lean something new work as a team  help each other good training  good management focus on customer professional  and strong leadership company
good,I am a gamer at heart and loved working for Gamestop. They were a great high school and holiday job. I enjoyed the employee discounts and benefits. Hard to advance in the company.
good,"It was a pretty nice job, as far as working with different types of culture in the company. The work was also pretty simple and  direct on what your task was for the day."
good,in breve io alla gamestop mi sono trovata bene nel complesso. l'unico problema è che ero a voucher e il salario non era il massimo inoltre non danno molte opportunità di crescita insieme all'azienda.
good,"Fast Paced Retail Company offering opportunities for continuous professional growth. Always at the technological edge, GameStop keeps learning new things the norm."
good,"For years people have told me how bad it was to work at any Gamestop. When I started I was afraid of the truth, now I can fully say that what was said is only partially true. It is a fun work enviroment if you make it so. I have fun with my customers and my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is maintaining knowledge on all things video games and pop culture. If there is a game you have no clue about, or a new fad you haven't heard of yet, it makes the job more difficult when the customer has to explain it to you."
good,"I enjoy my time at Gamestop. The hours are a bit lax but overall it is a fun place to work and most importantly... I am surrounded by gamers! My people! It's a job where I understand the product and know what I am selling. Dealing with the disgruntled customer is never fun but it is the only part of my job that I find stressful. The management is relaxed but focused and promotes us to exceed our goals. Most of everyday I am either working on the walls or helping a customer. It's pretty slow at my store but the people that do come in are super loyal to it and most have become friends with the employees.I learned a lot from this company, and not just cash register operation and customer interaction, but also what it is to actually enjoy the job you have. I would recommend this company to anyone"
good,Management did a overall excellent job when showing the co workers how to run the store efficiently and properly. Never missed a day of work while I was there. matter fact I've never taken a day off.
good,Worked with many different ages groups. The management team was very help full but hardly kept in contact with associates. The hardest part was knowing about games.
good,"Working at Gamestop Was a great way to improve your customer service skills. That is because you interact with guest everyday. Also there were goals that had to met in which helped your prioritizing skills.Management is very helpful at gamestop. They try to assist you the best way they can to help you be successful. The hardest part of the job was assisting angry guest, but the most enjoyable part of gamstop was hosting midnight releases, Also seeing how excited guest got when they purchased the game or system they have been wanting."
good,not the worst place have to be friendly to a lot of mean people but not to bad the managers can go from absolute poo to an amazing golden goose why wont this thing just let me move on alreadfy geez
good,Everyday is exciting to start work and help people find what they're looking for in the ethos of the gaming world. Very easy and manageable. Would recommend working here to the youth.
good,GameStop in really organized in their working schedules. I learned customer service and some administrative skills. Management is decent and strict when required. The coworkers are the best and you get to be surrounded by games all the time.
good,"Its fun and a very interactive workplace, I enjoy when it is slow and we have to stock the shelves with inventory. Also the hardest part of the job would be well there isn't anything hard about it, it is simple but  easy and overall its a great company."
good,this job was fun. you get to be around games all the time. you meet new people and get to gain experience in giving great customer service. management is pretty good and tries to cooperate as much as possible. the environment there was calm. the hardest thing to do there was organize the games alphabetically and talk to total strangers. the most enjoyable part was actually the people you work with and the fact that you are around games.
good,"Most days work by yourself. Its either you close, or you open the store. Learned a lot from management experience. Better understanding and respect for managers. Co-workers, some are good, some are bad like everywhere else. Hardest part of the job is dealing with entitled customers who expect everything FREE. The best part of the job is the workplace environment, Store Managers I'ved work for has been great people who loves their jobs and cares for their workers."
good,"I love the work place, I am also a gamer hence forth the reason i love to sell video games in said company. The typical day at work would consider selling pre-owned video game and pre-owned accessories. Then telling the customers how they can save as well with the power up rewards card."
good,I enjoyed working here. Management was understanding during my divorce. Open door policy with all management. Always had everything i needed to complete my job duties on a daily bases.
good,The job is not hard to do and customers get to know who is helping them. I love what I did at this job and what experience I gain form it
good,"Gamestop was a great experience as it showed me just how vast the world of gaming really is. Dealing with different types of customers, was insightful."
good,"GameStop is an overall amazing experience and an incredible place to work. The customers makes the job so much more rewarding in being able to be friendly and talk about the things you love together. The management can be great, but switches way too often and I have often found that some management in stores and district management are high school friends so a lot of  favoritism plays a huge role in job advancement/ promotions. The co-workers were amazing as we all had a lot in common with the job we loved. I was a senior game advisor so I know how to open and close a store, handle money, making bank runs, being a key holder and more importantly, running a store as if it were my own and performing Store Manager duties when the store manager would never show up for their respective shifts."
good,"Work at Gamestop (provided you find an environment that suits your mood and personality as I did), becomes less of a job. It's almost like you're just going to hang out with friends, selling things on a corner."
good,"For a first job this was everything I could ask for. Located within a mall, everything was convenient. Friendly staff and regular customer liven up the place. Evenings and weekends were the busiest. Favorite part was discussing games with customers ranging from teenagers to grandmothers. The hardest part was getting to work. Public transportation made my commute two hours. Pay wasn’t great."
good,The work environment is very welcoming and the people really make the job. The management are very happy and helpful and always willing to help someone interested in advancing in the company. most enjoyable part of the job has to be working with and learning from the other employees. Everyone there is friendly and receptive.
good,"Typical day you learn your alphabet very well due to running empty cases out to the walls, You will also have to file games into locked drawers in alphabetical order along with making sure that the store looks nice and clean. May occasionally have to restock shelves. Must be able to talk to each and every customer that comes in like they are your guest. Use open ended questions and try to give them the best possible assistance you can."
good,I enjoyed my employment at GameStop. My co-workers and managers were nice and fun to work with. A average was filled with organizing mostly but the customers and atmosphere kept the day exciting.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Gamestop. I would definitely work here again if possible. Management was usually fine, and customers were great as well."
good,Good job for people passionate about videogames and youth culture. Lots of long hours and late nights. Great swag if you become a manager.
good,"I actually really enjoy working here. First off, it's a place where I'm surrounded by something I enjoy, so when a customer comes in I always feel like I'm a great help. A typical day working at gamestop involves greeting customers, trying to encourage a sale of some kind, and helping the customer answer any questions they have about new of existing products that we have. I find that interacting with the customer is the most enjoyable part. I get to know what kind of games they play and what they're into, then make a sale based off of the given information. I always get positive reviews from the games I've recommended."
good,Its the same job i reviewed. Great place to work and fun work ethic. Management is always great and very easy to get along with
good,Working at Gamestop has been a very memorable time for me with all the new and amazing people I have met and helped over the years helping me expand myself as a person and a employee. Working there has help me improve as a team member and help solve veriest  problems that would accrue at the work place. The hardest part about working at Gamestop is the the debate on whos idea of making the workplace more efficient in terms of getting task done and helping store profit were more effective. I am the type of person who is thinking about what's best and fair for the people and would fight for the benefit of my fellow employees and customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the great people i have met over the time being there and learning knew thing with them. The act of coming together on common ground talking and enjoying each other in a fun and safe environment is always the best.
good,Game stop is a great place to work out! It has a great environment and all the staff and customers are nice and easy to get along with
good,A typical day at work is just organizing games in alphabetical order and adding games on the wall. The management at gamestop was quite impressive
good,"talking to customers about video games and what they like and what you recommend."
good,"As my first job, it was a nice experience. I was always a frequent customer and was an even more proud employee. I didn't like the lack of hours, which was equated to the lack of need of so many employees at so many times. But to maintain it's ability to hire part timers, there were not enough hours to go around, so I was on the clock 3 or 4 days out of the week at most. I learned a lot (customer service, how companies make profits, Point of Sale operations, etc.) since it was my first job. I enjoyed my coworkers; they were the perfect companions for anyone who enjoys video games and pop culture. The hardest part was remembering to complete the video game/quiz show style training system they implemented about halfway through my employment; the most enjoyable was simply the environment itself (the coworkers, the customers, the products)."
good,"As store manager I was responsible for a team of 10-16 employees. My job was to supervise, train, create different strategic plans to always be above the Goals set by the company and making sure my team is doing a great customer services. I had to make schedules, participation conference call, knowledge with the P & L to improve the costs of the company and make different action plans to work in the areas of opportunity and create better Gross Margin for the company."
good,"A typical day varied while I was there some days it was really busy others it was completely dead. I was there with a manager for the most part and I was given my tasks for the day to go along with my weekly sales goals. I learned how to comfortable speaking to strangers,sales methods, organizational skills, some networking skills, overall just learning how to be an effective salesman. My Managers were amazing very patient and understanding both them and the rest of co-workers felt like family. The hardest part was keeping up with sales quotas at time because of the traffic fluctuations in the store , my store manager always strived to be the best and pushed us to do the same so our goals were set much higher than other stores in the district. I can say the most enjoyable parts about the job was the interactions with the people , game releases , making friends, and customers that valued my opinion on the games that they should play."
good,associating with customers helping therm find what there looking for. I like interacting with people ive learned how to make a sale on the floor. Hardest part is not being a able to close a deal wit a customer.
good,"Employees all loved what they were talking about. They wanted nothing more than to give the customer the best experience and prices (employee's get no cut of profit no matter how much is sold by a given person). Some customers of course would not like some of the polices gamestop had (trade-in values, authorized Government ID for every Credit/Debit card transaction) but when it came to the actual people working, it was hands down a such a calm and refreshing environment."
good,"Not a bad place to get your foot in the door (as the title suggests)."
good,"GameStop can be a fun place to work depending on store location and coworkers. Your manager also will make or break your experience. Customers can be difficult to deal with because most of them will either be completely uneducated in any type of video game know-how or just give you really horrible attitudes, but, once again, depends on location of your store. I've worked at both awful stores will terrible management and customers and amazing stores with an excellent environment and wonderful coworkers and customers. If you aren't into video games or don't know much about the video game culture, working there is not for you. Don't go into this job thinking it's all fun and games but it does get very stressful at times. GAs (or the lowest rung on the totem pole) will get almost no hours so do not expect anywhere near 40 hours unless you're some type of manager. All in all though, it is a pleasant experience."
good,A great place to sell something I have a passion for. Can be difficult to deal with big launch titles but the joy from customers when they get a game they have been waiting for makes it worth it.
good,Gamestop is a stress free environment and an overall great company to work for. The management is great an the atmosphere is  enjoyable.
good,Great place to work if you love games and a challenge. Competive environment to a degree but always fun. A great place to meet a wide variety of customers.
good,"GameStop has been an ever evolving company as the years go on. Less from sales and numbers to the employees and customers. Most days start with simple cleaning and customer care. Work never piles up because my co-workers and I work as a team and know what needs to get done first. This leads to a much easier day for all of us to enjoy what we do, talk about games. The only time the job gets a little more difficult is when dealing with customers that are less than happy. But with our out of the box approach, we are almost always able to solve any situation. This has helped me grow as a person and as a worker, showing me what is needed in today's world to hold down a job and do it well."
good,"Great Job but if seeking fulltime apply for 3rd key or higher, as long as you show your trying you;ll move up fast, easy to use computers and interface."
good,"High volume of diverse customers with all types of wants and needs. I've learned to be more independent with frequent questions that may be difficult for the normal sales associate."
good,"Working at Gamestop is a fantastic experience for those who enjoy video games and are knowledgeable about them. The work is simple, engrossing, and can be anywhere from tedious to fun depending on attitude."
good,"my day would start off with checking our inventory on the floor to make sure it is all accounted for and organized, and once that is taken care of i would then proceed to either take care of customers or do any side tasks that were provided for the day such as marketing and price changes. the management took the time to be more than just managers. they cared both about the quality of the store and the quality of employment. the hardest part of the job was probably time management because within the day you would have certain tasks which had to be taken care of by a certain time but you also have customers that you want to help as soon as you can and not have them feel like they are inconveniencing you, you want them to feel like they can ask you for help. finding the balance between getting work done and providing great customer service was definitely the hardest part, but i loved the customer interaction. the best part of the job was meeting the wide variety of people and having that customer interaction that was more than just a basic sales experience."
good,I enjoyed the coworkers i had and loved working and helping the customer in a subject field i enjoyed so much. pay was fair and store was close to food court
good,"For an Opening Shift which usually are a 9-5 shift. I go into the store between thirty minutes to an hour before we open. In that time I count the registers, go to the bank to drop off the previous day's deposit, and make change if needed. I then have to complete the daily/weekly inventory counts. Then if I have a few minutes left I make sure the store is ready to be opened and then open the store for business. Around 10:30 or 11 in the morning UPS will come and drop off shipment (which can be as few a one box or upwards of 20) that need to be processed in the inventory system, then filed and put in its proper place. For the rest of the day I provide customer service and stride towards our daily/weekly goals. "
good,I enjoyed working here. I just hate I went through a temp service.
good,"A typical day at work would be checking inventory, placing all game trade ins behind the counter and putting the cases out on the shelves for people to see. Talking to customers about games they are looking for and having knowledge to help them was needed daily. "
good,"GameStop is probably one of the funnest places for a gamer to work. You get a chance to see all the latest games, be involved with game culture and get exclusive information that is relevant to your gaming life. The customers are not hard to deal with one bit and are more often than other, really, really nice. From the soccer mom to the busy dad, the loving grandparents to aunts and uncles, this place gives you a chance to be a part of a tightly nit family surrounded by bleeps and bloops. I think the hardest part of this job is selling memberships and dealing with a lot of people being put into a small space during the holidays."
good,"I currently love my job at GameStop. Who wouldn't enjoy having a job where you got to talk about something you're passionate about all day? Like any job it has its pros and cons. The holidays can get a little crazy around there, but we are good about keeping it a positive environment. I am an SGA (Senior Game Advisor) which is the fancy way of saying Manager on Duty. I make sure my coworkers are doing their set project or making sure all customers have been helped and are satisfied. I will admit that I am new to that particular role but I've caught on fairly quick. I have to be available for certain transactions such as phone trade ins. I must make sure all inventory is logged and put where it belongs. Make sure store is clean and organized at all times. I must also take all responsibility if a project is not done properly or not done at all. "
good,Was a great place to work I loved the environment and people.
good,"Fun place to work, room for advancement. Customers are usually easy going and management is easy to work with."
good,"I started my working life with GameStop. I worked from a holiday associate to Store Manager in my 6+ years there. Management cares for each individual associate, new challenges every day and dealing with fun customers."
good,I enjoyed coming into work to be able to be around the video games. While reservation numbers and membership signups are important they will come naturally with great customer service.
good,I have only worked at Gamestop for a short period of time but so far the management has been very supportive.  The people I work with are all very energetic and make it easy to get into the right mind set to help customers.  It makes it a pleasure to help customers with any questions or issues that they may have.
good,"Great place to work. Fun fast-paced environment. Great co-workers, very helpful when being trained. Very good management, very helpful."
good,"Management & coworkers are very helpful, learned to work with some hand tools, management very good about follow up on training, etc."
good,"A typical day, you'll sign in and start helping any customers that come in.  Downtime happens a decent amount as my store is not in a heavy traffic area.  Advancement is hard and not something I've tried as this is a secondary job.  Previous retail experience is helpful if you're looking to get a job there.  Best thing to do is to keep up on the newest games coming out but know about older titles as well.  It's great when you can nerd out with a customer about a title.  Worse part is having to deal with any angry customers like any retail job.  Some coworkers are super lazy but management is great now."
good,"I loved my co-workers and the customers for the most part were really cool too, the most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find games that they would enjoy"
good,"Working at Gamestop teaches you to be a friendly person. Often people are looking to buy expensive things they know nothing about, educating them on the wisest ways to spend their money requires patience. The people I work with, especially my boss, helped me to become friendly and confident in talking to many different people each day."
good,"I spent a long time at GameStop for a reason.  I loved my job there, and I was eventually moved up to a keyholder position.  The only trouble I really had was with the district manager, whom no one in any of the 3 stores in town liked.  All of the employees from all of the stores were friends and we had those stores running as smooth as any I've ever seen.  I loved knowing what games were coming out, having first opportunities at reserving, and being constantly surrounded by my biggest hobby.  It was still only a retail job, and a corporate dictated one at that, so the pay wasn't special, but the bond between coworkers made the difference.  It worked great as a high school/early college job."
good,"great PLACE TO WORK WITH PERKS, LOVE THE overall company.Great people we work with any customers are awesome"
good,"Learned quite a bit working here. Learned a bit about sales and product palcement. Was able to freshen up on Alphabetizing and organizing skills.  Fun, people-friendly job.  Worked with great people, that genuinely care about your success at the end of the work day.  Other employees were very generous and very willing to help new hirees learn the layout."
good,gamestop is a fun place to work but there is alot of work but the benefits are worth it
good,"I was fortunate to be a seasonal employee. I wish I could have stayed on, but full time positions are rare with this company. Customer service was very important here, and I am glad I learned how to handle customers through this experience. Being friendly and positive always gets the job done. I learned to never be afraid to ask questions, and to always help out."
good,"A typical day as a manager was full of juggling marketing standards, store upkeep/maintenance and overall great customer service. The biggest thing I learned as manager was that being friends with your coworkers is always nice, but to never let it affect either yours or their performance. The best part of the job was going in every day and talking about what I love."
good,"There is advancement, but it can take a long time before that happens. If you're patient enough to do so, then this would be a great company to advance through."
good,"GameStop was a fun part time job I held to make some extra money during the summers and holidays. Outside of these times I was not utilized, but was kept on record as a part-time employee."
good,"a typical day at work involved assisting customers with their game purchases, process shipment, call other locations to verify stock and request items for customers, opened and closed the store."
good,"It was a good place to work. I was only seasonal help so all I got was two hours a week. That was the only downfall but other than that, it was a good easy laid back job."
good,"I had many opportunities to educate people on games and consoles, which helped my people skills and helped me enjoy the job more. Connecting with people improved the overall experience and made each sale fun and easy."
good,"Each day was the same but people made it different. I learned out to talk to people and start a friendly conversation to figure out what they like, in order to help them to find games. I would restock the shelves and work the cash registers. It was fun working here, the co-works were great too. The most enjoyable part about this job was the holidays and the new releases. "
good,"a typical day would be to check e-mails to see what's new,goals for the week or check goals and talk in our workbook,help customers,do new marketing."
good,I loved working at Gamestop. The pushing of subs and reserves kind of sucked but if you love games you will love this place talking to customers was the best part.
good,GameStop is a very fun place to work if you find yourself having a common interest with gaming itself. i was a game adviser and i got to suggest and talk to people about games all day. I learned getting personal and close to certain customers works really well when it comes to sales type jobs/careers. The management was incredible in my store location and it made for a fun working environment. Co-workers became friends and we all shared common interests so it made for a good time at work. The hardest part of the job would be pushing reservations and subscriptions but you get used to it after a little bit.
good,"A typical day at work was to make sure that the shelves were organized and presentable, greeted and assisted customers."
good,A day at work would be me walking around the store helping customers get what they were looking for. I also had to suggest and sell other games to them as well as magazine subscriptions. I'm a huge gamer so it was great to talk to these customers who were also big gamers and get paid to do so. I really loved helping parents that would come in about games and systems for their kids and what would be great for them go get. The management was great. We all got along and joked around. Everyone there knew what they were supposed to do and it always ran smoothly. Sometimes I would go in the back and arrange and keep up with inventory. If it wasn't for the poor pay that would've been a dream job.
good,"A typical day at work was essentially walking through the door, clocking on, and bam instant email about exactly what was expected of you. So you could get right to work, and even add my own spin to the tasks. Obviously customers came first, and there was always something to do outside of the list. It was just over all a great place to be."
good,"Opened the Store and registers for day to day. Counted product on a daily and weekly schedule. Received products from other stores and dealt with inbound and outbound shipment using UPS and Fed ex. If opening another manager would arrive around 12 to 2, then I would take my lunch. The closing shift was when you worked with another associate who isn't a key holder."
good,I was seasonal but when i was there everyone was kind and let you have time off if you needed it.
good,"I enjoyed working here, I was able to apply my favorite hobby with work that I could really get into."
good,"las compañias llegan a Puerto Rico para venderse bien, pero hay veces que cometen errores al adquirir compañias q eran su competencia ,donde cambian todo lo que es administrativo,y tratan de abarcar mas el mercado ,colocando multiples tiendas juntas lo que genera division de ventas ."
good,My retail experience was all about numbers. Starting a day with simple inventory counts to pushing sales in reserving upcoming titles and magazine subscriptions after opening. Helping customers find the right game was always a great way to learn about them as well as the product's good points. Not every game may be a blockbuster but there is always something good about it that many customers may find entertaining and worthwhile. My staff and I were always trying to break our daily goals and see if we could set any records for the company. We kept up with other stores in the district to learn new selling techniques as well. The best part was selling something you really enjoyed which also made it hard to hang on to my paycheck.
good,"Great job, great benefits if your full-time. Discounts and the ability to sign out games for a few days."
good,"The work was always fast. Always something to do, never a down moment. Shipments came in and had to be processed while still handling customers and checking out. Managing co workers and coaching them. Holiday season brings 4 to 5 times the work."
good,I was apart of management and needless to say you are not being paid enough for the time you spend there. I might as well of working at fast food. Thats how much the pay sucks........
good,"Ottimo stipendio,non è un lavoro ma una 2 famiglia"
good,"Always be in the know about what's coming out. The better you can educate your customers the better you'll succeed at helping them. It's all about knowing the games and having knowledge. You don't have to know about EVERY console to work here, but doing your research really helps. As far as work goes, I learned everything I need to know about retail by working at Gamestop. They teach you how to clean a store, merchandising, checking in boxes, and how to run a register. Getting promoted isn't that hard as long as you do the tasks that need to be done. The people are awesome and the boss I had is fantastic. Communication is key, talk with your coworkers. Teamwork is the only way to succeed at Gamestop."
good,A big part of the job was relating to the customers on a personal level and it was very fulfilling to be a part of. Enjoying the same activities as your coworkers and customer was a great experience.
good,Has some really nice people there and I learned to break out of my shell and learn what I really love and life and people as I said are really nice there.
good,"Gamestop is a great place to work if you are very passionate about games and sharing your knowledge with other gamers. However, the need to achieve numbers at the end of the day can be a bit overbearing for some. It's a constant struggle of trying to convince people who don't want memberships to get them, and trying to convince people why pre-owned products are better than new. The staff are usually always willing to help you develop your customer service skills, and are knowledgeable in what they sell."
good,A great job to have if you just want some extra cash. Hours are ridiculous to get. Chances are you will get 4-8 hours a month until the holiday season starts kicking in. Keep a full-time job and join this for the discounts!
good,"Job Work/Life Balance"
good,"Depending on the day and the weather, the foot traffic can sometimes be really slow or really fast. The current manager is far better than the previous one. The hardest part of the job is working with difficult customers and trying to spot thieves. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the new products come in and the conversations with customers and coworkers."
good,This job is a great starting career for young adults who are just starting to work. It provides a clean professional work environment and allows people to open up to their peers.
good,Gamestop is a great place to work. Focused heavily on sales aspect then most would expect but is very easy for someone who enjoys games and collectibles. Great management
good,It's the perfect job for someone who wants to learn more about video games and video game systems. I love that the company thinks a lot about their employees.
good,"I was hired seasonal, but my files were mixed up in an overhaul GameStop was doing. I had to apply twice, even though the first time I was accepted."
good,Working at GameStop is actually a real joy. I love learning the culture behind the games and the collectibles we sell there. The best thing to do there is to just keep at it and get as much as you can do done.
good,Love everyone there never a dull moment and can’t wait to continue to prove myself and move up. A very positive experience positive environment and everyone there is special
good,benefits out weigh the bad here. competition between co-workers for top pre orders and pro rewards cards are intense as that's what helps you keep your employment.
good,I clock in and immediately turn my attention to customers learning to initiate interactions and smoothly drive sales. The management was down to earth enough for to meet me where I was and build me up. There were no difficult parts of working this job as everyday was an enjoyable day and experience.
good,"This was a production job at the refurbishment center warehouse, not a retail location."
good,Great place to learn people skills and customer service. Relaxed environment with lots of room to be promoted. Communication between stores from my experience is stream lined. My procedures are very simple and effective.
good,I loved working there. I mean there is no words for how fun it was. The employee were great an answered my hundreds of questions. Coustmers were friendly and pleasent.
good,The business flow could go from relaxed to fast paced in just a few minutes especially if you were the only employee in the building. I love talking about gaming in general and have played a wide variety of games in my past.
good,As an ASL you are mostly on the floor training your team for the weekly sales and goals that have to be met. You are going back and forth with your SL for operations that need to get done.
good,"I had my best time at game stop "
good,"I worked at GameStop as a Christmas part timer for two years. As a sales associate I enjoyed working with the manager and helping parents find the product their child asked for. For me, part of the fun was a parent coming in and saying “My kid said there’s a new switch thing she wants for Christmas, something about squids.” and seeing the relief on there face when I helped them find what they where looking for."
good,I love the job an I'm still there I just need a job that pays more I've only been there for a few days outta each week but I hope to get more hours. But other than that I love my job I just need more money
good,"The rest of the crew was nice, and they showed me how to do things each and every day. I was shown how to greet customers and look up if there was a game in stock of not."
good,I enjoy the environment and diversity at GameStop. There are so many amazing beings there. Best work environment Ive ever been in I just wish i was paid a tad bit more.
good,"Every day a work is excellent"
good,"GameStop made my first working experience worth it. Many people always end up complaining about their first jobs and how terrible everyone treated them, but working at game stop for me was amazing and has made me look forward to working there again one day."
good,"A great job, where I was able to pitch my passion and was able to interact with customers on a regular basis and assist them with their need as well as being able to work around other people passionate about work"
good,Good Job overall. I worked there for several years encountered the normal problems that come with retail management. This is the dream job of a gamer who is focused and can lead.
good,Everyone was really nice and it was a breath of fresh air that the people really cared about the company and their jobs. If they gave me more hours I'd continue working there.
good,"I worked at GameStop for a little over two and a half years. Over those two years I learned many things that would help me inside and outside of work. Leadership, responsibility, accountability just to name a few, but more than that I grew as a person from meeting so many different people and managers. Gamestop was a great experience for me and helped in a tremendous way to shape the man I am today."
good,"You would start out by opening the safe, get the money in the registers, start the daily counts, and then make the new price adjustments. Then later on you would check in the shipment and then work on helping customers until the afternoon when a second person would come in."
good,"Gamestop was a casual and fun place to work. I wish I had been kept on beyond seasonal work. It is a pretty calm and sociable job, which mainly consists of organizing games on shelves and greeting customers."
good,"I worked at the Placerville, CA store and it was a very down-to-earth, fun experience, especially if you enjoy video games. Management was very supportive and easy to work with/learn from."
good,I always looked forward to working here whenever I was scheduled to work. My manager and coworkers were always kind and maintained a positive attitude and work environment. My typical day was restocking shelves and helping whoever entered the store by finding what they needed.
good,being surrounded by video games all day was the best ever. Meeting new people that like all different types of games and genre was amazing. Management was well taken care of and new what you had to do on your shift
good,"I had a seasonal position at GameStop for a couple of months and the experience was okay. I'm gamer, so I spoke to other gamers through my job, which was great. The problem was I barely received hours."
good,"A typical day at work was normally just cleaning and keeping the store organized. I learned more about games I've never heard of, learned that they love to keep their game cases in alphabetical order on the shelf, and I learned how to properly answer the phone and how to uses their IPad. There were three managers and a assistant manager. They were pretty cool, kept the store going and they were all so very nice! Working at GameStop, there really isn't anything hard about it. The most enjoyable was in the beginning when I was able to learn about the store, my new co-workers, and how it all worked there!"
good,Good Company to work for if you need a temp or part time 2nd job to help with some extra money unless you want to get into management then maybe you have a better chance of getting better hours not sure of there pay though but a good side job to have if you need it
good,"great atmosphere, fast-paced but sometimes management wasn't based in reality. focused on hiring more upper management instead of worker bees. was contract at first then hired full time. changed jobs because of workload and long commute."
good,"If you are interested in video games working at Gamestop is a great opportunity to make something you care about into a career. Being able to relate to your customer base is very rewarding, although the company does set very high expectations of their workers."
good,The work environment was friendly. The coworkers and management was awesome to work with. It sucked being as I was a seasonal employee. everything about the job was great.
good,since i've been working there for almost a year now. there have been many ups and downs to the job. each store is different so customers make the job interesting.
good,"Overrall decent job, great co-workers, learned alot about retail, promotion/marketing, customer service, how to be respinsible in being a leader as acting manager"
good,Worked for the company since 2009 and I have loved every moment of it. The teams I have worked with are so amazing. The discount is great for gamers who work there as well
good,Awesome job! I always get to interact with different customers and have great conversations about new technology. I loved all the amenities the job offered.
good,A company with good benefits and management. The video game retail industry is struggling due to downloadable content so the future of this industry is uncertain.
good,"Fun and engaging atmosphere, great co-workers, and excellent management.  Love video games, it was a great fit, would have liked to continue working there."
good,"Being surrounded by video games and a growing market based out of 34th st was a great way for to me to grow accustomed to customer service and working with people. Assisting customers with video game selections and maintaining a friendly, positive work environment."
good,"As a store manager, the hardest part of the job was the work/life balance. It was typical to work 50+ hours per week."
good,"A typical day might include organizing and alphabetizing games in drawers and on walls. Helping guests find the products they are looking for even when they aren't sure what they are looking for. Setting guests up with Rewards Cards to save them money and reserving upcoming releases that they may be excited for. Cash management in processing transactions. Management was flexible in terms of scheduling, but personal accountability was important when it came to performance. The hardest part of the job was probably the few unruly guests that either take advantage of return policies or that don't understand policies, but instead of trying to learn they become irate and decide you as the employee are the bad guy and try to dehumanize you as just a retail associate that is out to hurt them. On the plus side the entire job is talking about video games with other people who are excited about video games! The workplace culture is pretty fantastic as you'll develop relationships with fellow employees as well as guests. It's almost family like."
good,Gamestop is a great place but every company has it's downsides.  While there I learned cooperation skills and developed a working attitude towards multitasking priorities and helping the customer.
good,Gamestop was where I grew the most professionally. My team was very supportive and my manager was a leader who wanted to see his employees excel in every aspect of life.
good,I liked working here a lot- it's very competitive and I like the sales environment. The only reason I stopped working here was because I was working too many jobs and going to school. They also started scheduling me really early compared to when I said my mornings could start which made it hard for me to keep up with good attendance. (Wasn't used to it at all and I was regularly up late due to homework).
good,"Over all the job itself Is fun, co-workers in short is like being in high school.  The work keeps you busy, day goes by quick. Most of management/supervisors  are very helpful and great at teaching."
good,"GameStop is a unique place to work at. I enjoyed my time there with my coworkers who were all very nice and relaxing people to work alongside. The store I worked at was rather small but very popular, so we often received too much stock on certain items and not enough for others. This also made up keeping the appearance of the store difficult at times."
good,days at game stop are slow but enjoyable. i learned a lot about electronics and customer service working at game stop. Working there is a great job for those who enjoy video games and other gaming products.
good,"GameStop was one of the most fun and competitive places i have ever worked in, as a techie, i was a great place because there was always something new coming up every other week."
good,The Manager`s were always friendly and helpful when i had trouble with a task. It was always busy so no one could slack off. Customers were sometimes angry because they didn't understand store policy until i explained in a calm manner.
good,"I enjoyed my job, i enjoyed expressing my love for my life of gaming and anime and sharing it with my coworkers and guests. It is very unfortunate i broke a policy and was terminated, i would have enjoyed seeing where my journey there went."
good,I had a very great time working there. very good company to work for. I had a great boss who carfed for the employees. I am very greatful to have worked in this type of establishment.
good,"Processed a number of transactions each day in a timely manner. Answered customers' questions and addressed problems and complaints in person and via phone. Opened and closed the store, which included counting cash drawers and making bank deposits. Maintained visually appealing and effective displays for the entire store. Educated customers on product and service offerings. Built customer confidence by actively listening to their concerns and giving appropriate feedback."
good,"There were times when the job was very rough, especially with some of the guests that would come in, but all in all it was a very fun experience. Typical days at work usually meant processing trades or putting games on the walls if not reorganizing sections. I learned a lot about management and about good business practices while here and my co-workers are some of my best friends, they are absolutely amazing and very good at their job."
good,lot of good people that worked there. never had a bad day there/ everyone was always friendly and the customers were always good. got to meet a lot of new people with the same interest as i did
good,"Working for this company has always been a joy, in spite of hour cuts during the summer and frustrations with coworkers. It's a very freeform, relaxed workplace with a diverse employee base and customer base."
good,"This was the first place I applied to as a 16 year old newbie. I enjoyed the work as it was very fast paced and there was always a challenge, either in the form of a surprise management visit or a customer who needed very specific or hard to get items. My coworkers made the workday fun as well. All of them are bright people with lovely personalities that get along well together."
good,"GameStop is best for people who are passionate about games and have already had retail experience. Depending on location, it can be the most fun place or a living nightmare."
good,"Going in making sure the store was up to date and clean for when it opens. Taking in shipment and helping customers as they come in, Helping them with their questions and needs about the latest stuff."
good,"En typisk dag på Gamestop handlar om att möta upp kunderna på golvet och att guida dem till rätt produkter."
good,"The work environment is very relaxed. A typical day will see anywhere from 50-200 customers coming in to make purchases, making for a sometimes hectic experience, but it's never been overwhelming."
good,"Working at GameStop was a great experience simply because they skills they provided me with while I was there. I was under the impression it would just be a regular retail job but there are so many complex layers within that company that you learn much more than basic sales. In my time there I learned what proper customer service was, how to lead and train new hires, entry level managerial skills, the complexities of sales, and much more. I left GameStop with more knowledge than I ever expected to gain."
good,Overall I am enjoying my time with the company I just wish I could transition to full time I enjoy the gaming culture as it is a large part of my life as a geek.
good,"Good work enviroment, nice co-workers, and nice warehouse to work in but I think the pays should be bumped up a dollar or two."
good,"There's always something to do and something to look forward to. No dull moments. Not very fast paced but slow neither. Co-workers were outgoing and friendly, which attracted customers. If you enjoy video games, the job will be enjoyable. Manager was like your best friend and flexible with your hours. The environment was fun and an overall great experience."
good,Very good place to work lots of fun the enviorment is great and being around games all the time is even better. You alos get to meet a lot of new people each day.
good,"This is a great place to have a lot fun, relaxed work environment, and a lot of cool free bees. I remember getting t-shirts, key-chains, toys and other neat extras to get the employees excited about new games. The main downside is the pay. As a store manager I made less then I did as a desk clerk for a hotel. Bottom line, a lot of fun, but very little money."
good,"I worked with GameStop over the Holiday season of Halloween, Black Friday, and Last Minute Christmas Shopping. The Job would begin with clocking in and wearing a namebadge and going straight to the customers that look like they are looking for something or those that have questions. "
good,"The company was fun for an entry level position, but once you move past that it becomes frustrating. The district manager has no understanding of the areas the stores are in, no concept of the fact that not every store can be exactly the same. "
good,"Great company to work for. The work environment is so friendly that you are never afraid to ask a question. You look forward to going to work, for your co-workers, managers and customers!"
good,There was lot of commutation in the place and if you like talking about video games this place was a right for you which is why i liked working here. it was hard working and there are costumer they were annoying but beside that fun place. co-workers were great they were nice to help no one that was getting to you.
good,"I originally was hired as a seasonal employee back in 2006. Ever since, I have been developed exponentially by talented leaders that gave the inspiration to pursue a business management degree. It is a great place for developing people, understanding business acumen and helping customers to the best of their needs."
good,I love people so working in sales is one of the best careers for me. I  like selling a product that is fun and GameStop provides that.  It's competitive without being overwhelming and your co-workers are generally great. You are constantly counting the product. 3-4 inventories a year plus weekly counts.
good,I would get to go to work and talk about the stuff I love (video games). The customers and co-workers were all nice and fun to be around and converse with. The manager treated me like a person and not just an employee. The hardest part for me was the pay/benefits. Not much to live off of. The best part was just being there. It never really felt like work.
good,"Working at gamestop was always a dream of mine. When I first started working at gamestop , I felt welcomed and my co-workers were awesome and so was my manger, he was a very cool laid back dude that would help u out when u needed help. On the job I learned how to communicate with guest,  take inventory, keep things organized and clean for display. the hardest part of my job really was just standing around all day waiting for a customer but other than that when customers did come in , I enjoyed speaking to them and getting to connect with them in a way to help better my service to them and building a good relationship with them."
good,"I was employed by GameStop for 5 years and while times did get rough at moments, it was a fantastic job and if it wasn't for the need for more hours and scheduling, I could see myself staying. While i did not receive many benefits, I did benefit from being able to work with such a wonderful management staff! My district and regional managers were also fantastic and wanted to help whenever they could or saw that something was wrong with their employees!"
good,"I'm a gamer, so when I worked at GameStop, I felt like I was in heaven. Such a wonderful surrounding to work at."
good,"Great environment where hard work pays off.  Progressing in this company comes as a very rewarding experiencing.  You don't have to be a gamer (such as myself) to enjoy the diversity and uniqueness of GameStop Headquarters.  I've gotten to meet many people from all over the world.  I think for a company this size we do a great job of being flexible and sensitive to needs of each other and our clients, both business related and personal."
good,"Gamestop is a very nice place to work at but my only problem is the pay and the hours. You don't get paid that much and nor do you get too many hours as well, but as far as the company overall, its fun to work there."
good,"usually just help customers, organize games, review inventory,overall easy first time job with a fun environment, corporate could give better compensation to employees though."
good,I would get there and start organizing all the games and wait behind the cash register for customers to ask about various games. I learned how to be very social and how to talk to customers right and inform them. Management was amazing I am still best friends with 2 of the managers. I am still friends with all of my co-workers I see them whenever I go there. Hardest part was being on you feet for 5-8 hours a day. Most enjoyable was being able to talk about games all day.
good,Interacting with customers and coworkers about your favorite games is always fun. Gamestop was a wonderful part time job!
good,"Working at GameStop is every gamer's dream and I can tell you all that it is my favorite job. A typical day at work varies on what the company provides task wise, what your position is at the time and what your store manager needs you to do. For me I clock in, help customers right away. Then I put product away, alphabetize all the games in their section from A-Z and make sure the store is clean by the end of the night. "
good,I only worked a seasonal shift for the 2008 Christmas season but it was fun. The people I worked with were fun. It's a good first job where someone can learn more about the business and see if it's worth pursuing.
good,Great reliable job I had during schooling. I recommend working at gamestop if you had a choice with retail.
good,"I really enjoy working at Gamestop, it's a fun environment and has a really good management team that makes you feel welcome."
good,"semi-long hours"
good,"Nice environment and great co-workers, really busy around 3 p.m., nice manager and buys food sometimes. hardest part of the job is the little kids disorganizing everything and then we putting it back in order. most enjoyable part is recommending games to customers to seek their needs."
good,Gamestop consists of some very knowledgeable people from sales associates all the way up to regional management. This company helped to form most of my customer service skills with high level clientele due to my managing store being located in an upper-middle class area.
good,"A great first time job oppurtunity. Beware its not all about games though!"
good,"Apertura negozio,"
good,"This job has reinforced the skills I learned from my last job, that customer service is key to success in a retail environment.  The highest success I have had in this position has always been through repeat customers whom I have grown a professional relationship with.    As long as you can maintain composure through the busiest of times, and treat every customer with care and a smile, then you will do well at this job!"
good,"I loved working at Gamestop.  I had a great team that I worked with, our manager was very team oriented.  If someone was not pulling their weight, it would not go on for long.  However, if you were doing your job, you were treated right and you would have fun all day.  "
good,Gamestop currently has me working a minimum of 10 hours of every week. This is a second job along with the one at the movie theater. Gamestop can work around any schedule and they manage their time greatly. Also I can easily transfer to any other store if I were to move. The benefits are exceptional and the employees are like my tutors as I learn the ropes.
good,"This was a company I was excited to work for that waned towards the end. Without going in to detail, it was like a roller coaster at most times. "
good,"A typical work day was doing shipments, labeling, this job never boring at all, which was great the day would just go by very fast. This job also help me to learn how to plan time management. The hardest part of the job was the store audits it was a very tidiest project to do. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers. Knowing about the products that you sell to customers makes the job a lot easier and fun."
good,One of the best jobs I have had for personal reasons and one of the memorable ones from co-workers or events that happened while working there.
good,"Stock shelves,Keep clean, and work on the computer as well as helping customers. The environment was fun and I love to play videogames and it was fun to chat."
good,I currently work for an amazing manager and store so my experience may differ from others. Every day that I work is like a breath of fresh air compared to my last job because customers are always so pleasant and polite and are okay with not knowing everything. It isn't to say there aren't those few people who believe they know EVERYTHING about gaming and we are the losers who are stupid.
good,a typical day at work be very busy customer service at gamestop is a constant thing never to many slow days
good,"I loved it, but the compensation is a little below average. The benefits are not that great, but I loved games and the job was easy to do so I stayed for a long time."
good,I likeed Gamestop. Wish they still had the shift I needed at the time
good,"Conta Hw e sw, variazione prezzi, controllo Siae, preparazione/ricezione colli, compilazione del registro dei corrispettivi, calcolo dei budjet, marketing dello store, front e back office. Ottimo rapporto con tutti i colleghi data anche la facilità del sottoscritto a socializzare con persone nuove."
good,This job requires the same type of work you'd expect out of any retail job.The employees were best group I've ever worked with and I learned alot about customer service and satisfaction.
good,Good working enviroment. More for a first job rather than carrer.
good,"i was always busy, there were many kids buying games all the time and having conversations with me, which i love working with kids and well overall it was a great experience for me."
good,"If you manage to land a job at Gamestop, stick with it for a while."
good,Working with people is always going to be a task but I think the people at GameStop have a good Handle on things. As a employee and as a customer they have a great way to make you feel like they have know you for a life time.
good,I have worked with this company for nearly two years and honestly loved almost every second of it. If it was an option I would have hapily stayed employed here.
good,The work was fairly easy and when there were minor inconveniences my coworkers were more than willing to provide me the aid needed to handle the situation.
good,"I have enjoyed working for GameStop. It is a fast paced job with lots of emphasis on sales. It is a fun environment to work in and everyone in the company is willing to help you along the way. If you enjoy a constantly challenging and changing environment, but with many assets to help along the way, GameStop is the perfect job for you."
good,"Never ending nerd culture from tech, movies, music, and of course video games. Gamestop is one of my favorite jobs I've had and I loved the upper management working with my weird school schedule."
good,I am rather lucky to have a team that I really enjoy working with. The people at my store really care about each other. I feel very appreciated as an employee by my management team.
good,I have fun working with the guests that aren't troublemakers and it brings me great joy to help a guest with their need. But you are not paid fairly for the amount of work that you do. I make $8.48hr as a senior game advisor. That is not starting pay for new employees.
good,At the time of employment i was an avid gamer so this job was right up my alley. there was opportunity to move up within the company and management would recognize hard work when done.
good,"The store was small, the workers were few, yet we had to help about 3 different ,smaller, cities and still didn't make enough hours."
good,As a part time employee the hours were very flexible. The work culture was fit for an outgoing and enthusiastic individual. Being able to engage with a customer was both beneficial to sales and a fun experience. A great job for those who enjoy video games.
good,"GameStop is a great place to work for someone in school who isn't looking for tons of hours. Sadly if you are looking for 40 hours a week you won't get it unless its during the holidays or your an ASL (Assistant Store Leader) or an SL (Store Leader). Seriously is an amazing place to work. Can be stressful at times, as any job can be but by far has been the most fun job I have had."
good,"Working at gamestop isn't that bad but it gets stressful at times. Sometimes customers are complete dummies and think Mario is on xbox and will try and tell you there 5 year old knows everything. But then sometimes you'll have a good conversation with people. Holidays are horrible people coming in and out, store is packed, they'll be rude and people rushing around. But it's not bad I had a good manager but the old assistant manager made it kinda hard to work there but overall not a bad place if you have a good manager"
good,Gamestop was a very enjoyable experience to meet like-minded people and be treated fairly as an employee. The culture within the store was very relaxed but kept you active as to not be too relaxed. Management truly cared for their employees and striked a fine balance between the companies objectives and their employees. The hardest part was selling memberships to a younger audience. Pay was fair but low in my area.
good,"I was the store manager for roughly 8 years and loved Gamestop. My first two District Managers were very good leaders and provided myself and my team with the support to be successful and grow our business and develop a great customer base. However the last District manager we got was very inexperienced and fired one-third of our district, then one-third quit, and 3 other managers had put in their two week notice before corporate finally stepped in and terminated the DM's employment."
good,"The type of company you work for that caters to tech enthusiasts and those who still honor the child at heart. The best thing about the brand is that they always thrived for evolution. Management, like any other job, is very important. Always SPEAK Up and get to know all departments, everyone’s specialty played a role in your own development."
good,"- A day at Gamestop generally started with organizing all the games and electronics and making sure everything looks presentable to the eyes of the customer. Also making sure each guest is up to date on the current sales and potential deals they may be eligible for. "
good,"a moderately fast paced environment, given the time of day, but very focused on making sales goals and selling specific product to the guests. easy going, basic work."
good,"They work with you on scheduling, being in store was nice they give you an opportunity to work on everything, stocking, cashiering, making your own goals to improve it was a good place of emoloyment"
good,"Everyone wants to work at GameStop and for good reason. I absolutely love my job at GameStop. I'm surrounded by people who share my interests and passions and I have full exposure to all things related to video games."
good,"I worked at gamestop for 2 years, but its a fun place to work if you know gaming culture or geek culture. The guests are really nice and sometimes you just have full chats with them. My only problem was the sales for member cards and making sure you got pre orders. Other than that, its a great job."
good,"working there was honestly one of the best times of my life, I knew what i was doing and the management helped me with the unfamiliar territory. The employees i met there were kind to me and were easy to get along with even the manager was a cool person, they told me about all the stuff i should do and the stuff i should avoid. Overall i wish i wasn't seasonal because i really did like my job and wish i could've kept working there."
good,"Avid fans as customers, never a dull moment. Discounts and related benefits are a nice plus and the management and team i have is awesome. Feels more like a family instead of work."
good,"It was my first ever job, and couldn't have had a better experience. It was always pretty laid back, even when it did get busy. Met lots of people and truly learned a lot on this job."
good,As a starting job it helps to mold you into a better employee. In my experience there I have made mistakes and the other employees try to make sure I learn from them instead of dwelling on them.
good,"I learned how to manage a register properly, how to care for customers in a timely and efficient manner, how to stock and display, and how to price merchandise. The staff was awesome and it was always a good day to go to work. The hardest part of the job was remembering to put the games into their cases. And the best part was being able to want to go to work instead of dreading it."
good,This has been  one of my easier jos i ave ever have had in my entire life . some days can be stressful but in  acreage its all good. one f th icons is that
good,"My average day was a bit hasty. I clocked in and grabbed a pile of games to restock until customers entered the store. When they would I'd be sure to check what types of games they liked and would recommend a few. I would ask them if they were members and let them know the benefits members did have. No pressure though. I had always wanted to work here so I was happy. I would try to have fun with customers making it a more colorful environment. It did get kinda tough to remember all the sales, but as long as I could handle that, the job was fun and simple."
good,"I loved my job. I went to work almost everyday in a great mood. My staff was awesome, I loved what I sold and for the most part the customers were cool. I however wasn't a fan of the lack of hours I got (I was a keyholder) and lack of pay I got as well."
good,The guests are the best part of the job. Meeting and finding out what they come into my location were great fun and provided an exciting day to day experience.
good,Had a great time as a seasonal guest adviser. The management team was good and the experience was great if you are looking to be busy at work especially with people. Very social environment and employees.
good,"I enjoyed working at GameStop. My superiors and seasoned co-workers were always willing to help when i did not know something or needed assistance. The manager was a very laid back, friendly gent who understood people very well and was a great customer service roll model. Great fun place to work if your video game savvy and up to date with trends and new titles. I personally am not so it was difficult but still enjoyable and informative"
good,Amazing place to work and plenty of room to advance. Family oriented management guest are always number 1 priority.  They care about you and your family.
good,"We would help any guests that would come in to buy phones, and sometimes they would walk out with games. It was nice to let any guests know about our Cricket plans and how affordable it is when they would come in the store to buy games. We would set daily goals on how many activations we should get by the end of the day as well."
good,"The coworkers I had were very upbeat and friendly. It felt like we were part of a family, everyone was very close and we would alway socialize. When it come down to it, we would get to work and do what needed to be done. It didn't feel like a job because all of us really enjoy video games and enjoyed the guests that would come into our store. Overall its a great place to work out when you have wonderful coworkers and wonderful management."
good,Gamestop is a unique experience. One of the few jobs that combine a retail environment with passion. This combination is better suited for someone who's proficient with sales and having some knowledge that's video game oriented. It can be an enjoyable place to work for.
good,I absolutely loved my time with the company. The customers were fun and always shared a common interest. My staff was also amazing picking up new skills very quickly and eager to prove themselves. The only thing I hated was our upper management (our district manager to be exact). He was new to his position and was wanting to prove his worth and taking it out on everyone. Bascially if you tried to offer a different point of view on ANYTHING you were automatically disliked and not treated very well. I couldn't prove my growth and experience to him even though I basically ran the store on my own for 2 months straight. Shortly after I left...I didn't I was going to progress anymore there and was my time to move on.
good,Working at GameStop was really nice and I really enjoyed it! It was amazing with how well they treated the employees and worked with people schedules.
good,"Working at gamestop was fun but also challenging, my co-workers and i wored as a team.Also helped each other need the goal for the day. The hardest part of the job was, when a co-work was on vacation and we were short of staff memebers."
good,"I loved my time at GameStop. My coworkers were wonderful people and we developed close relationships. Everyone was listened to. I learned most of my customer service skills from GameStop and grew a lot both as a person and as an employee. While I had issues with upper management and how corporate decided to run certain things, my immediate team was better than I could have ever imagined. Customers could be trying at times, but I developed patience throughout my time here and learned how to handle myself in tough situations. GameStop also promotes from within, so while it can be difficult to get hired, in my experience, the store managers really take care of their team and go out of their way for their employees. I knew managers from several different stores and I was impressed with all of them."
good,"Managements was enjoyable to work with, and I was happy to work with anyone else that happened to be on shift at the time. Unless things were incredibly hectic, you were able to go on break pretty much when you wanted to. The hardest part of the job was dealing with traded in systems when several customs brought them in back to back, but everything else was relatively easy. My favorite part of the job was just being around other people who were interested in the things I am interested in."
good,"Being able to joke, and play around with customers is great. Listening to customers who may be more informed on certain products and learning from them is helpful."
good,"The job is great if you do not mind dealing with people that sometimes have no clue what you're talking about.  The management for the most part was awesome and the store managers I had were great and I couldn't have asked for better.  The pay was unfortunate, but somewhat expected.  Enjoyed my time there."
good,Helping customers find games they where looking fooling daily inventories had a great head manager who we could always count on for help or answer any questions. Staff was great and very dependable we where lucky enough to have a staffed that truly loved there jobs. Hardest part of the job would have been working midnight lunches but that was almost some of the funniest shift to work
good,"A typical day would involve me going in at about 6pm and working until 9pm depending on my work schedule for the week. I learned that working in retail is very strict as to how you go about doing your job duties. My management was great, very flexible with hours and scheduling, other than a few personal conflicts with the store manager. My co-workers were great people, and could easily spend the day standing there talking to them. The hardest part of my job was when we would get really busy and only have 2 people working in the store, one of them including myself at the time. The most enjoyable part of the job was working around video games which iI love."
good,"I am QA Analyst worked at GS for 5 years .Loved it . Best management and very good team. The most enjoyable part of the job is a good people, everyone helps each other"
good,"Game Stop was my first job i loved it. I did a lot of different things such as fix systems and controllers, polish games and package them to be sent out. worked on the computer making labels for different products. I also used an RF for inventory control."
good,"increases my customer service"
good,This was my first job and i loved it. The atmosphere was fun and so were my co-workers and customers.
good,"I worked at gamestop for 4 years and made it to assistant manager. Overall, I loved this job. It is pretty easy, the hardest part being bad customers, like any other retail position. To get hired on, you pretty much have to be good with customers and be able to withstand a sometimes fast paced environment. Believe it or not, you don't have to be much of a gamer. That knowledge comes from working and learning as you go...and it will happen fast. If you wish to apply, just be persistant, don't look gross, regularly turn in applications (to multiple stores), and don't act so nerdy that you are unapproachable."
good,"GameStop has a very comfortable vibe, but also maintains a very professional attitude. I highly recommend working there."
good,I loved arranging video games and helping customers with questions about which video game to get or the details about the game which involves a lot of good communication and strong verbal skills.
good,Gamestop is full of younger people with a great store culture.
good,"Working at gamestop consists of stocking the walls, taking pre-orders for games, selling power up memberships, and being knowledgeable of games to answer customers questions. Management kept me on my toes and took the time to teach me how to upsell. The hardest part of the job was working so few hours. The most enjoyable part was being around other people who enjoy video games as much as I do. "
good,"Typical day at work would include organizing, plenty of customer service, and great experience with co-workers. Again, I repeat great co-workers. The individuals that work there are at the same level of friends you would usually have including the managers."
good,"The best part of working at Gamestop, is the fact that I work with something that interests me. I enjoy talking to customers, helping them discover games they may never have considered. The people at Gamestop are a big part of the reason I love working there as well. My co-workers are nice, fun and have the same interests as me. Compared to other work places in retail, the employees of Gamestop can be sure to have something in common with their co-workers."
good,It's a comfortable place to work if filled with nice and helpful employees. Simple not overly complicated. It's a clean environment and cares about your physical wellbeing.
good,"If your in to gaming and pop culture then is the right job for you and your nerd self  "
good,L’ambiente lavorativo è stimolante e appagante. I colleghi e i superiori ti insegnano il mestiere sufficientemente e senza avvilirti
good,GameStop was a fun place to work but I did not see an opportunity for career advancement with them. I enjoyed working with GameStop for the past years.
good,"Fun work environment. Never a dull moment with the amazing staff. Busiest times were launch nights of new games and holidays. But with a good staff and great leadership, things always ran smoothly."
good,"My time spent at GameStop was full of learning and the possibility to advance from within the company.   There was never a 'normal' day at the store, which I very much enjoyed.  Each day was always a fun day with different guests coming in with unique questions for different games and systems.  Management always had an open door policy so if at any point I needed something, we can up channel our questions or concerns and have them taken care of in a timely manner.  The best part about working for GameStop was the interactions and relationships we established with our guests and knowing that I was able to assist them with getting the right system, accessory, or game they were looking for."
good,"While I worked at Game Stop, I was a bit skeptical about how I would be able to do my job efficiently. Fortunately, the moment I started the job and was shown what to do, having to worry about efficiency wasn't a problem anymore. The other employees were nice and capable of giving me constructive criticism that made me feel like I was doing something right. The time I spent working there helped me to become patient while dealing with ""intolerable"" customers. Overall, I consider Game Stop's work environment to be very beneficial to teens looking to get their fist job."
good,"I absolutely loved working at GameStop!  I had to relocate and there were no openings in my new location, or else I could and would have just transferred to a new store!"
good,Typical day would consist of refurbishing a certain amount of specific product in an 8 hour work day. Very young and urban workplace culture. Fantastic management.
good,"Ho lavorato per GameStop nel periodo di Natale, nei giorni di maggiore affluenza. Essendo alla prima esperienza ho avuto bisogno di un po' di tempo prima di riuscire a gestire bene i clienti. La parte più difficile era non solo riuscire a soddisfare decine e decine di clienti,ma anche riuscire a trovare i giochi, poiché anche i nuovi spesso erano conservati senza custodia in un cassetto; al momento della vendita dovevo cercare il disco desiderato fra centinaia. Nel complesso è stata un'esperienza lavorativa piacevole."
good,"All GameStops are not the same, the one I worked at however was amazing. The manager really understood the products he was selling and that his employees had personal lives along with working lives. It put a high standard for GameStops for me and I have yet to find another one that good."
good,It's a fun environment and great work place and the worker are great to be around and the management was very dependable when it comes to your schedules.
good,"I worked at a smaller GameStop, so it wasn't too faced paced but co-workers were cool and all employees have video games as a common interest. It's easy to engage with customers because in order to get the job there you NEED video game knowledge which is basically all customers there talk about. Also, you will learn even more about games through co-workers and customers.  Raises are very hard to come by though and they will NEVER let you work more than 40 hours a week."
good,"I loved working at GameStop, the reason I left is the management in my location, because the manager did a very poor job. I was originally a seasonal but then got hired on for a part then full-time job, got transferred to become another manager at a different location. They treated their co-workers not as people but as subordinates with a harsh attitude that was not needed and a lot of the other employes asked me to talk to her about this but overall there was nothing I could do. So this is only because of management I left at the store I was located. I loved going it work it was never a job to be."
good,"It was a great working environment, management was great and kept a nice clean work environment. Most of the day was pretty slow because flagstaff was such a small town."
good,"As an avid video game player, this job felt just like home. The perks were nice, and it was very easy for me to help customers with their questions since I already knew a good amount about video games and technology."
good,I have always played Video games my entire life so it was a no brainer to get hired into Gamestop. Each day i get to be around awesome employees and greet customers with the same knowledge of gaming as me.
good,"Gamestop is an ever changing work place that aims to transform with the times. It is a place that requires constant learning and role play to enable staff to offer all of the products it offers. Gamestop offers level up training courses and even allows for staff to rent video games to aid employees with the task. A typical day at work would be completing daily paperwork, running bank deposit, setting daily goals, receiving and sending out product, and interacting with customers on the sales floor to assist and generate revenue."
good,"This company was excellent to me as an assistant manager.  The pay/benefits were great compared to similar jobs."
good,Everyone is very nice and fun to work with. The hardest part is starting off and learning about all the inventory. The manger was very nice and easy to work and get along with.
good,"typical day at work would be stocking shelves and selling games, movies and other products."
good,"Great place to work, if you are into electronics and video games. Advancement is possible, sales, and customer satisfaction."
good,"Coming in to a quiet store was a plus. It gave me time to think and work on my own, to accomplish a task that was set before me. A typical day would be reserving future games to be released such as an NBA or NFL game ready to be released at the end of the year."
good,This was a great place to work fun high energy great for gamers .
good,I don’t have much to say about this company seeing how going in I knew I would only be employee for the season. Everyone was generally friendly and seemed to know what they were doing.
good,"Let's be honest, GameStop is a dying company that is battling against digital games with still buying physical and adding collectibles to their catalog. As a guest advisor (sales associate), there is not much hassle or trouble stressing over on getting the next pre-order or fighting to get that prestige name under your store; albeit, this is exactly what you would want but there is not much you can do when you are not the store leader (manager). As an entry level employee, the hassle is not that hard trying to force people to sign up for memberships or getting customers to get a pre-owned game and telling them the benefits of those are. In this position, it is pretty relaxed and thanks to my co-workers and manager work is relatively fun and easy to do."
good,Sales customer service is most important. Organize items in store before opening. Help customers if we don’t have what’s for their use in are store call other GameStop company’s to assist them. Maintenance around store before close
good,When I worked there it was a great place to work.  The company was more focused on selling games and nothing else.  Now they are trying to sell more than that.  It was a fun place to work.  I had some great bosses that actually cared and I got along with everyone I worked with
good,Working here was one of my favorite jobs since I like video games. Coming to work never felt like a chore and getting to see same games earlier then the public was the best.
good,Very easy relaxed job and the work place itself was one of the best ive been too. I also found the staff very helpful and kind. My only regeret is that I was seasonal.
good,Working here caused me to switch to digital gaming. It wasn't bad if you have all of your time to devote to a part time job. It was a lot of fun to work here though
good,I feel that after working for Gamestop that I'm going to be suitable in any sort of situation i'm put into. I've already thrived at adapting to new business models and new initiatives.  But as a company who constantly has their foot on the excelerator they don't stop to think what the stores need on the inside to take care of themselves instead we're constantly tasking and constantly tasking to the point that tasking overrides everything else and it's very hard to actually connect on the customer service level in the ways you would want to. This is a company that will give you 40 hours of work with only four hours to do it and expected to do it while you have a busy store it's not a fight you can really ever win and unfortunately I like to win.
good,"Gamestop was a great place to work, but with receiving a new CEO the company went through a huge restrutor. This was necessary for the company to move in its new direction."
good,a typical day would be trying to figure out my schedule for the next two weeks. i learned that i do not want to work in retail anymore. the hardest part was dealing with co-workers. the most enjoyable part was working knowing i am doing the right thing and dealing with customers. keeping the store clean and organized.
good,This was a non-paying part of special needs job program through high school. Was giving people with special needs job training experience.Would have loved a job working there for pay. 1 weekend worked there for 20% off to help the store for a game launch on spring break
good,I love working with my guests however the company pushes to hard on numbers and not customer needs. It is get your minimum numbers or get written up and maybe let go.
good,it was fun to work at GameStop I really enjoyed it I learned more customers service there and it was a very enjoyable job for me
good,"I had a limited hours, limited training and no beneifits. I'm a big gamer and in this job it didnt help at all."
good,They like to rotate the employees either by terminating them or sending them to a different location because the company is closing in 2 years I feel they use there employees. I worked there for a few months my team was organized on time they worked hard even overtime the holidays was amazing with my team we put a smile on every customer
good,"Gamestop has some good sides, but plenty of bad ones. They don't provide fair pay or good hours. They have great benefit packages, but they do take out of your pay check and when you do not make much it doesn't really help."
good,A typical day at work I dealt with customers who loved and appreciated games as much as I did. I maintained the structure of the facility by keeping it clean and organized. I got along with my coworkers well and had a great time.
good,"-Typical day would be to organize the shelves and make sure everything is in it appropriate place, take care of in house customers and make sure they leave with a smile."
good,I was the only female working in my store and was the only one required to do all cleaning and organizing. Also was required to stick to cashering and not allowed to do any holds.
good,"opening and closing store, which included cash drops and deposits. Making sure that team members where keeping up with company guidelines."
good,"It was a good job, but you aren't going to go far if you are a person of color. The money i not that good. You can make good friends, but no money or advancement."
good,"I was hired on as a seasonal guest Advisor. I've been getting hours. Then I was promoted to guest Advisor and started getting four hours, one day a week. Let me know if anyone can survive on a four hour paycheck."
good,"I had a lovely manager and great coworkers. "
good,"The coworkers are great. The managers are honest and know what they're doing. The cashier system takes a bit of time to learn but once you get it, it's easy."
good,"It was fun to work at because I enjoyed the work, but the other employees, with the exception of a few, were horrible to work with, especially half of the people in management."
good,the job is okay but it is hard to advance and corporate isn't that great. Customers are rude for no reason. The mangers are always bickering amongst each other.
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to talk to customers about the different genre of video games they play as well as being able to assist customers with finding the eight game/console for them,"
good,"My experiences at the GameStop location on Overland Road in Boise, Idaho was neither an unpleasant or pleasant one. The work itself was rewarding, being a gamer myself. However, the management (Joshua Quimby to be specific) at the store location left much to be desired; Josh, the manager was always too high-strung and never could take the time to personally help or relate to a customer."
good,"The customers were friendly enough, people were elated to hear my opinions on their purchases."
good,It is great fun working around all the video games and all the people that come in but when you are not in management you are lucky to get any hours at all.
good,when i first started gamestop i was hired in as a seasonal hire but the mangers like me alot so eventually i got hired for a full employee. everyday we greet customers with a smile and sometimes get in long conversations about games which eventually helps them find the game they are longing for and also we tell the customers about the daily deals that go on so we can also help save them money and hopefully make them always wanting to come back.
good,"A typical day at GS is very productive. Interacting with guests is very informative and helps me to learn how to react with each and every guest. Management can be helpful with certain tasks and the environment at GS was very pleasant. When not helping a guests with their needs, management of the stores cleanliness is done as well as stocking supplies. The hardest part of working for me is closing simply because I don't want my workday to end and, the most enjoyable part is helping the guests with all their store needs."
good,"Although I love video games, it was pretty hard to give many opinions on the games. The people that I worked with are cool and fun. It just depends who you have as a manager and a SGA."
good,"The company isn't the greatest but if you get lucky with a good store and good coworkers, it's a lot of fun to work there. My store leader is one of my best friends now and he's honestly the best. He tries his best to give you as many hours as he can but the company doesn't always give us the hours we need. Moral of the story is, it's a great job to pass the time, not to pay bills or live off of though."
good,Store Assistant manager was great to work with. Store manager was not difficult but was not easy to work with. District manager was very difficult to work with and disrespectful. Every other employee I worked with was great. One of the few jobs that I actually loved working with everyone from the assistant manager position on down to the basic sales representative.
good,"a typical day at work is coming in, fixing the walls, and greeting customers. We made sure to tell our customers about our sales. which changed weekly. one of our biggest things to up sale was our memberships. we didn't have uniforms. the hardest part was selling the credit cards. my enjoyable parts are being able to talk about video games and the awesome discounts."
good,"You get to stand there all day."
good,"Fun environment, love my boss and coworkers. Not strenuous work, but for a billion dollar industry the pay is sketch to me."
good,Game and culture was great and the people with very passionate about the product. Daily operations was ast paced and energizing.
good,"fun place to work , keeping up with the daily gaming world, meeting all sorts of people with the same interests as myself."
good,"I have always loved video games and getting the opportunity to work around them is great; helping customers find what they want is very rewarding to me. I love the workplace and the people I work with, it is a great balance between being serious in our jobs and having fun after hours"
good,"Everyone was very knowledgeable and open to every question I had and made sure I had help when I needed it, especially when they visited on their own."
good,"My jobs was a few simple tasks, always talk to the customers.  Recommend the latest gamestop products and preorders.  Make sure everyone's questions get answered, and finally help the people working with me as much as possible."
good,"I'm going to be honest, this has hands down been the best job I've ever had. My managers are the best bosses I've ever had. There is no doubt in my mind ever that I matter to them, not only as a coworker, but as a person. In a world like ours, where the workers are just seen as profit generating wheels, people like my boss are too few and far between."
good,Working at Gamestop was a nice experience and I learned more about how to care for customers specific needs and get a better range of what individual types of personalities are like and how to approach each one. My former manager there was one of the best and fair ones Ive had.
good,"I have worked several seasons here. Each one has been positive and enjoyable. Being a gamer, getting to work around others that share the same interests makes the job that much easier."
good,"Overall the experience was a pleasant one. Aside from the internal politics that tended to pop up making management a bit more difficult, the overall experience was amazing. Had very helpful and caring bosses. Some of which remain good friends to this day. "
good,The hours were ok and management was good. The pay was horrible. Only made 7 an hour and you never get a raise unless you move up in company and that Is a one in a million to do.
good,"Typical workday: A typical workday is steady, and customers come in every few minutes, they browse and some buy. Best reason to work there is the customers I became friends with."
good,"Working with this company as long as I have, it helped me in developing a lot of my skills and learn new skills along the way as well. Not only did I improve and gain new skills, being with the company helped me eliminate some older skills I did not need anymore/skills that weren't beneficial in helping me grow as an employee."
good,"Working, whether paid or unpaid, is good for our health and well being. It contributes to our happiness, helps us to build confidence and self-esteem, and rewards us financially. Because of these benefits, it is important to return to work as soon as possible after an illness or injury."
good,"Great place to start a great career , hour wage could be  a bitter for the start but everything apart of that is great , great atmosphere within team members."
good,"Very good management structure but VERY entry level skill development even at the store manager level. "
good,I love my job with GameStop being a gamer myself it is easy to talk to guest and understand them. If it wasn’t for my engagement and moving out on our own I wouldn’t need to leave
good,"I loved working at my Gamestop when I worked there. However, I was only hired as a temporary seasonal employee, so I got the last pick of hours and days on the job, and the few days I did work were spread out over two months. I really miss it and would go back in a heartbeat if I could. I loved the mostly relaxed nature of the store, and having close coworkers that would help figuring things out when needed."
good,Gamestop - Good place to grow improved leadership skills daily and weekly. Work daily and weekly was focused on Service culture on how and what to improve the Service environment.
good,Store manager very friendly and out going best manager I have ever worked with.Co workers very friendly and out going nice and awesome place to work at.
good,"Great to start out with but need to advance through somewhere else. After a third key position , it is very hard to advance and recieve enough pay and hours to sustain oneself. Great environment , but its business is dieing."
good,Work was fun and I enjoyed going to work everyday. I enjoyed working around electronic products especially video games. I learned about pricing and how to sale and label new products.
good,The staff are all driven to provide and please all customers making for a great work environment. The customers become more like family as they are all valued customers.
good,Good place to work if you know video games and are knowledgeable about them. Staff are very friendly and will help train on the spot if you require assistance.
good,I had a great time at gamestop although it was seasonal. The managers were really cool and easy going people on top of the employees were all cool. It’s a pretty laid back job that allows you to talk about video games
good,As a seasonal employees. I got to say I enjoyed working there. It was fun and inviting. There were some difficult times with customers but that’s to be expected anywhere.
good,"A typical day at GameStop allows the opportunities for an associate to both culminate and foster skills, that they apply in helping customers, maintaining the store."
good,It’s nice getting to know the latest and greatest info on new games and accessories letting customers know and getting them excited to preorder. Interacting with customers was great
good,"Typical day at work in Gamestop is filled with organizing and handling the cash register. There were several things learned such as time management, how to be courteous to customers and update them on sales, etc."
good,"In my opinion personally working for the company was amazing best job I ever had, the pay was horrible but honestly I looked past that due to being able to talk to people about video games."
good,"A typical day at work is normally me adjusting the shelves at the store, ringing people up at the cash register and also answering any questions the customer may have."
good,"Fast paced environment, great working atmosphere very challenging tasks but nothing nobody can't handle. Friendly co-workers and very understanding managers."
good,"Obviously working at Gamestop requires a good background and involvement inthegaming world, and can help you thrive with your love for the job + training opportunities."
good,Gamestop is a relaxed place to work. All the customers that come in are very nice and the coworkers were really sweet too. I would recommend gamester to someone looking for an in between job though.
good,"It was great for a seasonal job that worked well with my other job schedule wise. My managers at the time were pretty awesome. The corperate culture at the time was as bad as I heard. Very focused on individual goals despite the lack of awareness about how busy different shifts were, and lack of awareness about consumer’s needs. I’ve heard they’ve since moved away from this strategy which is a good step. Still a loyal customer as well."
good,"It was an easy, not stressful job. Granted its usually only 2 employees in the store at all times. But come on its video games. Its not that difficult, help the customer and get them on their way. now and again you meet a video game enthusiast"
good,"Ambiente molto stimolante, ottimo team e molta clientela."
good,if u love video games and in school or college this is the job you would want otherwise to live working for gamestop its difficult bc during slow seasons u will only work 1-2 days a week
good,"Working at GameStop was a lot of fun. It's basically just like any other retail job, but with video games and franchises. A lot of my job was to rearrange the products in the store to fit the latest merchandising, and alphabetizing every case in the store. The location is small and doesn't get as much business as stores in bigger cities."
good,It is good place to work. You have to be real organice and fast about it. Keep everything clean plus be people friendly. It helps a lot of you know your gaming.
good,"Their pay is a bit low than their work because their work is fixing games and controllers, so its difficult to catchup for normal people unless you are me. But they only pay 10$"
good,"Easy work as long as you know about video games. The store can get a little busy during the holidays, and trades can sometimes be gross. Over all though It was a fun place to work."
good,"a typical day involved cleaning and assisting customers.management was great and my co workers were very friendly and helpful."
good,"I absolutely love working here. The staff is easy to talk to and the hours are not stressful. I love my experience here! I would recommend anyone to work here, dont miss out on a chance if you get one!"
good,from what i remember it was a slow paced work environment i did enjoy working there when i did but since i wasn't there long i do not really have much to say
good,"• Stocked the shelves. "
good,I worked in the call center and you really had your hands tied when it came to talking to customers. you didnt have alot of freedom with however many things you could do for them. which often left them upset
good,I love working at GameStop. It fits my needs well and plays to my strengths. I love gaming and the job is all about gaming and helping others find what they want.
good,"Roligt arbetsområde, bra fokus på kunder. Väldigt socialt då man utbyter en hel del konversationer med kunder och kunskaper kring spelrelaterade områden utvecklas. Lär sig ta ansvar genom att b.la. ha hand om pengar och öppna/stänga butik."
good,"Great place to work, more like a family than a job. positive and progressive environment. need more companies to take notes from Gamestop. Love Love Love this place!"
good,"Gamestop was a great opportunity for me. I had the chance to meet great people, learn new things, and take on new challenges. My time at the company was a success."
good,GameStop was a really nice place to work for. The atmosphere was always very pleasant. Hours can be kind of sparse unless you are an SM or an ASM. Advancement is pretty easy.
good,"Ottimo ambiente di lavoro, colleghi di lavoro competenti e simpatici."
good,GameStop was one of my favorite jobs. It was my first management role. It was fun working with a group of people that all enjoyed something similar. The environment was fun. Good communication skills and retail experience is a must.
good,"I worked as a seasonal employee, so i was not there past the end of the holiday season. I knew the assistant manager, and he helped me get the job. I had to stay on top of things there, which the managers made sure my coworkers and i would do. At the same time, i enjoyed interacting with customers and recommending games for them."
good,Really fun work enviornment. Loved all the different types of games and consoles. The culture itself there is very alive and thriving there as well. And the customers most of the time were always awesome and super appreciative
good,"I was already proficient in organizing things, so stocking the shelves with inventory wasn't complicated. The register was computerized, so it was easy to learn. I was able to learn communication skills by interacting with customers. I liked the job, but I wish I had been given more hours."
good,Greeted and assisted customers. Controlled fellow employee’s payroll by tracking and documenting their work hours. Altered pricing on merchandise when needed. Created and documented inbound and outbound shipments. Handled marketing appearance in store. Also in charge of opening and closing store duties.
good,"It was a fun, excitable, consistent, and the staff was awesome. Would definitely work there if given the opportunity again! The training was fast and simple and by my second week, I had everything pretty much down!"
good,"It's a lot of fun, but don't rely on them to pay your bills unless you can really up-sell people. The environment is great as well as the employees, most managers are cool as well. Again, don't rely on them to pay the bills."
good,I love working at Gamestop. They appreciate their employees and give them the autonomy they need to help our customers. The best part of working at Gamestop is all the different people I meet from the gaming community.
good,GameStop helped my customer service skills. It was a different environment from other places I have previously worked but everyone was friendly and welcoming.
good,"Fun work enviroment with awesome coworkers, but the customers were a pain to deal with at times, and the higher up managment made working there a living nightmare"
good,"I helped customers find, pre-order, and check out. I also did trade in, cleaning, and organizing the games. I love everything about this job and i would go back any day."
good,Gamestop was a really great company to work for.  I managed roughly 5-7 part time associates.  The hardest part of the job was keeping track of the inventory.  I loved when i could put a smile on a customer's face.
good,"Close knit employees."
good,"work days were slow, the management didn't really care to much "
good,Just didn't get enough hours I would've like to stayed on and got more  experience. I understood it was a seasonal position and I  could not stay. I  did learn a lot while I was there.
good,"This is by far my favorite job I had, sad I was only a seasonal. Face paced, stressful but I was surrounded by one of my favorite things, and I loved talking to the customers and assisting them with finding what they needed or even giving suggestions! The staff there were amazing in helping me learn about what I needed to know!"
good,"Game stop my first job and it was great fun job and I like video games and the store was so live all the time "
good,Its a good workplace. The workers are very kind and helpful. Cashier is something that was taught and how the system works. A typical day at work wasn't too busy but it was enjoyable because of the happy faces the customers left with and also just by working there.
good,Selling games and helping people is a great way to start customer service experience. Really hard to go up in ranks and pay but really great for people in high school or college.
good,Great place to work due to the fact that you work with nothing but video games. Free game rentals even a night before the game actually releases.
good,"If you're into video games, this is a great place to work with opportunities for advancement.  Nothing better than talking with customers about game play."
good,"Solid regular job that was close to me. Nice people that work there, managers are flexible with your schedule and it gets busy during the season so there is a lot to do."
good,"Worked with a lot of great people, learn new things about gaming platforms and new title releases. Got to try new titles and new systems. Definitely a fun place to work."
good,"To be honest, I can't really give much review for this particular company since I didn't have a chance to really get to show the store manager I worked for that I could work for the company. I didn't really learn much and didn't get to know any of my co-workers."
good,This job was very enjoyable because you met someone new every day. The only thing I disliked was that the advancement was not fair at all. A girl and I started at the same time and she became a store leader the beginning of this year but I was still an SGA. There isn't any opportunities to advance with this company at all.
good,"Although you may not get many hours (some employees only work 5 hours a week), it is a fun place to work and there are always ways to improve your skills of sales so that you can get a job in a big box store."
good,"Overall a good company to work for. Good benefits, and steady work. Always stay busy. Good supervisor, staff morale.Lots of new hires, so plenty of training to do."
good,"Gray job if in need of a second job or as a first job,  flexible with hours and friendly environment, great for gamers looking for an easy job"

The managers that i have worked with have all been great people that do their best to provide support for their employees and ensure that the store is operating smoothly.
good,GameStop was an amazing experience. The people there are wonderful and made me feel a part of the team immediately. It was hard work and I enjoyed every second of it.
good,"I was in search of a well paying entertaining job and game stop may have been busy, but it was truly worth it many days. I learned a lot about games, I learned more about being a cashier in retail, and being a sales rep was very informative opened my eyes on how open you have to be when many people with different attitudes and different mindset enter the store."
good,"The employees and managers has strong team work, great with customers , rarely had problems at all and everyone had an unbelievable strong bond."
good,Typical retail/customer service job. It was a good job but I was only temporary. Since I like games I was able to help people out.
good,I enjoyed working for Gamestop for a very long time. I would still be working here if not for other factors in my life. Great faced paced company with room for growth and development.
good,"A typical day at work was enjoyable and a learning experience. I learned about customer service, cash register, handling money, purchases, and helping customers with questions or problems. I had to manage the store, make sure everything was up to standards and organized. My co-workers were friendly and helpful. They would teach me new things, and help me if needed. The hardest part of the job was working at a very fast pace when there was a great amount of customers in the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customer satisfaction."
good,"I loved working there, my co-workers were amazing and understood my needs of being new and having to learn release dates and DLC's. "
good,Gamestop is an interesting place to work with co-workers who share common interests and a corporate office which seems to appreciate it's employees.  I enjoyed working for Gamestop.
good,A typical day at GameStop is none stop enjoyment. I've learned so much about different processors. Management assisted so much. My co-workers and I truly work as a team and view one another as family. The hardest part of the job is selling out of a product that a customer truly wants.

good,good place to work hard to make a living there. Learned new selling skills while working with coworkers and training on the computer

good,"Very fun atmosphere, fast paced and great coworkers. Loved the customers that came in, they brightened my day. Great Place to work."
good,I would usually get to talk to amazing people about things I was really passionate about. I would organize the store so that the costumers would be able to find what they wanted faster. I would answer questions to the best of my knowledge and if I didn't know the answer I would find it. I really enjoyed working with my bosses. They helped me learn and stay passionate about what I would do. The most enjoyable part of the job however was to be around people who where just as passionate I as I was about our products.
good,"Overall fun workplace with benefits, despite competitive hours and small pay. Co workers at gamestop and management are awesome people usually."

good,This is a fun workplace with supportive management. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them.
good,"I enjoyed my time at GameStop. After all, what's not to like about a job where you can talk about video games all day in between working your butt off? As with any job there are cons to this job especially for management, the hours in particular. Otherwise, great job. Lots of fun."
good,"Provided enthusiastic, energetic interaction with customer’s increased new game and product reservations by 15% all the while consistently exceeding sales goals for upcoming and reserved games newsletters and magazine subscriptions. Handled monetary transactions; assisted in bi-annual inventory audit. Maintained appearance of sales floor; provided new product demos. Informed customers of new and upcoming games, events, and etc."
good,"It was a lot of fun working for GameStop, the job was more challenging and set to my creative and bubbly attitude. Having to keep up with all that was being sold, or had to be sold always provided a challenge. The employment was kind and would discipline if needed. All in all it was like a family, and I couldn't thank them more!"
good,Working at GameStop has been very pleasant. I have been able to talk about my passion for video games while working. It has been amazing to train associates while discussing common interests. I have been responsible for training associates and overseeing daily operations.
good,I loved working at Gamestop because of how everyone would get along and the environment was easy to work in. It was always organized and completing tasks were easy.
good,Everyone who works there is awesome and all became quick friends. Christmas sucks because it's such a small store but overall its easy to find everything on the Mom's Christmas list.
good,"Responsible for the retail store’s day-to-day activities which included; store opening and   closing, customer service, cash handling, shipment, and product knowledge."
good,I have never had a bad day at work here. It is by far the most enjoyable job I have ever had and I look forward to going in every shift that I work. The bosses and co workers are like a big family. Every aspect of working at GameStop is nothing short of enjoyable.
good,I would highly recommend for any one who would want to work here very fun and great room for advancement for those who want that option
good,"I only did seasonal work here but this was a wonderful experience for me. I didn't like the fact that I didn't get many hrs until the holiday rush, but it picked up."
good,Face passed and effective. from the minute you clock in and clock out. I felt like I rally earned every single dollar of my paycheck.
good,I have been working at Gamestop since Oct. 2013. I have learned about the latest gaming consoles and their accessories. I enjoy interacting with the customers on a daily basis. My co-workers are all friendly and very knowledgeable in the respective field. My manager is very organized and works hard with his employees to ensure we are all up-to-date on the current sales and focal points in the company at the time. I look forward to going to work each day because I know that I have co-workers I can call friends as well and that are respectable to me and others.
good,fun to work with employees and for the customers of the gaming community.
good,"STOP."
good,"Amazing company"
good,The best part of working at gamestop is definitely the people. Being able to joke around and talk about games makes the long days blow by in an instant.
good,"I enjoy working at Gamestop. I have not put in very many hours, I started December 1, 2014 and would like to continue. I love my co-workers, as well as the customers that have come in. It's an entertaining and intriguing job. Working there keeps me on my toes, because a customer can ask any range of questions about any of our products and I have to be prepared with correct knowledge about any and all products in the store."
good,The benefits are great the environment is wonderful to work in and its not to complicated a job for the money. So all in all an amazing place to work.
good,"Working at GameStop is basically all about providing a great customer experience. A typical day at work is providing information and exclusive offers to our customers to better inform them so they can make the right decision. Working at this establishment i learned how to greet and target specifications in games or systems the customer is looking for. The hardest part is not being able to help or inform the customer to their needs. The Best part is being able to interact with customers and putting a smile on their face, which of course puts a smile on my face."
good,There is  plenty of room to grow with in the company and the opportunities come with in as you perform. When you are passionate about what you do it doesn't become your job anymore and that's exactly how this company works. POWER TO THE PLAYERS!
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is their was always opportunities for career advancement.
good,A typical work day is being brought up to date on what is new.  I have learned different approaches to marketing and merchandising.  My management and co-workers are helpful and fun to be around.  The hardest part of this job is irate customers that want to return games that are over a year old.  The most enjoyable part is teaching the customer the difference between consoles.
good,"work regular 8 hr shifts"
good,I love working for these kind of places because I am a nerd and I love playing games so I help other people find the games they want.
good,Soddisfazioni per il rapporto creato con il pubblico. Tutto il lavoro piacevole.
good,"Did not work here very long, maybe fifteen hours a week if I was lucky but it was just very part time when I was still in high school.  We greeted customers, put games away, suggested games, we got to test out new games, rang up customers, and excelled in every aspect of customer service."
good,A typical day was selling video games the most fun part of working there was being able to play the games.
good,Was an experience and an opportunity working at Gamestop. Everyone of the associates were completely awesome people. would love to recommend working at that location.
good,If you love video game this is the place to work.It know the people and sharing the same likes
good,"The busiest times were Christmas Eve and the day after Christmas. I only worked as a seasonal associate, so I thought my time was valued and helped improve sales in the long run."
good,"Just your typical retail job."
good,"As a Assistant Store Manager it was fun to come, and look at the new, and exiting products coming out, the staff was very helpful, and very informative. Good benefits, and all around good environment"
good,"I loved this job! It was a fast pace and very challenging environment. We had company goals for sales numbers which provided a challenging sense to the job. The only downfall to speak of, is the amount of daily counts and operations. Overall, a great job and great atmosphere to work in if you like customer service in high volumes."
good,"Extremely flexible hours, but all in all it's a gamer's dream to work here."
good,"I loved the staff, management could have been better. You will meet a bunch of great customers."
good,I enjoy working there. I was able to get my duties done while habing fun. I loved helping customers and answering questions. The best part about my job was watching a child walk out the door satisfied. I met mostly every goal I had. I never came to work in a bad mood because I loved who I work with and for.
good,"As a Game Adviser, I am responsible for overall store tidiness, cleanliness, and approaching guests to make a connection about the games they love. I use suggestive selling and add-on selling techniques to improve customer's experiences and to continue to grow clientele. There are keyholders and managers who ensure I am responsible for my performance, and direct the flow of the tasks assigned. Difficulties can arise with several customers simultaneously during high traffic times, and I excel at expedient yet quality service during such times. I absolutely love gaming and videogames, and working with them."
good,wish it had more hours. it can get stressful sometimes but it is a relativiatly easy job
good,"I handle any network issues, printer configurations and any windows operating system troubleshooting."
good,"The co-workers are amazing people. The job itself was very fun, always meeting new people and getting along with everyone made the job easier. The customers were great people to talk to, always learning something new about them. Overall, it was an amazing job."
good,"As a woman in GameStop you will find yourself being hit on often. As a gamer you will find yourself in heaven! I loved working there, aside from the pervies. I like how simple it is to be promoted. I find it to be a great chance for anyone seeking first employment or part time. anyone who wants full time or a good salary might want to try somewhere else."
good,Working for Gamestop was one of the greatest experiences of my life. I loved the company. Loved the store I worked in and the people I worked with. I had training for a key holder position but I moved. I was supposed to be transferred to the store here where I live but that fell through the cracks. Working with the public is always difficult but I sold video games and I was good at it.
good,"I just started less than a month ago, so I have been in training. My typical day you put product back out on the shelf, which has to be in alphabetical order. I also run the cash register. I love learning from my co-workers about new and old games. I enjoy getting suggestions on games I should try and by working there you can keep updated on the newest games coming out."
good,"Interacting acting with customers everyday, informing customers of upcoming products. Great staff and wonderful co-workers. Keeping up with the latest games and consoles"
good,"An alright job, just not enough variety of work to do. I was assigned the same tasks each day which I enjoyed but was ready to learn new things. Great co-workers, management just an exciting place to work."
good,"A typical day in this particular GameStop would consist of making sure that I was dressed in proper attire, showing up on time making sure that the store was up to par and keeping the games in order throughout the day. I would meet interesting people every time the doors would open it was a very lively upbeat atmosphere and I simply loved it. I would say the hardest part of the job was keeping in mind that I was at work and not getting too friendly with the customers so that I wouldn't neglect my duties. with the co-workers being as fun and alive as they were they kept me from ever having a dull moment while I was employed by GameStop. I learned a lot form my manager and co-workers form handling complicated situations with angry or outraged customers to understanding how the system worked it was a very homely but professional environment."
good,"A typical day at work involves helping customers, organizing the store, and taking trade-ins."
good,"A fast paced, evolving company that sets standards for ethical business practices."
good,Had a blast and enjoyed working for the company and co workers.
good,Coworkers were fun and knowledgeable. Easy work schedule and short hours. Never an issue with education or need of time off. Laid-back and was able to relate to customer's easily.
good,Count register and clock in. unpack boxes of merchandise and sort it. apply stickers to it and shelve items appropriately. assist customers in deciding the best games for them or there children. alphabetize games and clean the store when i leave. re-market if need be. management was respectful and helpful and believed in working as a team as well as the co-workers. Their was not a hard part to this job to me.But the most enjoyable part was having customers return with a smile knowing they can trust me on a good reference to a game and working with a great group of people.
good,"You don't get this job for the pay, you get it because of the perks and the work environment. As long as you can deal with that, and you like talking to people and video games, then this is the place for you."
good,"- District managers don't know what they are doing but besides that the best job I've ever had"
good,I enjoyed working here. the staff were really nice. the management were very helpful and you ever had a problem they had no problems helping you out.
good,"At times I would feel taken advantage of, more pay would have been better, but the people for the most part were nice."
good,"Enjoyed the long walk before and after work to vehicle. "
good,"Definitely regret leaving this place but it had several downfalls. Our management team was falling apart but going into work was always fun. Met tons of people, even had regular customers. Fixed up walls and displays. I learned how to work a POS here and its definitely helped me in all of my other jobs. I learned how to add on merchandise as well as bringing customers back by selling reserves."
good,To do this job you have to be informed in the gaming world and have the ability to up-sale.
good,"Gamestop is a great overall environment because it's something that kids love ""Video Games"""
good,"The customers are understanding and caring as well as my co-workers. The hardest part would be if we have an unhappy customer, but we usually try our best to help them."
good,Gamestop gave me experience in dealing with all sorts of people.
good,"Best place to work, looking to get back into business world and out of retail."
good,Match online order tickets to products and to pack orders received from online purchase.
good,"My overall rating is 5 stars for this company. This is a stable company that is very flexible. Its a very diverse company, jobs here are very secure and room for advancement is rare. Management is great and I can balance work, life and school."
good,Loved this job. Co-workers were great always a lot of fun at work!
good,staff was really friendly. Place and pick orders according to customer wants. avoid errors.
good,"I recomend this company. It was fun fast paced,with room to grow in the company."
good,This way my first real job. I feel that the manager I worked for is an amazing person and would go back there in a heart beat.
good,"Coworkers and managers shared love for video games, so it was a fun environment to work in. Learn about new games and got to test some before it was mass produced."
good,"Great day to day operations, Workload not to strenuous."
good,My only problem with Gamestop was that my work schedule conflicted with my school schedule and unfortunately I could not stay there.
good,this job was right up my ally. i know a lot about the job and had great employees.
good,Best job i have ever had. I love the video game environment and all of my customers. the hardest part was leaving everyday.
good,"Throughout a day at GameStop, there were many different kinds of customers, ranging from children to late adulthood. The job was very customer-service focused, given that nearly every customer required assistance in some way while shopping at the store. One must be very organized, friendly, and especially patient while working at GameStop."
good,"At GameStop, we learned how to treat people with the respect they deserve. We also managed to work together to keep up the company stander and to push sales above the expected. The fun part is the great team work experience,"
good,I am a big gamer and I had a good bunch of co-workers there. I would go in and clock in and enjoy the smell of new electronics. The manager was one of the best managers I have ever had.
good,"A typical work day included helping customers, keeping the store organized, and processing trade-ins. The managers and coworkers were unique characters who were helpful and encouraging. The hardest part of this job was the vigilance of keeping the store organized during busy hours. What I enjoyed most about the job was the environment and the customers that I was able to interact with."
good,"A typical day during the holiday season was helping people with their holiday shopping. The store was busy most of the days that I worked there. The other seasonal associates were interesting people to talk with when time allowed for it. The full-time associates and managers were behind the counter mostly expediting sales, and assisting the seasonal associates with questions if we had any about pricing and more information regarding bundles and packages. The hardest part of the job was staying focused because the customers were so abundant that there was little time between finishing with one customer and moving onto the next; so it was a little grueling as far as pace at which business was moving. The thing I enjoyed the most was probably the pay because it was the first place that was able to hire anybody (even if it was for only a month or two) so it was nice to have a few dollars to put into the bank. Overall, I would definitely work there again if I got a call-back but I'm looking for a more career-oriented position."
good,The people I worked with were willing to help me when I wasn't exactly sure what to do at a particular moment in time. The work hours were flexible and meshed well with my school hours.
good,Great environment but no room for advancement. Training is lacking luster.
good,"I mean it could be better because of the recent GameStops closing we don’t have an Assistant Manager but, we’re trying our best and I honestly like it I just wish my hours were more consistent"
good,"Enjoyed the environment; cool staff to work with, everyone got along great, I learned a lot about games, customers were great and overall a good work environment."
good,"Fun place to work, but the pay isn't good. Can't live off of it. The people are fun to work with, and they know their games and systems.  Very relaxed and easy going group of people."
good,Hardest part of the job is sales. During holidays or weekends employees are trained to sell console as well as gift cards etc. Your knowledge of gaming increases which is the upside of the job.
good,"Gamestop begins to hire closer to the beginning of fall. "
good,"Great place to build lifetime relationships. Field Management is decent, but the expectations are sometimes a little out of control. But I love working there and as long as you build the correct relationships, you will have a great experience there."
good,"Managers seems more in touch with customers than with employees or employee schedules/needs. Overall, the experience is fun if you like people and are fairly patient and quick witted"
good,Not a bad place to work coworkers are great customers are amazing on a good day only bad thing I would say is the staff is underpaid for what we deal with on a daily basis customers are rude the store is sometimes under staffed and we do not always get the product to meet the demand.
good,"I wish I could actually stay with the company because there is so much potential found there, but even as a manager I am paid a measly sum and almost never get any additional benefits at the job. This is the case for most GameStop workers, and unfortunately is the only reason I wish to find other employment. GameStop, you will be missed."
good,A typical work day for Game Stop was greeting customers and helping them with buying and trading games. The leadership and customers were great to be around and work with. I feel like I learned a lot of quality customer service working at games stop. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was working with such an energetic and passionate group of people.
good,"It is a very easy place to work. Everything that you had to do was fun, easy, and fairly easy to learn. Everyone got a long, worked together well, and mad sure they had a good environment for customers. However, the hours, depending on your status there, were horrible."
good,"Not too many things can be said bad about my position at Gamestop. I had a good part time job there, also had very few disagreements or misscomunications."
good,basically its fun and if you really love games then this is a good place to be around people who are like minded but the hours tend to be horrible and pay isn't very good at all.
good,Fun if you be gaming. And interaction between customers and children and teenagers. Great work environment. Steady pace of work. Not to many hrs available unfortunately.
good,"I Really Love Working For The Company, Best Thing Is Taking Care Of The Customers, And Working With My Employees, I Get To Get Hands On With Some Of The Best Products In The Gaming Community"
good,"● Fun environment "
good,A typical day at work started as soon as i would walk in. It was very fun and very productive. There was hardly time where we didn't have down time but when we did we kept busy by taking quizzes provided by our work to learn more about our products. I learned how to become more understanding to peoples needs. Immediate management was amazing but our higher ups didn't really care much about our individual stores. Co-workers were amazing and helpful. There wasn't really a hard part of the job but the most challenging part was when it would get busy since we only had two registers. Most enjoyable was when the customer was satisfied with our customer service.
good,"The most entertaining job I have ever had, but the lowest paying with the worst benefits. I would love to go back if they paid more now."
good,Was a great place to work i was seasonal and didnt get to stay long i didnt reaally like that if u didnt ell power up cards u didnt get may hours.
good,"The day would vary depending on if you were opening or closing.  Then the other factor would be who was on shift prior to you.  My store manager at the time was quite lazy and ended up passing his work on to his Assistant Manager and myself.  This would cause more work then was needed, however it would get done.  The only thing I can say I truly learned from that place was the retail system and using the Point of Sale system.  Everything else I felt was basic knowledge such as being an effective leader, which I learned while in the Navy for 5 years.  Overall the job was easy and fun when working with productive people."
good,learned about stocking merchandising register money count maintence being a game advisor labeling communication skills woking as a team getting task done catergorizing alphabetizing in alpha order game ratings learned about system producing company somewhat knowledge on apple and android products also learned how to fix system errors
good,Working here was a fun environment to be in as well as a good learning curve as a personal salves representative and to also hep me become a better cashier with learning how to do cash exchanges.
good,Helping costumers find the game they are looking for and cleaning up the sales floor. Much of the job is sales and organizing. I learned more register training and picked up great sale advice.
good,Normally working for a game store is fun but where I worked was even better because my co-workers helped me understand things in easy fun ways and getting to know them made them  like family. The management was strict on rules but was really fun and nice about it at the same time. The hardest part of the job was nothing everything was easy for me and fun. The best part of it was to learn new skills and new knowledge.
good,"Things would get done most of the time. Managers can be a little too lenient when it comes to getting something done. I never slacked off or played while I was on the job, but a lot of my coworkers did. I learned that even though you're at work, some play is needed to stay sane. However, there is a time and place for everything and unless it is your job to play all day, playing at work should not be in the schedule. The most enjoyable part of my job was coming in and seeing familiar faces walk through the door. Willing to try out the latest gaming system or try out a classic game."
good,"I've been with gamestop for years. One of the things that keeps me there is my relationship with the other team members. I love the work and I enjoy talking to customers (and team members) about new and trending video games... And of course getting a discount is great."
good,"Come in setup, go thru own check list and making sure all pertinent information is correct and move to the next level. Co-workers were very helpful and I enjoyed the covered parking."
good,i go either from restocking and cleaning walls to talking to customers and also selling and taking in video games for sell
good,"While helping customers with video game consoles and games. I maintained inventory, trained fellow employees , maintained the sales floor,and a register till."
good,"While providing excellent customer service, I was also responsible for trying to get the customer to suscribe to our gaming magazines (Game Informer) and to seek their interest in out store cards which allowed them to receive insentives and bonuses. Our managment staff was very friendly and helpfu .They never let me astray.The hardest part about it was the hectic re-organzing and inventory that came with getting prepared for the next day. the best part was being able to try all the new games before we let them out on the floor. Finally, we had to restock and do inventory of all of our hardware and software. making notes f what was missing and what we had available."
good,Mi sono trovata bene in quanto era possibile svolgere varie mansioni all’interno del punto vendita e si veniva spronati da un ambiente pieno di stimoli
good,I worked for Gamestop for 4 years. It was minimum pay and maybe 8 to 10 hrs a week. LOVED my bosses. They were incredible. But there are absolutely no hours to work for Gamestop. For two years I pretty much just sat on the payroll but was given absolutely no hours until they finally fired me. I miss the place but its honestly not worth working there unless you are a teenager.
good,"Bella esperienza, ma azienda falsa, promette un futuro con carriera, e non appena sei tra i primi 10 in classifica non ti rinnovano il contratto, e manco ti danno l'indeterminato."
good,"If you like retail and video games then GameStop is a good fit, the problem most people have with GameStop is that it is a SELLING job, so you do have to sell. It's not easy and laid back but it is extremely rewarding. If the company had more of a future I would've stayed on but working there 10+ years I can tell you that as far as specialty retail goes, it is a great place to work."
good,It's a great experience with some fun people and the timing it takes to make connections with customers. The management is friendly but there is a low amount of hours to be given.
good,There was only 1 bad thing about this job for me. The hours. I worked 1 day a week. That's it. However the people I worked with and the benefits as far as discounts and employee sales went was amazing. To date my favorite job. Just wished I had more hours and could be paid more.
good,"I loved working at Gamestop. I was only a seasonal employee, but I 100% would go back if I had the time for a second job. In fact, while I was working there, I had two jobs and though it was exhausting (The whole waking up at 5 AM to work 6-2:30 and then Immediately driving to Gamestop to work another 8 hours), it felt so fulfilling. I didn't think I could function on such little sleep, but because it was so relaxed, along with my other job, I didn't feel any buildup of stress while I worked there. At one point, between the two, I worked nearly 80 hours in one week. It was amazing. "
good,"I loved working for GameStop. While starting out as a temp, I was then hired on as a full time employee. After spending two years in the warehouse, I was then hired on in their corporate office."
good,A typical day would be me honestly chilling. We don't get too many people but we get a good amount in a day. I'm mostly just ringing people up but It's a amazing job.
good,"At gamestop they are very patient and very relaxed. They are very helpful and try their best to help customers find what they need, even telling them which other locations have the product they are looking for. The work experience is also very relaxed and everyone is nice to each other, and also help out anyone who is new."
good,"A typical day starts off with updating inventory and cleaning the sales area.  Upon opening the store, you assist customers on an as needed basis.  I liked that they placed you in the store according to your favorite gaming system.  I would mainly work on a seasonal basis so I enjoyed serving parents and friends that wanted to buy gaming systems and games to the delight of their relatives.  The hardest part of the day would be the influx of customers when we were opened later at night.  If you are not a people person and can't multi-task, this position would not be in your best interest."
good,"Tremendo el sistema de trabajo "
good,Video games are a passion of mine so I really enjoyed this job. I wish I could have had more hours and career advancement opportunities. Overall would work here part-time any time they called.
good,"It was a great place to work while I was in college. They allowed me to check out used games that saved me some money, and also allowed me to work on homework while the store was empty."
good,At the age of 17 this job was great for someone who has a love of video games and needs an space to express it and share it. The work can be difficult during the holidays but is very nice the rest of the year.
good,"this was my first job, and probably my favorite. there was no pressure put on me by my employers, and we always  worked together. it was hard to learn everything at first, but worth the effort."
good,The issue I had was not related in any way to this/his store or to the franchise company of GameStop. The issue was actually caused by an outside company and related to internet access. The owner still fixed it solely to keep his customers happy. I really appreciated this and thus I will be doing more video game business here versus online.
good,Loved the people. Hated knowing who was corrupt and never being able to get it to a high enough power in the chain of command. Keep your head down and nose to your work. Or know someone who can do something about the problem.
good,I absolutely LOVED working at GameStop. All of my co-workers were amazing my manager was also one of the coolest guys I know! ONLY DOWNSIDES ARE No Guaranteed hours and the pay is AWFUL! I left to only because some Friends and i were going to open up a LAN Center (Competitive Gaming Center). I would go back in a heartbeat though. I guess it is just the love for the people at the stores. towards the time I left Corporate started coming into the stores more and more firing people for not meeting their outrageous sales goals. Same with their Pro Card and Pre-Order percentage.
good,Fun to work at but not going to pay to much until you get to assistant manager even then you'll only make around 13 dollars lots of pricing and inventory changes every week or so.
good,I've worked at three different locations on three separate occasions and have not loved a job more. It's a fun environment to work in and you meet some great people. It's a smaller staff so you really get to know the people you work with. You really feel like a family.
good,Loved working and managing a store for this company. Hours where good and compensation was almost good. The customers where great to work with since I love talking about games all day.
good,"Good place to work during college. Awesome staffs usually. I worked at 3 locations."
good,It's a great place to work people are fun to be around . Customers are very polite .. Workers are fun .. The best place to get game systems and games for cheap
good,"I loved working here. So much so that I would love to work there again; only if their pay was competitive. It was a great work environment and I never left feeling like I hated my job. Honestly, Gamestop does have its ups and downs, but it was definitely one of the greatest places to work. Especially if its your first job or if you want to work a second job!"
good,"On a typical day a shift could last anywhere from 2 to 8 hours. Peak hours are managed by up to 4 employees. During the busy season i.e. holidays, the job can be a bit overwhelming. However, at the end of the day you can still get excited with customers about video games and upcoming products."
good,"Fun corporate office due to specialized retail focus (video games & ThinkGeek).  Although video games are moving to digital, there are growth opportunities in the other family of brands owned by the company."
good,"Working at gamestop was just as one would expect, you work with video games, encounter all sorts of customers, generally quite a nice lot"
good,A typical day I would open work by myself for 5 hours helping people then i would have help come in. I would then take a break for thirty minuets then comeback work for thirty more minuets then leave.
good,Amazing days of work. Working with some of the coolest customers and sometimes even celebrities. I learned the values of a team. How to be a successful salesman. Management was awesome. I worked with some of the best managers in the company. My co-workers were extremely fun and hard working individuals that made our store go around. The hardest part of my job was definitely the rude customers with dissatisfaction in what they had purchased. The most enjoyable part of my job was pretty much everything I loved working there.
good,This was a typical retail experience.  I have no complaints about working with the company or employees.  I was able to perform basic managerial tasks while working in an industry that I have enjoyed as a hobby for many years.
good,"The typical work day had a casual feel, the manager was nice and so were the other employees, the company was very organized also."
good,"Other than being robbed, it was great. Worked in the Liffey Street branch and enjoyed every last minute of the job. "
good,"The most thing I can say about my previous employment was for the simple fact I was a team player, I got my work done, always had a game plan for every game release or for just a daily routine work schedule. I learned alot from working with the management as well from my co workers to teach me a few things to better myself to become a manager. Customers loved to just come to the store location to purchase items and also to become PUR (Power Up Rewards) members."
good,I stocked shelves and talked about new releases with customers! I made many friends and learned a bit about running the store from my boss. It was a fun environment! My coworkers and I had each others backs through the chaos of holidays and angry 12 year olds trying to buy Mature games. which can only be bought by adults of 18 years of age and older. I really loved this job but needed more hours.
good,"Manger works hard, never a boring day, great team of people i would love to work there again. great place to work and enjoy yourself"
good,I loved working at GameStop. Its not hard you just need to know your ABC's. But the pay was below minimum wage and the most hours I worked was 4 a day only 3-4 days a week. I would be lucky to get midnight launch. That would have been an extra hour of work.
good,I love this job when I was young. The hours worked well with my school and the co-workers and the customers were very enjoyable. The only problem was it didn't pay enough for me to stay.
good,"il lavoro è molto impegnativo, ma divertente, gli orari di lavoro sono buoni, il contatto con il pubblico e la cura del cliente è molto importante in questa azienda."
good,A very fun place to work and fast paced. Co-workers are great to work with.
good,Unless you're a manger than woking here isn't going to et you far. Which is why its a great place for someone that needs a part time job. Its fun.
good,"typical day,morning inventory count, check emails ,put up store marketing,opening safe, set up cash register[computer]. store opens at  10:00. I'm on the clock at 9:00. Ups drops off more inventory to be put up. working the cash register I am the only one there tell 11:30 am. 12:00 bank run for change, and deposit. store operations and close. We all worked as a team to be number one in pre-sales,and we was. are store was awarded 1# in Mo. In 2009. It was fun, it was hard work, but being a gamer I was working with something I loved."
good,I would just wait for customers to come in & help them with suggestions & purchases or place any special request.
good,Most days where very busy especially around the holidays. Overall though I have to say it is a great experience and a good job to move up in.
good,I hd alot of fun working here i enjoyed helping the customers find the game they want to play.
good,"As a whole I like GameStop but out of the two places I worked and with plenty of friends/family that worked there, I know management is slow and lazy. A lot of stuff I was told to do, was wrong latter on but was never told until weeks later and some problems at hand where never resolved. Now don't get me wrong I liked working with them and my manager did get done what he needed to get done, but as a whole the company seems to have a laziness about it."
good,"I never dreaded coming into work. I was always very happy to go. I would get to help people all day with something I knew a lot about. I learned how to deal with peoples needs better and I learned to ask open ended question to more quickly identify their needs. The manager and my coworkers were all very friendly people and they were great to be around. The hardest part of the job for me was closing just because there was a lot of cleaning, but it really wasn't that bad. The most enjoyable part of the job was my manager and coworkers."
good,"A typical day at work involves providing customers with information on video games and providing exceptional customer service.  Using this exceptional customer service, you can mitigate almost all customer service issues (which is by far the hardest part of the job).  "
good,I enjoyed every day I came into work for Game Stop. Every customer had their own interests and always a story to tell. I would spend my days unpacking shipment and chatting with customers who just liked to hang out and discuss our video game interests. It was a great environment.
good,A typical day at work is relaxing except everyonce in awile you'll get some not so very happy customers but it's nothing the crew couldn't handle.
good,"GameStop is a great company to work for, especially when you're an 18-25 year old gamer. I worked for them for three years and my experience there was really amazing. I loved that job, I met a lot of great people, the customers were cool to chat with, the people i worked with were amazing, and learned a lot of valuable skills,"
good,"calm yet productive. Would get busy at times but very manageable. Learned how to work on the cash register, change and revise price tags, search for inventory with a special program of theirs. Manager was very patient, friendly and nice, as well as my co-workers. Not a hard job at all. Enjoyed every minute working there."
good,Cashier and sales. Weekly inventory and a few midnight launches for really popular game. While there I also did some light house keeping.
good,The work area is well taking care of and is enjoyable. Not to hard but does give chances to make yourself a better worker.
good,Nice place to work part-time. Management and co-workers were great.
good,"A typical day at work consists of answering many questions customers have about anything game related. Working there I've learned a lot about game consoles and video games as well. Management was very laid back and easy going. A lot of my co-workers were very pleasant to work with and always cheerful. The hardest part of the job was dealing with a lot of sexist customers. Being that I'm a female they underestimated my knowledge, but I would always have the answer they were looking for. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to handle all if the merchandise and knowing about games or consoles before anyone else even knew they were coming out."
good,"A typical day at work consists of greeting every customer, and assuring they are notified of any ongoing sales at the moment, helping those customers find anything they are looking for, and then checking them out at the register."
good,"A typical work day was, coming in, clock in, if it is a slow day, go through and sort the games on the shelves. Greet customers as they walk in, Help them with anything they need."
good,"Job was fun. "
good,"Enjoyed working for them a lot, wish they paid more and had more hours. Only fulltime and management got the best hours and pay. Overall tho, I didn't have a bad experience working there."
good,"GameStop provided enough help to get me through my shifts with little to no problems. Staff was super friendly, helpful, and lenient. I was handed a fair amount of responsibilities, and guided through stressful events."
good,"Man, the working world is hard. It might sound stupid, but you never know how truly gruelling standing 8 hours on your feet doing something you don't wanna do is until, well, you do it. It wasn't Gamestop's fault I'm spoiled(?) and was totally destroyed emotionally and physically by their job. It was an easy job with friendly people and reasonable managers. I worked for them through Cornerstone Staffing as a temp. "
good,"The Gamestop stores offer a unique place where gamers can come to socialize and interact with each other over fandoms, games, or anything in between. Employees get to interact with customers who share similar values in entertainment."
good,The job was great just i needed more hours and better pay to be able to afford my bills. And I just need to search for a new job. Also I didnt get fired or leave the store was just being shutdown.
good,Management and other employees are friendly and great to work with. Work gets slow on occasion but also very fast on other occasions. The manager is reasonable to work with when it comes to asking for more hours. The hardest part of the job is finding something to do when work slows down. The easiest part of the job would be speaking with customers regarding games they are interested in.
good,"Gamestop is a fun culture to work in. Aside from the typical woes of retail and retail management, there is a reasonable balance of high-temp and low-tempo work. The Company generally underpays its associates and lacks ""individual"" employee value. Many of the policies and procedures are directives given from administrators without logical or realistic goals.  Many of the expectations feel as though they are created by people with little or no store-level experience or reasonable understanding of the front line logistics."
good,"Die Arbeit macht Spaß, ein Grund dafür ist sind die Kollegen. Man versteht sich auch privat und trifft sich um was zu unternehmen oder einfach nur um eine Runde zu zocken."
good,"Super slow on some nights, but it’s super busy during the holidays because of the deals that they have. A lot of the interactions will be with customers, you always want to greet them when they come in and maybe even introduce yourself and your coworkers and let them know you’re there to help."
good,"Lavoro a contatto col publico per consigli su videogiochi e console da acquistare e varia accessoristica o merchandising."
good,Hands down easiest place to be more versatile. You get to learn what to do when it's down time and what not to do when its go time. Depending on location of store you work at it can be very fast paced BUT you deal with so many smiles it wouldn't feel hard it's a fun job especially if you're a gamer
good,"Fantastisk arbeidsplass, lett å komme inn i rutiner, flink sjef med passe godt grep på butikk og ansatte. Friheten til å utvikle deg videre."
good,"The management is good, and the workplace culture is competitive in a fun way. As an SGA you can learn the basics of management and training others. You do need to make sure you do the management tasks you are assigned, such as cleaning the store after close, merchandising, and inventory control. The most enjoyable part of it is talking to people about video games. The hardest part is when people are afraid of you talking to them about video games."
good,"Typical day involves immediate sign in, shop floor management, stock replenishment, dealing with customers, hitting targets via sales and aiding customers with all queries they may have."
good,I absolutely loved working at GameStop because I am a big gamer. I would have loved to have been there for longer but they were only hiring for seasonal positions.
good,This can be an enjoyable career path with the right management and co-workers. Ive worked at a couple different locations and they all run similarly but the environment can be completely different depending on who your coworkers are.
good,I really have nothing bad to say about GameStop aside from it being difficult to get in the door and the pay isn't great. What I can say is it makes up in perks for what it lacks in pay. If your just a gamer and lack customer service skills this job really isn't for you.
good,My time at GAMESTOP started with some uncertainty as i was not your average Gamer but with time and training i begin to learn more and more about games and having better one on one talks with the customer. My strong point with the company was the operations part of it with coming in very early sometimes 6am starts doing inventory and counting over 600 games some morning. hardest part of the job was the lost prevention part of it and being such a high volume store and the foot traffic being so high u had to always be on your toes and very aware
good,i build the career of gaming and telling others of games that became great to know of and learn to work with other people; what they were happy for...
good,"A typical work day at Gamestop is always productive. Never stop and get work done. I learned how to keep calm under pressure and to keep customers happy. Management has always been wonderful and understanding, teaching and yet tough. Workplace culture is wonderful, for the store is not just Gamestop, it is my store that I take pride in caring and curating. The hardest part of the job is not having the item a customer is looking for and or having to find it in a different store, and trying to find a way to the customer in case it is not available on our website. The most enjoyable part of this job is making customers happy and being able to say that I made that possible."
good,Advancement was an issue. Hours were cut. But the atmosphere was great. Great management. Great employees. Great business. Just no room to grow. Employee pay could be more fair.
good,"I've personally worked for the company for 7 years now and I have enjoyed every minute of it. Being a gamer myself, it's made the job that much more enjoyable. Being around video games and other like minded guests, is the best part of this job."
good,awesome place to work if your into video games although it can be a bit stressful during the holidays its nothing compared to other retail places in the same category.
good,It's suuper fun place to work. I love the video games and get pay for doing what you love it's really really good. Also the company prepare you with all the knowledge that you need to grow into the company or in another company. Was a good experience.
good,If your knowledge is great in games and your competitive in completing goals GameStop a great job. I had fun while working for this company they just lacked in hours but if they had me full-time I’ll probably be general manager right now.
good,"If you love gaming and helping people find the best games and gaming products then this job is for you, great schedules great managers, and there is possibility for advancement."
good,Gamestop was one of the best jobs I had. It was relaxed work. Mangers were easy going but tough when they needed to be. Discounts and benefits were great if you were interested in their products. Associate apreciation day was the best.
good,"I was a seasonal worker so I had no benefits or even job security, so please dont take my ratings on that part to heart. The client interactions were very important when I was working, too. The coworkers I had were fun people and if I felt like something would have overwhelmed me, they would laugh and help me through it; my coworkers were good people to a temp like me, and I still think of my time working there fondly."
good,great place to work if you absolutely enjoy the electronic life of gaming. Customers were 90% of the time friendly and staff was always there to have your back and help you if needed.
good,"Work was never boring. Time constraints were extremely heavy and work load was too mich for alloted time. Care for employee well-being was extremely low, and only shown from the store level. DM and higher had no care for employee unless the employee began doin poorly and hurting the store"
good,"Awesome place to work, but the biggest downside to this place is that you're not going to get very many hours to work with. Great perks, but terrible benefits."
good,The management and other employees are always inviting and positive ready to work. I enjoyed every shift I worked with this company and was always excited for another shift.
good,"Gli orari di lavoro sono perfetti,si lavora mezza giornata dalle 9:00 alle 15:00(orario mattutino) e dalle 15:00 alle 21:00(orario pomeridiano)"
good,"Ever since I was young I have always wanted to work at GameStop. I had always shopped at the same local GameStop since I was seven or eight years old. I became a regular, and got to know the staff very well. At the age of seventeen I would occasionally go up to my local store to talk with the employees about upcoming games and deals. At the age of eighteen I applied for a seasonal position at GameStop. I was always up there and the manager was well aware I knew my stuff about Video Games. I arrived fifteen minutes early to my interview, and ten minutes later I was hired. Working at GameStop was one of the best experiences of my life. I was able to use my knowledge of video games, something I enjoy, to help others with any questions or tasks they possibly had. I learned a lot from working at GameStop, especially since it was my first job. As an employee you will learn great customer service skills and job experience. The hardest part of working at GameStop would be the stock. There is a lot to be done with the video games in-store after a customer trades in merchandise. You are expected to print out new covers for game cases, re-tag any wrongly priced merchandise, clean game consoles that have been traded in, repackage merchandise for shipping, and so much more. I enjoyed every aspect of my position at GameStop. I enjoyed working with a fun, positive staff of fellow gamers. Overall, I would gladly take a seasonal position at GameStop again in the future. It's an annual way to get more enjoyment out of a hobby I enjoy everyday."
good,"I liked the customer focused ideals, and wish that I was called into to work more or was accepted as a part time after my seasonal work was over. It may have been a small store, but it was great."
good,"Fast paced sales and customer service focused environment. Games are alphabetized and stored in sections."
good,"Liked working there, benefits were good, but definitely not a career job unless you're a well paid third key or a manager. better pay would have been great because the  holidays got so stressful, especially when the Wii first came out."
good,"At GameStop, I truly felt like achieved the right mix of selling products with customer service.  I used to tell my employees, coworkers, and others that at GameStop you need to make the company money, and make the customer happy.  And you might get to do it again tomorrow."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of about 200 or so customers, 85% that bought a game or console, 5% that put money down towards a pre-order, 5% shopping for a gift, and the other 5% just looking around. Typical days are busy, Sunday and Monday are slow days with at least 50 customers or so. I learned everything about how games are processed when traded in and that it takes 18 days for them to be cleared for selling. Management up to my newest boss has been pleasant. I have no quarrels with management so far. There is no real hard part of this job. Everything is super easy to learn, if you make a mistake, you make a mistake. No hard feelings. I've enjoyed my co-workers conversations and the friendships I have gained from them. I've also enjoyed working with something I love, Video games. I also enjoyed the customers that came in to see me or asked me a question and thanked me for my time. This job is very rewarding in feeling like you helped someone out."
good,"I have worked here for three Christmas holidays, it's enjoyable, but they don't give enough hours to live off of. I mainly organize the games, and help advise the customers on games and consoles. I don't usually need to get on the register, but am trusted to do so."
good,I loved working at this company. I was looking for a company in which I can be promoted within the company. I love working with other people and love to motivate everyone to push past the goal that was set for yesterday.
good,"A great place to work at, the work space is friendly and open to advancement. Slow enough to learn, but fast paced in order to keep you on your toes."
good,"This is a great part-time job."
good,Fun work environment with supportive management. Room to grow and develop as an employee and person. Some red tape due to sheer size of the company.
good,Being my first and longest held job there's a lot i could say.  Management is very friendly and helpful.  Whenever questions would arise or I needed assistance they were there.  While working on the job I learned how to handle cash in a fast paced environment while also having discussions with customers.  The holiday season was the roughest part of the job as we were always busy and there was never a dull moment.  Overall the job was fun.  I was able to work in a place where I enjoyed the product and the customer making it almost seem like it wasn't a job.
good,It's shocking just how much fun working at Game Stop is. You're encouraged to be friends with the customers and talk about the products you're selling.
good,"My usual day at Gamestop was opening/closing the store, managing cash, inventory, overseeing other employees, keeping the work area clean as well as assisting customers so that their desires and needs are met"
good,"Great place to work for retail environment. The only draw back is family/work balance isn't the best. Obviously, working a 9-5 in retail wont happen, midnights to open are killer."
good,i really like this job as well i had got to play video games even thou i was already into them so that was cool helping people find the games they wanted but most of all getting the excitement wit the customers that came in for the new releases.
good,A lot to remember and do but quite a fun place to work. Have to be knowledgeable about products and services. My coworkers are very fun and it's very easy to get along with the customers.
good,"It was my first job, so of course I was really excited for it even though the pay was low and we weren't given many hours I still learned a lot about retail in the video gaming industry sense."
good,"Working at GameStop was quite fun! I really enjoyed it, except for the fact that there were so little ways to advance. I was laid off seasonally and I had to work 12 hours on Black Friday. Not fun."
good,"Had I worked at GameStop at a different point in my life, I probably would have enjoyed it more and stayed longer.  Being someone who enjoys Video Games, I LOVED the access to new games.  We were not only allowed but encouraged to borrow video games to keep our product knowledge current.  The employee incentives and prizes for sales and membership contests made work fun.  Early into my time there, I was offered the Assistant Manager's position.  The week I was set to begin, I unexpectedly found out I was pregnant.  Suddenly, they found someone else for the position they had offered me and my hours were getting drastically cut.  I understand that my pregnancy had some impacts on my abilities to do certain duties like climbing ladders and carrying shipment boxes but I was still able to do 90% of all Management duties.  The pay was not stellar to begin with and my growing family meant I needed a job with better pay and some potential for advancement that wouldn't be revoked due to pregnancy so when my son was born, I moved on.  We parted on good terms."
good,"Gamestop was a challenging but exciting work environment for me. A smaller work staff allowed for little social life outside of work, but the employees were all high caliber and competitive, as well as supportive, and the management was first class. Everyone consistently went above and beyond expectation."
good,"I really enjoyed working at GameStop. In fact, if I made enough to live off of I would probably try to continue working there. I learned a lot about how to juggle doing the practical things that are required, such as filing away the games, keeping the store clean and organized, making sure everything on display looks good and other such things, with making sure all of the customers who enter the store are satisfied when they leave it. My coworkers are really great people and I enjoy working with all of them. The hardest part about working with GameStop was being completely financially unstable, but the hardest part about the actual job was dealing with irate customers, which I feel that I do quite well. I enjoyed being able to talk to people about video games all day at work. I would definitely have to say that was my favorite part."
good,"I love working with people who share the same interest with games as I do. As a gamer, its nice to work with, and talk to people with there point of view on different types of video games."
good,"Usual day includes stocking shelves, helping people find what they're looking for and cashing out. The management was really relaxed and helpful when it came to home life vs. work life, which for me was the best part of the job. The only downside to working here was during the holidays, it's a mad house!"
good,It was interesting going to work at Gamestop. You got to meet a lot of different people. The management was a lot of fun and easy to get along with.
good,Typical work day varied depending on time of year and customers who entered the store. Working holiday time and black friday is no picnic
good,"before the merger of EB Games and GameStop, this was my favorite place to work. It wasn't until after the merger when I was replaced by EB Games employees that I had any problems."
good,"Not many hours if you are not a key holder but nice enviroment, and great managers."
good,Great job for highschool students. Mindless work and you can play games for free.
good,"Well, I do love working for Game Stop. I am a gamer myself, and the co-workers are awesome, friendly, and easy to work with. We have a great staff at the store I'm in, and a high customer volume. Getting to rent a game to try it out is an excellent perk, and a %15 discount is awesome, considering most places only do %10. Overall, it is a very enjoyable place to be."
good,I love working for GameStop only wish they had better hours and training.
good,"I enjoy working here. My coworkers are very pleasant and we all work hard as a team to satisfy our customers. "
good,"Family-friendly environment. When I was in high school my job was flexible with my schedule, but I did not get many hours, but I loved the environment!"
good,"A lot of the time you aren't doing much. You make sure the store is clean, and make sure to greet any customers. It's pretty simple to learn the system as well"
good,People skills helps when selling and making sales pitches. Easy to work the register. Store goals to hit during your shift. Tasks given to keep busy like controlling inventory.
good,I enjoyed working with the company for a while. The best part about it is the guest interactions. Most of the time you'll get sour apples but most of the time you'll meet new friends and make open connections.
good,"In my time working for the company many changes were done and instated, but were manageable with the work. The management can be hit or miss with some stores, but when you have an actively working Store Leader things can go very smoothly."
good,"At GameStop, people can gain customer service and sales skills in a retail job. Sales Associates learn to sell to a niche market with niche products, like video games, gaming products and accessories, and collectibles."
good,"Everyone i worked with was friendly and willing to help whenever i asked. They also hung out outside of work as well, but always made sure the work got done first."
good,I really enjoyed Working at GameStop. I really enjoyed the whole culture behind the job I enjoy the customers that I got to interact with on a daily basis.
good,Its a great place to work especially if you are young. Great people and work place. The hours are good on holiday season but you would have to get a 2nd job for the rest of the year.
good,"Like any retail, its about customer service.   Giving your customer more than they expected.  A true genuine experience.  Always looking to teach your team to improve."
good,"Had to be out on floor promoting Gamestop rewards, or looking up rewards for customers. Always be out helping customer find what they need or trying to promote a sale in what they are looking at. Always alphabetizing games or doing video game inventory."
good,"repair all Iphones problems, fixed and desassembly ex box 360. scannig all work before and after you done.nice working area , peace full, good management."
good,"I miss this place. The employees, the customers, everything. It’s a great place to work at if your a college student because of the flexible hours and they’re not long shifts either. Of course if you’re an older person who needs money to pay rent, this isn’t the job for you 😅 they don’t pay much"
good,"I always enjoyed meeting all the people who wanted the latest game, and was always surrounded by good co-workers. The pay was low, but for me it really didn't matter all to much."
good,"During summer or slower times of the year, work is usually minimal but that gives you more time to interact and get to know the guests. You get to create those guest/employee relationships that keep them coming back. Holidays are usually the hardest because of the volume of inventory being received and sold. It is a little bit more difficult to create those guest/employee relationships but it is still worth it knowing that you helped a sometimes clueless parent, grandparent, or friend find their loved one exactly what they want."
good,"I love working here. My coworkers are awesome I get to talk about video games all day! However it really depends on your manager. Mine is super cool, our store meets our sales and we have a lot of fun!"
good,It was a pretty decent place to work the pay just was'nt enough...the people there were fun and i was working with them through a temp service but once you become permanent there you're pay does not go up
good,"Great management and staff all around. Pay and hours are very low. Overall fun environment to work in, unfortunately rate of pay and hours were not enough to afford cost of living."
good,"Fun place to work, your not likely to really earn enough to live on but great as a second job or work while going to school ect"
good,"I intended on staying at my location for as long as possible, and unfortunately it was shut down after working there for a little over three months. "
good,"It is a fun place to work for, the only down side is the amount of hours  some are given to work. That plus minimum wage it hardly enough to try and get life together unless you are management"
good,"It was a fun experience during my holiday season there. Black Friday was a bit intense at times, but no different than any other retail position on that day."
good,"Questo è un lavoro altamente commerciale, dove ci sono stimoli da diverse parti. C'è sempre la competizione, perché ci sono le classifiche personali, e quindi è un ottimo posto per una persona competitiva."
good,GameStop is a fun company to work with. The discounts are also pretty great. Employees get along with each other very well surprisingly. It is just the lack of advancement that turns me away from wanting to stay.
good,Gamestop was so fun working here we got to playbthe new games before they hit the shelves.I was in the inventory department so i got to be hands on with the product which was great
good,"I worked as basically relief aid for when we had available hours and needed the extra help with customers or helping change up store poster/layouts. There were a few older customers that could be infuriating, but for those who had done their research resulted in worthwhile interactions."
good,It was a fun environment with great co workers. Bosses and team leads always had my back and made sure we had a high energy. The schedule was very flexible and accommodating to students.
good,"I was only seasonal help, but it was a great seasonal job. Had a blast working there and got along great with everybody. All in all it was on the best jobs ive had"
good,It was a fun part time/seasonal job. If you are looking to start a family and provide for that family this is not the job for you. If you have spare time and are bored with it and love geek culture and video games then this is the job for you. Great atmosphere. Very customer service oriented. Must be knowledgable in the field and not shy to approach customers and strike up a conversation.
good,"Its Been a really long time since i worked there but when i did work there i loved it, Co-Workers were a joy to work with my boss was fantastic. Great Customers."
good,Fue una gran experiencia trabajar en esta empresa.
good,"pretty gross when taking in old systems some of them had live insects inside or cat urine all over the cords."
good,"I would love to keep working at gamestop but they don't give hours to people its hard to make money and support yourself definitely a side job. Unlike other companies hours are given mainly  on how well the store does financially. You can be a great employee but if the store as a whole does not meet financial goals for the week your hours get cut, drastically."
good,Great work culture. Nice people and customers. Work relaxed not too fasted paced. Easy to get past the learning curve and very helpful. Great company to work for.
good,"Management is very nice and friendly, also very flexible with schedules. Only real benefits as a Game Advisor is discounts and early knowledge of new releases. I began as a seasonal and got promoted to GA. Only downside is after seasonal my hours were cut severely. Still fun despite I only work 1-2 days a week."
good,"Awesome management team, always a fun environment when arriving to work, my most enjoyable part of this job was the holidays and big sale days, and getting discounts on items."
good,I loved working around video games and selling those products and the items attached. The joy gets removed because of the extreme sells driven relationship the company tries to develop with customers.
good,"The job is fun if you're looking for a job to get you by. The pay is low, but the job itself is really only tough during the holiday season. The rest of the time its a fun job to interact with customers who have the same passion for games you do."
good,"Great workplace. Spending each day helping people and enjoying the company of a relaxed an effective crew. Would recommend this type of job to anybody who can contribute to a warm environment, otherwise you'd be taking from the charm of a capable and special store."
good,"I loved this job, even though I wasn't there for very long because it was a seasonal job, it was a great experience for me. When people came in the store and didn't know so much about a certain product, I love to explain and have a conversation with them. I love it when they leave the store satisfied."
good,But after that it gets old. They need to work on re-structuring how the hours get divided up. Then again priority people make sense too. I dont know..
good,"A typical day at work is mainly basic retail duties, such as operating the register and providing customer service, but I've learned a lot about video games and gaming consoles. All of your co-workers love video games, so it's always fun to talk about them during a lull in the workday. The hardest part was keeping up with the fast-paced workday, while maintaining normal duties."
good,Great place to work if you like gaming and dealing with the public / flexible hours.   They can train you for upper management if you desire.  All in all a great place to work
good,"If you enjoy playing video games, and know a lot about video games, then you can do well in this work environment. However, don't expect high pay, and don't expect many hours, unless you work for a busy store."
good,"Really good job if you like working with people and video games."
good,"A great job if you love video games and retail, but don't expect it to go anywhere unless you have the time and drive to wait for a promotional opening. If you can tough it out and get there, it's pretty sweet."
good,"Great place to work even for a temporary position. Discounts offered, as well as other opportunities to get incentives. Overall experience is definitely ideal for your average work employee."
good,It's a good job they can be reasonable people and it was a fun experience the hardest part would be as in any job dealing with the public but other then that it was fun
good,If you like videogames and abysmal hours then gamestop is the job for you. The people here are friendly and nice and easy to talk to. Great place to work but the pay is low and the hours are too.
good,"I started as holiday help years ago and progressed through the ranks quickly due to hard work, willingness to learn new parts of the changing business, and the ability to learn from constructive criticism.  This is a fast paced, constantly changing SALES job.  If you aren't comfortable talking to guests about new products and services on a daily basis, this isn't the job for you.  I love change and don't mind a sales based atmosphere where making recommendations and asking guests if they would be interested in our products is part of the norm."
good,"I enjoy working with this company. Easy to be promoted within the company. Co-workers and customers are nice. Management is friendly, and helpful. The locations are convenient."
good,the job was fairly easy but where it really shined was interacting with the customers about a common interest. Also seeing them smile when they find exactly what they were looking for .
good,"I loved working for Gamestop, I mean what other job was there for a gamer like me? I got paid to talk about video games all day with customers.  The hours were not the best but I was fresh out of high school working with video games."
good,Definitely a good place to work. There will be a lot of small tasks to accomplish and the store relies heavily on everyone getting their job done on time. Usually tasks will stack up quickly so take them seriously. other than that it is a good place to work with very nice customers and coworkers
good,This company was exciting to work for. I'm big into video games and I enjoyed being a part of the company. I moved up very fast in this company due to my knowledge and they appreciated me
good,always fun tim you meet really cool people and talk about your passion for gaming fantastic staff and management i literally have nothing bad to say about them
good,I just hope to bring high energy & also great work ethic to any establishment. Mostly all of my co-workers are great to work with. I believe I am an people person so it just makes everything else easier.
good,"lavoro in team"
good,during my time in Game Stop my time was enjoyable both the employees and customers were fun and understandable. It was a good experience
good,you get to help people find games they want and recommend games you like to play and get more people to play whatever game you want cause why not? you have to be able to use a tablet
good,"I was hired for seasonal help. The job was easy and quite enjoyable. The co-workers were a pleasure to work with. The hardest part of the job would be that how hectic it could get the closer Christmas got. The management was easy to get along with. As long as you did your work and did it well you had no problems with the management. The most enjoyable part about the job was the different customers that would come through. A typical days work would include: changing the price on games or consoles or other accessories in the store. Restocking games, consoles or other accessories, Inventory, making sure the store was clean, helping customers find the games that they were looking for, and working the register. There really wasn't much to learn except that you would need to stay on top of the newest video games that were going to come out"
good,"A typical day was just ensuring that our guest were taken care of, and we kept our attitudes upbeat. We would stock and replenish any product that was needed during the day."
good,open and closed store. Kept up with the new systems and games that came out. made sure store was clean and running properly.
good,"My only complaint for GameStop was the higher management, my store manager was awesome but the District manager really ruined the job for nearly everyone. My location had a complete turn over in less than a year because of the District managers work."
good,"My time spent at GameStop was full of learning. Staring as  Senior Game Advisor you are thought opening and closing procedures, as well as other managerial duties. Most managers are decent employees who look out for their employees when ever possible."
good,"It is a fun place to work with a lot of hours if you are a SGA or above. Great regular customers and enjoyable work research. Not very many hours as a GA except around holiday time,and even then we are over saturated with extra employees until Jan."
good,"A very energetic surrounding, and everyone was super sweet and welcomed all new comers with open arms. If anyone made a mistake you weren't punished, you were helpfully corrected."
good,"*Cashier and cleaning at closing time."
good,Very understanding Manager who let me take off when needed to and would make hours for me whenever he could (was a seasonal employee). Would definitely recommend this job to anyone.!!!
good,"The managers do a fantastic job at quickly educating new hires and performing day to day duties at a gold standard. It is a job which requires outstanding social skills; one must not be afraid to approach customers and strike up interesting conversation. The people I have met here are great to work with and have become friends, not just co-workers."
good,"Typical day at Work: Interacting with customers,and being able to handle difficult situations in a respectable manner. Being able to multitask and go where you are needed. Moving through multiple tasks quickly but efficiently. Being able to work independently and using the best of your knowledge to help customer needs. This company is all about customer service, so you must always for what is best for the customer, within reason. Creating a fun environment for people to come in. Personally I really enjoy the atmosphere of this company and how much you can really experience from this job. It's a great starting position if you are looking for experience in customer service and retail."
good,"Just like any other day at work, get there do what needs to be done and leave. All that and more! meeting new people, playing new games, getting to know everything about gaming."
good,"A typical day at work includes sharing my time with a team of other store associates. We work together all day to ensure our store is clean and organized, that all customers are welcomed to our store and are assisted to our fullest capabilities as a team. It's always heart-warming to learn when a place of business really cares about their employees as a team, rather than promotes a competitive workplace for the sake of sales. "
good,My favorite thing about working at GameStop was educating people old and young about new products and accessories that they could buy and I learned a lot of social and communication skills by being on the floor and approaching customers. My manager was very flexible and easy to get along with. My co-workers were very helpful with settling into the job and helping me feel more comfortable about talking with people. The company doesn't seem to want to promote from within. I enjoyed being up to date with all the latest gaming news and being able to share that with all the customers
good,"I am responsible for opening or closing the store based on the day. I started off only being customer service, but now that I am a manager I am able to do so much more. Not only can I do more to make customers happy, I can also ship and receive important shipments. My co-workers and managers are great to work with. The hardest part of the job is maintaining certain numbers (example, reservations) If you don't get the numbers, you don't get scheduled."
good,"Days are repetitive, but my co-workers were wonderful and we always had so much fun together. Our manager was extremely nice and we were all treated as equals."
good,It was a fun and easy job learned how to interact with customers..I learned alot about video games. It was a good part time job.
good,"The two months I spent as a seasonal employee at GameStop were definitely enjoyable. But did I learn anything of value? No, I didn't, an average day would consist of a few customers asking questions about games are getting upset at trade in prices. Considering I already had customer experience from Walmart I did not find it at all troubling to resolve these customers issues. Everything was extremely laid back, we all joked around a lot, it was a very fun environment."
good,"Great people and environment."
good,"open the store, open and put away shipment, help each customer with individual needs, answer phone, all while keeping a big smile and positive attitude."
good,"•	Responsible for organizing merchandise on shelves"
good,"Lavoro stimolante per chi piace il mondo dei videogames."
good,"You will love the management. They treat you with respect and are very down to earth. The work is easy, but you get to keep up with a fast and interesting market, and if you love video games then you get to talk to people about what you love."
good,"Typical retail environment I enjoyed working when they actually had me in, hours are restricted by corporate and me being a seasonal employee I was given a small amount of hours, which I knew when I took the job. Besides for the no hours situation I made friends and i enjoyed the work place environment."
good,Loved working for GameStop. One of the best jobs. I only wish they kept their word and brougth me back in after I left the army. I love everything about this company. Customers can be some of the craziest and funniest people around. Would do anything to return.
good,"A typical day consist of calling customers about merchandise the have reserved, stocking product for the customers to see, informing customers on the product and or merchandise they're interested in and processing the following transaction. Management is very understanding and polite. Always willing to work with you when it comes to a scheduling issue. The hardest part of my job is the same as any customer service job, dealing with the few unruly costumers that may come in, while simple it does become tedious."
good,"I would greet customers, stock video games and be in the cash register."
good,The job is a wonderful place to work if you enjoy games but don't expect to get rich here.
good,"Each day consists of playing demo games to show your customers how awesome they are and convince them to buy these games. I learned how to be a better gamer here, and the staff is wonderful."
good,"I worked for Gamestop in my early 20's, and I have recently found myself employed with them once again. Not much has changed, as a typical day of work includes handling multiple customers, multitasking, managing the money and inventory, and making quick decisions on which tasks need to handled first."
good,"good money, good hours. you'll learn how to play golf and meet great inspirational people"
good,"Fun place to work. Casual and professional work environment."
good,The Hours were not too long. Everyone worked together. Easier to help customers.
good,Loved working there the only reason i left was because i went off to college
good,its really chill and laid back but you do have a lot of little things to keep in place. my co-workers are awesome we are like a family there.
good,"My experience while working at GameStop, while minimal, was pleasurable. I worked around good people, I had great customers come in daily. The only part that wasn't pleasurable, was the pay. It just wasn't worth the minimum wage."
good,I thought that it was the best job in the world to acquire but its not.simple yes but my complaint is on the side not shown .the lack of communication between the management and the employees(even if the employee is seasonal).lack of hours provided.last but not least the taboo of sexual preference.
good,Provided the chance to expand on customer relations and management styles.  It provided the insight into business management and micro management that is helpful when pursuing a business degree. The best part of this job was the fun work environment and the professional contacts that I made.
good,Gamestop inc. generates an incredible amount of support from its customers. great service creates a lot of regular customers at one location.
good,"loved my job there. ever changing environment. great customer relations. plenty on training."
good,"A typical day at work included getting trades ranging from video game/consoles, to video game accessories. Dealing with not so pleasant customers and customers who just loved to talk your ear off. Making sure sales numbers/percentages remained at a high level. Sending out and taking in daily shipments. Then by the end of the day closing till drawers down and dropping off the deposit for the day."
good,"*Help Customers, stock shelves, ring out customers"
good,Working with Gamestop of Burien was how you see it when you walk in fun people who enjoy video game talk. I learned not much on the customer service side but a lot on the video games side of things. hardest part of the job would be learning how to get the computers down. As far as Returns and exchanges or returning games etc. Most enjoyable part is the people who come in and working with helpful employees.
good,"A typical day at work involved coming in early and waiting for a manager to open for business hours then providing the customers with the best service I could. I helped them to look for games they wanted and suggested new ones based on the genre and console they had. Working here I learned to be more confident in a face to face sale at a retail store. My coworkers were all wonderful and we had a lot in common. The hardest part of the job was selling the headphones and other hardware pieces I was more unfamiliar with. The most enjoyable part was talking to coworkers or customers about upcoming games, nostalgic games, and various story lines within titles I found interesting."
good,I learned to organize using the alpha-alpha system always putting the customer first. the management was excellent very supportive. The hardest part of this job was my lack of hours. the best part of this job was interacting with the customers.
good,"Employees get to check out games, it's actually a really fun environment, we have a solid and active customer base, get to meet a ton of new people and I have amazing coworkers"
good,"Visiting one to two stores daily working with the store manager and they're staff to increase sales and customer service. Developing stores managers into promotoable positions was enjoyable. I always wanted to see my team of associates reap the rewards of the work and help them see that through. Not only did I enjoy working with each store staff, I also enjoyed interacting and engaging with our customers. By providing customers with exceptional service I strived to make them life time consumers. The toughest part working with Game Stop was the fact that business had steadily declined as the technolgy improves and more customers are now downloading their games straight from Sony, Microsoft etc. I fear that this company will go the way of the video and music business has recently where everything can be downloaded."
good,I overall enjoyed working for GameStop. It was my first job coming out of high school. The hardest part of the job was finding a game for a customer after it was removed from its original place.
good,sales associate
good,"Consisted of price changing, game advising, looking up games, alphabatizing games on wall amrketing, pre sales for new game releases."
good,"customers are great. Work was always fun and easy. management was good,good benefits. Best part was big time midnite launches"
good,"This job was easy and fun, we were a big family and hung out in and out of work. we made the work place fun and some where i enjoyed going to."
good,"I loved working with gamestop - I made friends with the customers, I learned alot about a subject that deeply interest me and I generally looked forward to work (that is....when I was scheduled). I feel that this company would benefit from having less locations with more on site staff per location. Having only one or two employees in the store at a time made it difficult for it to get jobs off-floor completed in the alloted times, and occassionally we wouldn't be able to spend as much time on customer service as was warrented. Entry level positions averaged 8 hours a week in off season, and as many as 40 around the holidays. However, that is all there is as an employee that I have to complain about. Management was excellent, I greatly enjoyed working with the customers and staff. Management was good at training and providing excellent feedback to help encourage and provide other employees with the knowledge to enhance their performance. I will forever miss this job, and compare all other jobs I have to this one."
good,The only thing that i did not like about this job was only how much we were paid and that's it.
good,GameStop is a fun place to work. It has its problems that all retail stores have but its a fun experience. Pay is the downside to gamestop but only job I have had that had me happy to go to work.
good,"Gamestop is a diverse company with people from every walk of life there. Family environment, and the management staff is there to answer any and all questions, or concerns you may have on your mind."
good,"I loved working at my particular store. Everyone was very close, diverse, and inclusive, and we all worked together nicely. Not all stores have the same atmosphere, but ours was amazing. We all genuinely cared for each other as well as our guests. Management was a bit lackluster in that they were not around a lot. I loved my fellow supervisors and my GAs. I do feel, however, that there is not a lot of support to advance within the company. District Managers do not support Store Leaders and Store Leaders do not support Senior Guest Advisors or Guest Advisors with advancement opportunities."
good,It was nice working there friendly people and manager and costumers weren’t terrible had to mostly sort games and check out/help costumers with anything they needed
good,"Working here has been some of my most enjoyable times as I have made so many connections with guests just solely based on our gaming preferences. Whether it be a tabletop game or a video game, I have connected with thousands of people over the years, and quite a few of them still come back to my store because they enjoy conversing with advisors such as myself. I have learned selling strategies, ad placements, use of the company applications and appliances, and even how to be less awkward when talking with complete strangers. My manager is amazing and is always pushing for us to push the envelope and trigger those responses that show what a guest is really interested in because the chances of us having something that they may actually like is pretty high."
good,"My manager had poor management skills, so it made working there difficult. When she wasn’t there, we had a better time and that’s when I liked my job, but she was not good. Other than her, everything about this job was awesome."
good,I worked for Gamestop for a total of ten years. I loved to show up and prep my store for the business day. Interacting with all my customers and sharing our interest in games and geek culture was informative and entertaining. Developing my team members was the highlight of my day and instilling a workplace culture of customers first. The hardest part of the job was when team members left for other opportunities and then trying to recruit strong replacements.
good,"The location itself was what made the job good, I go to other places and they were not up to par as this location. The employees here played a role as well ."
good,"Be aware of the management drama, keep your ears open for anything and everything. You can get far if you do as you're told. This job is a dream come true."
good,I love working here. Its is a fantastic atmosphere. Great people. And I would love for anyone to work here with us......              and.              Everyobody here gets along.   And.          I'm not sure what else to put down.
good,"Gamestop. Somedays would be slow and boring like any job really. overall though, it was always just fun to talk about games and i loved talking to people. I was an assistant manager for 5 years and then got promoted to Store manager/ store leader,( what they call it now). it can be a great workplace environment, if you're working with the right people.  Hardest part of the job was definitely upselling. Somedays it would be very hard to make quotas. Most enjoyable part of the job was definitely just to do what I love to do, Talk about video games and interact with people"
good,"Stock up game cases,price changing,helped out costumers with their questions, stocking accessories"
good,"I'm very happy with the people I work with & so far everyone I have met is extremely nice. Some of the corporate decision are hard to understand from my point of view as an SGA. Sometimes I wish there was a little more clarity from the higher ups, but I understand that is hard to accomplish."
good,"A typical day at gamestop, I would walk in and start on alphabetizing the games and organize them into the drawers. Afterwords, I would put empty cases back onto the walls. Finally, I'd be one of the workers on the register assisting customers."
good,Gamestop was my first job out of high school and I stayed there through college. It is truly a creative environment where you get to be around and work with people who have the same interests as you.
good,"Laid back, especially if you're into video games and things like that. "
good,This was my first ever retail job that had to deal with selling things to customers and the company did a great job introducing me on how to do it as well as be very welcoming to my school schedule and having to plan around it.
good,I thoroughly enjoy working at Gamestop. My manager is amazing. The team I work with is equally spectacular. I have never had any problems when it came to rescheduling with coworkers. The work is exceptionally easy. Great sales experience for stating in the sales field.
good,"good company, great discounts, teamwork good, easy to switch hours if needed, fast-paced. would recommend any gamer lover to work here at least once, mainly for knowledge on games and collector items if you are a collector"
good,è stato il mio primo lavoro e sono stato davvero bene . Soprattutto con i colleghi con il quale ho avuto un ottimo rapporto sia professionale che  umano
good,Working for gamestop is more fun then most things. coming to work is almost too fun. good coworkers and customers. if you like video games this is the job for you.
good,The management team is amazing and everyone is a gamer. Its never dull when your talking about video games all day. Does not feel like work. The guests are also really friendly people.
good,"Good workplace, Couldn't ask for a better job. Very fun easy going place of work with friendly competition. They make me feel like family and drive me to be very successful."
good,Enjoyed my time there. Everyone was really nice and a great environment for all game lovers! Manager was really helpful in teaching the how to on the computers and it was a nice experience.
good,very fun place to work at. its an easy slow paced job where you get alot of free time. if you are a gamer this is a place to work. the customers are great
good,"competitive sales, stocking, always good management, pretty decent speed around the holidays but slow any time else unless there was a game coming out that night"
good,"The store i was working was amazing. The store manager was fun and helped everyone, he treated everyone working there like a big family."
good,"You are picking, packing, stocking, loading mostly video games and collectibles items. They have very good work hours M-T 10hrs a day. There's a small group of associates working M-F 8hrs a day. The most enjoyable part of the job is playing games during breaks and lunch."
good,not much to say that i can remember its been more then 10 years not much i can say i guess it was good nothing bad that i can remember i was 18 and the assistant store manager
good,I love working for gamestop however it does not pay the bills very well. Also unfortunately advancing in the company can be very difficult especially starting as a part time employee.
good,"great if you are gamer and just need some discount on games you buy and have time to work part timer great for that. If you are wanting to be a full-timer its very hard to get and will have to become a key-holder or a manger in order to get good hours but not guaranteed full time which is interesting with how good they are doing you would think they could hire more full-timers that arent mangers but is as small store so not that many ppl really need to be there and would rather have a key holder or manger there because they have to have access to everything and know how to handle it all so you would want to try to move up, but its very hard with how many mangers they already have. they do try to hire with-in the company for mangers first before bringing in an outsiders. So if you just want to work here to make extra cash or for the discount its great but to make it far in the company would seriously need to know someone high up in the chain."
good,I loved working for Gamestop. I was a seasonal employee and I love playing video games. I was trying to get hired full time but was not lucky enough. If I could work there again I would!
good,Literally Gamestop is a dream job honestly. I loved every second of being there. The environment was just amazing the people and managers were just great.
good,"I really enjoy working here. Sometimes things get a little stressful if we have a lot of sales going on and of course the holiday rush, but other than that it's a fun and pretty easy job. Just don't expect a lot of hours or great pay if you're only a part time associate."
good,Gamestop is a super great place to work the management is great there’s plenty of opportunities to move up in the company they somewhat take good care of there employees. I would definitely recommend the job for people who are just starting out in the work world.
good,"Its a good place to work at, it can get busy at times but usually blows over well. My co-workers are awesome and i wouldn't trade them. A lovely place to work at besides not having ANY benefits"
good,"GameStop. That was the dream job. Selling games, talking about games, playing new games, getting free games! Seriously, GameStop is an awesome place to work at."
good,It’s a job for high school gamers looking for a first job. If you are a gamer looking for a job where you can advance its better to come in with management experience.
good,"In my short amount of time with gamestop I truly enjoyed the work environment. Although it felt understaffed we didn’t really need more staff unless for a launch day. The manangement was awesome, an there was always positive feedback making the environment very lax and positive. Hardest part was just launch days only because the store was very small and the volume of people was too much to handle sometimes. The most enjoyable part was sharing my passion for games."
good,"Gamestop was a good place for me start in retail and i advanced fairly quickly from GA to ASL. It's a company that thrives on it's selling culture and if you can do that you'd have no problem here, especially if you love what you're doing. Personally I'd just felt that it was my time to go and that I was being over-worked but under utilized. I'd work at another Gamestop in the future under the right circumstances."
good,Working at gamestop was fun at first. The company went through a lot of changes within my 3 yr here. My best advice would be to adapt quickly or you’ll sink.
good,Worked at corporate headquarters. Got to see all the new games coming out on the market. Management was very encouraging and work culture was of a team building mindset. The commute was the hardest part of the job.
good,"I would recommend this only to high school or college kids who enjoy games and want to make a little money, if you enjoy it, move up the ranks, but starting positions do not pay enough to support a family"
good,"By far the best job I've ever had excluding the last manager I had while being an assistant manager. he would clock in and leave, would never close. would constantly complain about things not getting done but would not contribute. other then him, absolutely loved doing what I loved with a few good people I hired. I genuinely loved going into work each and every day until the last few months."
good,"My favorite job, I love video games and talking to people. Absolute best management I've worked for, even the District Manager is great to work for, keeps a positive environment."
good,"It's a great place to work if you just need maybe a little food money. You get you talk about what you love all day. There isn't much money in it, but I didn't really need it at the time. I enjoyed it."
good,"Though there is a lot to do when working at Game Stop, the bosses and the atmosphere make it seem more play than work. The management for the most pat were very kind, but also strict in the best ways. For a first real job, its a great place to start."
good,"miss working for them. was my all time favorite job. bosses were great, co workers were awesome, never streesed out. midnight releases were my favorite part of my job."
good,"Haven't had a more exciting job than working for Gamestop. It was fun, surprising, and rewarding in more ways than one. Looks of joy on the faces of customers when a much anticipated game arrives on the shelf was priceless."
good,I honestly loved working at Game Stop both times that I did. I loved talking to everyone about the difference in games and systems. There was never a bad day even when there are rude customers. The teamwork always works flawlessly even during training (which they do in the form of a video game).
good,"A typical day of stocking shelves, entering new inventory into the system, and attending to customers."
good,"Can be fast paced and a great work environment. If you are passionate about video games and fandom base collectibles/accessoryies, i would highly recommend a job here. You get to talk about your lies and dislikes to customers to help drive sales and create unique experences with every customer"
good,It's always a blessing to be able to work in and around the culture you've grown up being involved in. Gamestop was is and always will be my dream job!
good,Here you either hate it or love it. Me personally depending on management it can be a beautiful place to work as long as you know your stuff. To me the only hardest part about this job is either getting upsales or taking in trades since a lot of customers don't agree with the payout. But knowing that you helped a parent find something for their child or a regular customer leaving with the satisfaction that they received exactly what they came in for makes the day go by a lot easier.
good,"Game Stop is a good job to gain sales and customer service experience. It's an organized company and I found them to be flexible in scheduling. I enjoyed my time spent with this company, if you have a passion for video games and pop culture this is for you."
good,"The management was supportive, helpful, and instructive when it came to helping associates and customers.  The workplace culture leads employees to work quickly and accurately so they can spend the maximum amount of time helping customers."
good,not a lot of room for advancement. great for a college student or someone that doesnt mind making just over minimum. managment was way more fun. hours suck for guest advisers
good,Time to help each customer with what they needed Good support from the management and always fun to see people leave happy. Sometimes unhappy customer
good,"As a seasonal hire, I worked part-time while maintaining a full-time job. GameStop was very flexible with my schedule and I had a lot of fun working during the holidays."
good,"Excellent communication and multi-tasking skills developed from previous experiences Excellent leadership skills, with the ability to take necessary actions in tasks when required Admirable work ethic"
good,"this is a great place to work. great benefits, great pay, great advancement as well. hours are great, location is great as well. overall a great place to work."
good,Everyday I like to inform our guest about the latest gaming technology available to them. I learn how each system works and the games that will be available to them. I educated myself on the latest games and inform my guest about them in hopes to help them find what they are looking for.
good,at gamestop its a wonderful and cushy job. the environment is great and the work is very fun and fulfilling there is always something to be done but they pay their associates barley enough to survive.
good,Mi trovo molto bene da Game Stop. Si lavora in tranquillità e le scadenze dei lavori arrivano in tempo
good,I can become very fast pace in the blink of an eye but not hard to learn and easy to maintain my manager was cool gave the best advice it was a amazing experience
good,I still work here and it's a fun place to be at. IT really depends on the manager you have but fun environment to be in. Besides sometimes screaming children.
good,"When I was an employee there, it was a very relaxed place. It was relaxed because I was surrounded by my favorite hobby. The hardest part of the job was trying to open up a bit more often, but I managed to get over that problem in time."
good,It was a great job till everything started to go digital.  Now Gamestop is declining.  I would personally only work here if you are looking for something as a starting off career as the digital age will probalby put Gamestop under.
good,"good place to work for.  Ever changing business model, so you have to be able to keep up.  Very goal oriented and very competitive sales model.  Very friendly environment,"
good,Good Company to work for. it can eat into your off time and could get overwhelming. People are nice and there is no real work place drama and it has been a rewarding place for me to work there.
good,I enjoyed working at GameStop my boss was always nice  the other people I worked with were always nice to work with there was usually just a lot of pressure because when I first went in there was a lot to learn and it had to be done in a timely fashion but environmentally it is a fun place to work but if you have goals and bills I would not recommend due to the short hours and minimal pay
good,Good company. Demanding goals that need to be fulfilled. Challenging yet fun. A typical day at work consists of helping customers and handling monetary transactions. Management is easy to get along with. Hardest part of the job is taking inventory and making sure everything works and is in good condition.
good,"My time at GameStop provided me with many important skills for the future, such as the ability to deal with customers, answer phone calls, manage money, and advertisement shifting. The work environment was very friendly, but there really was no chance of advancing, and seeing as my position was extremely expendable, there wasn't much room to improve when it comes to payment."
good,"Working for Gamestop is fun, always changing and offers you a lot of chances to move up with the company. They care about who works for them and you can always count on your peers in other stores around you."
good,I just started at this job and cant really review much but there is a lot to learn about each gaming system and different games
good,loved hanging with video game nerds all day. only problem is not many hours except for the holidays. literally sometimes you're lucky to have 8 hours in a week. just how it is in small stores. but its a super fun part time gig.
good,"Lets get this out of the way, the hardest and worst part of this job is filing games for hours on end with little to no time to do it because corporate heavily restricts store hours. With that aside Gamestop in Manhattan is the best experience I've had at a job ever. The place is super laid back, but it doesn't slack on getting things done in a proper amount of time. The management and employees are all super friendly and helpful, and the customers are phenomenal. Anyone who needs a place to work at over the holidays, this is the place to do it."
good,Game Stop has to be the best place I've ever worked. The managers people and environment is amazing! although the pay isn't great the people there make me feel at home and the customers do as well.
good,I would ask customers if they needed any assistance finding anything. They would ask me what game I would recommend. I would tell them what I think might suit them. Co- workers were friendly.
good,"Creating a comfortable environment for guests, helping develop associates to progress within the company."
good,Typical day at work is assisting customer on video game choices while also keeping the store neat and tiddy. Managment was amazing. And the job isn't hard
good,there are a lot of perks to being a gamestop employee such as the discount on gaming products and the free rentals!  You also get to meet other gamers as well.
good,"file games, take trade ins , sale reserves. my favorite part was finding the prefect game for my customer. my coworkers made a great team we would work together to get the sale ."
good,If you like gaming this is the place for you.  Great in store perks for being an employee.  Management is cool and willing to work with you  as far as time off and other circumstances.
good,They had great customer service they were all about there customers & I love the team work they had. They looked at for one another.
good,Working for gamestop is fun and exciting its full of fun discussions and multicultural interactions with people from all different walks of life im currently a part time manager
good,"Gamestop is a great place to work, you just dont get a lot of hours working as a Game Advisor, management gets changed every now and again, and most employees are great, its a fun place to work."
good,it was an amazing job i loved every second of it. A great experience all around. the ones that didnt get five star the first was because of me not knowing how to balance 2 jobs at that time .the other was because it was only a seasonal job
good,"i always had a great time going to work with great employees and i learned alot working there, i got a full handle of opperating the system and it was alot of fun"
good,I was there for about 4 years i can say that its a fun place to work. I never reached my goal to be manager because I only work 6-8 hours per week at least my last year because I have to take a full time job.
good,working there I never feel inferior or inconvenienced. Although the pay isn't the best I do enjoy working there and if I could make a substantial living with it I would definitely keep it as a job.
good,A typical day is fast and exciting. Everyone was kind and helped each other throughout the day. The hardest part was working through  seasonal rush but the best part is talking about games and toys with everyone.
good,"Working at this location particularly was a bit of a challenge, it is a high volume store therefore get a large mixture of customers ranging from pleasant to outright rude. maintaining an organized store was very difficult due to the number of daily customers"
good,"I love working at game stop, I get to work with people who are focused, detail oriented and fun. My manager is kind and serious about the work we do and everyone is always providing top notch customer service. My only issue is that I was hired during the seasonal period and I don't know if I'll get to keep my job as well as not being paid enough to get my own home as I am currently staying with relatives."
good,"Very down to earth co workers , very willing to teach those who do not understand and being able to help people of all ages is a a wonderful feeling as well . The down side is people tend to be very short fused and that includes other co workers as well . To much backstabbing for my liking . They speak of team work but if push comes to shove they will throw you under the bus ."
good,"I had a great time working with my co-workers at Gamestop, because we would be able to enjoy our time at work while also performing the tasks that needed to be completed. I am a big game nerd, and when it came to working there, it was a dream, because I could finally assist in customer service in a specific area of retail which I can consider my specialty."
good,"A typical day would be helping customers buy games and/or systems."
good,"Definitely learned a lot from this job. This being my first real job, I learned more about business and customer service. The management was good, they definitely made sure I was learning something new each day. My co-workers were amazing, very fun and I learned a lot from them. The hardest part of the job was the very limited amount of hours, and I would say the most enjoyable part of the job was the people, both co-workers and customers."
good,"By all means, go ahead and apply to GameStop when there is an on the spot interview, you might just have a better chance anyway to get a job. My experience, for a first job, was awesome."
good,Such a great group of staff in one store. Always productive with gaming talk and laughs in between. GameStop was my first job and it was an awesome experience. I don't think there could be a better group in one store.
good,Everyone is professional and great with customers. I have learned  valuable skill to grow in my career in customer service.
good,"A typical day at GameStop was a busy day at GameStop. Full of questions and conversation, even if the customer wasn't there to purchase anything. What I learned about GameStop is that it gave you the opportunity to be informed about the behind the scenes of video games and who is really interested in certain gameplay. Management was always different, because i went through several managers, but they were all very pleasant. The hardest part of the job was cleaning up after store hours. There is a lot of merchandising and plan-o-grams involved to get the store back to 100%. The most enjoyable part of the job is game/console release day. The long lines and excitement always had you looking forward to coming in and working your shift."
good,"Loved the work and really enjoyed the team that supported me. When I was single it was a much easier job to keep up with. With a wife and kid, it just requires too much time away from home."
good,"This is one my best jobs I've had even with the few downsides. It was a fluctuating schedule. GameStop will always be part-time. Only Senior Game Advisors and Management have full-time hours. I was a Game Advisor. The holidays is when the hours really pick up. The max amount of hours I've had was probably 25+ and I was the most reliable person there. Once holidays are over expect 10hrs or less. Maybe 15 if your really lucky. So you'll be suffering from about Feb-Aug. Management is awesome though, very nice and cares about you. co-workers are cool too. The customers are even cool. I mean you really can't get too many bad ones, it's GameStop people are here for fun. The big this is sales, you gotta push sales. That was harder for me cause I don't like to push people to buy things they didn't come in for. The best part was having a customer leave happy and excited about playing their new game."
good,"Counting all the systems and games every morning helped me learn more about organization and structure. Working with the employees made the workplace a fun and friendly place to go to everyday. It taught me to be more patient and caring of customers."
good,The company cares for its employees and gave me the opportunities to advance quickly.
good,I enjoyed working for gamestop. I was into the video game lifestyle and helped many people choose between various items in the video game world. My co-workers where very knowledgeable. The most enjoyable part of working at gamestop was meeting players who were very passionate about video games and wanted to learn more about up and coming games
good,I truly wish this position was a contract position. work life balance was great as well as the company its self. I truly enjoyed going to work everyday. When the contract was up I was disappointed it ended however i am grateful to have gained the experience of working for GameStop Inc.
good,"- My day to day tasks involved me vacuuming the floor, organizing the shelves by bar-coding, greeting and helping customer, as well as advising and working sales."
good,"Start and end the day by helping any customer that needs it."
good,"A typical day at work for me is fun I enjoy working with staff, the manager is great I'm very dedicated to working for him and he makes sure everything is perfect for his employees. The hardest part of the job is the lack of payroll we have it makes our job difficult to get things done. The most enjoyable part of the job is bonding with the customers and helping them out while you make a genuine conversation with them."
good,Much like any retail department store you're assisting customers with knowledge of video game. For some one into gaming it can definitely be a fun work place
good,A typical day for me would just be serving customers and helping them with any problems they needed.I learned how to use a till.The manager was very helpful and friendly as were the co workers.The hardest part of my job was dealing with a big rush when people were getting impatient but thanks to my staff they helped me when I needed it.The best part of my job was helping people and learning about all the different types of games.
good,In one's day there are many chances to interact with customers to build bonds. The hardest part of the job is being able to thoroughly go through games.
good,"A typical day at work"
good,I love working for Gamestop. My co-workers and boss especially are great people and so are the customers
good,Very interested in what I was selling and willing to to get feedback from other coworkers.
good,"I went in only knowing that I had a passion for games and got the job on a chance that they took. Working for them is very interesting but also quite fun. There really is never a dull moment and you see just about every type of gamer out there.The deals and promotions may be a bit confusing but it's never as confusing as when a customer tries to explain it back! The management is nice; it's like working for a good friend who also is able to professionally manage people. All in all, it was a really nice experience and I wish I could go back and do it again."
good,"This was just a season position that enjoyed very much. My co-workers were people I could relate to with my hobbies and interests. I got to help people get the right gifts for their friends and family, or even themselves. I learned many ways to approach people when attempting to sell them something that will honestly enjoy. Talking to people has always been a forte of mine and doing it to get paid made it even more enjoyable. I also worked here this past season."
good,the company all in all is a good company to work for they really care about your needs and wants and will listen when you have something to say. a typical day at work is helping customers as needed while keeping the shelves stocked with merchandise and presentable to sell. i ahve learned all kinds of new ways to lead as well as put what i learned in the marine corps to use. my co workers are all generally in great moods. the hardeset part is when i have to let them know we cut hours. i love my job all around my im ready for advancement.
good,"Working at Gamestop  was very rewarding. I expanded knowledge of great customer service. Management was very helpful, always there when I Had questions. Co-workers provided great team work. I learned how to deal with tough customers when unhappy with purchased customers. Enjoyed employee benefits."
good,"GameStop(s) in Omaha are the best ones around. I've known all these people employed here for about 8 years, and they're all great people to work for."
good,"GameStop Store Manager was the best job I ever had."
good,I really enjoyed the job but I was only hired for the Holidays and was a little younger then the average age they typically hired.
good,From day to day it was great working with games and getting more retail experience.
good,"One thing I can say about GameStop is, they really do care about the customer. We check the survey customers take on a daily basis. You stay busy most of the time with a lot of different things to do. One down side is, sometimes the comany doesn't give the store enough hours to do what they ask of us. Over all, Gamestop is a good company. "
good,Meeting the stores daily and weekly while giving high level of service to the customers. I was able to understand what it means to sell with really selling but giving customer what the need not what they what. 
good,Typical day at game stop is counting the money checking the books for the daily goals to meet your quota. Guest vary from time to time like at every retail but over all is a very easy job to have common sense is needed. Management at times is not always the best since everyone has there idea on how to run there own store even if its not being profitable. The hardest part of this job is during the holidays and the madness that it is involved can be very fast pace. Best part of the job is the gamers the culture that gaming brings in everyone has there own story of they love and its always great to hear them gives you a better feel of what they are shopping for and who your guest are.
good,"I loved my management and coworkers here, always had a blast when i went to work, and overall was a wonderful experience. "
good,Learned how to talk to customers and handle customers. Learned how to manage a store. Co-workers were really nice.
good,"I really enjoyed my time with GameStop and enjoyed working with great employees, Learned a lot from the company as I went through the routes of the company, (from Xmas Sales Assistant to an Assistant Manager) Learned alot from managers with years of experience, I really benefted with my people skills as I was great with customer service, Most enjoyable part must be the busy periods, there is just a brillian vibe and excitment in the store and meeting new customers. I really can't say I had a hard part to my job I always looked forward to going to work everyday."
good,GameStop is a good place to get your feet wet or even a second job and its not difficult at all. Its a definite place to enjoy being in a game environment. Co-workers are great to work with and all of the supervisors feel like they are just another co-worker and are great to work with . Of course this is just from my location experience. The hardest part of the job is the short amount of hours and pretty much your decent work hours are for the holidays. The most enjoyable part of the job are the perks and being able to see upcoming information for future games.
good,"A typical day at the job would be organizing and mechandising the store, and I learned great marketing skills. Managment and my co-worker were great. The hardest part about the job was keeping the store organised and the most enjoyable ws my co-workers and being able to play games on the job."
good,"I liked the job other than the nerds who never leave the store or are great window shoppers, but i guess thats apart of any job who provides sale to the community. I only worked for a short time overall i enjoyed but it was only for the holidays."
good,"Gamestop was a fun place to work for, always meeting new people."
good,"Inventory new (pre-owned) items into system, test consoles, stock items in alphabetical order or in their correct locations."
good,"It was a fun place to work. Learned alot, and met some great people."
good,This is a good company and I wish the fit would have been better
good,"Its not the best job ever but you will meet lots of people. Gamestop is a job to enjoy, so if your not a gamer this job isn't for you."
good,"Dealing with a variety of different customers ranging from those not proficient in english all the way to those looking to drop prices in a non-price matching company has taught me patience and loyalty to the company. Overall, the job is a typical retail job with counting/change skills being required and use of an electronic register."
good,"A typical day included re-stocking on video games, informing customers of special deals, recommending certain video games, and helping others in determining what item was of greater importance. The managing was great and efficient. Unless you work very hard and know your video games, moving up in job status is difficult."
good,"I would help customers that are in need for Information about a game, and if its appropriate for them. I have learned about all the different games, and what kind of game they are looking for. I've learn on how to talk to a customer. The management was excellent, he helped me in variety of ways to sell products. My co-workers were nice and helped me out. The hardest part of the job was helping all the customers at the cash register during Black Friday. They were tons of customers, but it had all manage to work out. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting people and helping them in their needs."
good,"GameStop was a pretty good company to work for. Though I was only hired as a seasonal, I was taught well how to do my job while I was there. I enjoyed it, though I wished that I could have had more hours. The work was not hard at all, but it was in large amounts. The staff for the most part was very friendly and I enjoyed the company of everyone I met."
good,a typical day at work would be laid back and busy around 2-3pm.My manager was great at his job as well as my co-workers.The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to rent games out.
good,"Working at GameStop was a very enjoyable and enlightening experience. I got the opportunity to work face to face with customers, as well as discovering the satisfaction of helping people find what they need and makes them happy. Working more closely with my fellow employees than I have with any other job was also rewarding in the way that I got to learn about how well I can work together with others and feel accomplished in completing assigned tasks."
good,My first ever job. It was a very fun and easygoing position. I help people make purchases at the cash register and assisted people with buying games. the team was also very easygoing and we worked well together.
good,"I found it to be everything I was looking for at that point and time. The culture surrounding video games, music and comics was my cup of tea, I found it to be quite a satisfying work environment."
good,"Strong emphasis on guest satisfaction. Honest, hard-working employees and a great working environment. Very supportive management and co-workers, but the pay and benefits could be better."
good,"Loved working sales and showing people new games or consoles. Really does something when you make someones day by showing them a game that fits their taste and they didnt know about. Management was great too, just like a standard employee instead of a boss."
good,"Gamestop is a very fun place to work. If you enjoy video games, comics, collectibles, movies and television, pop culture and merchandise from the previously mentioned, then Gamestop is the place for you! Customers love talking with other customers and employees about old, current and newly coming games. Often times, it feels more like you are hanging out with people who have similar interests than it does work."
good,"Very nice place to work, it is a great job to start and keep going within the company or to get customer service and sales experience. Works great with your college schedule."
good,"I really enjoy working at GameStop, I get to talk about the kinds of video games I like to play and recommend games to others! It's a fun job that presents unique challenges and chances for creative problems solving."
good,Everyone at the GameStop I work at gets along great and has a fun time working and helping customers. It's a refreshing change from the usual retail work.
good,"No-one will ever tell you they love retail. However, if I'm going to work retail anywhere, I'd choose GameStop. You get to be surrounded by video games all day, see when all the new ones come out, special events, etc. The environment is upbeat and friendly and everyone has a pretty decent amount of gamer knowledge there. I would go and hang with the crew on days off just because it was so much fun to be there."
good,I never worked before and then giving me a opportunity was awesome and aloud me to learn customer service to work with a cash register and public. Management was very helpful with my school schedule
good,management developed a good sales practice throughout its employees to maintain a good experience for all gamestop customers. Meetings were often scheduled to obtain a connection for employees. i learned a lot from gamestop on how to speak to customers to have a good sales quota as well as tranquility through conversations.
good,"I generally enjoyed working at Game Stop. I spent my day talking to people about video games, and I felt joy when I was able to help a customer find what they were looking for."
good,"I was able to learn a lot of different thing about Security and what goes behind the scenes. "
good,"I really enjoy working at gamestop. there are lots of perks and advantages  if someone enjoys video games, and gaming technology. Unfortunately there is not a lot of room for advancement."
good,I really love working here. It’s really fun because you get to talk about a bunch of awesome things!! A lot of the guests are very nice and funny as well!!
good,"In my position, a day at Gamestop would generally consist of unpacking and putting away merchandise, whether on the sales floor or in the storage area, and assisting guests with any queries about merchandise they may have or helping them find the product they are searching for should it not be immediately apparent."
good,"Easy work, Great management and very enjoyable work environment. I love getting some free stuff here and there. The hardest part of the job is honestly not muchthe only problem i had was the pay is just not enough."
good,"In the time I spent working at GameStop I enjoyed working there and I got along with all of my coworkers."
good,"I was a store manager for Gamestop for 2 years. It was one of the best jobs I ever had. I started as a 3rd key and with hard work and training I was promoted withing 3 months. The hardest part of the job was dealing with having to fill in when others called out. There were nights I slept in the store, nights I worked open to close for over 3 weeks. I loved it, the only reason I left was because a senior Store Manager was moving to my area and the Distric Manager was forcing me to step down and give my store to the senior store manager."
good,"Certain managers and stores operate more professionally than others. However, due to the structure of jobs within the company promoting past SGA to Assistant Store leader is challenging and become a store leader is just about impossible. Beyond promotion possibilities I would highly recommend GameStop to anyone who doesn't need a cost of living job."
good,Gamestop didn't have much to provide when discussing income or benefits. But what made me stay for as long as I did was my team that I worked with at most times it didn't feel like just another day at a JOB. It felt like much more than that like if I was around family that cared more than I've seen at any job before not only about the job but also cared about each other as well.
good,"My boss is the best boss ive ever had. My coworkers are also splendid. The one drawback is the sales focus, i'm more of a creative type. But other than that, it's fantasic."
good,Loved the job and the only reason I left was due to having to relocate. Outside of that the job itself provided one of the best experiences I’ve had in a long time
good,"Gamestop in Ontario was amazing! I no longer work there, but the workers are amazing, the management is great, and theres always something new to learn! Customers who come in are normally super nice and willing to talk video games with you. The only bad part is low pay and not enough hours. There were weeks where I would only work 8 hours. During holiday seasons, though, hours get close to 40 hours per week."
good,"Look, Ive heard everything under the sun about Gamestop and how its run so let me lay some truth down."
good,Working at GameStop was my first experience with retail. I felt that I wouldn't know what to do. That all changed once I get the proper training. I still continue to grow with the company with new knowledge every day. What's more is I become close with my co-worker that give advice when I am unsure about certain situations.
good,I honestly like my job at GameStop. I enjoy helping the customers find what games they're into. I enjoy helping parent find the best gift for their kids.
good,There was never really a typical day working there. It was always something different. I learned various important tools for specific tasks while being employed there. The management was by far the best that I have ever had. It was fun working there and you would always be productive. Hardest part was leaving that sort of job. The enjoyable part were the discounts and the environment.
good,"Overall, GameStop was a fun place to work and I wish to continue working there. However, my time working there was temporary so I may have a difficult time getting back in."
good,working there was fun it was slow paced but other than that i mean it was a great place to start for learning retail. you didnt get anything special but managment really showed their workers that they appericate them
good,"I did not know much about video games before working there. They were patient and taught me what I needed to know; including, how to work with costumers."
good,A typical day at work would consist of me having to make sure that the display walls were organized along with making sure that customers are treated well.
good,Fast and Easy job advancement with the ability to learn and increase the Knowledge of an Individual so they may lead and have a profitable store. After the Initial training you are given free rain to learn what the job requires of you and able to progress even farther in the field.
good,"9 años estupendo trabajar en la gamestop Italia, mucho comopañerismo de trabajo"
good,"I would work at Gamestop again. It does get slow when it's not during peak season, but it's always fun to come in and work with friendly, professional people."
good,"Staff here is super awesome, Shame I had to go. Was on my way to becoming a key holder and got the flu. Hope I can come back some day, it was an enjoyable occupation."
good,"As an avid gamer, i knew i would love working around video games. It was almost a dream come true, while working for this company, I had no problem working and helping them advance considering I LOVED the work!"
good,Very big on safety and at peak season at can get crazy. I learned how to be a better picker and packer since there do cross training.The new management have to learn a lot. I learned new culture and their a very friendly and hard working co-workers.Most enjoyable part to work their is the co-workers help you in any ways their can.
good,"Wonderful Part Time Job unless your a manager or Assistant Manager. The work environment is very caring and really works with you on all your problems, as well as wonderful about giving you a break when needed."
good,"The hours we're slow at times, but there was always something to do. The staff was always fun and the manager was excellent to work with. The discounts and rewards you get was worth it, and if you are fond of the gaming industry I highly recommend working here."
good,not a lot of hours but great discounts and people and life there are fun. took 6 months to train me in register and only gave me three hours a week at bare minimum pay.
good,Fun place to work and the co-workers are even better. they make you feel very comfortable and at home. The responsibilities are equally shared so you don't feel overwhelmed.
good,"GameStop is the perfect place for anyone who loves games or geeky stuff, as well as anyone who needs a flexible schedule! It's fun and entertaining but it IS work so don't except it to be a piece of cake."
good,"I learned a great many things in my short time working there, and the discount on games was wonderful. Also got to borrow games for free up to 4 days."
good,"During my time at Gamestop I actually found most shifts theraputic, the actual job is really kushy compared to other retail chains. The software for ringing transactions is fantastic even though the internet connectivity cut out from time to time leaving credit card transactions impossible. "
good,"Very competitive sales environment, with a excellent support team to help reach sales goals. Management is great with helping the team grow and learn."
good,Wonderful Job For People who Just need a little something however it is not for people Looking for a long term career Moving up takes time and there are few positions to move to though I still highly recommend it
good,"Durante la giornata di lavoro non c'era un attimo di pausa."
good,"GameStop was a fantastic company to work for, always had fun and enjoyed my fellow co-workers, it was a very easy job to develop strong Relationships with the guests who visited our store. I would recommend GameStop as a retail job any day of the week!"
good,"Gamestop is a seller/resale shop for current generation video games, consoles, accessories, and other video game related merchandise. As a seasonal employee during the holiday season, I was mainly tasked with customer support and making sure the shelves looked okay."
good,"Going to work never made me unhappy, I loved everyone I worked with and they always helped and showed you the right way to talk to customers. One of my favorite work experiences!"
good,"the work environment was really good, everyone became friends and easy to work with. when it got busy it was a good pace to help customers, and also able to speak to disgruntled customers who were looking for specific items"
good,I loved working for gamestop I would go work there again if I didn't need more money and more hours. The atmosphere is fun and as long as you get your job done it is awesome.
good,"as a new hire it was a open welcome into a fun and entertaining job experience, when i hit up to assistant manager i got a hold of a bad leader/district manager which made working for the company unbearable. but not everyone is bad"
good,"A typical day at work is energetic because you're ready to help someone with a product you know they actually want. I've learned so much from this job as well as my coworkers, it feels great to be apart of an actual team that knows what they're doing without flaw. The workplace culture is based on organization, understanding and communication. The hardest part of the job is memorizing all the new products and major prices, but over time you become adjusted to it. The most enjoyable part of the job is to see so many awesome people everyday who are there to appreciate the same thing as everyone else, games!"
good,"Even though it was a temp job, i enjoyed it greatly, and i did enjoy helping people find things that made them and myself happy. video games are good for everyone."
good,you have to have the knowledge of video games and game systems and what they are about. you should be people friendly of all ages.  great work places and coworkers.
good,"I think every location can be different depending on management, but mine was amazing! The manager was super chill while still pointing out things you could work on.  The only reason I left was because I just wan't making enough to pay bills much less have a good vacation."
good,"I really enjoyed my time here. I worked with many different types of people and they were all, for the most part, nice peoole to work with. I wasn't much of a gamer but they didn't seem to mind and helped me out a lot when ever I got stuck and always really nice. Not many hours per week but it's a pretty awesome part time."
good,"When I worked there, the pay wasn't great but it was a very fun job, at least, when I had good management there. We got bad management after my boss left, and it went downhill from there. You can move up if you work hard and you get more pay."
good,"My position was only a seasonal for the 2017 holiday season. However in the time that I was there (roughly 4 months) I never had an issue. The store I worked at was the best in the area. An extremely friendly staff who were always willing to help out the customers as well as the learning seasonal employees, and an understanding, helpful, albeit quiet manager. Everyone of the employees tried their hardest to create a welcome environment for everyone who walked through the doors. The management staff were not harsh with the employees, and instead of writing them up, preferred to do constructive criticism and guide them to do better. "
good,"Nach meiner Meinung,ist es eine gute Lebens- und Arbeitserfahrung. Nach meinem Abitur, den ersten festen Job als Teilzeit zu haben und hinein in die Welt der Arbeit zu schnuppern,empfinde ich als Verkäuferin nicht nur den  positiven Umgang mit Menschen gut,sondern auch seinen Hobby und die private Affinität von Spielen dort auszuleben. Es macht Spaß. Es zeigt mir die harten und guten Seiten den Erfolg und Leistungen zuerbringen. Und ebenso konnte ich  mich damit orientieren welchen Wege ich in der Zukunft einschlagen kann."
good,have to know games and have good customer service skills to answer multiple questions. moving up in the ranks it then becomes a balance of new responsibilities of being part of management and making your own sales goals.
good,Working at Game Stop was interesting.  I enjoyed being there because there was always something to do.  There was lots of new things to learn and I enjoyed assisting people with their purchases
good,"Confidence is key to the job. Being confident in your skills will lead to results and numbers, and those are what help you advance within this company."
good,A typical day is chatting up guest about everything from games to movies while you process games and systems shipment. You learn how to manage the priorities while taking care of the guest. Working in the Gamestop environment is fun and frustrating at the same time but its the guest and staff that make me stay. The hardest part is during the holiday when you have 100 and 1 things to do and still make the guest happy. The most enjoyable part is helping guest and taking time to get to know who they are and what hey need.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of checking inventory, assisting customers,testing electronic equipment, as well as making sales. I worked the cash register,competed in a competitive retail environment while delivering professional customer service to all my customers. I was the assistant manager at the time and I gained valuable manager experience. I learned how to manage and gained skills such as creative problem solving and multitasking. I learned how to be a strong independent worker that my team could depend on."
good,"I loved this job! I worked my way up from a seasonal Game Advisor to Assistant Store Manager in less than 5 years. Loved my customers and my co workers. Only drawback was, when I left, the company was changing focus from the employees to the bottom line and sacrificing quality of customer service for pushing unneeded addons."
good,"Gamestop is a great place to work with amazing co workers, and great management. If you enjoy video games and pop culture, this is the place to be. The work can be stressful sometimes, but you'll have a great support system to get through any problems."
good,"Come-in at 5am work hard, offload trucks, receive product, down-stack pallets, process mail, and complete ROC truck duties. Managers and leads were knowledgeable and willing to answer questions."
good,"I was only a seasonal hire at GameStop, but it was my favorite job I’ve ever had. It’s a relaxed environment, but there’s almost constantly customers in the building, so you’re never without something to do. They also make an effort to educate employees on games so that they can answer questions effectively. This is done by a checkout system for games. You can checkout one or two games for a week for free if you’re an employee, play them, and bring them back, sort of like a library. It was a cool system and a cool job, and I was very disappointed to leave when the season was over."
good,"GameStop is a varied retailer.  Dealing in games, consoles, tech, and now collectibles, it's become a one stop shop for gamer and geek culture.  Reservations, protections, and subscriptions are offered to round out a thourough experience, along with both physical and digital product, as well as online products orderable in store."
good,"I loved working here. I would still be there if I could relocate, but there wasn't any transfer openings at the time. I was only a GA so i didn't get paid much but I LOVED cleaning, organizing, talking to customers about upcoming games and DLCs. The hardest part was meeting the quotas but a stores location has a lot to do with that problem. Would work here again in a heart beat!!"
good,"Gamestop is a fun place to work at if you love video games. There is alot that you have to do, but it is mostly interacting with customers and helping them look for something in particular."
good,Like any job you get what you give with this company. you can advance as fast as you learn. just try your best and over time it will show in you performance and you will be rewarded.
good,"A typical work day at GameStop was eventful with all the new things coming in each day. The learning never stops at GameStop. You can learn all types of sills such as management and more! This is not a place just about video games though, it is about sales and making sure you give great customer service as well. This is the place where you can advance but the place that I was working in, the people had been working there for so many years so management was never an opportunity for me. But the job security was perfect I was never worried about losing my job."
good,"As a gamer, I can honestly say that it was a fun and relaxing job. It's a lot of fun to be able to help other gamers find games that they like. You also get some pretty sweet discounts."
good,"Hardest part of the job is keeping numbers high, when you have regulars who already have cards, its rough to resell cause they (by the years time) don't shop much at the store anymore (understandable) but higher management demands keeping numbers up."
good,"A great place to work when you want a solid job. This is not the place for a career as salary seems to be on the lower side of the spectrum. However, they offer great opportunities for training and advancement, and sick extra benefits if you like video games."
good,"GameStop pretty regularly gets a bad rap because of the type of company they are by people who don't understand how profit works in a buying and selling environment like that. I have found that this company, though occasionally making silly decisions, has overall really done everything I could ask for to take care of me. Up to the position of store leader, the upward mobility can be quick and easy to take advantage of if you put effort into your job. Some managers can be hard to work for but that's the case anywhere. Here at least you can be selling fun while it happens."
good,"I never thought  I would enjoy retail until I started working at GameStop. It's a laid back, easy job that includes challenges to keep it exciting. I always feel like I'm learning."
good,Was with GameStop as a Manager for 7 yrs and loved every aspect of it. Advancement opportunities are endless and loved traveling to management conferences. Overall super fun
good,"GameStop was a great place to work at with short hours for first starting workers and great management that worked with you as you trained, learning the cash register system and keeping the store organized properly."
good,This was the first job i ever had. It was alot of fun especially getting to run the register. That was my favorite part at that point because i never had. Alot of fun!!!
good,I loved working at gamestop! The environment was great as were my coworkers! Always loved going into work except when our very lazy store manager was there.
good,"I enjoyed it"
good,I was a store manager for GameStop for about 2 years. During those 2 years it was really difficult to balance any form of social or family life. Working a salaried position where I was semi overused was not a very fun experience; however the overall experience was a lot of fun!
good,"I really enjoyed working for Gamestop. Most of the customers were a younger crowd, giving me a chance to connect with people of all ages. Learning about different products made working here exciting. I was always learning something new about products.  Being able to play games myself so I could give recommendations depending on age groups and what type of games the customer enjoyed was an exciting part of the job."
good,"Gamestop has a friendly fast paced work environment. You become friends with your coworkers quicker because they would be people with a shared interest in video games and pop culture such as collectable figures and games related merchandise, pretty much the items we sell."
good,I would organize shelves and manage the cash register. I learned how to use thier computer system and i learned more about gaming. Management was nice and a quick study. It was a great environment to be in. The hardest part would be answering difficult questions customers may have. The most enjoyable part would be getting to try new games before they even release.
good,Game stop is always full of energy and helpful employees there to direct you if you need it. Thought i was only hired on seasonal i thoroughly enjoyed the job and had a lot of fun working for game stop
good,I got along with all my coworkers and it was a really relaxed atmosphere. Pretty easy going job even during the holiday rush periods. I have no complaints about working there other than I was only a temp.
good,"everyday I learn something new which also helps because being a game advisor you need to be up to date with all the new games and product coming out, my goal is to know things our customers don't know so they get the fun experience."
good,"While working for Gamestop, I found myself with great coworkers. We were definitely a team everyone had their specialties and none hesitated to help at anytime. As far as the scheduling, very , very,  flexible. No problems no worries."
good,"I come in and stock cases, file games away, and assist customers in any need they may have in store. I answer any and all questions to the best of my ability and I be sure to keep my work place neat and as clean as possible."
good,"Good place to work, great environment. Management is great and there are plenty of opportunities to advance if you put the time and effort in. Give it a shot!"
good,"Product knowledge, upcoming software and system knowledge, game specifics, ratings, sorting, organizing, taking trade. "
good,They truly care about the growth and development of its people. They helped me grow in all the fields of business management and I will miss being a part of the organization
good,Gamestop is a great place to work if you love video games and do not have many responsibilities. The job does not have benefits that i am aware of and isn't the best pay but its a great part time job for motivated people with knowledge about the culture.
good,Great people to work with great environment to work in everyone was great to one and other made the job easy on everyone working there and made it the job simpler
good,"Great work, fun product, wonderful advancement opportunities, and management is always willing to help out. The company is always giving away gaming gear, and bonuses.  There are always fun inter region competitions going on to always have a chance a winning something new that is coming out."
good,"The company was good workers were good and easy to work, always busy which was good. I did not like the transition plan they had"
good,"Very simple, having been hired on as seasonal customer service it was still very hard to get any hours in the week. I also believe that part of this was the new management taking on a few too many workers too quickly"
good,This company is no longer.  All Waldenbooks stores have been closed.  It was a great place to work while open.  Great co-workers and work environment.
good,"It's a great experience if you are into the gaming culture; however, sometimes you have to deal with rude, and not-so-knowledgable customers. Patience is the key to working at Gamestop."
good,Company is great to work for. You sell fun and all your customer know that. The environment is really open and everyone has a great attitude. Each store must be ran by a good manager that supports his/her team instead of degrade them. Great place otherwise.
good,Email Reporting.Shipping and receiving staying on top of the latest games. Hardest part of work is receiving inventory from other locations.
good,"A typical day would consist of organizing games, cleaning systems and or helping out customers."
good,Well i work at a taco truck so i know how to be fast when theres a big line and i learned that at gamestop you have to be fast with numbers and be nice to all people that come to the store even if young or old and to have a good time with your fellow workers also to get along with them
good,"My job consists of selling games to customers. I greet every customer that comes in the door. All my co-workers are great and it is a great work environment. We encourage each other to do our best each and everyday. My main manager, the store manager, is the best boss I have ever had. He is extremely helpful and a great teacher."
good,The job itself is fun if you love video games. The customers are typically really chill and each day at work is usually pretty simple.
good,"I love working here. The learning was amazing learning a lot of customer service, and working with people helping them find the product they were looking for."
good,"Its a decent part-time job to have. Fun environment and atmosphere. It's a standard retail job, just with video games. Managers are friendly and pretty laid-back. I don't have many bad things to say about the company, really. The only thing is that unless you're an Assistant Store Manager or a Store Manager, you're not getting full time hours. Regular Game Advisers get less than 10 hours on average. It goes up during holiday time, but the rest of the year you're barely working."
good,I had fun there learned valuable sales skills which will help be further my career. My fellow employees where great to interact with and management was helpful and fun.
good,"Amazing and fun place to work, with an immense amount of interesting people. I very much enjoyed my time there and wish to work in a place with a similar atmosphere."
good,"Awesome place, great coworkers, great culture, only downside was dealing with disgruntled customers (retail) all in all not a bad job"
good,"- Greeting and assisting customers. Cleaning and ringing out customers."
good,"Gamestop being a retail store, working the P.O.S. system register is not hard to work at all and it is easy to learn. When customers buy games, the games are searched for in the alphabet list in their appropriate console. "
good,working for gamestop put me in an enviroment around things that i love as well as helping customers out in buying items. i get to mingle with the customers and after they make the purchace in the store i feel happy that i helped them out during that day
good,"This is a fun job with great management. It consisted mainly of me speaking to customers about my hobby, which is video games. Also helping people find what they want and making suggestions to things they might also enjoy. While trying to meet a sales quota."
good,Amazing company to work for. Management experience was top tier and my team was phenomenal. Wages were a little to low and had to step down due to long commute.
good,GameStop is a great company to work for it was rough starting out with little to no hours but if you keep your head in the game there is plenty of opportunity for advancement into the company. They have great teams to work and grow with and while working its like a family enviornment.
good,"This is a great place to work if you have an interest in video games. It's great for people entering the workforce to get some working experience and somewhat related to video games. Many people gain work experience here while developing skills both at work in school and are able to pursue more advanced jobs, both in and out of the games industry. It will also help you communicate technical information to people with very little technical experience."
good,"A typical work day would consist of customer service with the coolest, most interesting people that you could find. Management and co-workers are always quite pleasant. The hardest part of the job is when the store gets slow and finding things to keep busy. Most enjoyable part: everything else."
good,"Although I only worked for this company for a short time it was a great experience for me. It was nice to be in a higher management position and to be able to help out my employees with problems and help to drive our store to excellence. I think the thing I liked the most here was how I never felt like I had a manager to ""answer to"". My direct store manager was more of a teammate, someone who I could work with to solve issues and come up with effective ideas to better us as a store. Working with video games was of course a lot of fun and I really liked our customer base."
good,You will have fun and like the work you do. Management is awesome and works with your schedule well. Love it here. It is awesome
good,Great place to work with great people. It feels wonderful coming into work with great guys and girls. One of the best jobs I have ever had.
good,"I work around the store whether it is cleaning, fixing the games, register, and helping mu customers find the games they enjoy. I learned to not only communicate better, but I also have learned how to make a good sale and have customer come back. It a loyal customer relationship. Management there is awesome. They are all great and fun to work with. The hardest part of the job is add on sales. Everything about the job is great and a fun place to be."
good,has a wonderful atmosphere for everyone when you walk in. we make sure everyone is happy. we all work well and get along with each other. we strive to improve ourselves and each other.
good,"Had great experiences with other employees, with a wonderful clean store. Constantly was busy and completing tasks to better the store. You could see the improvement."
good,"Customer Service is key here. Get 'numbers'! Just another way in saying, get people buying more of your product. You dont get any benefit from it other than job security and props. Be honest to the customer no matter what."
good,"Its usually pretty relaxed in there and you can have fun its a little tough at first. You get used to it pretty quickly, I learned that people don't know much about video games in the sense of there being different types and what suits each person.The hardest part of the job is catering to each individual customer, my co-workers were pretty cool it's usually just you and one other person and they train you as you go along. The most enjoyable part of the job is the employee discount which makes buying stuff a lot cheaper."
good,"Usually consisting of stocking shelves, or helping customers with purchases, also getting a leg up on knowledge of new games to be well informed for the customer if they have questions."
good,I love working at gamestop. I had been wanting to work there since I got out of high school as I have a passion for games. I love my co workers and the atmosphere at this employment. The only downfall I see that may be an issue for some is the hours. Sometimes you get quite a bit of hours and other times you only get one day shifts the entire week. Other than that this job is amazing and the coworkers make it enjoyable that you will want to work more just to talk to other gamers.
good,I enjoyed working at Game Stop I learned many new things everyday being there. It was challenging because I had to learn to balance doing multiple things at once but I managed to do it because I great coworkers to teach me. I believed if the business didn't close down I still would be currently employed there.
good,"i loved the environment and the easy going people how ever an inexperienced lead  whom didn't know how to supervise fired several people for no reason , i as well for looking for product that people purposely moved with out my consent"
good,Great place to work. management is always trying to help you my favriote & lease favriote part of the job was dealing with the customers alot were fun to deal with but some were just mean especially around the holidays
good,"* Buen ambiente de trabajo, un equipo muy profesional y humano."
good,"The management was wonderful and everyone i worked with, they really cared about their employees and they created a bond with all of us. The environment was so fun, everyday just promoting and talking about games and new things to come."
good,"Helping customers and talking about games all day. If you love gaming, this is the job for you."
good,"Each employee was very outgoing and bright and didnt let a bad sale get them down. Work place was overall happy and outgoing. Help was supplied whenever needed and we worked as a team to meet our goals, never was it a competition. I learned new information on the items we sold and got to experiance other customers views on the products. Hardest part of the job is standing for 6 hours on end but its nothing to complain about or that will hold me back. You learn to work through it and stay busy. A typical day is busy and every customer is a new start. Theres always something to do if the store is empty or cleaned."
good,"Depending on the shift I might just help in opening, closing, or just walking in to do customer service.  Either we are busy helping customers and attending to them or keeping busy at having the store look presentable and in order.  I learned better customer service skills. "
good,If you a gamer you will be in heaven! Talking to other gamers and debating about games conversation last for hours.
good,"I worked here on two separate seasonals. Very amazing place to work at and great if someone is looking to pick up a summer job for the extra cash. Customers are very friendly and cool, and you might even find out about a new game from them. As being a seasonal, of course, means that you are constantly fighting for hours, but the hours you do get is well spent enjoying everything and everyone."
good,"I really enjoyed Working here. It was an easy job , we got to learn about the products, and switch roles from time to time. The downfall about working here is that they were only offering seasonal work since there was no room for extra employees during non holidays."
good,"Typically it was a nice, calm place with occasional rushes, but the customers were always nice and the demands were low. When we weren't busy with customers, we were cleaning up the store."
good,"A typical day started the moment i walked in the door. It consisted of cleaning and organizing, selling and helping customers."
good,Loved the job awesome management. No sign of progress as far as pay. Loved dealing with customers.
good,Gain a lot of knowledge about video games and accessories. People are very friendly
good,"GameStop is a great place to work when you have little or no experience in retail. It helped me build confidence in my customer service by learning to push magazines and reserves on people who had never even picked up a controller. As crazy as that sounds, I really enjoy working there, but it could have been because I'm was the only girl working there so the majority of the customers were very nice to me when they actually did talk to me.I made a lot of friends there and everyone I worked with was awesome. We would compete with each other over who had the best numbers at the end of the night and help each other get reserves and subs if we saw they were losing the customer."
good,"Questa azienda mi ha dato la possibilità di imparare tante cose nuove sia a livello gestionale che umano."
good,"Gamestop is a fun company to work the only thing I will change will be the luck of compesation for assistants and 3rd keys."
good,"A typical day at work involved helping the customers find what they were looking for. I learned that some people are very angry and no matter how nice you are they will always take offence, but the majority of people are easy and fun to deal with. The manager was absolutely lovely and a pleasure to work with, the same goes for my co-workers. The hardest part of the job for me was probably cleaning the shop, only because I found the other parts so much fun. I loved helping the customers find the perfect game for their needs and I (as weird as it is) had great fun organizing the stock room."
good,Visited multiple stores on a daily and weekly schedule to ensure sales and marketing execution was accomplished. Provided training opportunities within the team to further better team work and improve sales techniques. Learned how to maximize product launches and improve customer experiences through interaction and partnering up with local vendor teams to create launch events that our customers enjoyed and kept them coming back for the next titles. My team and peers we're helpful and excited which made everyday a challenge to improve. Hardest part of the job was the work life balance and making sure I took time to myself and to give more of my leaders chances to take the lead for our vision. Seeing my team grow and improve through communication.
good,"My job with Gamestop is fun and exciting. I learn new skills on a day to day basis. As a Manager with my company I expect all of my employees to exceed our Organizational Goals. The hardest part about my job is only being able to work there for ONLY 40hrs per week. If I could I would be there 7/7 days a week. The most enjoyable part of my job is making sure our guests leave with the satisfaction of knowing their needs were taken care of. My management staff is the best, friendly,outgoing, and can be tough on you if you are not performing well. They don't put you down but build your skills for when you are searching for different career paths. My co-workers are phenomenal. They do as they are asked, work together as a team, hit expectations day to day."
good,"Most days are just spent making sure every customer is given what they need whether it's games or advice. Over the years its taught me to work hard and how to take care of customers to the best of my abilities."
good,"If you're a gamer, this is the perfect place to work. Great gaming culture, awesome discounts, and you get to keep your ear to the ground on all the latest releases."
good,"in questa azienda si lavorava con degli orari decisi mese per mese si attaccava o la mattina o il pomeriggio verso le 15:00. tantissimo non ho potuto imparare per via del poco tempo che ho avuto a disposizione , però ho fatto  un pò di volte cassa, e soprattutto ti aiuta ancora di più a saper interagire con il cliente .è un ottima azienda dove mi sono trovato benissimo"
good,"Create the daily and weekly goals.  Process daily shipments and organize all products and clean the store.  Focus on all sales and trade-ins. "
good,"Absolutely love working at GameStop, if you are big or even slightly into video games it is a great pace to be. Being surrounded by others who are just as passionate as you makes it even better. Co-workers are informative and helpful, always willing to lend a hand."
good,"I truly enjoyed my experience working with Game Stop. The management was very laid back, the workers were committed and the customers were typically easy to deal with. We typically worked in 2 man teams, which made the work day be very team oriented. Typically from day to day, at the start we get informed of any sales that are happening. We would also receive information on the company goals for the day referring to trade and membership signups. Other than managing those ideas at hand we do game and system trade in inspections. We also did point of sales, returns, purchases and organized the store while we have free time. One of the hardest parts of the job was trying to balancing all of these things at once while still creating a good customer service experience. At times it can be easy to get flustered when you're in a rush, but my co workers can agree I always did a good job of keeping a cool head and understanding a customers viewpoint. One of the most enjoyable parts of the job was getting to speak about something I'm passionate about on the daily basis. I am a gamer and love to talk about games to people if they're interested."
good,"Each day was great working around video games, classics up to new and upcoming games and systems. Then would be arranging the store to make sure all was in order, clean the and vacuum the floor before opening. Helping customers look for the games or accessories they needed if we did not have it woe we would call another shop to see if they did.I learned more about sales and customer service and my manager was great he was one of the nicest guys i ever had the pleasure to work with, and my co-workers as well they made each work day a great one and made job fun. I think the hardest part of a job that is in retail is try and making sure you reach your financial sales goal, and obviously best part of the job was working with a product i know a lot about"
good,"A typical day at work is getting the chance to meet new people, help them with whatever they need and being able to talk and have fun doing what I like to do. "
good,I loved this place. It really gives you a shot at improving your customer service skills.
good,"I absolutely loved working for GameStop Inc.! I regret leaving this company every day. The workplace was relaxed and the people you worked with were relaxed as well as amiable and easy going. "
good,"Between the managers and the staff, it was a pleasure to work at this location.  while the hours were not very long the work was fast paced and demanding.  was sorry to leave."
good,"go into store and check numbers from previous day. then i would do inventory and open up the store. after i would help customers and employees with any questions they had regarding video games, updates, news on games, and products and accessories. i learned how to be a great manager and lead a team to the top. i also learned how to manage time and work. my co-workers were very fun to work with. they were also great listeners and took my instructions well. the hardest part of the job was keeping all the games in alphabetical order all day... the most enjoyable part of my job was holding late night events for new and upcoming video games."
good,"A typical day at work included store organization, vacuuming, pricing and stock shifting. With customers present in the shop all job activities were dropped when they needed help, and returned to when the customer was satisfied. So you can imagine, a little gaming shop in a mall during christmas, we were very busy during open hours. "
good,"Bring a lot of enthusiasm and drive with you and you will be in first place, after all second place is the first looser!!"
good,"Overall a great place to work, good managment. Easy work. Great sense of humor that everybody has with eachother"
good,"learned various responsibilities that helped improve my daily work. Hardest part of the job is to not buy out the store, with so many great games around you constantly, its very hard not to spend money. Most enjoyable part of the job had to be the customers, I had some great loyal customers. "
good,"L'attività di lavoro veniva svolta con turni organizzati dal responsabile soprattutto nelle giornate di maggiore affluenza dell'utenza."
good,"learned retail there. enjoyed talking to customers, was a very easy job."
good,"Providing customer service in the entertainment industry is fun, the people that come in are fun to get to know and help out. The employees and management are like family and very close knit together in the area/district"
good,I loved this job; it was always a fun and cheerful place to be and my co-workers were the best. There are only a few bad apples in this company but they treat their long time employees well and their new employees have plenty of chances for advancement.
good,i oved my days there. working with awesoe people and getting to talk about thinks i had no clue about and learned about more sofware i didnt ven know there was. my customers and i got close and would come in just to ak questions. i had a great team and system there.
good,"Loved it, easy going yet hard work."
good,"I loved everything about this place. I am a mid level gamer so being in this type of environment made it easy for me to go about my daily work interactions. Management made me feel like family. I don't go to work to make friends, but I can honestly say I made more than friends working here. I made a new set of family members."
good,"Typical day at work is greeting customers, making sure they are finding what they are looking for. Suggesting video games that are similar to what they are looking for. Friendly checkout, ask if they have their power up rewards card if not explain what its all about. Asking if they want to preorder any new releases. Last but not least ask them to fill out a short survey giving us feedback on how we did. Oh and of course making sure you thank the customer and hope to see them again."
good,Manager was great at training to become a good employee
good,"Guest focused, good benefits, leadership generally works hard, loving games only makes it better!"
good,"I came into this company as an Assistant Manager and I absolutely loved it. My job includes providing excellent customer service, training and working with new employees, intake and distribution of product, handling customer issues and keeping a tidy, well stocked store as well as vast knowledge of the games and systems I am selling. I have won an award for my customer service skills and constantly show outstanding numbers in sales, reservations and rewards subscriptions, as well as warranties and up sells."
good,"I LOVED this job. I came to work every day and talked about video games. I liked all of my co-workers and my manager was one of my favorites as well. He was actually one of my role models for becoming management, especially in retail. I learned that retail is harder than it appears. The higher up the chain you go the more stressful it gets. The hardest part of the job was understanding some of the changes corporate office was trying to put in place."
good,"GameStop was a fantastic job. The people I worked with were wonderful, it was fast-paced but not stressful, and it was fun. I would easily work for the company again."
good,I Loved This Job The Employes Are Great And Always Upbeat The customers are cool only down side is the hours if they were able to provide more hours this would be the best job
good,"If you enjoy video games this is a great place to work, you're not just working with people with similar tastes but you're also helping people! The customer base is generally awesome and fairly easy to work with."
good,"I loved everything about GameStop except the pay."
good,Gamestop employees are always up beat outgoing individuals and they always ensure that every customers needs are met and satisfied when leaving the store. I had a great time working there and I felt right at home and comfortable from the moment I started.
good,"Flexible hours, Good atmosphere.  Team players. A boss that genuinely cares about the employees and the customers.  Everyone respects one another.  Training provided for new merchandise."
good,"I only worked at Gamestop for a few short months, but I enjoyed my time there tremendously. The managers at my location were fantastic people and very patient with me as I learned the ins and outs of the store. My only complaint would be they did not provide a whole lot of hours, however that can be attributed to the district manager frequently making changes to our schedule."
good,"I loved working here when I did. It was tideous, always quizzing and stuff, but it was a lot of fun. I'm still friend with some of my coworkers, too. Most people are there for a very long time, if that tells you anything. It's a great place to work. Wish they paid better."
good,"Fun to work for great people."
good,"Working at GameStop did not feel like working at all. It felt like being with a group of friends doing something we were passionate about. I learned more about video games, consoles, how to get more sales, and a different style of working in sales. The hardest part of the job for me personally was being asked if I actually ""knew"" anything since I am a female. I rarely had to experience angry customers and when I did they were very reasonable and understanding. The only negative is how it is almost impossible to get hired on."
good,"Its been a while since I've worked for the company, but as a young adult it was a great stepping stone to learning how to work with different kinds of people, customers and grow into who i wanted to be. I give a lot of that credit to some of the courageous and educated leaders i had over the years."
good,GameStop was very challenging however I did enjoyed my time there. Peak seasons were a bit stressful. I would work a lot of hours. I enjoyed my time with my co workers.
good,"I made really great friends there, it was a super easy place to work and it wasn't too crazy. holidays were a little rough but nothing noone could handle"
good,"GameStop isn't a bad company to work for; as long as you do your job correctly and in a timely manner. Co-workers make the job so much easier, and customers are always willing to hear you out on items. Though people may have a bad outlook on the company, it is in fact a solid place to work for. Love it here."
good,"Having a passion for customer service and video games makes working at Gamestop so rewarding.  Believing in the product that I sell makes it enjoyable to do so.  Building relationships with guests is not only fun but encouraged as to make everyone feel welcomed to the Gamestop family.  Being a part of the management team can be stressful at times, but once a balance between service and tasks is met, the store feels like your own.  However, compensation for managing a store could be a bit more competitive."
good,"I loved working at GameStop. I had it as a second job, so the low pay and very few shifts didn't bother me too much. I worked part time and had maybe three or four 4-hour shifts a week. The atmosphere is fun and really informal, and great for people who love video games for sure. Management was awesome and friendly. Sad I had to quit since I was moving, and would honestly go back if I could!"
good,"My experience as a worker at GameStop so far is great. Fellow employees are very friendly, its a calm environment, and very customer friendly. The manager was very helpful and showed instructions that were position based, as well as co-workers."
good,"a typical day a work involved interacting with guests, a 5 minute huddle with the other shift manager, phone operations, and inventory management. hardest part of the job is not spending your entire paycheck there. most enjoyable part for me was checking in inventory, it was like christmas everyday. workplace culture is however you create it."
good,"One may not be able to live of this job especially if you arent a store leader, but there is always chances to pick up shifts and get more hours. No overtime allowed but getting discounts is worth it. Overall if you like games it is a great place to work, talk about and sell games to others is always fun."
good,"I worked for the company for almost 3 years, and yes it has its downfalls, but the management and the team is what keeps you going. I have had a lot of good memories working for the company."
good,"Laid back with small store, easy to clean, nice guests. Talking about things that you love and it being relevant to the workplace. Safe place for being a ""nerd""."
good,"I learned how to properly maintain a store even during the busiest hours as well as some of the best customer service training I have ever received. Some people will write a bad review about the store because they don't know the struggles of being in the management position truly are. "
good,Extremely fun and professional. The atmosphere is second to none. The management is the best I've ever worked for. Extremely inclusive and helpful. Just not good for your family if you need a M-F job. Schedules change often.
good,"I used to really love the company. But there is too much expected out of management, with minimal support. They continue to pile on tasks, without extra employees or payroll to help."
good,"I started working for Gamestop as a first job, and I don't regret a minute of it. I love my work family. The work comes easily to me since I already know about games, systems, etc."
good,"There are so many great programs. They focus a lot on personal development. I currently work at a female friendly store, and it makes me feel so very welcome. However that isn't always the case. "
good,"I loved my seasonal position here and hope to return the next available opening. I literally have nothing to complain about, I wish the season would’ve lasted longer so I could’ve been a part of the store longer."
good,All of the employees were gamers. Most of the customers were gamers. We got to sell the product that the customers loved and that we loved to play and sell. It was happiness ninety percent of the time.
good,"There are a lot of bad stories about people working at GameStop but I honestly loved it. I had awesome coworkers, a great manager, and was surrounded by video games and nerdy memorabilia. It may not have paid the best but I had fun working there and would recommend it to other people who want a job surrounded by something they love."
good,"The discount is probably the best part of the job. There are sales regularly that stack with your discount and make everything dirt cheap-- even crazy expensive statues, plushies, etc."
good,Sales Associate experience. Holiday sales. Experience in setting up displays. Friendly co-worker experience. Learned product development. Good place for employment.
good,"Everyone worked together like a tight knit family. The environment was relaxed and helpful, even during the busiest hours of the day. The clientele is always kind and the other workers are always kind and helpful, even after work hours."
good,"I appreciate the wisdom, flexibility and patience with which has been shown to me in transitioning into a new position. I appreciate that everyone carries their own weight and their are many great character people here. The company has many proactive programs to assist others from diverse backgrounds and allows for individuals to express themselves without judgement. They have brought in higher end vendors that serve healthy alternatives to typical junk food if desired. Since I have been here their has been a continual effort to improve the facilities and operations in order to maintain our competitive edge and provide for the employees as well as the customer."
good,"Fine place to work just not enough hours  and the quota you have to meet for them is kind of un reachable, but the people you meet and get to interact with are great"
good,"I really loved my Job as a Store Manager and really wish I could go back, but some of the upper Management doesn't allow for you to come back after you leave the company, even when I gave a months notice. I was pretty upset about this, but there's not much I can change. I loved talking about games with people and make them love what they did. Providing entertainment to people was probably one of the best careers I could have held. The sales goals weren't impossible, and the morale was overall really good."
good,"Typical day at work is to work on shipment and inventory counts on our accessories and games. What I have learned since being their is patience and awareness of our product. There are hundreds of games even some with same title, but with added content so their sku's are different. It's takes attentions to detail to be able to work at GameStop. "
good,Gamestop was a fun work environment. More often than not than not the customers were cool. The employees were fun to work with. The management ran the store successfully.
good,I was a holiday hire for about three or four months. It was great and everyone was super helpful and willing to teach what need to be taught to succeed.
good,I loved this job.Guests that came in genuinely appreciated the honesty of someone who loves the culture and would visit on a personal basis just from the love of our location. I was part of a store that rocked sales and was a real family of coworkers. We made the top 15% of stores in the company! It was that success that made upper management split our store into an attempt to make lesser preforming stores reach a higher potential. I was guilt pressured and promised things that did not turn out to be true. I then was treated to a less than understanding manager that contradicted and belittled me in front of not only my associates but other managers as well. My love for my job faded due to my manager's hypocrisy and unwavering attitude.
good,"You get to the nerd you always wanted to be and get paid for it!"
good,"Working for GameStop gave me great work experience, allowed me to handle problems by myself and develop leadership skills. Management was very strong and helped make the job fun."
good,This is actually a great place to work for young adults. the pay isn't that great but it really doesn't need to be. it's more so of a place to work if you have a gaming hobby and love to talk about it with other people who love gaming.
good,"great company to work for if you love to game, companies would send copies of the games to managers so they know what they talk about when customers ask"
good,"As someone who works for gamestop, I can easily say that it can be a fun and interesting place. There are times that upper management can be dumb and out of touch but they are usually on point."
good,"Great place to work overall, not good pay, but fun job. Great customer interactions, if you love video games you will love talking to customers and other associates about video games. But unfortunately, the pay and hours need work"
good,"Restocked shelves, relaxed with enough work."
good,GameStop is a place for people who enjoy games can come and converse with leading professionals in that area. Employees here are completely dedicated.
good,Assisted customers on purchasing games and accessories. Advised on what games are in and which ones would be great for the family. Assisted with opening an closing the store. Always high energy and fun environment.
good,"I learned how to be an assistant manager here and enjoyed it quite a lot! I think that this business should have more benefits added for the employees behalf as it was kind of lacking. But overall it was by far my favorite job and If I could go back I would, mainly for the amazing people that I met through here."
good,"I enjoyed my time while working here! I was only seasonal, so I was actually sad I wasn't kept after the new year. GameStop definitely wants you to learn their sale tactics and apply them daily. It's a pretty laid-back culture, and bonus, you get to nerd out over video games with your co-workers and customers!"
good,"I was hired as a seasonal employee.  The management and the company were very good to work for.  I don't know about other locations, but the location I worked at was a good experience.  I'd recommend it to a friend."
good,"A day at GameStop really depends on location. Some stores are busier than others, and sometimes the available inventory is VASTLY different so familiarizing  yourself with what's available is KEY. Depending on your role you might only work with the store manager once or twice a week, but every shift has a trusted keyholder to answer most of your questions. Working at GameStop provides an opportunity to learn more about not just the latest games and systems but also about the customers that come in regularly and learning what their tastes are so we can offer them appropriate products. The hardest part of the job is having those far and few customers who want no interaction with the staff at all and are just angry about everything, there's nothing we can do to alleviate that so we just smile and nod and help them with their transactions, nothing more, nothing less. What I LOVE about the job is learning about upcoming games and building a list of what I need to pick up throughout the year!"
good,GameStop is a great place to work for people who don't mind a challenge and clearly set goals. The hours can be a little overwhelming especially during holiday season and for midnight releases of new games coming out. Pay and benefits are fair and competitive.
good,"Great Place to work, enjoyed the people and great support system among other store leaders in the company.  GameStop as a company is always findings ways to be innovative to grow it's business."
good,Great work environment. Management for the time I was working at the store was a good. The employees were nice and helpful with information about the job.
good,fun and productive fast paced and great team players. always willing to help and get the job done. management was wonderful and understanding in hard situations i would gladly go back
good,"Fun Workplace, but not many hours unless you care to advance within the company; but they will work with your school schedule which is very nice when it comes to working and school."
good,"What I have learned so far is that there will be a time you are going to deal with customers that don't speak English. Especially when you are at a store location that is a tourist destination. The management is good so far. The Workplace culture is very welcoming and exciting."
good,This is a great first job they are willing to hire you as long as u love games and willing to learn something new. While working you have to promote Gamestop benefits and make sure u have people pre order games buy the pro membership and buy protection to their games
good,"Yeah it can be stressful at times, but if you put in the work expected of you then you can have a blast working for them.  Crazy fun stuff for free and an amazing discount to boot"
good,It was a great job with sweet discounts and management was great. I really enjoyed my time there and would recommend it for anyone looking for a part time job
good,"This job is a fun place to work at, the employees are all friendly. Our upper management team is the best ever. I have learned so much from them. The hardest part of the job is just making sure I can keep other focused right away once they clock on. The most enjoyable thing about the job honestly is the whole staffing."
good,"This is a great place to work at especially if you are knowledgable of video games and its consoles. Do not be fooled by GameStop employees telling you to go apply online. Your resume will be lost forever. Believe me, it has happened to me for years till a manager pointed it out to me. What you want to do is to print out an application, or get your GS of choice to print it out for you, fill it out and then hand deliver it to GS. If you want your chances of being hired to be greater, send a filled application to each GS that you want to work at. "
good,"Don't have much to comment on. I worked as a seasonal, learned all the ropes quickly and the job turned out easier than expected. Everyone was chillax and I had good times."
good,"Fun culture overall, you really need to understand the type content of most Games / Systems to offer the Best Product to your guest. Call us Tech-savvy. There is Plenty of Training Material to be completed for almost every single New Release. You learn a lot of your Guest on how they talk and what there knowledge is and create a relationship with the Guest."
good,"Gamestop in Okeechobee, Florida is the best gamestop I've been to. My manager was amazing and we were all like family in that store. I didn't want to leave."
good,working with Gamestop was great they make you feel like you are in a family playing to new games first. They would always work with me when i had a family emergency
good,nice job and good environment but not a place you want to work at if you need to pay rent. You start at minimum wage and there are few hours. I wouldn't stay with the job for to long unless you are aiming for managment
good,Being able to assist people with getting games or even when it comes to ringing them out was a joy. The smile on their faces and speaking different games was fun
good,i absolutely loved working with Gamestop. compensation was not the best fit for my families needs. the atmosphere was extremely professional and it was as if working with a large loving family.
good,"typically it started with restocking shelf's, or bringing boxes out of the back."
good,If you can get hired its a great place to work but the only catch is your temp unless corporate wants to keep you. you work the floor which is where you provide customer service or cashier.
good,The manager does a great job of balancing a position of power and being your friend. Everyone who works in the store is very kind and agreeable. 10/10 would work for again.
good,"It was a very busy time of year. Holiday season. But I did learn more about gaming systems, and updates. Management was wonderful. Helped answer any of my questions."
good,"this is a pretty cool place to work especially if you love video games. the only bad part of this place is the pay. the pay stinks, but otherwise id work here again if I could."
good,"I was only seasonal for Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. I was only used as a sales associate, cleaning up the store and helping guest find games they were looking for. I learned a great deal about games. The management was awesome and knew a lot about games. Hardest part of the job was not knowing all the new releases coming out so I could not answer too many questions. Most enjoyable part of the job was being in the gaming atmosphere."
good,"Such a refreshing work environment to come into, with everyone being warm, welcoming and helpful. Their culture of giving back not only to employees, as well as their philanthropic groups is inspiring. Overall, it was an amazing opportunity to work for this organization."
good,"Ahh, Gamestop. Despite all the bad reviews it sometimes gets, working at, at least the Athens, TN store, was a dream. "
good,"Gamestop was a great company to work for. The customers were most often enjoyable and fun. We got to talk video games all day, who doesn't like that? A drawback would be customers who were not happy with the value of trade-ins. Most customers were amazing though and made the day very fun."
good,"Although my job was temporary, the team was very welcoming and did not discourage questions during the training and were very friendly as well as accommodating with scheduling."
good,"As a gamer working for Gamestop has been very enjoyable. Days are all in all the same. As a guest adviser I clock in, help guests find games or recommend some based on their interests, take phone calls, answer questions people have about games or systems, take in trades on games, clean the store if its a closing shift. The manager has been there since I was a kid and is very good at being a leader. Co-workers are easy to get a long with. I enjoy recommending games or systems to people and hearing that they enjoyed them."
good,"I've never had as much fun at a job like GameStop! As a person who is head over heels for the gaming community, it seemed like the perfect place to work. I was only a Seasonal Employee, so I didn't get a lot of hours or pay. I still found myself very eager to work the hours I had, and I wanted to help every single customer that walked through the door. It was hard at first getting the routine down since you never know what a person needs until they ask, especially since some had questions about new systems or games that I had no idea about. However, my manager and lead associate were very patient with me and showed me every step of the way, and it made me enjoy my time at GameStop that much more!"
good,"Fantastic place for a high schooler to work, not an adult trying to make a living though. Lack of hours throughout summer, great at holiday time"
good,I had a wonderful time working there. The people were fun and the games were amazing. The people were fun to work with and help out everyone had a great attitude and the management was awesome.
good,"This was a great place to work, real friendly and the employees were real attentive. I would recommend this store and this job."
good,"Gamestop is one the best organization in the country,gamestop give all is associate room to lean if you choose to,is a friendly working environment,"
good,"When working at GameStop, one of the first requirements you'll need is a strong set of social skills. A good work ethic and drive to success will also aide in maintaining a good standing. On a typical day you can expect to be flooded with several customers who come in not knowing exactly what they want. It's up to you to educate them on all the options your store provides. Working at GameStop also requires a large understanding of all aspects of video gaming, not just certain genres you're interested in. Management is at limes lax, but if your supervisor sees you're not maintaining a steady work flow you will be disciplined. Over all, this job is perfect for young people looking for work experience and with a lot of free time on their hands."
good,its a very comfortable environment to work in. we make you feel right at home when shopping with us. hardest part of the job though is the pay and moving up the ranks.
good,"Working at GameStop, you needed only the most basic understanding of retail cashiering and logistics. Opening the store in the morning consisted of very in-depth and necessary counts that changed daily, as well as counting tills. Once opened, it was a very fun task to carry out your day. Setting up new displays, or fixtures for new signage of the latest release. "
good,"This is a fantastic company to work for. They listen to you, help you deal with personal and work related problems, and someone is always around to help you. The pay isn't what it should be for the amount of money the company makes, but it's a solid job."
good,"Gamestop was my very first job coming out of high school and will probably be my favorite to date. The staff is very friendly and extremely helpful. I worked here for about 3 months before I was laid-off since this was only a seasonal job. My manager was great, very helpful and easy to get along with. If I did something wrong, he NEVER talked down to me or belittled me. His criticism was very positive and welcoming. My hours differed based off the company needs. Pay was okay for the work I was doing since it was only minimum wage, however, we got bonuses and other incentives for working there so I'm not complaining by any means."
good,I was hired as a seasonal and managed to work myself up to a 3rd key position and had completed my Assistant Store Manager training. I loved my team and had a really great time in the years I worked there.
good,This company is very professional at all times. It is very rare that an employee would become unprofessional. The management team was very motivating and made sure things got done in a timely manner.
good,Standing and meeting customers in an active and competitive workplace. As customers come in greet them with a smile and a hello. Great customer based company with knowledgeable people working their.
good,"I really love working here, its very fast paced and there is always something to do. I really like the managers i have they really know how train and teach. I also love what i have to do at work its very fulfilling."
good,"Gamestop Refurbishment Center was focused on producing quality products in a timely manner. It had a fun and friendly atmosphere, which indeed included a ping pong table along with a great cafeteria."
good,"A typical day of work was pretty short but fun overall. I did learn a lot about customer service and doing whatever it takes to make the customer happy, along with management skills. The managers were very helpful but some were real lazy and did not help, which is why I was forced to learn a lot of skills on my own. My co-workers were very far behind me, though they were employed there before I was. They were still very helpful and work oriented. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers even though we gave great customer service, but what I did enjoy was talking to customers about games. It's fun sharing the same enjoyments in games with customers because it always makes great conversation."
good,"Very family oriented and very kind people, from great service to up-to-date products, GameStop is a great place to start you carrer in retail and sales!"
good,"Great job, fun workplace, fast paced, inspirational and great atmosphere. Being able to try out all the games is one of the best perks for gamer's. Fast paced environment and everyday is a learning experience, also very helpful in team building and one on one with other associates and also managing skills."
good,"This company is very fun and easy to work for. Coworkers are always easy to work with and easy going. Not to say they don't do their jobs or crack down on someone who is slacking. The only problems I ever had was that my store didn't have many hours to give out among its employees. This seems to be a common thing among these stores, but there isn't much to be done about it."
good,"A typical day as an ASM at gamestop was, handling customer service we prided ourselves on outstanding customer service and we were ranked monthly on our surveys and customer reviews."
good,"My responsibilities as a Shift manager was to make sure I watched and learned how to be a leader from my higher managers, as well as exceptional customer service, minor inventory control, making sure I personally met my sales goals and helping the associates who worked under me to stay up to date and meet their requirements for the job"
good,"Nice Place to work, Goo Team, Very Focus to compleate the goal of the store. Not all about grow up. Fun Work.Supportive Management, Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,"I loved my experience working for GameStop. Part-time hours are easy and fun to work with. Talking with customers about their favorite games and sharing your experiences is a fun way to connect personally with your customer base. Helping out distraught mothers near Christmas time can be a hassle but is usually a breeze. There were downsides, but they hardly make an impact on how much fun I had working for GameStop."
good,"I enjoyed my job at GameStop because gaming is something I am extremely interested in and enjoy to discuss.  The day would begin by opening the store (took about an hour at my store) and then engaging with customers throughout the day.  When it was slow, you re-stock, process shipment, and organize the shelves.  At the end of the day (if you have a closing shift) you would close the store... this took about 30 minutes in my store, but I covered at larger stores and it could take about an hour/an hour and a half."
good,they cut hours like crazy but its still a crazy fun place to work. i never had a dull moment and i had never had so much fun selling something i love so much.
good,"The company provides support and encouragement for its employees. As a manger I was responsible for overlooking the productivity of 5-7 employees during a given shift. I worked on the sales floor, the cash register, and in the stock department."
good,"product knowledge, answering questions about either up coming games, system or deals, cleaning, customer service and any other thing that is required"
good,From my years with GameStop I cannot say one bad thing. This company rocks! They treat their employees with respect and are very flexible for most college students. If you are looking for an opportunity for advancement and a decent wage then this job is a dream.
good,Once i would get to work i would go around the store and answer as many questions that the customers might have and help them find what they are looking for.
good,"Training was very well organized and completed with manager very thoroughly"
good,"•	Process inventory/job applications"
good,"I've always had wonderful coworkers and most of the customers are pretty good. The hardest part of the job is the customers that aren't nice, but the polite customers that I'm really able to help are the best part of the job."
good,Had nothing but good times working in this position and my boss and coworkers were like family and the overall experience helped me greatly.
good,great company with room to grow i would come in and open and everything was always in order i worked with a highly trained team who worked together to accomplish company and customer satisfactory goals and it was a very knowledgeable and positive enviroment
good,"Fun place to work. Love my co workers. Always something to do, never bored. You get incredible game knowledge, awesome discounts and perks."
good,"The overall work day was pretty easy, but not without it's share of professionalism. It was a nice balance and easy to work with my kind of schedule. Working with games is also a fun feat. :)"
good,"I come into work, process and get documents ready, Make sure store is cleaned and organized properly."
good,"Working at Gamestop in an awesome experience. Not only do you get to feel accomplished in helping the people but every sale you make helps the company, and you really begin to feel what its like to be apart of a thriving company."
good,As a game advisor your job was to help the customer. You would figure out what they liked and make suggestions based on what you figured they would like. You got to meet different people and share a few gaming stories was well.
good,"This was one of my favorite jobs in that I learned the most about marketing strategies, coaching and developing employees in order to groom them for promotion.  I also learned a lot about inventory management, budgeting, account receivable and payable, labor hours, just how to run a business from every aspect."
good,"A great place to work, although you will not get many hours if it's not holiday season."
good,"I would read e-mails and verify all games were displayed properly.  Greet customers and let them know of any and all specials that were running at the time.  Take phone calls and inform the caller of inventory that is in stock if requested and current deals.  To always be courteous and informative."
good,"GameStop has been a great company to row with. I have achieved so much within this company from winning major awards such as holiday overall performance and promotions. I have a great working relation with my Boss, Pears and staff. I fully enjoy working in a retail store promoting a selling some thing I am passionate about. I find the hours to be hard during the holidays but have always found the energy and excitement to lead my team threw the hardest part of the year. I would not be able to do so with out the leadership of GameStops field managers and Corporate office."
good,"A typical day contained advising games to customers but alot of standing. I learned how to interact with customers. Management was great and understanding. My co-workers were alright, some were very helpful. The hardest part was the standing and walking for the entirety of the time working. The most enjoyable part was assisting customers and making them smile!"
good,"Learned a lot of business aspect of the business, this company is known for advancement"
good,"A typical day at work builds the brain, whether alphabetizing games, knowing OF a game or looking games up for a customer. I learned more ways to handle cash and be in charge of others. The customers and co-workers were fun and knew a lot about their jobs. Friendly and rather mellow when it came to troubling situations. They did their jobs without having heart attacks or yelling."
good,For a job I had in my youth I loved working with the co-workers I had the privilege of working with. Were it not for a family member getting ill I would have continued on at this job for much longer than I was able.
good,"A typical day includes greeting customers when they come in, and asking them how you can help them. After that you would assist them with either a purchase, sale, return, or exchange. "
good,"I've had this job since my Sophomore year of high school and kept it throughout college. Since then I have managed to move up to a management level position. I've worked at several different GameStop locations and have enjoyed every once, the culture and passion that is involved with the video game industry translates so well with the employees! So much personality! The hardest part of the job is staying motivated outside of the holiday season because the store gets pretty slow from February through November. In this job I have learned so much about customer relationships... regular customers are happy to see me (and I them), and being able to give a man/woman/mom/kid something more than just a video-game purchase is a very rewarding feeling."
good,"I could come in and do a million things in a day and never be bored. My co workers are delights and we have a very solid team. Playing free video games is considered ""product research"" which is probably the best part!"
good,Great place to work to get you through high school and college!
good,"It was a pleasure working there. The owner was kind and hardworking, and the experience there was excellent."
good,"I enjoy this company, employers, co-workers. I work part time at this job, so I do learn new things each day, but I do my best with each situation presented to me, I am a people person and I enjoy the heavy flow of customers that walk through our door, when I work! The only complaint I have is, I wish I was working Full time within Game Stop and the hourly was alittle more, but other than that I have none and will continue to work with this company!"
good,"It was excellent! The employees and even the managers are really kids at heart! I learned a lot about customer service, how to help customers find what they need using the point of sale register which is really comfortable-like using my own PC.  The hardest part? Learning how to file again? Maybe? However, the excitement of working there makes for a great learning environment and totally worth it!"
good,Really fun place. Sometimes stressful during big game launch and weekends
good,"The corporation itself may have its flaws, my review would be more solely based on the specific stores I worked in. My stores were very friendly, and were high strung on making sure the customer walked away satisfied, getting the service they needed, and left happy. That to me is important to making the store thrive. So being that, I greatly enjoyed the GameStop stores I was in, and they are great for helping the people of the area get what they need, and doing so professionally."
good,"At GameStop the employee talk about games all day they help each other complete there task. You could get very comfortable with employees. Every day u open the store you organize the selves and u also restock the drawers. u should always keep  the back counter clean and oraganized. "
good,On a typical day you get to talk about video games with people of all ages. Most of the people you work with are really cool people as well.
good,"Typical day work alone in the morning get help once the store becomes a little more busy and then leave when closing manager comes in for night shift.  Only close 1-2 nights a week but could be more if you desire."
good,"retail and customer service, managing a store crew of 6 plus people. Operating and maintain the store to the best standards. Great working with co workers and maintain store group bond"
good,Wonderful to help various customers and clientele develop an understanding of the product. Also feels beneficial having competitive sales goals.
good,"La giornata inizia con l' apertura e la pulizia dello store. Tramite mail giornaliera si viene aggiornati sulle promozioni attive, sui cambi di promozioni o su eventuali problematiche, I compiti sono sempre ben chiari e scritti su ogni mail quindi non si ha la scusa di ""dimenticarsi"" qualcosa. Il servizio alla clientela è la parte piu divertente e piacevole del lavoro come il lavoro di squadra: quando tutti sanno cosa fare e lo fanno bene il negozio ha prestazioni piu elevate rispetto ad altri che magari non sono preparati o non ne hanno voglia. Un' altra parte piacevole di questo lavoro è la formazione dei nuovi assunti: è bello insegnare a ragazzi volenterosi e pieni di entusiasmo anche perchè essendo una multinazionale basata sul ludico c'è sempre bisogno di giovani. Forse la parte più difficile è dare spiegazioni ai superiori del perchè un certo obiettivo o un certo badget non vengono raggiunti...di questi tempi la clientela spende meno degli anni passati e non essendo beni di prima necessità magari a volte è difficile convincere i clienti ad acquistare di più di quanto si erano prefissati."
good,"While there may not have been a constant, steady flow of customers every day, you always have something to do. The management keeps it a fun place to work making every day at work a good day. All in all, no job beats one where you get to spend the day working with video games and interacting with people that share a passion."
good,"It's a great experience when you're behind the register. I have learned so much , how to process Credit Cards, Cash, and manage a POS system. Organization skills is indeed mandatory."
good,typical day at work is come on time serve customers and keep the store clean.best thing about mangement is they can work on your schedule any way you like.great co-workers.hardest part was closing time.most enjoyable enjoyable part is interacting with co workers and recieving compliments from customers
good,The work environment is very exciting and fun to work at. There is a constant balance of heavy and light number of customers throughtout the day. The hardest part of this job would be standing for some hours without sitting until your lunch break but the more enjoyable part is helping customers choose games that are right for them as well as seeing the new products that will be coming out.
good,"I loved every minute of working for GameStop. Though I remained at GA for the entirety of my employment, I always maintained a great customer base, and positive outlook. I couldn't have asked for a better manager. The whole staff is amazing! Through my fiver years at GameStop, my co-workers and I became a family. I know I am always welcomed back with open arms!"
good,"the work day seemed to fly by on the weekends with the rush of cutomers but during the week quite slow, i usually do my checklist of the store to keep it in order"
good,Young fun workplace to develop and grow in a retail enviroment
good,I loved working at GameStop having been a video gamer all of my life. I got to be a part of vide game culture and live on the front lines of video game sales. My managers were awesome and they helped me with as much as they could.
good,"Per me è stato tutto nuovo dal contatto con il pubblico al tipo di lavoro svolto, i colleghi erano molto disponibili e gentili nel spiegarmi come andava svolto il lavoro,la parte più difficile è stata la cassa perchè avevo sempre paura di sbagliare,la parte più piacevole è stata il contatto con il pubblico."
good,"Gamestop was pretty awesome, I was hired on as a PT Sales Associate. The pay wasn't bad either if you were FT. Yearly bonuses, and very flexible schedules. Not too hype except for the holidays. Wish I never left."
good,a most excellent place to work if you like anything to do with video games.
good,"Gamestop was a Great company to work for. It was a challenging enviroment with a lot of growth from within for driven individuals. The company offered great benifits and truly valued the opinions of their associates. A typical day would consist of interacting with customers in a sales based enviroment, and basic upkeep of the store. The Part of the job I loved most was the competitive enviorment between stores, and districts.Competition would bring out the best salesmanship and seperate the stronger stores from the weaker. My team and I strived to always be the strongest store which produced great store rankings and great store visits.Working at Gamestop with a great District Manager taught me how to evolve my management style to achieve better results out of my associates while keeping a fun atmosphere."
good,"I enjoyed the atmosphere, the co-workers, and the subject matter of discussing video games with the customers."
good,Such a fun place to work! I loved my co-workers and management. They were there whenever you needed assistance and guidance.
good,"GameStop was a very good working experience, the guys there were wonderful and it was so easy to chat with others about newest games and gameplay suggestions. Don't expect to work there long if you are a female, as they mostly hire women for temporary seasonal help; besides that small negative factor, it was really awesome to have worked there."
good,I truly enjoyed working here so much so I was sad I had to go cause it was only a seasonal postion.
good,"Excellent start up job to build experience, good environment, fun place to work ."
good,"Ero affiancato da uno staff carismatico e divertente, il lavoro è stato molto leggero per questo, ho imparato tanto da loro"
good,I love this job. I've never worked anywhere quite like GameStop. I love everyone I work with and everyone who shops with us. It's such a fun environment that I get excited to go into work. I enjoy everything this job provides. It's definitely a great balance of work and play.
good,I feel like I know what I'm doing as well as doing well at it. Sometimes there is alot to learn but I feel with my managment team I can accomplish alot. I like the environment her and if it paid well and had the hours I could easily go full time.
good,"Management Understands the mine and the other employee's needs in terms of scheduling.."
good,"Working at GameStop was the best experience I've ever had with work. My co-workers pretty much turned into work friends, the work there was calming and I love what I did. 11/10 would work there again."
good,"Fast pace , educational , appreciated my experience and utilized it , they have the footprint to where the future is headed , excellent job , only downfall was seasonal cutbacks . good job otherwise"
good,Ambiente di lavoro come precedentemente descritto sopra molto stimolante che invoglia il lavoratore ha migliorarsi giorno dopo giorno
good,It may be seasonal but I learned a lot from the Job I also would love to work there again if it was full time. Also the culture there is great no wearing full on suits all you have to wear is gaming shirts which inspires the culture of what they do which is sales into gaming.
good,"It is one of the best companies that I worked for."
good,"I had a very enjoyable time at Gamestop because i have decent knowledge of video game so it was a field i enjoyed. My coworkers and management were a pleasure to work with no drama and plenty of chemistry between team members. work load included things like helping customers, handling money and organization of inventory."
good,Mi ha aiutato a diventare il professionista che sono. Esperienza lunga e sopratutto completa sotto tutti i punti di vista.
good,"Current employee and love my Gamestop family. I have a great team and great guests. Things always look greener on the other side. There is tons of work, good thing I’m a worker."
good,I've had a great experience working for GameStop. If you keep a positive attitude about the business and the task you are performing it's easy to have a great experience with this company.
good,You will like all the managers there. You will get to see a lot of personalities walking in and out the door. You will have good hours and it is a job you wouldn't wan to quick
good,GameStop is very very chill relax just long hours but the pay is great and the people are awesome I'm hoping to be able to go back to GameStop it's a seasonal thing
good,"Getting to greet customers and finding out exactly what they're looking for is part of the job, giving them recommendations and trying to get them to sign up for the Power UP rewards membership is also part of the job for a nice discount on pre-owned products."
good,Overall Gamestop is a great place to work. There is a good synergy between teams and it is small enough to get to know most everyone. And it is big enough to be a challenge on the technical side of things.
good,"This is not your typical retail, the only request I have is to get more hours for staff or have us not work by ourselves. "
good,Gamestop was a great place to work i learned alot the different generes of video games and consoles and learning about how to interact with customers and teaching the kind of video games they would be interested in.
good,"It is truly a family working for GameStop. They ALWAYS catered to my needs, either with my family or my own health. We all work to better each other and our selves. The customers we consider regulars and new ones are why we keep doing what we do. It's because of them and my boss that I want to work here for the rest of my life."
good,"Great manager, great employees, everyone was enthusiastic about their job and it didn't feel like anyone disliked their job. Would recommend this job to anyone."
good,"Gamestop is one of those jobs were your experience is reliant on who you work with. I had a good crew of people at my Gamestop so I had a positive experience, but the company itself is so numbers focused.  "
good,"A typical workday would be clocking in and cashiering for about half an hour to an hour, helping customers find games or accesories, preparing orders and doing inventory in a similar cycle for the rest of the shift. There's no strict uniform, as long as you dress business casual in comfortable clothes you can work in."
good,"I enjoyed working for Gamestop. Company gave me an insight to the gaming community and competitive gaming industry. My typical work day included team management, customer service, merchandising, inventory management, sale promotions, team meetings on how to improve and promote new products. Hardest part of my job was staying up to date with the latest games that were coming out to increase sales. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting and speaking with customers. getting their feedback on the products/games. Throwing gaming competitions and midnight early release. Seeing the excitement of the customers really made my job enjoyable."
good,I worked as a seasonal sales associate over the holidays and really enjoyed it.  Our manager was fantastic and the training was very thorough.  Our store had a positive attitude and made the work day go by in the blink of an eye.
good,depending on the days working at gamestop is a great part time job but on certain days sometimes it can be a hassle if dealing with angry customers or people who do not know what the problem they have with a certain console or video game is but all in all gamestop while stressful is a decent job if your looking for a job
good,I was a Seasonal hire so I was regulated to being a customer consultant. Guiding and helping customers get there purchase or guided them to someone who could help them better. The workplace in my opinion is easy going and friendly. The hardest part in my opinion was searching for POP! figurine since there not in order. It's not that we don't put them in order it's just that when Customer's are looking through them they make a bit of a mess and makes it hard to keep it organize. The most enjoyable part in my opinion is meeting new people and learning from them about stuff even we didn't know about.
good,"Typical days involve discussing products with customers, working the register, and cleaning up the store. Management is relaxed, but focused on goals and betterment."
good,"Working at GameStop is everything you would imagine it to be. Laid back, but you stay busy. Best retail Job I have ever had, and honestly I have no complaints."
good,"Gamestop is a great place to work. The work hours are accommodating. If a problem occurs they are quick to find a solution. Supervisor, leads and trainers are nice and professional and are willing to help."
good,"Gamestop is a very fun place to work, I'm actually trying to get back in a Gamestop. The only bad thing about it is the hourly pay, but besides that its a lovely job"
good,"I enjoy working here, it's hard but not that hard. There's more to it than just ringing people up, there is a sales aspect, but in my experience, everyone there is happy to help you learn and grow."
good,Working for gamestop was something that I always wanted to do. its a place where you would assume gaming is life; however for me it was interacting with customers and making sure they got the help and exact things they were looking for.
good,"I loved working at Gamestop with my associates. To be able to talk about anything, make new connections with friends, and improve on my working experience, it was a very productive and heartwarming experience. I feel like I learned from not only my managers, but my coworkers and guests who came to our store. There was always room for improvement and more to learn on the job. It is one of the few places where being yourself is good. The most enjoyable part about the job was the customer interactions. I think I became a better salesperson because of the atmosphere, support and feedback from everyone."
good,"A great company to work for. I am fortunate enough to have a District Leader who is supportive and challenges me to he a better leader."
good,"Just your standard selling culture based retailer. Flip preowned products over new, add warranties, sell memberships, and adore your guests! There is no hardest part as a Game Advisor, everyone is your superior."
good,Work can be stressful and at the same time rewarding. The only thing I wish would change in the forever changing economy is how upper-level management needs to fight for a more competitive pay salary.
good,on a typical day you would help guest find the stuff they needed. and by asking questions that helped with the work place culture. there really wasnt a hard part of the job I truly enjoyed every second i worked there. the most enjoyable part of the job was helping the grandparents becuase they were just so thankful that we took the time and explained everything they needed to know and got them everything they needed for there grandchild
good,"its fun working with people that have the same intrests as i do as well as a fun and fast paced work invorment, over all one of the best jobs ive had, just wish we got paid a little more"
good,"A typical day at work I came in and changed shifts with another employee. I when then start ringing up customers, When there is no longer a line I would restock the shelves and help customers if they had any questions or look for products in the back of the store. I would do that for about 6 hrs. and then I would help clean and vacuum the store. Management was amazing and very nice people anytime I  needed help they were they and made me feel welcome with asking questions."
good,"Working at GameStop as a gamer was fun. There are stressful corporate moments where sales are structured, but nothing more severe than any other retail environment. Customer service and patience is a must! Questions of all types get asked, and customers generally are buying items for loved ones,(son, daughter, grandchild, etc.) and might have no idea what they’re looking for. They will need your guidance to be reassured they’re leaving with what they needed. This is a great job for somebody who has great customer service and sales skills. Plus if also a gamer you get a discount on your purchases which is great."
good,we apply good games we have machine to control and also have good benefits the hardest part was to learn on your own no trainee not much good to say for game stop other then good benefits and people was kind to others.
good,I like working for Gamestop. Its a good environment to learn and grow. Sales has been something that i have really learned. Gamestop is definitely a selling culture.
good,"After a few years away from the gaming community, a friend recommended me to apply for an opening in management. This was one of the best jobs I ever had and was sad to have to leave. Inspiring culture and great sales training and experience. Brought me back to the gaming community."
good,it overall the company is great but like all company's it has its ups and downs. while the people i work with are great i have had a chance to meet higher ups and they are just as easy to get along with
good,"job culture was fun, competitive, and great energy. it didn't feel like work because you were able to talk to customers and see what they liked and disliked. having different release parties were also fun."
good,Great place to work if you enjoy talking about video games and are good at selling. The guest that come are really nice and never really had a hard time communicating with any guest.
good,Gamestop has been great working for all these years if I didn't like it then I would not have stayed 10 years like I have. I really want to move up in my career into a district manager for a retail company or into an inventory career field.
good,"Great place to work and customers are well comical so are anyways."
good,Working here not only helped me understand the consumer mind more but it also helped me develop networking skills along with great customer service skills .
good,One of my favorite jobs in my life but it was a Crazy job In the Worlds MOST Craziest Mall IN Baltimore Keeps You OnYour Toes and has you coming back for MORE!!!!!!
good,"i enjoyed all of my time at gamestop, you just talk about games, consoles, help people pick out what they want and it was really fun, i can talk about games for hours so its no problem for me!"
good,This job was very relaxing. The store can be empty for two hours then suddenly it it is filled but the customers are hardly rude. The staff is very friendly and helpful.
good,"It will be a little boring when you go over the manual on working at Game Stop. Even my supervisor admitted that and I found it hilarious. "
good,"Fun environment, management is great. The most enjoyable part of my day is seeing young kids come up to buy their own games and seeing them so excited about it. The hard part of my job is having to tell kids when they aren't old enough to purchase certain games (rated M games). Typical day at work is come in, take care of a few customers at the registers if there's a line, then start seeing if customers on the floor need help with anything. If not, then start zoning the walls and making sure everything looks nice. Switch with other employees between working the registers or the floor. Make sure the floor is vacuumed, trash is taken out, and the windows are clean before the end of your shift."
good,Fun and friendly environment. Competitive workplace for to meet sale quotas. Ability to talk with customers about their passion for gaming and keep them happy.
good,"Opening and closing, inventory control, cash handling, and supervising employees. Best part is talking and living a culture one can relate to. The days spent it like minded folk both coworkers and customers were amazing. relaxed job if you can finish assigned tasks promptly"
good,Management was always nice and the day goes by insanely fast. I never had a problem with anything. It was like a home away from home. Since I am a fan of video games it was fun and easy taking to customers about them.
good,There was always room to grow within the company. You really pick up on customer service skills. My days were never dull. The hours were completely fair.
good,nice side job but vey little hours and have to always follower customer to make sales in order  to keep your the job you have to make sales. Other then that its a very relax job and not hard work.
good,GameStop has easily been the best job I've ever had in my working life.  Throughout the years it has been a privilege to work there with the people I've worked with.
good,"I loved loved and I mean LOVED my employees/coworkers. The only issue I have with the company is how competitive it can sometimes be, and how underpaid management is. Overall I had a wonderful run with this company, I made many new friends and got to help awesome people on a daily basis."
good,"As someone who love playing video games, Gamestop  became a pretty ideal job where I got to talk about games all day and be around for the new releases which kept me entertained."
good,"I got to work in a industry that I've enjoyed being apart of since the classic gaming systems first came out. The team I worked with was extremely welcoming! They made me feel at home. The manager was great too. Flexible hours, and gaming benefits. If you are a gamer this can be a great entry level job to get experience."
good,A typical day at gamestop is pretty slow unless your working on the weekends. But most days are fun and slow paced. I've learned a lot about sales from them  and team leading.
good,The work atmosphere is very friendly and fun. It is a fast paced warehouse but the job task are all easy.                                                   .
good,"Gamestop knows exactly what the future is bringing and from what i can tell minus a few hiccups they are making valid attempts to stay relevant as a brick and mortar store in this evolving digital age."
good,The work was fun but was also highly repetitive. The Circle of Life sales pitch we had to memorize was a drag at times because customers are not always openminded.
good,"Although the management is sometimes unclear about certain projects, the overall experience with the company is great. Co-workers are very easy going and the atmosphere is always positive."
good,"Great place to work, employees are very kind and awesome to be around. Work ethic was great and the environment was very exceptional. Never had an issue"
good,"we will interact with all departments and totally environmental is good  "
good,"At GameStop you have many different types of gamers walk through the front door. It's a mission to have every one of them leave with what they came for or questions answered. My favorite part was the regular customers I would get. Great conversations with great passionate gamers and collectors. The best part was when I would suggest a game, based on the information they gave me, to them and they would end up getting it and coming back with positive reviews and thanks. GameStop is amazing for people who are outgoing and if you come in shy and quiet they will change that."
good,I loved working at gamespot calm environment (except for game launches and Black Friday). My managers and co workers were awesome. Awesome spot to work if you love video games
good,"I personally loved this job, the team was very nice and almost like a family. My role included keeping the shelf's stocked and organized and running a cash register."
good,"Working for this company I had my ups and downs, but in all honesty I really loved this job. They will train you and most time the managers will try to have a one on one with the employees to help empower them in the areas the are lacking in. The hardest part of working here was the short breaks with long hours of being on my feet for long periods of time. But even with all that I loved every minute of being in that store."
good,"Was a blast working for this company, enjoyed the customers, trying out new games is always fun, opening nights are the best, caring company to work for."
good,Probably the best Job I ever worked at. The only issue was the lack of hours and low pay. Other than that it is a great place to work. Great customers and staff.
good,Had a great time working for the company. They do have a lot of HR inconsistencies and policies and the way they handle disciplinary actions to their employees though. But other than that I worked for one of the best managers ever.
good,Enjoyed working here no problems no issues worked with very common customers everyday community oriented easy & fun shipment was handled easily in & out
good,"Working for GameStop there is always room to advance. I moved from a GA to an SGA in a matter of months. If you learn your products, are good with customers and willing to learn there is no limit to what you could do. It is an extremely fun environment to work in."
good,"The industry is changing and with the major game consoles delivering pre-downloaded Zero day releases, it is hard to see GameStop remaining a major player for much longer. The job itself was great, good people, not to heavy on the bureaucracy, and decent managers, but the company as a whole was not able to position themselves for longevity."
good,"I absolutely Love this position with this company.  I am only looking to improve my compensation to accommodate life situations.  It is a very relaxed atmosphere.  There are lots of cool items and events that are available.  They have associate help lines to provide assistance to certain situations.  That, to me, is the best."
good,Gamestop was a good work experience for me. The managers were really nice and made sure your were on top of your game.The store wasn't very big but we did have our days where we were packed. If you love a laid back environment and videos games this is the place to go!
good,"As a gamer, GameStop was an easy-going job to have after high-school. They worked around my college schedule and were making sure I did my training to learn the GameStop Circle of Life inside- and out.

Stock the shelves, rearrange displays, Clean the store, and box up shipments.  I personally love working there, it lets me talk games to fellow gamers and earn money while doing it."
good,"Working here was a lot of fun. It was very productive and I learned a lot. I met all kinds of people and loved seeing that everyone had games in common. I got along well with all of my bosses and I think that was one of the reasons I liked it so much. Customers do get upset about release dates being pushed back, but that was probably the worst part."
good,working at game stop was fun. your customers are just as excited as you are in the store when it comes to conversations and comparing experiences with the surrounding product.
good,GameStop has a great working environment. Shifts are filled with helping people find the right game or giving them tips on aspects throughout the gaming industry. Overall the management is helpful and great at training and teaching. The entire atmosphere of games and merchandise was enjoyable and comfortable.
good,"Good place to begin early retail learning in an environment you can enjoy as well if the entertainment industry interests you. Some opportunity for advancement, but stores are typically smaller."

The experiences I have had have allowed me to grow as a salesperson and help teach others about sales and I feel like the company really does care about making an impact on the lives of it's hard working employees. Fantastic company! A+!
good,"Brentwood was a great paying job especially for me because I didn't have any kids at the time but you got paid every week and the people was like family, they gave out bonuses on Christmas and gave you holidays off"
good,"A typical gamestop day isn't usually bad because of the daily regular fun spirited guests. I believe the hardest part of the job is remembering the company expectations need to be accomplished due to the fun you will have interacting with co-workers, managers, and customers. I would say my co-workers are the most enjoyable part of the job because we are like a small family that works together to accomplish our goals. However, if you aren't a gamer it makes your experience here a lot less enjoyable"
good,gamestop is the perfect place to get games toys and other things you may fanticise about. to all the gamers out there gamestop is the place for you.
good,"Approach customers, assist customers with buybacks or sell new items. Keep updated knowledge of games and consoles. Arrange games in an appealing way."

good,This job is a great place to work with a lot of benefits for the management team.THe vendors really care about what the associate think.
good,"The thing I love most about working for Gamestop are my co-workers. They are always very friendly and help me whenever I have a problem. I learned how to work with customers, do trades, work a register, and organize/clean the store."
good,"Although I only worked there seasonally and had to relocate due to financial reasons, GameStop was one of the best jobs I have ever had. Their management style is leadership based in every sense of the word. I never felt like I had a job but had an experienced mentor guiding me day by day, and for that I am so grateful. I would highly recommend working here for anyone interested in video games and electronics."
good,"busy day at work getting merchandise to sorters and packaging "
good,"I worked at the cash register, I put games on the shelves, I helped customers find what they needed. I learned how to price and label products, how to do online ordering, and how to  work well with customers. Management was wonderful always willing to answer any questions you may have. My co-workers were always wonderful to work with very friendly. Answering the phones were always the hardest part of the job for me. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was getting to test games to see how you like them."
good,"tipica giornata lavorativa consisteva o nel tenere in ordine il magazzino dai vari articoli in arrivo e in uscita dal magazzino oppure nel mettere in appositi scaffali i prodotti che poi venivano prelevati da altri operai."
good,Really fun and cool place to work at if you have a passion for video games. The people who work there are great and help teach you what you need to know. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting customers who love video games as much as you and interacting with them.
good,"The typical day was about helping customers and stocking the shelves."
good,"Gamestop was a cool place to work at and honestly I can say I would apply back. The management was cool. They trained me thoroughly during the holiday season. I will say thee hardest part of the job was interacting with rude customers during the holiday season, but I kept composure. The most enjoyable part of the job was handling the cash register and talking about upcoming video games with customers. What I've learned is that retail is my kind of environment to work in."
good,Fun and competitive company to work for in the retail and gaming industry. Basic sales with multiple opportunities for advancement and connections beyond just the company.
good,"A great company to work for. Everyone there is friendly and well help guide you in the right direction if your about to make a little mistake. You do have things to learn about they systems and games. Its simple to start picking up on them. All around, this can be a fun place to work."
good,The environment there was productive and always positive. The team atmosphere of the employees made customers feel welcomed when they entered to store.
good,great with supporting and empowering their employees. great room for growth. nice discounts if you enjoy video games. work schedule flexibility. District manager has open door policy
good,"I've never worked for a company that I actually enjoy waking up and going to work for. Since there is a handful of staffing, it is easy to get close to your coworkers and be able to work together as close as family. Moving up in the company is more of a waiting game as Gamestop likes to keep very limited hours and staffing so you might be ready for a promotion but may wait an extremely long time due to a low turnover rate. Benefits are decent as to the pay. One of the downsides is the lack of hours given for employees available to work."
good,"Amazing place to work for. They really do care about their employees and do anything in their power to help you advance. I got paid to sell video games and talk geek all day everyday, it was awesome."
good,I only worked seasonal so I don't think I have enough to say. But from my time there it was a good experience. they thought me well and never left me to fend for my self which i appropriate a lot
good,"It was fun even though it was seasonal. Flexible with my schedule since I had a second job at the time, Customers, management, and work environment were all enjoyable and I'd be more than happy to work there again."
good,"The work environment is great, the work you have to do isn't the best for the pay. $7.25 for customer service, register, sorting games, filing games, alphabetize games on the wall, keep the store clean, vacuum, wipe windows, throw trash away, ETC."
good,"Assist customers’ pre order merchandise, answer phones, stock shelves, and sell merchandise."
good,"Even though I was there for a short time, the people I worked with were some of the nicest people I have ever met. Since I was new whenever I had a question or needed assistance with a customer they were always able to help me out."
good,It Was a very educational experience i learned how to handle difficult customers and how they stack and organize stuff and the hardest bit of the job was the property heating was way high in it made me sleepy and it was sometimes hard to hear.
good,Love helping people in that industry and continue to connect with people from that area of sales and customers thanks guys.
good,"As a third key manager I supervised closing and occasional opening shifts, provided management to game advisers, assisting with inventory and training."
good,"Working at GameStop is always fun and challenging. You're constantly learning about new games, consoles and accessories. While the workload can sometimes be high with demanding requirements from corporate, having great coworkers makes the time there a breeze. The hardest thing is remembering everything about the games. There are so many, it gets hard to keep up. My manager does her best to help us excel in every way possible."
good,"great work place with good staff, opportunity's for advancement take time but they are there. I would definitely recommend people to take game stop as a first job as you will learn god customer service skills in a moderately paced retail enviroment"
good,This job environment is beyond what I expected to be. This company comes with open arms. A daily day there is jammed packed with various task and duties. Learned what a company should be.
good,"I loved this job, it was fun easy and the customers were some of the best I could have asked for. You make friends here, not just business acquaintances."
good,"I take calls for more than 6,000 stores around the US and Puerto Rico, I assist with customers issue that Customer Service Tier I is not able to assist with, I love my team and my coworkers management is always there to help out when needed."
good,"easy job with ok employee benefits"
good,"A typical day in the life of a Game Stop employee is filled with many different things to do, but mostly it involves customer service. We answer questions on the phone and in person, we process transactions where people are trading games in to get store credit or cash, buying new games, and even reserving games that have not yet been released. It also involves housekeeping like cleaning, filing games, and putting up back stock. "
good,"Managers are great and friendly. We have fun, but we work hard. They are very patient and teach you what you need to learn. The best part is interacting with the customers. The hardest part of the job is probably keeping the shelf's nice and the filing system we have."
good,It has been great working for gamstop and the MGR's. One of the best companies I have worked for in a long time and i love the team i work with. I don't think you can get any better. The staff always watches out for each other and helps each others out. We will make sure you leave happy knowing we did every thing we could.
good,"It has only taken 16 years to get the job there. I love the positive up-lifting atmosphere Gamestop has. Management could be any better. I've still yet to see the hard part of the job, there. The most enjoyable part of my job, is walking the door and getting my day started."
good,"When most people think of a day at work at a GameStop store they typically think about playing video games all day and talking to people about video games all day. While the ladder is true sometimes and we do get to converse with customers, there will never be a time when a GameStop employee will get to sit around and play video games all day. "
good,Fun place to work! Laid-back with potential to promote from within.
good,"A typical day at work would involve me doing a lot of administrative tasks in- between engaging my customers and ringing up sales through the reger. I learn different ways to interact with my customers, as well as how to mentor/ lead my team sccessfully on a daily basis.The hardest part of my job is not being able to get the overtime that I want. I enjoy working  my associates the most because we ry have a great team that works together for the success of our store."
good,"I enjoyed everything from the management to the perks of working at this establishment. I would not mind working for them again, but not for a terribly long time, for it would take a bit to see any raises or any advancement in my position; other than that, lovely place to work"
good,"Fun-filled, lightning fast shifts. Work never felt like work, coworkers, and customers contribute to an environment that eases shifts and lends to a productive, and fun filled environment."
good,"Customer service,stocking, money handling, i leaned how imported is was to keep the store clean, the management was superior at the stop but above them not so much the hardest part of the job was to not be intimidated by the customers and to remember to do you job the best part of the job is the people"
good,"I have been close to many of my coworkers before but nothing really compares to the friends that come from working here. And as long as you can interact with people one can be taught about games. There have been the few times that the company itself has been confusing or tiresome, but for the most part was always fine. There aren't a whole lot of positions in the company overall, with there not being many people within each store and very few levels within the whole company, but it keeps things a little easier and neat when you are only around half a dozen positions between you and the owners. And there was the occasionally terrible or angry customer to deal with. A lot of working with yourself, setting, and accomplishing goals, but who doesn't want to stand around all day dealing with games with your best friends."
good,"Great customer service."
good,"Excellent place to work. Reasonable workload. Would clock in, start assisting customers, help customers check out, clean work space and main floor of the store, after locking up at close, would vacuum and make sure store was clean before clocking out and going home. I learned how to handle tough customers, how to deal with stressful situations (having to work fast with people asking questions and a long line of customers behind them). Most enjoyable part of the job is the entire job itself."
good,South Texas Branch is a great company to work for where everyone in the district believes in helping one another.
good,Working with good people is half of any job and my GameStop Store has good people. All of them are friendly and easy to get along with. If you like to work with people and like video games then this is a job for you because you get to talk to people about video games! Now just like any job it isn't all about having fun. Tasks still must be completed and the hardest part of the job is learning to complete tasks while still giving an excellent customer service.
good,"I have learned how to do multiple things on a computer, it definitely satisfied my OCD. I love my co-workers and managers. They are FANTASTIC! I love video games and everything that comes with gaming and working there i really got to express that."
good,Gamestop is a great place to work.  The hours are good during the holidays and the company stays loyal to its employees.
good,"This is the first place I ever worked, and I have absolutely enjoyed my time with this company. Each shift consists of customer service, running cash register, and making sales for the store. We were also encouraged to get customers to make reservations for titles not out yet, and talk them into signing up for the company's discount card. This was hardest during the slow part of the year, and one really can't determine the types of customers that came in and out of the store from day to day, so numbers tend to fluctuate..which sadly, is also a reason as to why hours were not consistent either. However, I never had a problem with any member of my team, the people I worked with and how we all shared passions and interests with a large portion of the customers we tended to really made the job quite enjoyable. I love being able to laugh and have a good time in the workplace."
good,"Start off with labeling games at new prices if needed, then worked towards restocking games in alphabetical order, and by system. Co-workers were great and very helpful when needed to be. Management kept in their work and showed me great tips on how to become a more effective seller. The hardest part of the job was dealing with distractions, but managements and co-workers supported me with knowing what to do."
good,"I really enjoy GameStop because I have learned so much since I started there. I love teaching customers about the technology that gaming entails and giving them all the details about games coming out, because it lets them know what to look forward to. My coworkers are amazing individuals and so full of energy. We try to make each customer feel like the service they get from us us tailored specifically to them. It is an energetic place where people with questions can come in and get all the answers they need from fun and friendly associates who have a passion for what they do."
good,"I loved it but the pay was terrible. If you like kids that have nothing to do all day, you would love it"
good,"I absolutely love being at GameStop! The team is so fun, laid back, and easy to become friends with. The manager is a really awesome guy and works around schedules with understanding. The team never makes any day seem overwhelming no matter how busy the store gets and you are never bored."
good,GameStop stores sell more than videogames and downloadable content.  GameStop brings a new experience to retail shoppers with its very knowledgeable and diverse employees.  Customers that look for their gaming needs at stores like Wal-Mart usually deal with employees that are moved in from other departments and don't really care for gaming.  I personally have several customers that come in just to talk with employees and will usually always end up buying something based off of our recommendations.
good,gamestop is a great job to start off they work with your hours. you meet the most amazing people and you have fun while your working
good,"A typical day is going in and start organizing games and making sure everything is neat. Added to that is helping costumers with any need they have; that can vary from a simple opinion about a game all the way to how a consuls operating systems works. "
good,"I love working here,The people are great the customers are all fun to talk to and I love the Games we sell."
good,My co-workers helped me with my first day and made me feel like I was part of a family. Everyone was nice and had a sense of humor which made the work day go by faster.
good,"Amazing place to work."
good,working Midnight releases were my favorite moments in work!
good,fun and not boring always had people coming in. management was fine before the switched them up now i cant trust there management to much. they are to serious
good,"My typical day at work involved prowling the sales floor searching for customers to help with their purchases.  I learned how to operate hand held scanners, and cash registers with touch screens fairly quickly due to tutelage from the management as well as the other employees that were readily available at a moments notice to answer any questions I had."
good,"Great place to work "
good,"I have held this job for 6 years now and still enjoy going to work every shift that I have. Friendly environment with a great client base. Always being considered for promotion is nice, and management is always trying to help you out no matter what is going on."
good,Whats not to love about working with video games all day long. It is a great experience for those who love video games and want to get into the video game design field. I've learned a lot and will continue to work there seasonal 
good,Gamestop is a very fast paced company and I thoroughly enjoy it. It's not for the weak at heart when it comes to change. New initiatives are constantly being rolled out and that makes it a challenge to full-time employees.
good,"I really enjoyed working for GameStop during the holiday shopping season, most notably Black Friday.  Management and co-workers were very friendly and helpful with teaching me the rules and skills I need to be successful.  Overall I would highly recommend this to people in the age group of 18-25."
good,"My experience with GameStop is excellent. The store manager hired me as a clueless teenager and as grown me into one of the store's most successful Game Advisers. My team is always flexible and enjoyable, I've never disliked a single co-worker. The customer service is always wonderful and  the customers are the best. It's easy to manage the store's product; i.e putting out display cases, filing game discs, doing price changes, while engaging customers on their needs. Some unhappy customers can make the day a little stressful, but luckily the A+ management always knows the best way to resolve the situation and educate the Game Advisers how to handle it themselves. The best part is participating in the midnight launches, giving away posters and getting gamers excited for the next big thing is like one big party."
good,"Great work enviroment with great coworkers, My only complaint is there is not enough room to advance."
good,My co-workers are the best! I love coming to work because they would have the most interesting and funny conversations. I learn that even though I am a black sheep I was with other black sheep and I didn't feel out of place. I will always go to that GameStop!
good,"My typical day at work starts with a smile, doesn't matter the mood i came in from the outside. Im here to work and work ill do. The thing i learn from jobs and is willing to learn is anything new, i want to adapt to what i can to help the business more. I made some memories with some co-workers in the past whom i would refer to jobs, or they would even refer me. The hardest part of the job is being criticized. For example, at time its hard to always hear bad stuff about you, it will effect you but you shouldn't let it get to you at work . When i work, i love helping the best to my abilities, to make a customer satisfied, is the best feeling ever."
good,great working environment with knowledgeable staff. Flexible schedules. good benefits
good,"The hardest part would be staying busy. This was a new store, so most of the time you would be just explaining what Gamestop Kids was to customers, who would end up just going to the other Gamestop. I did enjoy working in the enviorment, though it wasnt as fast paced as I wished, I did have memorable co workers who kept a smile on my face."
good,"Great work place, Great people, Great management! This is a great place to work even if you don't know about gaming that much, they will give you the heads up on whats what and then you will pick things up along the way. The company is really a great company to work with."
good,"A typical day of work would be me coming in and clocking in, and immediately helping customers with their needs. Their needs ranged from locating games, to asking about the information of games, and helping them check out by use of a register. The only thing I learned was how to use a register. The management at the store are very nice and friendly. They do expect you to work your hardest. The co-workers are equally very nice and helpful. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with ""those"" customers who want things to go their way that aren't company policy. The most enjoyable part was just the great atmosphere and working the register."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of a four hour shift, helping customers throughout the evening while working on the cash register. I would also help close at night and clean/organize the store."
good,I loved working there. I was able to help gamers such as myself.
good,"Video game specialty retailer; great first job to have while in, or just out of, high school. Decent potential for advancement with enough time and effort put in. Fair amount of autonomy given to store managers to adjust to local market. Good staff, good management."
good,"I worked with two of my best friends, and everyone who worked at the store got along great. We all would hang out and talk all the time, so it made going to work easier. Very relaxing place to work, and met some really cool customers everynight."
good,Great work environment. Great management.
good,"Gamestop was a very busy place to work there were always tasks that had to be done on a daily basis, quite repetitive. Overall, it was a rather nice place to work, enjoyed the atmosphere."
good,"Great place to work for however, there are peaks where the labor is slow and not enough work to be done. The hours could be more flexible especially for second shift."
good,"A typical day at work was clocking in, seeing what needed to be done, interacting with costumers."
good,"all about customer experience,talk to people about what games they like and games they might like to reserve with Gamestop.I learn that customers always come first over my daily tasks,management is always there to help.The hardest part of the job is trying to reach goals when customers only want what they came to get,the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to check out games to preview and give feedback to customers"
good,"Typical day at work entails processing transaction for new an used games, receiving pre-owned merchandise and preparing for sale as well as advising customer's of new product. Great way to see a booming industry up close, providing customers with a product with the purpose of entertainment. Customers are friendly, management is supportive and hands on during training, which was one on one."
good,working at Game Stop was really fun. you get to meet new people and learn what they like and what they dont like.
good,Great people and good customers. Fast paced environment where you are never bored and constantly busy. I very much enjoyed working here.
good,Had a great time working for Game Stop. I learned alot about sales from management and from senior co-workers.
good,Learned very good customer service.
good,"This is the top company to work for if you like video games. A fun, friendly and competitive environment. A great part-time starter job with a promising career future."
good,Both my boss and co-workers felt like family to me. They provided flexible hours so I can continue being my mother's primary care take and continue my college education.
good,"In the five years that I worked for Gamestop, it quickly began to feel more like a family, everyone I worked with was funny, respectful, and genuinely good people. The upper management was also really nice to work with if there was an issue of any kind."
good,I only worked the seasonal black Friday shift and such but overall it was fun everyone is so nice and helpful. I had a great experience working there.
good,I started at GameStop as a regular associate and worked my way up to store manger in 2 years. They were fair and always seemed appreciative of my work. The holiday periods can be stressful but for the most part it’s a very easy going company.
good,As a game advisor. I ensure to provide exceptional and efficient customer service to patrons throughout the store. Excellent customer service. Ability to handle cash transactions.
good,"I was a seasonal at the time and I actually loved my job here! I just wish I could of stayed (they had no room for me). Hours were perfect and so was the management. Some of the coworkers were friendly and fun while others were more serious but I had no issues. "
good,My location had some really cool and understanding managers who were always willing to answer questions and help out. They never asked me to do things that they were not willing to do themselves.
good,"Very nice and organized workplace, amazing people to work with and have similar hobbies and interests. great for people looking for a laid back but safe and comfortable work place."
good,"Overall I had a great time working at GameStop. I wish I could’ve stayed longer but I was only there as a seasonal employee. All the employees there are friendly. You can ask almost anything and they’ll give you an answer, if they know it. Everybody’s trying to help each other."
good,"As a female, I was hesitant to start working here. After about a month, I felt 100% comfortable in this environment. I look forward to my future with this job."
good,I learned after working at 4 stores it is all the managers 2 of the four stores I worked for were terrible in the sense of cleanliness and management but my two stores were I started from those were the best staff and managers I’ve worked for so far
good,"This place was great, I cant speak to the retail stores, but the distribution center was amazing. The people were the kindest I've worked with. The .managers were appreciative of hard work, and the benefits/vacation were the best I've had."
good,"Talking to people about video games is something I never thought I’d get paid for, but GameStop was always the place I knew I’d be able to profit from my passion."
good,Everyone I worked with there became a close friend of mine and I made memories I will never forget. Very calm yet competitive in a friendly sense. Fun especially when you're familiar with games and consoles.
good,Everyone was nice it as a good working environment the Manager treated everyone nicely the pay was given out evenly I have no complaints about the job
good,Wonderful family environment. They push you to be better everyday with kind words. It’s a pretty relaxed job with little to no problems. The nicest customers.
good,"If your into gaming and don't mind dealing with different personalities on the daily then this place is ideal for you. You work around a great team of people and, have fun talking about what interests most of us that look into Gamestop as a career and that's games."
good,Amazing place to work for especially with the right team. Best job i've had and I don't intend to leave. Only negative side is GAs don't get many hours.
good,"It's a fast pace environment. You must be quick mentally and physically while still providing the best customer service to each guest. The goal is that each guest should leave happier than when they came in. You must monitor your store's performance daily, and you must be able to make improvements in the areas that need it. The guests are very diverse, so you must be able to read people in order to give them what they want."
good,Era agradable muy divertido pero termino cuando Serafina la tienda de puerto rico
good,"I really like my job and workplace at GameStop in Norway, for me I have no big complaints and think this is the perfect job for people who like a workplace like they provide at this company."
good,"A typical day consisted of receiving and entering orders in the system. Assisting customers with their order status by phone and by email. I learned about the industry of gaming, and let me tell you the gamers take their stuff serious for sure!"
good,"Working at gamestop it was like a family, providing quality care for guests. With excellent staff and professional management. I enjoyed working for gamestop!"
good,"Very Good work environment. I was an intern here , but they treated me as a part of them."
good,so one day at game stop I walked in preparing myself for a regular day I that I thought it would be but as the day was going a customer came to the register with a bad attitude and I began to make her day by cheering her up with jokes and laughter but nobody know that it was really hard for me to do that because I'm such a shy person but love when I see somebody laugh or smile because of me.
good,"I have loved every second of my job at GameStop. The company offers lots of resources, backs up their employees, and really makes the job feel like a family or home away from home. I love the people I’ve met and the job can be a ton of fun."
good,"I learned to work fast with other people, so many new things about consoles and headsets, super nice and fun environment, every ones always in the best mood"
good,"people were friendly and the environment was great! I honestly was greeted by nice workers and caring individuals. Although I was stationed at a repair workshop, I still had a lot of new experiences with the way the gaming industry worked."
good,"Would of loved staying here, some things are hard to come by. Ill always try once in a while just because I love the environment of every store ive gone into."
good,"I started out as a seasonal who opened the store for its grand opening. I enjoyed every time I got to go in. I knew there would always be something to do. I quickly moved up to full time, then promoted to a key holder (manager on duty), to assistant manager, then before leaving I was store manager (one of the youngest ones)"
good,"Everything I do there is fun. Even if its putting up games or doing simple tasks the other workers always make the work fun to do. There is nothing really wrong with working here, the management treats me fairly and the culture is my cup of tea, it's all about games and being a gamer I enjoy those things. Hardest part is not asking for help. And the most enjoyable part is when I can talk to customers about games that I enjoy or recommendations."
good,Great place to work and learn new technologies and improve yourself in the areas that you are interested to move ahead with high skilled mentors to guide you through.
good,"My advise is you have to have some knowledge of the stuff in the store. Constant question, constant recommendation, constant movement. Hardest part is also the easiest part inventory because the prices for the supply change on a daily basis."
good,"The days I spent at Gamestop were always interesting, whether it was talking to customers and helping them find their needs, simply chatting with guests, or fulfilling tasks while being able to flexibly assist in what ever task needed to be handled."
good,"I loved working for GameStop, even as a seasonal employee. Gaming was and still is a huge passion of mine and working for this business is something I can say was not only a fun workplace, but a dream job that I can say I'm proud of working in."
good,"If you like to work with people and give them the feeling that they are coming and not wasting their time when leaving store by informing them of the latest/greatest or upcoming releases or with consoles that are all the rage or selling them other merchandise. This job can be quite randomly high paced especially during November to January."
good,"Excellent work culture , good work life balance. There is opportunity for advancement in the IT and web space. The management is good and accommodating to employees needs ."
good,"A typical day at work for a guest advisor looks like greeting people promptly as they walk in the door, helping them find anything they want or suggesting things they need, handling transactions for buying, selling, and trading games, consoles, accessories, and anything else GameStop may be selling at the time. Learn to collaborate as a team to accomplish tasks set by the district leader or store leader, and help each coworker who may be struggling in their goals to find solutions to overcome their struggles."
good,"I really enjoyed working at GameStop. I made sure games were in the proper order, and assisted with customers' needs. Overall I think that the atmosphere was pretty well and everyone seemed to work well together."
good,A fast paced working environment with the chance of new opportunities to explore as the day goes on and new customers arrive to the stores location. Very enjoyable and fun to experience.
good,I love working at Gamestop Hated that It was Seasonal and i loved the people i worked with and the Customers who came into the store and there was no Hard part maybe the trade ins but other than that it was okay.
good,"I work with some awesome people. They taught me the ways of retail and sales pitching, they may not pay a whole lot. But gamestop is a good place to work at for those who are just starting to work."
good,I worked in GameStop for part time for about 3 years and grew inside the company and opened many doors in my work field. Game Stop is fun to work with because of the team and the discounts if you are a gamer
good,"I learned that projecting your voice is very important in a crowded environment during the holidays, due to the high number of customers in the store."
good,"Great fun place to work especially for anyone who is a gamer; always know whats coming up and any sales as well as the store discount, great friendly environment, just like hanging with friends while working."
good,"As an avid gamer this job was a fantastic experience. Discounts, working with a great team, as well as being able to build on my customer service background by becoming a manager for a year and a half."
good,Was a very great place to work. Everyone was fun and relaxed was the best job I had and the most fun I had in a long time. Very Much Recommended to everyone.
good,"GameStop is one of the best employers anyone could hope to work for. Fun products, exciting promotions, midnight launches, product give aways, employee contests and so much more."
good,I enjoyed working here. I worked as a cashier and sales associate. I have a great deal of experience with games and enjoyed talking to customers. I hope to work at a similar place.
good,"Game stop has always been a great place to work, friendly staff great customers, i learned more about the game industry working their. management very friendly postiive energy, hardest part of the job was just the hours."
good,"Assist customers on locating the new and exciting game that just released they are looking for.  Knowledgeable in upcoming games, systems, hand held devices and accessories.  Yearly meetings required traveling to help grow within the company and develop a better atmosphere for customers to come into the store.  Inventory control on all games, consoles, handheld devices and accessories to ensure stock is accurate.  Upselling to the membership services where they receive a discount on pre-owned games.  Ensured marketing was set up each week to show the newest items and games that will be releasing.  Held game nights on midnight releases to ensure a fun atmosphere for customers to come and wait for the new game to release."
good,"Flexible hours, friendly coworkers, regular customers. Opportunities to advance if willing. Reasonable sale goals. Fun work environment. Great for part time, couple shifts a week. During holidays you get more hours. Only assistant manager/manager get full time. (*at a slow store/location)"
good,Gamestop is an awesome job being a gamer. Your in an environment that you know alot about and is apart of your life. Game launch nights are the best. Manager at the time was a really good man. I never had a problem with him or my team. We all clicked well.
good,"A workday at Gamestop is fun and productive. This Gamestop helped improve my social skills. The hardest part about the job is constantly being on your feet (sometimes up to 12hrs a day). The best part is the employees. They are great to work with, they work as a team, and they make this a place you want to work."
good,"Muy buen, buen ambiente laboral, oportunidad de promoción, seriedad, buena dirección,"
good,I had so much fun working there great environment friendly people man it was the best job I've had so far. The management was clear cut and to the point wish I could have become a DM.
good,"Very cool place to work, enjoyed myself with this company. good team work when it came to push things out. Always work to get done, and the company looks out for their employees."
good,"The hours they give are bad, but benefits are a whole lot better, especially if you are a gamer, the co-workers really brighten up the place as well as the customers."
good,"A day at work was simple, fun and never boring. Our interaction with customers was always enjoyable. Management was supportive and always willing to teach. Co-workers were fun and helpful. No part of this job was genuinely difficult."
good,To gamers alike a job like this is a great part time job for those that are in school or with another job. the staff is lively and can have its perks with employee discounts and etc
good,I had multiple responsibilities ranging from assisting customers to restocking merchandise. I learned a lot about working in retail positions and assisting customers find what they were looking for.I had a great relationship with my manager who showed me my mistakes and helped me to understand my duties. The hardest but most fulfilling aspect of my job was that I had to assist people who did not have a definitive idea of what they wanted when they came in. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the smiles of those who had gotten exactly what they were searching for.
good,"Working for the company of GameStop was incredible, I would love to still be there.  The reason for not being at GameStop is because the company outsourced our department to Costa Rica."
good,Management truly cares about both its employees and customers alike. I love working with every single one of my coworkers and going to work is never a chore no matter what needs to be done around the store or how i'm feeling that day personally. Everyone has always been eager to help when I struggled with something and never once made me feel uncomfortable or embarrassed when I didn't know how to do something. There really is not a single aspect of working at GameStop that I dislike.
good,"didnt stay with them long but loved the people, culture, and opportunities given to me. love the customers and helping them leave happy. overall wonderful working experience."
good,"Customers come in and talk to us about games that are already out or possibly coming out. A typical day may be slow or fast paced, you never really know but it is all worth it; the supervisors really help the day go by quickly ."
good,"Its GameStop! what more of a review would you need? fun place, fun people. Nothing hard about it unless you don't like to talk to people."
good,"My typical work day was nothing less than amazing from interacting with the customers to just relaxing with the guys when business slowed down. I've learned that there's definitely hard workers out there when it comes to Gamestop. The manager was amazing he gave me a chance when no other place would. He made sure everyone was doing their job and that everyone was feeling comfortable throughout the day. The hardest part was really standing up and that's not really a big deal as you learn to get over it. But, the most enjoyable part was without a doubt closing time because we were able to just crack jokes before we closed down for the day. All in all I believe that Gamestop is an amazing place for anybody to work."
good,"interact with costumers"
good,Gamestop was my first job. Everyone I worked with was nice. The manager was good at teaching about how to be a sales associate.
good,"Customer service was always top priority in our store, as per our online training sessions available to us during slow hours, as well as the fortunate experience of being able to work under Tristin James, one of the most hardworking managers I have been privileged to meet, and for her dedication to making the guest experience golden every single time. Watching her with her clients inspired me to do my best at the job and soon earned a promotion to keyholder, giving me many more responsibilities over the store. We had group meetings frequently, discussing the upcoming releases of which each of us had been assigned to research and present (a very fun experience for all, probably the best part of being a keyholder). Being able to cooperate with other employees as we reached for higher sales numbers, ""going in for the assist,"" as we called it, which means helping out another game advisor to sell systems, games, and the famous Pro cards. Personally I enjoy GameStop as an individual within the free market and believe their prices are fair, as I do have an inside view into the potential savings and benefits from being a Pro member. The only slightest complaint I might have is the constant bombardment of adverts on the televisions (I understand that people need to be alerted of new games, but everyday working several hours with the same commercials with booms and tat-tat-tats can make a soul like mine a bit weary). This is why I chose to wear headphones around my neck plugged into an iPod with Libera running, very soothing, and as Tristin had put it, ""the angels surrounding Paul."" I"
good,"I enjoyed working with video games, and helping customers pick out video games to play. I especially enjoyed working the midnight releases for big games being released because I got to dress up for the event. I worked with a number of people, and customers. Helping customers around Christmas time was one of my favorite things because they always had lists that they needed help with. I always had customers leave extremely happy."
good,Working at GameStop exceeded my expectations as an employee. The culture of working for GameStop provided a fun environment to work in and everyone got along with each other. Working for GameStop gave me a lot of experience in managing the store and making sure that  games were displayed properly on the walls.
good,really enjoyed working for this company it was fun and i met some really nice people there too and the supervisors were nice and the leads were nice as well
good,"A good place to start career due to its fast changing pace which intend encourages learning."
good,I love working here and serving customers.I have learned how to approach people with a friendly and energetic attitude. My co-workers are wonderful and they listen to me without a problem. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people and putting a smile on their face.
good,"I loved working for GameStop, it was a very relaxed environment with plenty of flexibility for their employees. Any typical day had its rush moments, typically when school was out or it was a holiday. I became well experienced in handling money and communicating with customers on a regular basis. Management, fortunately, was very tolerable since it consisted mostly my peers. All of my co-workers had a very similar mindset about work and how customers were to be handled effectively and in a timely manner. The hardest part was trying to upsell pre-orders to customers that didnt want anything, especially when it seemed to offend them that I asked. The most enjoyable part of my time working there was just getting to be in that environment, with like-minded and relaxed people all day."
good,"Working for GameStop DC was a great experience for me that I wish would have lasted longer, but due to my wife's promotion, we had to move to Houston. The work environment was very faced paced, and my position required a ken eye for detail. Inventory Control required us to account for every item in the DC, which was a huge responsibility, but I welcomed it. The work life balance was great, and the entire staff were a joy to be around."
good,My day would began either opening or going in for my shift in the middle of the day. My day would go on from either leaving for the day or closing the store. My day would go to helping customer's with there needs or doing my operations from either sending out merchandise to sending out electronics.
good,Great customers and great coworkers everything is easy to learn.
good,"i worked at valle vista mall, san benito and harlingen store outside of mall and every co worker was awesome to work with. hardest part of job was changing marketing more than once during the launch of call of duty ghost and xbox one and ps4 . most enjoyable part of job is that i love video games and i would love to see little kids get happy when they would get a game. Management was great and i learned alot from them that has helped me with other jobs"
good,My day to day well at Gamestop was amazing selling of video games  computer software accessories for improving gaming stocking merchandise managing the staff and giving great customer service.The only problem i would say is working with staff members that was not for company but more or less for them selves this was my first job where i seen in store theft and had to do something about it and change out for people that is for the company.
good,"Adored working for gamestop during the time I worked for them,  my coworkers were fantastic, the customers were great and the experience was overall extremely positive."
good,"Was a door greater, and moved up. I worked stock and cashier. Was hired from temp to perm, however there were not many hours for me."
good,"I had a blast working with the people there, as well as learned so much about the software and hardware it took to make gaming consoles and games."
good,"Selling, trading, and obtaining reservations would be the typical day at work."
good,"GREATEST JOB EVER. "
good,"Outside of minimum payment, i found this company to be a great company to work for"
good,Although i only got to work at Game-stop for a short period of time the management there where great. I enjoyed working as a key-holder. I feel as if i learned a lot  of managing at Game stop. The hardest part of the job for me would be trying to memorize and understand the games and different typed of systems.
good,"Sales, Customer Service, Management, Inventory, Shipping/Receiving, and Marketing"
good,"On June 29, 2013 Gamestop took the workers to the six flags. It was a great experience for me because it was my first time visit. The people were very friendly. We had food and drinks served to us. Pictures were taken too. It was a great social event. The workers at Gamestop are very friendly. They are always willing to help each other especially towards the end of the shift. There is great order in the leadership from the upper management to the lower management. The hardest part of this job is that sometimes when there is an error on the part of the associates, the punishment is most of the time "" a first and final warning"" which makes it uneasy for   some of the associates."
good,Able to help customers find the products they want.
good,"This is a valuable location to learn many career skills including advancing my management knowledge, balance of high-priority tasks, and working with corporate employees."
good,Great enviroment great system helped expand my management skills as well as sales and customer service
good,"Fast work environment, never boring, some duties can be tedious but every job has those. Management and employees get treated great. There is always room to advance."
good,A typical day at work consists of keeping up with individual production of associates who work in the software department. I also identify trends in data compiled in order to understand the business flow. I can then present the data in a clear-cut manner to management to help them make decisions regarding the company.
good,"I would go on and stack shelf,greet customers for my start of the day.What i have learned is that making other customers happy will indeed help them throughout their day.My coworkers were very social,they kept me in a good mood.My hardest part of the job is really nothin,there isnt nothin i cant put my heart into and make it at ease.The enjoyable part of the day is leaving work of course, ready to get home and get ready for the next day"
good,"It is always a satisfying day of work. It is one of those places in which one gets so comfortable that it barely ever feels like working. Unless, of course, there is a game release. Then, it is somehow hectic, but in a good way. It is like a ticking bomb, each step of the release unravels and you see it happening and put in all the work because you simply can't wait to see the joy on people's faces once they get a hand on their copy of the game of the month or the year."
good,"Organized the Games and DVDS while helping customers. I learnd a lot about store policies and how to lock up the store at night as well as how to open. Management was awesome, everybody there was very welcoming, playful, and at the same time very professional. The hardest part of that job was just some of the much younger crowd for me Back then. I really enjoied learning and taking all the new information in."
good,I would be excited to go to work. I was a friendly and challenging environment.
good,"Management was great and so were the employees. The environment was laid back and relaxing. If you're a playful person and you like being around people, this is the place for you."
good,"The management was great, they took care of the employees and was one of the best job expiriences I've had. Had store benefits and flexible hours and the oportunity to grow in the company."
good,Great place to work on a military base. If you can't get a security clearance I'm told regular game stops don't pay nearly as much and you get the added benefit of insurance.
good,"working for Gamestop has been a great experience to say the least, you stay on top of what’s coming soon and New Releases on games and collectibles to pass on information to our customers"
good,When you first start you don't get very good hours. So you have to prove you are worth the time and money during a short period. Once you become a key holder that's when you start getting more hours.
good,"A typical day I'm restocking the shelves, or assisting a customer either find a game they want to play or recommending a game they may of not heard or played before. Management was very kind and willing to work with you. Everyone was extremely nice and inclusive. The hardest part is your on the feet the whole time and I found out that I have a medical condition that made it near impossible to do this. I think its a great first time job."
good,"Fun working environment a place. Be ready to sell though! Previous sales experience could work in your favor big time! It’s definitely a great place to work at if your into games and know a lot."
good,"This was a second job I applied to when I first started at dollar tree. GameStop was my seasonal job. This was another job to work. Talked & helped to customers about games, accessories and electronics."
good,I absolutely loved working for this company you can check out games instead of buy them if you aren't quite certain if you want to get them as a benefit and you get an extra 10% off with your pro player only reason I left is during the slow periods sometimes you're only working 3 hours a week make sure you have another job
good,I like this job because like type  of game at game like  fight game sport game is will be good place to work at  with u like games it't Alaway god to work

good,"One of the best companies that I worked."
good,"Upon taking my job at Gamestop, I had met many interesting customers and workers with many different and unique personalities. They all seemed welcoming and goofy, however, when it came to working, they all buckled down and focused, paying attention to detail and satisfaction of the customers."
good,"Working for Gamestop was and still for me is the best experience i had in customer service. Friendly employees and customers , good hours , and the ability to advance."
good,"I had a really good experience at gamestop the coworkers and my manager was very very awesome "

good,"Molta collaborazione con il pesonale"
good,"This was a wonderful place to work.  Friendly people, and flexible hours so I could continue working while being s full time student and an athlete.  They always encourage upward movement"
good,The big thing I liked about gamestop other then games was the customers. The relationships made with customers was an unforgettable experience that I wouldn't mind building new ones.
good,"My time at GameStop was very enjoyable, from the management down to my coworkers it was an amazing experience. They're very flexible with your schedule and are always willing to work with you in order to help you become better at your job."
good,i loved working at Gamestop because i got to learn new skills and work at a fast paste and i also can say the workers and Managers are all very helpful and caring..
good,"if you're into video games then working at GameStop will be exactly as you imagine it, great times and great conversations with costumers with similar interest to your own."
good,"Inventory items/Process Returns/Maintained employee scheduling needs. Sold Gaming items and Accessories to customers in high volumes with intelligence, proficiency and care. Assist Customers and Sales Representatives with stock items, inventory & questions. "
good,I had a great time working at Gamestop. My managers were amazing and the enviornment was very welcoming and felt like a business family. It really was a self learns you will but I also had wonderful trainers too.
good,Is a job for gamers that love helping customers learn more on the games they would be interested in. I would work there as a full time just to be able to talk about the lastest games.
good,i would help many people find the thing they need and after my job i will give poor people the money and gameStop is ever cool i made alot of friends.
good,Good part time job. Very relaxed and the manager is great. Schedule is flexible. The day pretty much consists of assisting customers and putting items up.
good,"The company is really good and well managed. The only problem that I have is lack of hours, other than that I plan on still working here for as long as I can."
good,"While there were many things to do each day, including shipping as well as price tags, the enjoyment never stopped. Customers would come in and I would help them by getting to know what systems they had and what type of games they played. This allowed me to offer the best games for them. The hardest part of the job is getting people to sign up for the rewards program, because it cost extra money. On the bright side, I was able to share my love of video games with those around me, and the experience was great."
good,This job is amazing. They give you a great discount on games and other tech. I would recommend working here for anyone who is interested in gaming. Pay is not great but it is fair.
good,"Gamestop is great! Especially The Store Manager position. Great culture, great environment. Free games, consoles, and discounts are also great! Develop the right team and you will not fail!"
good,"- Fun"
good,Great first job for some one fresh out of high school.
good,"i love it here, i honestly never want to leave  its so chill and fun and since i like gaming i can better interact with people and learn new things all the time"
good,In all Honesty a great place to work definitely would recommend working here especially if you are perky and nerdy as well you will definitely enjoy this job.
good,they where fun people to work with and very nice. they where like friends to me even tough they where co workers. they where also really funny to be around and the energy was good
good,"Great company. Made me who I am today. Definitely taught me important skills such as delegation, management, stocking, customer care, and selling. A company worth working for"
good,"I enjoyed working at GameStop, the Manager and staff were very understanding and caring."
good,Honestly one of the best jobs I ever had but I had to leave due to me relocating and certain problems I had going on within myself at the moment of me working for the company best job ever.
good,It is a very good job most people think we play games all day but it so much more to it than that. It’s about connecting with gamers from all platforms and making sure they enjoy every bit of it.
good,"a typical day at work, could start slow but pick 'up very quickly. not just with the customer, but internally as well. management is great but if customer care is not taken care of youll notice. the gaming community is great until you meet a confused mother. that be the worst for me at GameStop, other than that, making sure a customer gets the best gaming experiences and knowledge then I'm satisfied."
good,"Not a bad job, and not really a good job either. Turns you into a robot that sells gas, candy, beer and cigarettes. Say the same things over and over again, and perform the same tasks every single day. Suddenly the day is over, you clock out and wait for the check. Simple as that. Wouldn’t rehire me after three years with the company; it had been my first real job. Wouldn’t get a call back at all."
good,"Its a very relaxed job expect on black friday and holidays lol, but the customer service experience was excellent, the training was beneficial. We had awesome benefits and the staff is incredible"
good,"I always had fun working there! It was the best job I’ve had to this day and will totally recommend for anyone! Salary is very good, commission also! Plus you get the fun to test games and toys before selling!"
good,A great place to work with friendly people will to help you anyway you need. My boss is the sweetest person I know. I love working here and always feel listened to.
good,I enjoy helping customers find the right games that fit their personalities and skill levels. A lot of customers are very friendly and they make it easier to help them find what they are looking for.
good,"Posto di lavoro bello per chi è amante di videogame, si lavora per obiettivi di filiare"
good,"It was overall great. I know the Assistant Store Leader and he is the one that recommended that I apply. "
good,I loved working their. I was only seasonal so i was only their a few months but it was fun to go to work everyday. The management was great to me. Always their to help if needed.
good,I enjoyed my time working at game stop because i have a passion for playing video games myself. So it was second nature to recommend or up sale merchandise because of how thrilled i was for the products that would be released.
good,I could open and close the store in under 20 minutes I got extremely good at this job. I got laid off because of a merger happening so they were cutting back on labor.
good,It wasnt a job. More like coming to a second home. Being an avid gamer myself it was always wonderful to come to work and do what i loved. Even talking with the customers was a learning experience with so many aspects of that job.
good,I would get to the store and begin working by helping my fellow colleagues with their workload. It was a very cooperative work environment. Help costumers with their specific needs while offering the store credit card. Help the client with my knowledge in video games.
good,"Typical day at work was fun you made sales, talking to people about video games, I learned how to sell things very well and how to use software. Management was great they taught me a lot. Hardest part was having to rearrange the walls of games after a long day. Most enjoyable part was customer interaction."
good,"Arranged new merchandise with signage and appealing displays that encouraged customer sales and moved overstock items"
good,"I worked at Gamestop for over 4 years and in that time I was promoted from Assistant Store Leader to Store Leader. I loved every aspect of working for this company as there was plenty of room to further my career and I am passionate about gaming. I was salary for the duration of my time with the company however I became pregnant and was out on maternity leave when the company switched from salary to hourly. Although that would not necessary be a huge stress factor, my Assistant Store leader was promoted to Store Leader and transferred to a different location and one of my key holders resigned in my absence as well. My store was left in shambles and upon my return I was advised that I had to figure out how to clean up my store on 40 hours per week and only having  one person a day that did not come in until 6pm to close with me. My team and I made the best of it and restored the cleanliness to the store front."
good,"If your a gamer, I think it's a pretty cool environment to work in. You could talk about the new games coming out with your employers. Having almost the same pros and cons and exploring new things at work together."
good,Very fun workplace. This is a great job to have right out of school. Very fun and laid back. It can be a little stressful but it is worth it if you love video games
good,Never had such a inviting and motivated family at my location and surrounding ones. Always positive and caring about each other. I've worked in retail for years and overall I went through this job was always there for me and welcomed me with warm arms. Discounts are nice and getting extra goodies like promotions items are great also. I've been with GameStop for a couple years and I plan on staying here longer.
good,Great work environment no bad vibes what so ever enjoyed working there everyday working around video games great customers and awesome co workers was exciting really satisfied.
good,Loved working directly with games and people familier in that environment. Can become high stress job during the holiday seasons but worth the benefits
good,awesome place to work if your not looking for hours. the job is pretty easy and overall not to demanding. the people that work there all have like minded interests
good,I loved working there and it was best experience I have ever had and I would recommend my friend to work at that place because it amazing job and u learn really quick
good,"Overall gamestop was good to me, I had a great Dm he helped me thru a lot and was a good mentor to me. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting free trips to see the upcoming new games and consoles."
good,Chat chat chat all day long about games with guest and co-workers. Customer service is on point with us in Lewisburg if you need a game come on down. Prestige store for 4 quarters in a row ask for me and I'll help you out.
good,it was a nice and cleaned place. it was a hard working place. you work fast and have alot of customers. u stocker every thing and take phone calls. u also clean..
good,"GameStop is an Awesome job place, better than any other jobs I had in the past, I wouldn't trade this job for any other job, and is a fun place to have a job"
good,"At gamestop you can learn about being social and working as a team. You learn how to talk to customers and make sale pitches, as well as learning about communication and preperation."
good,"Typical day is pretty busy as I worked during the holiday season, always something to do so it's never boring. It's a job where passion thrives and will help you succeed"
good,I loved my Gamestop. The people there meant the world to me and everyone made it fun to work there. I had a perfect amount of responsibility and got to hang out with and do something I loved.
good,If i had the chance i would work there again. i thank the management for there help when i needed it..................................................
good,"Working at GameStop was an interesting experience. The older staff had the liberty of teaching us newer staff what to do, and what duties and tasks were assigned to us. I'll be honest, I never worked cashier because I was always too scared that I would mess up while speaking to the customers. But my manager supported me and gave me help whenever I was behind the cash register. Overall I liked my time there, and I would recommend everyone work there as their first job."
good,A fun and exciting place to work on a daily basis good management good coworkers fairly easy job close to home and decent paid for the work nice air-conditioned facility
good,"Although they come pretty short on hours until the holiday season, once you start working, you don't want to leave. Even during the busiest times of the year it's always is lighthearted and fun, while also being efficient and on time."
good,As much as i would like to apply here again Gamestop is one of my favorite places that ive ever worked for plus who doesn’t love working with video games
good,They really dont care. You are just another drone pushing items to customers and upselling them. They will take new games off the shelf so they can make the most money with the used games. Kinda shady.
good,"You are able to sell and talk to guests about your favorite games and theirs as well. As long as you go with the flow, it is a fun, productive job.I would highly recommend working here."
good,It was a very fun working environment . everyone got along and worked with one another. It was fast paced but very fun to work there Never stressed cause everyone was laid back and the discounts were the best.
good,"My team is well put together, well managed, and capable. The company itself is very engaged, giving rewards and holding contests for its associates. The only issue is the low pay"
good,Having a great management team leads to having great associates. Better productivity and higher turnover in revenue.   I've noticed that when all these things are firing the possibilities are endless.
good,"Gamestop is a fun place to work in. Depending on the day it can be stressful, but the people there are very helpful and are willing to help if you have a problem and are willing to explain to you how it works."
good,"Working two jobs just got too hard for me, so I gave up Gamestop first cuz I was working less hours there, but was such an amazing company to be part of."
good,My experience here was enjoyable because I helped customers and felt like I was part of a community. The workplace was fun and challenging for myself and I feel like I learned a lot about customer service.
good,"Truly a good place to work, the only downside is the store leaders don't have enough hours to give. I work one day a week for 4 hours which gives me, if I'm lucky, $150 a month. I love the job enough I would love for it to be a full-time career but corporate needs to get their act together."

good,"It's a typical retail job really, you have your regular customers that you either get along with and genuinely enjoy seeing or the ones that you absolutely cannot stand. No matter what an air of professionalism is required, and if you can't handle that then don't apply for any retail job, let alone GameStop. Many people think GameStop employees sit and goof around and that we do nothing but talk about games all day. That is not true, there are a lot of tasks that go on behind the scenes that people won't ever see."

good,"Typical day at work at GameStop involves a lot of operational tasks to start out with.  Preparing for the rest of the day and setting your team up for success.  Guests arrive and it's all about them until closing time.  I learned a lot of time management & humility working for GameStop.  Management had stern expectations of upper management and it was stressful but it pushed me to be a better leader.  Hardest part of the job was being a Store Manager as hourly, really put some restrictions on how much I could get done in a week.  Most enjoyable part of the job were the associates I met and the guests I was able to help."

good,"This job is amazing! Helping people find the games or accessories they love doesn't feel like a job. Overall this is the best job I have had. The only requirement they ask of you is sell memberships and preorders, other than that just give your customers an amazing experience which isn't hard."

good,"It was super fun working there. I loved all my co-workers. They were always ready to be productive and help each other out whenever there was something needed to be done. Normally our day would start out with us just filing games, counting the registers, and dealing with customers via in person or over the phone. Management was great there. They are all so sweet and pushing for success. Hardest part of the job was nonexistent."
good,I worked there while I was still in high school to get some money but they overall experience was great. Friendly coworkers and amazing opportunities.
good,Great place to work great guest interaction. People always asking new question keeps the job fun and exciting. Having the chance to find what people want and not what they need makes every guest a new challenge

good,"worked here for about 4 months and made so many friends working here, learned alot about games and consoles, as well as the art of interacting with angry customers."
good,"This job is great, it's not meant for the average gamer stereotype though.  You have to be able to speak with guests and help them understand what you're selling them.  Don't work here just because you like video games, you have to like people too.  Some guests will be difficult and make dumb remarks about the company, but its pretty great when you find the guests who genuinely want your opinion on games and want to discuss different games that are coming out.  "
good,its great for the time being. i had to leave because with so many employees there wasn't enough hours to go around. i love video games and to be around them and talk with customers who also loved them it was a dream.

good,"A typical day at GameStop was making sure we met our goals for the week and working as a tem to met them. The best part about the job was getting the customers what they wanted for the best price. The goals we had to meet everyday was there to keep us on track and focused. GameStop has given a lot kills, for instance my selling kills has increased since I've been there. Also it has taught me how to talk to people and help them. The hardest thing about the job was learning how to talk to people and knowing what to say and when to say it. The easiest part of the job is when its really busy...I know that sounds weird t say but I usually do really good in fast paced work places. My management at GameStop was incredible! They knew what they were doing and they were great instructors."
good,"Gamestop is a very friendly job that allows for open interaction with guests and co workers alike, you get to talk about games you enjoy playing while also getting paid for it, which for me, has no downside, often times I was recommended very good games by guests and vice versa."
good,Working for GameStop is a rewarding and wonderful experience with a lot of potential for employee growth. The company offers proper training and cultivation of necessary skills to promote advancement from within at a health and stable pace.

good,"learn great customer exprisves. learn how to open the store and close as well."
good,"I absolutely loved this job. It is an amazing environment to work in. Wear a game shirt and black jeans to the interview. It is most appealing.

good,"This job was an amazing experience, the employees are wonderful to be around and work with. I highly recommend working there if you are interested in gaming"

good,If only this store had stayed open I would've been able to go further. But when it closed so did my life as a gamer. It made me really sad to go but then again I wouldn't have to drive so far for a few hours
good,"clock in, ask what needs to be done and if they say nothin, i would do level up which helps me learn the knoweldge for the products in  the store. most fun part of the job was selling"

good,"Whether you are apart of the management crew or are starting out as an entry-level Game Advisor, the work environment is very casual. As someone who has worked for the company for 7 years, GameStop does an outstanding job training it's staff on customer servicing, money transactions, order manipulation, workload delegation, and problem solving. You learn interpersonal skills and communication skills from talking with customers. You also learn how to meet customer needs based on what their issues are. As a Senior Game Advisor, you learn how to work/train team members to achieve both customer satisfaction and store goals on a weekly and daily basis."
good,"Through out the day it was calm. People wanted to buy or trade or sell us game for in store credit or sometimes cash. I also learned how to be more relaxed, wear a smile confidently and show customers a good time. My manager(s) were all very helpful and supporting, I would always give them a 5 star rating. The hardest part of the job would be if someone got upset for a minor mistake that could be easily fixed. With that being said the most enjoyable was the communication I was able to do with the customers and to learn/hear about new games I haven't tried."
good,"Lots of work to constantly be done, so helped with making the hours go by. You get an understanding of how basic retail sales work. As well as an understanding of shipping and receiving, inventory etc."
good,"Would recomend working here honestly i loved it plus renting games was always the best,and the discounts on merch was great too especially the clearence items"
good,"I worked for Game Stop for over 5 years, I only left their employment because we moved to another state.  I loved working for this company, they treat their employees fairly and give a lot of perks."
good,Best job I've ever had. So much fun. Great culture and staff at every location. Everyone is fun and knowledgeable on the products and just love helping each other and others. Great fridge benefits and access to industry info about cool upcoming products. Would recommend to anyone who loves tech or fun.
good,"If you are lucky enough to be able to work here, then you know how much fun it can be. This job was perfect for me due to me being a giant nerd. I miss working there and wish i could go back, but i was only seasonal."
good,A great place to work! I really enjoyed it here. Helping customerswith questions and buying products. Making sure everything was restocked and clean. Opening and closing the store.
good,I enjoyed interacting with customers in this role and had made many great friendships through doing so. I will always reflect on this position with great pride.
good,"Great work environment, great managment, and great community. I have never had so much fun at one job with so many benefits that help me. I love gamestop."
good,working at GameStop was a thrilling job. They helped me grow as an individual and as a employee. The last manager that i had was by far one of the best managers that i had in all my working experience!
good,"So like any kid the dream usually revolves around games, working for Gamestop was awesome and very fun. They are professional but also it isn't a job you wake up to bored with. You meet a lot of new people and friendly faces."
good,"Working with Gamestop has helped me immensely to multitask while working on more than one project. The laid back nature of the company allows associates to feel comfortable as they learn and advance through the ranks. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing someone leave your store with a smile, knowing they received exactly what they wanted, because of you."
good,Was a good experience. Enjoyed it thoroughly. Would recommend this place to anyone trying to make some decent money and get a good advancement in the city life.
good,"I learned a lot about what it takes to work in a GameStop. Needless to say, it's not just selling games and consoles. I myself struggled because I didn't know much about tech and the gaming world these days, but I can say I enjoyed all the people I met there; the guests and specifically all of my co-workers were a great group of people."
good,"Work on the daily is enjoyable, I love my job, hardest is to work your way up, most enjoyable is talking about what I love on the daily, never had problems with the management, loved all my managers so far, I've learned personal patience and how to be responsible with money and open and closing the store (manager duties)"
good,This job was fun and laid back. Worked long hours and didn't see my family much but the paychecks were awesome. The management was helpful but didn't care about its workers as people. Their point system was rediculous.
good,A typical day at Game stop was amazing. I worked with customers in finding the games they liked. I also cleaned up the store and put games back in order.
good,A lot of fun working here learned A lot about gaming and everyone was nice customers where a real joy to be around  everyone is like one big happy family
good,Working there taught me a lot about video games and different consoles that are out. I learned so much just by listening to the conversations that I've had with customers.
good,It was a wonderful experience.  The employees are friendly and the work environment is laid back.  Also the customers are really friendly.  it also had it's perks.
good,I must say it is the most relaxed job I have One place to work for Employees are great very nice people Discounts are good slow at-times but pretty steady
good,"A typical day was pretty relaxing. Every now and again we got rushes of customers. It was a lot of fun helping customers find the perfect video game for them. The management was a lot of fun, and kind."
good,Working at Gamestop gave me the opportunity to work on my personal interaction with guests. This job was a stepping stone in achieving my goals. Without that job i would not have the job i have now
good,"this is by far the best place i have ever worked."
good,"This is a great place to work only if you interest in video games (obviously). Gamers ask very specific question so if you dont have a interest or knowledge in that field, might be a bit stressful at times."
good,"This was a workplace where I got to learn a lot from, not only from those above me but those under me as well. No one ever hesitated to answer questions I had and everyday, before each of us started our shift, we would go over something called the ""daily huddle"". It included going over what needed to be our main focus as people of Gamestop, our focus for the day/week, and roleplaying. It was a very fun experience as being gamers, we would all geek out with each other and get into friendly debates about which game was better."
good,"Gamestop was a great place to work at.  The days were not terribly long, even if you would work from open to close.  The customers were always polite and excited to walk into the store.  They taught me a couple of manager responsibilities, such as closing down the store and making sure the deposit was accurate.  I was responsible for doing counts and making sure our products were all accounted for.  The hardest part of the job would be making sure all of the counts are done and all of the products are accounted for.  The most enjoyable part of the job was simply working there.  Video games and electronics are a hobby of mine, so working in a store that sells these products was very fun.  Managers were always willing to help you out and teach you new things as long as you were willing to learn, which I always was."
good,Gamestop is absolutely a great place to work at if you're into gaming. Time flies by without realizing it because your hanging out with friends and talking about games all day. I would work for gamestop in a heartbeat if the chance came!
good,"GameStop was the best job ive ever had, from the discounts to the launch parties, but my favorite thing would have to be the regulars that come in, they would chill there for hours and make the shift go by very quickly and even help you make some sales. It was a great job but the main flaw is the hours you get, i was hired as a seasonal but they kept me on as a game advisor. Once i was an advisor I got maybe 3 shifts a week, definitley not enough to pay the bills"
good,Good easy job starter job or long term. If you can move up quickly and make manager within a few monthes. Good company for students and people with reatil manager backgrounds
good,"I've worked with Gamestop since November of 2016, and I've never loved a job more. I absolutely love the people that I work with and the customers that come through are absolutely fantastic!"
good,"A typical work day included a clean and inviting store! We made sure every guest was finding the right product for them and then some! We utilized the RSB rating system to make sure each guest was getting the right product for their needs and age! "
good,"Gamestop has an amazing environment. Easy to maintain responsibilities, raises given annually. Perfect for a first job! I would recommend to anyone looking for something to do, also works as a second part time job. Management is great and trains all of their employees to be great at their jobs. Promotions made easily acheivable if wanted. Love love love my job!"
good,"GameStop Helped me grow and interact with my employees. The hardest part is getting a good sales pitch, but you will get the best training ever. I will forever love Gamestop, because it taught me leadership and it has helped me grow even now. They base  themselves off of influence not power. Managers meet with employees every week, and always have easy contact with district managers. Working for gamestop was a great opportunity."
good,Working here was a pleasure as I was really into gamming so it was more like a playground then work and everyone really makes you feel at home and help you in the learning process here I got to see how much people really in gamming solutions in their every day life
good,"I only worked as a seasonal employee, but was constantly in as a customer. staff and management are great. they offered good hours and pay was decent."
good,Learned a lot about sales and cashier very fun workplace fun interaction with customers and also very good co workers and the managers were always eager to help and answer questions.
good,Very fun atmosphere.  Great cliental.  Enjoyed working with and assisting other passionate gamers.  Great work life balance.  General conference was an absolute blast.
good,Every day i took it as if i was learning something new and exploring new ways to help the customer enjoy their time at the store. I enjoyed every day.
good,"My favorite job I ever had, amazing people, atmosphere, and customers. That job gave me a chance to really grow and expand as an employee. Highly recommend."
good,"GameStop Was A Okayy Job It Was A Fast Paste Job & the mangers was Stict with there rules everything needs too be done in a certain way , The Coworkers Was Nice , But GameStop never had a Set Time Too get off"
good,It was very fun and changeling to work at GameStop it had some points that were hard but not impossible and the best staff and atmosphere. I would love to come back and work here.
good,"Wonderful place to work of you're in school as they'll only schedule you part time unless you're a manager. The tedious computer systems really helped advance my knowledge of the P. O. S, Excel and several other systems"
good,Working for Game Stop was very fun and I enjoy it.  Its not the greatest place if it is your only income but as a part time job it is great.  You can rent games and try them before you buy them
good,"There was nothing good about working at gamestop. the management was horrible, the pay was horrible, there was nothing good about working with that company."
good,"work was good, sometimes days where slow. i've learned about about managing my team. good culture with the employees. everything was fairly easy only hard part i would say is when it gets crowed."
good,"as one of my first jobs, GameStop prepared me for the world of sales and customer help. I was trained extensively and properly. I was paid 7.50 and hour and was happy to work there every day."
good,They were a great place to work for while i was younger. yearly conferences and every year we would get a ton of free stuff. Built great customer service skills.
good,"it was honestly the best place ive worked at"
good,"A lot of potential for career growth and expansion. Great employer with focus on personal growth and investing in training employees and management. "
good,so many people complain abut gamestop as a company but compare it to any other company based video game store it is on of the best there is. the people i worked with where all friendly and considerate.
good,Even though I was only a seasonal member. The work was great and I enjoyed my time there. The team was amazing and it helped me get through some tough days. I have learned a lot in the process of dealing with customers which was amazing.
good,if your into video games then this is the job for you. I have lots of fun working there. the customer might get to you but other than that good place to work.
good,"I enjoyed working at Game Stop. The staff was very friendly.If you needed help, they would kindly help you out and not make you look bad in front of customers."
good,Gamestop is a wonderful place to work. Great environment. The pay is low but it is entry level sales and it's retail so you kind of know what to expect already.
good,"I enjoyed working at GameStop. The only thing I did dislike was just being a seasonal hire, and the lack of hours I was getting. Other than that everything was perfect."
good,"When I first started working at Gamestop, I was a nervous wreck from it being my first job. Everyone there was nice and I learned quickly how much I love helping people and making them smile. I got over my nervousness by the next day and gained confidence."
good,Working at Gamestop was one of my favorite jobs ever.  My vast knowledge of video games and the equipment used to play them showed customers that I was a very reliabe source of information.  My coworkers and managers acknowledged my skills and let me know that I was  fantastic worker.
good,Working in a place where you can help other gamers is heaven on earth. But there are some hectic days. For instance Black Friday is one the busiest days out of the year. so many new faces.
good,"Loved helping people find what they were looking for and just being part of the team. i was a lead asst, Manager before going to school. being around video games."
good,I absolutely enjoyed every aspect of the company and their employees! I started as a seasonal employee starting in October ending after December. Highly recommend!
good,I thoroughly working for GameStop. All of the management are wonderful and they are very easy to work for. I really enjoy the customer base and love being part of a great team!
good,learned the value of providing good customer service. Evaluated customer needs and provided them with the products they desired and meet their needs with the best value.
good,"The manager is cool, got good discounts on merchandise. Fun never dull moment, the customers where fun and glad that you were there to help. If couldn't find there always can point to place they could find item."
good,Very laid back job it is not for everyone but for a games it is paradise you get to see all of the new games and product and talk to a lot of other people about what you both like
good,Gamestop was a great place for me to work. Very welcoming saff and i learned a lot about customer service. A typical day is clocking in for work and helping customers immediately with game advise.
good,Gamestop is a good place to work especially as a teen or someone who likes video games. Its a slow paced job and it can become a fast pace job as well depending on the day.
good,"A typical day at Gamestop, would be having to talk about games all day and just have that knowledgement about everything you love to do. Being able to share what you know with customers is a really good feeling, it kinda feels like you aren't working but you really are. Restocking every single item on the floor. As well as having marketing days having to switch every banner or game case cover in one night."
good,"A typical day can consist of constant work which may be overwhelming at times. However,  being surrounded by hard working coworkers made the day manageable . Management showed their appreciation to us daily."
good,"Start of day ,includes morning meeting to find out what the production goal is, and where you are assigned to.  Once that is done , work gets started.  Great workplace, associates are friendly and courteous."
good,At the time I worked there it was only a seasonal position then I was kept on for Part-Time. Cant speak for how it may be now but 3 years ago for a part time job it was pretty enjoyable.
good,I got to work with multiple gaming platforms and some great people. I spent my days talking to customers trying to help them find out what games that might best suite there needs. management was always there to help and find and help out. hardest part is getting to know all the products but the funnest part is the whole job its self.
good,This place is just as fun to work at as much as everyone thinks that it is. There is always something fun for the staff to work towards and there are always opportunities to learn this for employee advancement and/or hobby purposes.
good,At this establishment I learned how to sell subscriptions to clientele. It helped the consumer to find out how to beat stages with there video games. I also learned package and sell video games/ video consoles appropriately for resale. Some were used and some were new. I also organized the store decor.
good,"I really enjoy working here. I love the managers I work with. I really enjoy playing video games myself, so I feel it really helps me be able to connect with the customers."
good,Fun and interesting work environment and very familiar with everything there. Working at GameStop was an enjoyable experience and I would work there in a heart beat.
good,"Un bel luogo di lavoro,sopratutto per chi è appassionato del mondo dei videogiochi"
good,"This is the place to be for the latest and greatest games, as well as the classics. Very chill and helpful staff that exceeds the potential of video game selling."
good,"I was a seasonal rep. I would come in and organize the game wall, I would also greet customers as they arrived. it was laid back and very easy work. I would recommend working here."
good,"I loved this job, co workers where really nice and everyone got along great. It wasn't a hard job and you met some really nice people. Loved all of it"
good,There are a lot of fun people to work with and also fun because I love gaming. I also like the flexible hours and different stores.
good,you get to meet a lot of the loyal customers and talk about the things you are most passionate about throughout your work day. The sales plans aren't competitive which is nice during the slower time of the year.
good,Great place to work and not hard at all. Have to learn how to use a computer at first but all around great place. Everyone will help you out with no problem at all.
good,"As a Seasonal Employee, I learned a lot from the managers working there and they made it a fun environment to work in. I learned how to deal with customers in the retail world and how to push sales."
good,I absolutely loved this Job and didn't want to leave. It helps that I had proper training and a great team. I would absolutely love to work here again and maybe I will.
good,"That was a great place to work. The managers and the other staff were so helpful and polite.Th customers that came into the store were very nice, patient and understanding that i didn't know everything."
good,Working with Game Stop was a great experience.  Great management and team workers.  Would work there again and would recommend others to work there.
good,"I loved it. Welcomed me back anytime. I worked there two consecutive years as a Seasonal Game Advisor, and would go back the first chance I got."
good,Great job for anyone who wants to work with video games. A little low on the pay scale but its a job that will get you the 40 hours that you need. It is one big family that will take care of its own.
good,"I have a blast when I'm at work and there's honestly never a dull moment. If you're a gaming nerd it'll make you happy to have people to talk to that are just as nerdy as you and you can share all the new fun games that you like and suggest them to others. It's also nice to see loyal customers come in and have them know who you are and greet you like a friend. I am a proud employee of this establishment, what more can I say?"
good,The best part of working for GameStop was the variety of customers you get. Video games are bought by every demographic so there is no shortage of unique experiences and it is never boring.
good,"I worked at Game Stop for a year and I never had any complaints except for maybe the lack of hours. I had another job at the time so for me it was almost perfect. good people, good customers, lots of fun working there and a great way to get a refresher on the alpha numeric categorization. the only real thing that needed to be changed and since has was the target number of reservations and membership applications one had to meet every week. Miss too many weeks in a row and you would lose your job."
good,Great Job to work out as a career and even move up in ranks to get promoted easily and make good paying money also employee benefites are a plus more than minus
good,I learned that there were more Game stop stores all over the world. All the new games that came out and the equipment that came with it. The new game systems we got to play.
good,Very open minded staff. The manager is very understanding and fair to everyone. Working there helps with customers service. I would say having customers sign up for pro cards would be the hardest part. Working with such a versatile group and a new wave of customers daily would have to be the best part.
good,"Fun and productive customer service type job. Keep up to date with the latest gaming technology and information! Typical days at work are spent with enjoyable management and co-workers, driving dales."
good,great place to start off if you're young and willing to work the small hours they give you for the experience they provide .
good,I really liked it I would defenitely go back to this place.                                                 Great benefits they always want to make people part of the company so that t is defenitely a plus
good,"To have a job experience working for gamestop, and to get to know my co-workers, I want to enjoy to help people find what they need, the hardest is that I can handle it."
good,Fast pace job where you meet a lot of people.  Chance to shine and show what you can do. Work  is based on customer service first.   Task may vary and keep you busy. Helping people find what they want and need is a great part of this job.
good,My time at every company I've had the pleasure of working has always been a learning experience. Good or bad the lessons I've learned have been valuable to my growth and development. every step or misstep is conducive to shaping me as a model employee.
good,its a great working environment and i loved working there. it was truly amazing.i had a lot of duties which made me enjoy my day even more because it always kept me busy.
good,"The work staff was very friendly, the hours weren't so great but the experience was worth it, clean environment, and interacting with customers was easy."
good,"I loved working at gamestop, it was fun and the other employees and managers were great to work with and were all really nice and great to customers."
good,For the most part a day will go quick at the start when there are a lot of people coming in. There is also a lot to do involving sorting games and stocking shelves. Customer relationships are key and being good to your customers is always a plus.
good,"From when I started to work there to when I left it change my life. I became an experience speaker. I had a great time working with my team and helping my team reach our goals each week. The key to our success is working together as a family and getting things done in time. A difficult time would be not reaching goals, like for example, getting each customer to upgrade to a pro membership. Even if that day was slow the next day can be better by learning from what you can change speaking with the next customer. The most enjoyable part of working at GameStop was seeing each customer smiling and excited to play their new game, purchasing their item to show it off with their friends and family."
good,"It's a really great place to work if you are a gamer at heart. My one issue is they over hired, so I didn't get as many hours as I would have liked. Other than that the environment is amazing."
good,The job itself is a lot of fun. It is nights and weekends so you need to think about that before applying. Some holidays shifts as well.
good,Very nice and friendly people.. Love the gaming knowlage there cause im a gamer myself. Had fun working there would go back and work there again. Recomend to any gamer for work place
good,Gamestop gives you a lot of freedom to take care of your guest without having to worry about getting in trouble. They promote ownership with there management staff and teach you closing how to follow your P&L.
good,"Of every job I have worked since I was 16 years old, this is by far the most fun. I'm lucky to say I was hired on and trained by an amazing staff. I enjoyed working with our patrons and getting to know them. My boss is easy to talk to and is very patient with all of his employees. The store was always kept clean and organized, which made the work environment more comfortable."
good,"Fun job, alot of videogames and helping cutstomers. Alot of standing and greeting customers. Good pay but sometimes boring. Teaches you to socialize with people and help people find games that would best suit them."
good,"Great Job for developing skills and ambitions in sales, while also remaining a fun and supporting career choice. Great coworkers, great customers, awesome management and corporate involvement and recognition."
good,I love working for a company that actually cares enough for the customer to want to offer retention tools as well as benefits to the customer.
good,"Probably one of the best places I have the pleasure of working at."
good,"i have nothing bad to say about gamestop. i loved the people, environment and how it was run. i never had a problem working there and believe i never will."
good,"loved working for game stop, I was just ready for advancement not part time work . I liked that they were willing to give you more hours if needed,"
good,A wonderful place to work. The staff and managers were great. The best part of the job was the everyday interactions with the customers.
good,Love how all the employees got along how we respected each other how we use to compete with other game stops how we use to help the kids love when we had early release parties
good,"talk to customers and always room for advancement. competitive work environment for extra stuff. great atmosphere, fun environment, great staff, good hours, run register."
good,"I loved working here, the management staff were very good to the employees and were always fair. All the other staff were awesome as well."
good,I loved working at Game-stop. The customers were always incredibly nice and fun to talk to. I enjoyed my co-workers as well they were always relaxed and fun to talk to. It was very easy to come in with a positive attitude
good,"A typical day at GameStop was always fun and exciting, especially to someone like me that was eager to know and understand the field of the gaming industry and how it pertained to the overall culture and career markets.  I learned quite a lot while I was with this company for 4 years, I learned that there are people who will live above and beyond their means just to obtain the latest and greatest videogame software and hardware.  I also learned that being an advisor you can have great influence on those people who want the latest and greatest too, especially when it comes to informing customers about the ratings on videogames and how they can help in the decision making process about what games are good for their children to engage in.  The Management and my co-workers played a big part in helping me to speak to customers about their products and how to assist them in their decision making process about those same products.  The hardest part of this job was learning about the gaming industry and the billion dollar business that it is, the most enjoyable part of this job was sampling the games for the customers to view."
good,Love everything about working there it was a dream job. Very professional & great company with nice employees. Great work place helpful & knowledgeable of there products.
good,best time i had at a job..learned alot about being a manager and got great skills and had amazing bosses to look up to and taught me alot loved being around video games all the time
good,"Friendly faces that welcome you at the door. "
good,"Its a great way to interact with people from different backgrounds, learn basic accounting skills and inventory process."
good,Was very simple and it was basically my favorite work environment i just wish it wasn't seasonal. I enjoyed all the customers who came in and i loved walking around and helping people. It was very laid back on certain days but thanks to the holidays the line was out the door.
good,"Great Place for a ""First Job"". Learned alot met alot of people that helped me grow as a person and an employee. Good communication can go a long way at this job. Gamers are welcome too."
good,"Between the other associates and the management team, this was my favorite job. They make you fee so loved and comfortable that you become a family. They are irreplacable in my life."
good,i loved everything about Gamestop it was by far my fav job i loved my mangers and my district manger it didnt take me long to excel and move up i was also number one ASM every month or 4 months stright or o and got awards
good,very fast and friendly environment. The days are pretty steady. Its not a goal oriented job either . over all i enjoyed my time working there.
good,"Started off as seasonal during the holidays, was eager to learn and showed my potential. A few months later I was hired on as a game advisor, loved learning something new every day. The customers are great, and enjoy celebrating about games along with making sure sales goals are being met. Once I was promoted I had to take leadership and help guide my team into the right direction. Loved the competition within my store and stores in the district."
good,Working for GameStop is a very rewarding experience. A normal day is talking with everyone that comes in about videogames and helping co-workers stay up to date on what's new and what has gotten updates. I have really been enjoying working for the company. I have learned not to let someone get under my skin and to always be nice no matter what I have going on in my personal life.
good,"You have yo have a thick skin to work in retail, especially being a female in a video game store . It is always your fault when something goes wrong and you have to figure out solutions that help both business and customer. I love the solution selling aspect of the job and I highly suggest working for the company ."
good,Gamestop is a place where you can help customer decide whats the best game not only in price but also on knowledge. Always looking to improve sale and customer service. Updates and Marketing is always changing so we have to keep an eye to be up to date. Very relaxing place.
good,"I've learned not only about the new video games and technology, but also how to become a better employee, sales person, and leader. The hardest part of the job is just trying to do everything alone. Once you have help, it's great! I enjoy the customers the most. You meet some great people who walk through those doors."
good,GameStop is a great job for those who are knowledgeable in gaming and have an outgoing personality. I was constantly talking to customers about games for all ages and preferences. Loved being able to socialize about games my entire day.
good,"Everything about this job was enjoyable."
good,"Sell video games."
good,"Typical day was I would stock shelves, put games away, help customers. I learned how to better my people skills and what was the best way to handle things under pressure. I loved coming in on my days off, just to help my team out."
good,Fun work place with many perks and nice co workers was allowed to play used games every once and while nice employee discounts. Co-workers were friendly.
good,"Game Stop is a fun company for gamers to work. Meeting other gamers, whether they are co-workers or  ustomers. GameStop encourages product knowledge, so they allow employees fo bring games home to try them out for a couple days. Overall, fun and fair place of employment that cares about its employees."
good,"Gamestop is a very intense and a place were you have to be energetic. Always asking the customer if they need helping looking for a game or an accessory. Gamestop does get very busy when you least expect it to, so you really have to be on your toes. The atmosphere was great at Gamestop. Even tho I don't work there anymore I still have some customers that I have served to come up to me and ask about what is going on and just friendly conversations."
good,I have loved working for gamestop for the last two years. Being able to transfer due to moving was something that i loved that i could do. I have been very happy with the company
good,"This was by far the best job I have ever had. There were obviously the ups and downs with the company, but the job was very enjoyable in any aspect. "
good,they did everything that was required of a workplace with an excellent atmosphere and ecosystem! would definitely reccommend it to a friend
good,I would clock in and begin to fix the wall of video games. If customers came in I would go to them and help them the best of my ability. When they where done shopping I would ring them up and give them information on newly released games. I cleaned the store and counted my register at the end of the night.
good,Started the day with conference calls . Learned a lot about cricket phones and plans. We had to sell 5 phones per employee  for the whole month. There was never a dull moment.
good,"Had fun ! Energetic everyday with my co-workers ! Learned a lot about management. Counting the tills, safe . Customer service had to be our main priority"
good,The store was pretty small. I would suggest you work there if you like to play games. on gaming systems. Around the time it was fast paste because of Christmas.
good,My first job I learned a lot about retail. The work place was great made new friends. Completed all tasks and beat goals each week. It was very enjoyable.
good,"Loved the people, customers, and the environment there. I just got laid off due to not enough hours per employee."
good,It was a nice place to work. Very clean and professional. Customers were nice and I enjoyed helping pick out outfits. Helping customers was a blast. My second favortite job
good,"Gamestop/Funcoland was the first job I got that I was able to move from store clerk to store manager. I typical work day included receiving packages before the store opened and inventorying the items received and setting them up for sale. Then opening the store and selling the product that had been received. Within one year of starting this job as a part time clerk that just sold games, I move to assist manager, and then manager of the store. I helped the company transition from Funcoland, when I started, to Gamestop (when Funcoland was bought out by Barnes and Noble books). This transition included inventorying all games and equipment at the store. Setting up new store protocols, and working for an entirely new parent company. The transition under my management when smoothly and was completed with no issues. As manager my duties included hiring of new staff, setting up the schedule for staff for the week. Internal book keeping of all games and equipment in the store, and conducting quarterly reviews of staff and inventory of the store. My co-workers were my biggest asset as I hired all but one worker who stayed on during the Funcoland/Gamestop transition. I had no theft issues at my store, and we consistently hit our projected sales goals that the parent company set for my store. The hardest part of the job was having to let seasonal help go as they would otfen become friends, and all were excellent workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to try out new games before they hit the shelves for sale, and having product reps stop by and show me and my staff new"

good,"greet guest"
good,"I always received a great review every year."
good,"From the minute I was hired, even before than actually, I was treated with such dignity and respect, it blows my mind how kind and appreciative my coworkers and supervisor are. They always thanked me and always greeted me. I don't think I've ever seen such a level of appreciation come from a company. I learned how important it is to be efficient and pleasant. The hardest part of the job was probably the amount of effort and knowledge you had to put into upselling things such as GPGs and PRPs. It's typically pretty slow in the day time, but gets really busy at night time. A lot of go backs and organizing is needed to be done as well as filing, so if you're not typically and organized person, I wouldn't recommend working here."
good,"I loved this job. Sadly, i was only seasonal. Not only did i learn how to talk to customers and sell different products, i learned how to work the cash register."
good,Gamestop was one of the most fun places I have ever worked. The people are unique and the environment is always fun. I have made friends there that I still stay in contact with even 3 years later. Not to mention you get to check out any game you want in the store!
good,"It was a fun experience, even working late nights was enjoyable. The supervisor was amazing with organization and communication. Most of the time I worked, everything was fast paced but it ran smoothly. I am glad I worked at GameStop for my first retail experience."

good,"During the day, I worked on the store floor, engaging customers with their needs and helping them find what they were looking for. The hardest part of the job was seeing preference with other employees. The most enjoyable part was being able to communicate with customers, their needs and help them."
good,"I would work various hours at the Game Stop I worked at. but I know that anytime I came into work there was always a steady flow of people. we were always busy but I loved it. people with all similar interests as me coming to me for help to find videogames, videogame merchandise, and other various things game stop has to offer, including information on up coming games. by far my favorite job. now game stop didn't teach me much I didn't already know about sales or videogames, but it did make me better at it. and "

good,Great place to work- Management is great and very accommodating to your personal schedule. Because a lot of the customers were international foreigners I got a chance practice Spanish.
good,"GameStop was for me just a part time job on the side from another job while I was in High school. I mostly worked seasonal for 3 years straight, it was nice to have extra income around the holidays."
good,"> A typical day at work was advertising and informing customers about sales and merchandise questions or needs"
good,"Typical day at work is amazing! I work with coworkers that communicate and are always staying productive. Management always have a ""Game plan"" of store tactics, strategies and critique on sales, services and cleanliness. We work together as a team to complete tasks! The best part about the jobs is talking about video games with coworkers and customers."
good,"Learned many security procedures such as camera monitoring, reviewing, and pat down procedures. Improved customer service and conflict management and resolutions. Great Job for those who will follow and follow up on what is requested."
good,"It was a fun experience and I worked here as part of a program to get high school credits, I had a great time with my very first job experience."
good,collaborazione con i colleghi durante l'orario e ottimo rapporto con il responsabile
good,"A lot of easy interaction with customers and friendly and at-ease environment, management was wonderful as ever and same for the co-workers! Hardest part of job was doing trade in sometimes, most enjoyable part of job was about everything. Learned how to advertise additional products to customers, issue warranties for products and settle returns."
good,"It was a fairly easy job, nothing too complicated. The employees were all nice. Hardest part was when the computers were not working. I enjoyed the discount I had."
good,fun place to work. Nice people. Good work environment. Good management. Not enough hours given. I would recommend working there.
good,Gamestop was a new kind of job for me coming out of the food industry. It was exciting and different and provided me with a lot of new job experience
good,GameStop was a fun working place with great management and very friendly hard working workers. the most enjoyable part of my job was being surrounded by video games and people that loved the same stuff i did. The worst part about my job was not working as much as i wanted.

I get along with everyone I work with. There is no hard part about this job, it is very laid back and fun. I enjoy Game Stop all around."
good,Great company lead by some of the best executives that retail has to offer.  They truly believe in where they are going and what they are doing. I would recommend anyone getting into retail looking for a place to start your leadership training to start here.

good,great part time job just need way more hours and way better pay for the amount of bills i have at the moment or else the job would be amazing.
good,"GameStop was a great place to learn about myself and grow. I started as a Sales Associate getting 4 hours a week and worked my way up to Assistant Store Manager within 10 months. A small staff allowed us to have a close relationship with each other. Our goals were clear and I was allowed to provide on the spot coaching."
good,Working in a gaming store is quite a thrill especially with the best supportive management staff. The task we were given were not very difficult and easy to complete.
good,"Loyalty. You talk about protecting the family yet your stores are a revolving door of employees. Give more payroll to stores. You guys took that first step adding double coverage to all stores making 2+ million. Adding this to some stores in the tier below may be a financial risk but will give your store the ability to service the customers and leave lasting impressions and attract new ones. Advancement opportunities.Moving up through to Store Manager is possible but anything above is a glass ceiling that can't be touched."
good,Game stop is by far my all time favorite job. Selling games for a living may have not been enough but doing it because I loved it was always great. Management and even my co workers were always so helpful and kind to me.
good,Working at GameStop was a great place for me to learn how to work with a team and how to work on a computer.  The hours were not too bad and the days worked were always fun and full of new skills for me to learn on the job.
good,it's a great place to work at. I basically help people with video games and also help set up posters and standees for new games. My co-workers are like family and my manager is the nicest guy ever.

good,I absoulty loved my job at Game Stop and i was amazing at it i just wanted to help people in a better way than showing them what game to buy. The hardest part of this job was clocking out for me if i could i would have worked a 12 everyday. The best part of this job was dealing with people and the problems they would run into on a daily.
good,"Coming into GameStop, I had absolutely no clue where I stood or what I was dealing with. I never played video games before or dealt with software related events. My manager knowing that still took me in and showed me the ropes with patience and kindness. It became second nature to me and in such little time. I honestly love a work place where I can gain new information and explore beyond comfortable boundaries. Besides my personal experience the company is great and I will always give them a thumbs up."
good,"Gamestop is a great environment with loving co-worker, best customers ever.! Getting to know new people everyday or talking to gamers that come in all the time. Its a great job. The only hard part of gamestop is that when i didnt know about a game i tryed my hardest to give a littel information about the game by looking at the title."

good,The Gamestop I worked at was a great place to work the staff and management team where all great to work for a customers where easy to handle even when they were a hand full.
good,A typical day would be greeting customers as they walk in giving them flyers and explaining verbally as well any questions that the customers had about merchandise or Gamestop credit cards and doing go-backs. Your co-workers are very humble intelligent easy going polite and professional and willing to help you if you have any concerns or questions. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult people but the enjoyable part is having co-workers that you feel comfortable working with.
good,This was a seasonal job. As a Game Advisor you must be a cash register and still have to help advice customers in what game he or she will like if they cannot decide on a game.
good,I enjoyed working at GameStop. I enjoyed the work that I did and the people I worked with. I learned a lot about Rent Payables.

good,"Working at GameStop was my dream job. Everything was great; the environment, the people, the atmosphere. My supervisors were nice, they were also understanding and reliable. I learned how to edal with a variaty of people. My co-workers were always fun and supportive."
good,"I was a store manager for over five years. Loved my team and my management. However it is so hard to move up in this company due to the size and also the loyalty from their employees. There was never a job opening and I was past being trained to be the DM. It was a waiting game, but unfortunately to long. I had to leave and find a career somewhere else"
good,"It is a great environment to work in, with good pay and health benefits along with great employee discounts."
good,Overall GameStop was a good company to work for. I learned a lot about selling and marketing while also learning how to communicate with customers and educate them. The hardest part of the job was definitely meeting sale goals. I really enjoyed showing customers new products.
good,always a chance to advance and learn more as long as you are open to learn and take every task thrown your way. great company to work for.
good,"Both Staff and children are great, these people do care about the children and there futur. No better place to send your kids or to work there as well."
good,Good place to work but very few hours for a seasonal job. but it is nice to be surrounded by those just like you who are a fan of video games

good,"Wonderful workplace, would recommend to anyone who enjoys working with guests in a fast paced environment. I learned a lot about maintaining a store and handling not only customers, but the things behind the scenes in liaison with the manager."
good,I enjoyed working here however I feel a lot of that attributed to the customers you will see and the people you work with directly. This job more-so than others.
good,"I loved coming to work at Game Stop. Given it was my first job working for someone else other than myself. I was able to learn so many things as far as what it took to run an entertainment company in a retail setting. Being someone who frequently enjoys playing a video game I found that Game Stop was a perfect match. I enjoyed working with my coworkers, with whom we would share new strategies on how to get to the next level, personal opinions of a game coming out or just came out. One of the hardest parts was trying to inform a customer that  he/she was unable to return an item that was bought from another Game Stop to the one at the mall and get his/ her full money back. Or why the product lost value once it left the store by using examples like driving a car off the lot after it's been bought. A typical day at work could be anything from your basic hum-drum day to preparing for a midnight opening for the newest game, to trying to make sure that the weekly amount of hours are distributed fairly."
good,"I was there during the launch of the PS4 and Xbox One. It was so exciting to see customers come in and pick up their next gen systems. My daily actives would be stocking, inventory, sales, and customer service. I would educate customers on hardware and software. My goal was to make sure every customer found the right game that best suited their needs."
good,game stop is a fun and exciting place to work and learn about games and accessories they treat you fair and its just a fun place
good,"At Gamestop, I worked on the sales floor and gained a management position withing my first year and a half of employment at eighteen years old. I learned about sales,how Gamestop as a company operates, and some marketing strategies that game companies use. My manager Dan Merzke set  great example for myself and other employees and became a good friend of mine and still is. The work environment was the greatest and was made so by the people I worked with. I learned about customer engagement and how to communicate better with them. The hardest part of the job was taking on the management position at such a young age. Dan helped me become a better leader and gave me confidence that I can handle management positions in the future.I enjoyed my work environment, being around a hobby the enjoyed when I was younger."
good,Its a great place to work. The management is very supportive and professional. My co-workers are helpful. The pay is on the low side.
good,"During my hours in GameStop it would usually be very busy but with a close manager and very outgoing environment, time flew by and made my experience with customer service very enjoyable. Plus, I was surrounded by consoles and games which honestly made me more enthusiastic during work hours. Everything that surrounded me was exciting."
good,"amazing service, I would recommend this to anyone currently seeking employment. I hope it can help me in the near future"

good,"My day included selling and talking about my favorite things in the world."
good,I was very happy here. This employer was very nice and accommodating. You had set hours to work which where business hours. You also had set days off. The compensations was on point for the job requirements. You also were given huge discounts on storage and truck rentals.
good,if you love dealing with customers on a one on one interaction then this is the job for you i really loved my customers and will miss helping them selling was fun and being able to solve problems was enjoyable task for myself
good,"fun place to work: co-workers are great, hours can be unpredictable especially with certain districts, difficult keeping up with certain marketing deals"
good,"Working for GameStop is never a dull day. It's fun to be around people with the same interest as you. The only down side that I have come across is not getting enough hours and depending on the area that you are located, you will get really slow days."
good,Favorite place to go always smiles and laughter in there. also got almost ever game u will need and accessories that are good or gaming with is good to have
good,Honestly one of the best jobs I've had. The entire staff is wonderful. They where all friendly and treated me just like one of their own. Wish i could have stayed longer
good,I really enjoyed working for this company it was fun and i met some really nice people there too and the supervisors were nice and the leads were nice as well
good,If you love video games you will surely love to work here. Well organized and friendly staff and great customers. Decent benefits but amazing for a part time job
good,"Showing customers the deals we currently have, whats on sale and helping them find what they are looking for. Co workers are usually gamers and can assist me in things that I am not to sure of. The hardest part of the day is when i have to leave because i love my job."
good,"Everyday I walked into GameStop it was with a smile. Whatever your shift, you started the same way unless you were told otherwise. As soon as you come in you organize the game cases and make sure customers are ok and have been helped. I learned making someone smile just a little can really brighten their day. I learned how to push sales and product and how to handle a cash register. The hardest part for me would be learning the codes to all the categories. The most enjoyable part of this job would be the open atmosphere. Everyone was friendly and loved to joke around with each other."

good,"I used to work here when i was sixteen, this was my first job ever. "
good,"Loved the experience at Gamestop, the best job I've ever had, most fun time, and the best employees, and boss ever. The staff, and even the District manager was great, everyone smiles and come to work knowing they love their job."
good,"Every day we were expected to make sales, to keep the store clean and tidy, and most importantly to accommodate to the customers every need and also suggest other products that may help them have a better gaming experience. I learned how to effectively make sales and also to hone in on my customer service skills. The management at GameStop was the best that I've had out of all my jobs. I felt very comfortable and had a very good time making sales and doing so in a competitive environment. The hardest part of the job was during black friday, because of the fact that we had so many people rushing in and out. Although it was hard, it was fun for all of us because working under pressure is where I find that I thrive the most. The most enjoyable part of this job was helping customers and making sure that they left the store very pleased and with exactly what they wanted, and sometimes with more."
good,"I was hired in seasonally and was able to advance to management in a year. I learned valuable cash handling experience and inventory management. My coworkers were amazing and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was during the holiday rush, but it boosted my customer service experience as well."
good,"Love the job and the people, including the customers. Never once did I dread coming into work. Always looked forward to the midnight releases and helping out the customers who needed help. Especially to the customers who weren't to familiar with gaming."
good,Loved the job co workers are friendly. Really enjoy meeting new costumers.
good,"Great workplace! have great coworkers and customers. Located on mansell road in alpharetta ga. Good location, great manager, good hours, there's nothing hard about this job, I enjoy renting the games both new and used."

good,"Game Stop the largest retailer for game is a change of pace come pared to many retailer. Game stop has a very interesting system for growth and opportunity, they promote from with in. Management is stern but they provide a great leadership role for growth not only in the company but as a person as well. Many of co-worker their are just as ambitious as any place else you would find them, some are aggressive other are laid back, some approach a take better than other. The hardest part of my job was the customer at time, the customer is always right, people are hard when it come to a simple mistake. what i did like about game stop was the opportunity to learn about the gaming world and how it is constantly growing, even the company a whole learning about it growth and being apart of it was what made it so exciting to work."
good,was fun working here. the training was good and met alot of new people here.
good,"Games are fun so it is obvious that working in an area were talking, learning, and explaining the benefits of owning a game is amazing.You get to learn about the latest games and tech used to play said games, also a conversation about there development can come in to play. Also if you like selling your self you have to sell the credit and gamestop cards aswell."
good,"Gamestop provided a lot of opportunities to advance my sales and public contact skills.  One of the biggest things about gamestop are reservations and although you only have to put five dollars down, it was a challenge at time because you have to know who to pitch certain games to,  what about the game is going to interest the customer, and how you think they will enjoy the game.  Most of that comes for engaging the customer and asking certain target questions in order to better understand the customers wants and need for any game that you are pitching."

good,Ambiente lavorativo stimolante e ottimo rapporto con I colleghi di lavoro.

good,"easy work if you love games."
good,"I work the register, greet customers, help them on the sales floor, and complete transactions while up-selling key products. The management and co-workers are friendly, helpful, and dedicated to their work. They help whenever they can, teach me what I need to make the customer happy, as well as getting the customer the best deal in order to ensure that they come back. The only trouble I have is learning the different search methods to complete transactions faster. I fine the most joy I do have is when I get to interact with the customers face to face and help them get what they came for and more."
good,"Loved working here, everyone was friendly, and it was a very competitive job."
good,I have worked at gamestop for 3 years now under the same manager and have never had any problems. you learn day by day on how to become a better person and effectively take care of customers better.
good,Great atmosphere with great co-workers and customers.  I mean it's video games!  What's not to love?!!
good,Gamestop is a great place to work! I would however recommend getting a second job because the hours are not what you would expect if you pay rent or mortgage. If you live at home with parents and you have very few bills then it's a great job to keep as a primary.
good,"- Great coworkers"

good,"I never would have left this job if it wasn't seasonal only!!"
good,A typical day at work Is really fun and easy. I go throughout the day alphabetizing walls. I learn how to re-stock walls and bins for the games and accessories. My management Is very helpful whenever I need them to be. My co-workers are very efficient and very helpful as well. The hardest part of my job Is closing. Sometimes customers are still there while closing and It takes longer to get ready. The most enjoyable part of my job Is knowing customers are happy and satisfied when they leave GameStop.

My co-workers were very engaging and fun to communicate with because everyone had a central topic on the daily basis. The were very professional and humorous.

The management is very flexible and relaxed while still being focused. My co-workers have become my friends and we like to talk outside of work and even play the new releases together if there is a multiplayer option. The hardest part of the job was learning to work with some upset or difficult customers since this was my first retail job. The most enjoyable part in my opinion was working with a genre of entertainment I enjoy which is video games. I also met a lot of great people and have forged business relationships with some of our regular customers."
