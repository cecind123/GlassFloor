rating,review
bad,"Terrible management. Only advance the people they attend church with. Constant layoffs and lies from managers. Long stressful hours...no wonder they are closing this office, but it won't improve when they move into the CMT building downtown"
bad,"12 years, laid off due to poor company management. no loyalty to the working staff. anyone that is promoted is a friend or a friend of a friend. the regular staff at Viacom is perfectly fine, great people."
bad,Went out of business with the video rental industry.  I moved to Kentucky when I noticed how the industry was changing.  Was a fun job while it lasted.
bad,"As a employee of Viacom Group, I have had the chance to develop my self in a exciting work environment, on my role as controller and "
bad,This company does not develop its employees. Management and employees are unprofessional. The gossip and politics are synonymous to high school. Work/life balance is non existent. Employees often work very long hours due to poor systems and management ignorance to issues in the work place.
bad,"Lacks creativity, very internally political and high up management is delusional . Overall brain drain there aren't that many smart people. People go into their office everyday and just waste time or waste time with internal meetings trying to justify their jobs."
bad,"My experience here was not good. I'm sure management does not listen to advice given, my experience was that they did not listen to any I offered. The Politics here are ALL CONSUMING."
bad,"The organization that I was in, a central technology group, was more focused on political gamesmanship and growing individual fiefdom's instead of accomplishing actual work. This is largely due to the matrix managed structure where there is no common accountability across the group."
bad,Horrible working experience. Worst I have ever head in my life. Worst manager I have ever had that is absolutely out of control and verbally emotionally abusive to the subordinates.
bad,"Boring work, boring people. Freelanced and was let go after missing 3 days of work because of having a miscarriage. Really and truly a horrible place to work."
bad,Not sure what to say here.  Viacom dba Blockbuster went out of business years ago.  Not sure a review of a company that has closed its doors is relevant.
bad,Outbound calling center offering cable services and upgraded premium channels to new and current customers. Expected to hit daily goals. Professional dress code required.
bad,"I was there for 18 years and I've seen all sorts or questionable practices going on there. There is virtually no room for advancement and no one really appreciates the time and effort you put into doing your job, they will tell you that they do but it doesn't show in compensation. There are so many projects to complete but most of them are under funded and have ridiculous deadlines. I would not advise anyone to work there, believe me, I was there a long time so I know the truth."
bad,The management culture at Viacom was very abusive.  The compensation and benefits were awesome.
bad,"This is for the former digital department at Nickelodeon."
bad,lax  corporate environment. advancement based on your management and low pay. not competitive at all. you can work there for years and not get promoted at all.
bad,An interesting place to work: Good employees and benefits but very political and difficult to advance. It can be a struggle to survive the multiple rounds of lay offs.
bad,"Check emails, check the queue, data entry, amend records, setup orders for pickups.I have learned how to write emails and improve customer service management is a little flaky a lot of nepotism and bad ethics as far as moving up within the department/company. My co-workers are friendly and nice and fun to talk and work with. There is really nothing difficult or challenging about this job anyone can do this job. The enjoyable part about this job is when my shift ends."
bad,"My internship at Viacom was poorly structured and run. I was basically given all the work my ""internship manager"" didn't want to do. The social activities were poorly executed (think of quaker oat bars as the snack) and there was minimal mentorship from actual managers."
bad,"Good Place to work, very corporate, takes a while for decisions to be made because of the amount of people involved in the process. Not technologically advanced."
bad,"Viacom is not a great place to work, but it has good people in jr positions. The pay is not competitive, so there is no incentive to stay. Viacom needs to position itself as a great place to work and get rid of old people in the exec seats."
bad,"Viacom has a history of being a great and innovative place to work.  While that may be true going back to the mid 90's and early 2000s, in my experience it was no different than any other large me"
bad,"I enjoy working here, but wish there were more opportunities for growth. I have been with Viacom for almost four years now and still feel like I am waiting on career growth."
bad,"With so many reorganizations happening, managers and team leaders do not prioritize members of their team by laying out concrete career paths or opportunities for growth."
bad,"Viacom is a great place for someone just starting out in their career to gain some experience in their preferred field, but in order to move up you, need to leave the company, gain outside experience, and then come back."
bad,"Handled all inbound phone calls to the company. Helped out the sales team with mail, filing, typing, phone messages."
bad,"As an intern, I did not have much to do and my boss did not help much or communicate well. Another co-worker was kind enough to try to teach me some useful skills."
bad,"Hard to move up the chain and transfer to another area with in the company. Also, pay is very low considering the amount of work you are asked to do. ."
bad,"BET Network was recently bought out by Viacom and since August 2012 my work environment has changed in a nasty way. Upper management suck at communication, pass judgement off of hear-say, implement new things without testing first and they way they talk to you is very disrespectful. Overall I love what I do but it the new people and company that I work with who does not try to make an effort at anything honestly."
bad,I Interned for this company for about 5 months.
bad,"They keep their costs low by hiring good but very inexpetienced people. Because its cheap they home grow everything. Thus ending up with unfocused apps with no targeted goals."
bad,"Limited upside potential and poor career advancement support.  Strategy under redefinition, financial performance under pressure.  HR support for career advancement is limited.  Compensation is at market level and other non-monetary benefits are good."
bad,Best part of working for that company was the compensation.
bad,"I couldn't have asked to work alongside a more supportive team, there is just no room for growth and no promise for a staff position or health benefits."
bad,Minimal automation. Your ideas will not be entertained. Old technologies are user. Process oriented. Micro management. Not best for production support jobs.
bad,Viacom favors freelance over full-time. Very outdated on all things. If you are looking for old school broadcast linear- this is your place. I was managed terribly and was severely underpaid. ( I'm talking like max 50 k with a masters after 3 years there.
bad,"Viacom should have been a great place to work.  It did have a great and relaxed culture, busy-pace, and fun events.  However, it wasn't enough to overshadow how their operational strategies negatively affected their employees."
bad,"Its Never A Dull Moment At Viacom, Very Diverse And Busy. Somedays Maybe Harder Than Others When It Comes to Dealing With Management And Pleasing Clients."
good,"Viacom has many perks and positives as a workplace. However, there is a constant fear of layoffs hanging like the sword of Damocles over all of the Viacom employees. Constant layoffs and a lack of clear communication from the higher ups, make Viacom a difficult place to work as employees are constantly obsessed with being laid off."
good,"What you don't make in pay/benefits/advancement, they ""make up for"" in engagement activities.  It's a company in flux and you feel your job is in danger at all times."
good,"This company was once a fun, collaborative work place with great incentives and helpful HR."
good,"Viacom is a fun place to work, but it is plagued by bad managers that have been around for decades.  Viacom needs to take management training seriously and require all people mangers to take management training courses."
good,"Kreatív, nemzetközi munkakörnyezet, 2014- év design irodája. Angol munkanyelv"
good,"No work life balance, back stabbing is a norm. Poor managers."
good,"I was a contract freelancer so I was only at Viacom for less than two months. I was brought in to work on a project so I was spared the politics of navigating their structure. "
good,"I was hired for 3 years full time but project based no benefits, then that project ended and found another position within the company months later, that one ended after 4 months. Met and worked with great people but viacom really does not care about their employees. I gave them my life 5 days a week for years and they underpay, and dont give benefits. but in this world, especially in NY you take what you can get."
good,It was a great learning experience to manage up to 10 associates. Providing guidance to produce a daily commercial log for the network to air. The workplace was a fun atmosphere to work.
good,"There are dinosaurs in the office and the company culture is a ""crabs in a barrel"" mentality. CEO is long overdue to step down. There is no growth or job security. I worked all day and put all of my soul into the company - they do not care. The executives at the company just use the job for the fringes that come along with it - there is no concern for the terrible programming. On a positive note the company gave me a sense of confidence working with black professionals in that space was amazing."
good,Worked as an intern and the department didn't have enough money to hire me. I was very overworked and paid minimum wage. I was doing work at the coordinator level and getting paid less than what an intern in the marketing industry should get paid.
good,"•	Provide technical support for offsite productions (MTV Movie Awards, Video Music Awards, Kid’s Choice Awards, Paramount Studios, Comedy Central, etc.)"
good,"need severe management training within each department in certain locations."
good,"It was interesting to work for the producer but he was very much a type A personality and always ended up rewriting the material I provided. I was hired for my knowledge of the local lowrider car culture but that went out the door when the producer ""hipped it up."""
good,"Chould be a GREAT company to work for, very poor management, poor directions, poor business model. Waste too much money, areas are too independent and run as they want to very poor focus."
good,se nota en el ambiente que hay demasiadas entradas y salidas continuamente en la empresa
good,"Culturally ingrained ""mean girl/gossip girl"" mentality. Men and women. There will be no change if executives don't shift the culture with the clique-ish behavior and promoting gossippers, and even participating themselves."
good,"It is a nice environment to work in because of the nice colleagues. "
good,"Total lack of career advancement but really fun perks. Other than that, no direction from upper management about long term career goals. Would recommend to young professionals looking to start out their career but definitely not long term."
good,Working at Viacom used to be super fun but there has been so much restructuring over the last 2 years and there is a huge lack of communication and proper management.
good,"- Huge company...lots of networking opportunities "
good,"Teams have changed multiple times in my time at Viacom and with each team change the experience working has changed as well.  At times people higher up bottleneck information which bottlenecks ability for productivity, let alone the time to create cool and innovative content.  Overall office culture and employee bonding opportunities are really cool though."
good,"There is a hierarchical and competitive landscape. Networking is essential in addition to rigor. It's not an easy industry, but if you are willing to put in the work it will pay off eventually. You will also have some fun along the way."
good,"Working at Viacom is a great entry level job, for those who want to cut their teeth in the entertainment industry. It's a great job at a starter level, because you're more concerned with getting in aside and not the lack of benefits, vacation time, pay, or advancement. You do need to leave the company to get a higher title and pay."
good,"Good working environment, but individual leadership and politics make a big difference in the work-life experiences.  Very committed people that work hard and play hard.  Creativity and self-expression are plentiful and appreciated."
good,"While many divisions were poorly managed, there were several departments with great talent and creative thinkers on business growth and expansion.  Fun environment."
good,MTV is a great young place to work. I've been with the promos department over ten years and every time critics try to write us off we find a way to reinvent ourselves.
good,Internship was okay - nothing special but not horrible. Higher-ups were not very good at explaining what they wanted done. A lot of busy work and meaningless tasks.
good,"The company is great as a whole. "
good,management is fickle  No consistency to policy procedures  Expectations are above the time allotted  no OT but expects all to be completed  Expects to cross over to other divisions with no training
good,I enjoyed working for Viacom as its creative environment allowed me to get stuck in and explore areas of technology and hadn't encountered. In addition I was able to spend a lot of time writing reviews for programmes and shadowing creative directors.
good,It used to be a great place to work but the creative culture has changed and lost some of its appeal lately. The benefits are still great but the salaries are usually lower.
good,"Overall, I really enjoyed my time at Nickelodeon but I found the management to be horrible and unprofessional. The structure is way too top heavy which leads to too many of the same people telling you very different things (without talking to one another), mixed messages, and last minute changes leading to a frustrating work environment. Hard work seems to go unnoticed by the majority of the teams and those who move up did so because they asked for it, not because they deserved it (which they did). "
good,"Fast pace hard work culture, hard to advance to higher positions.  Variety of projects and diverse group of people to work with. Some supportive managers."
good,"Overall you learn a lot, and work for iconic brands, but overall management and career planning is not great. Take what you can get from here and move on."
good,"This is a great place to start a career in Broadcast Media as you can advance easily in the company, but after few years you will understand it is poorly managed. The culture at Viacom is great, lots of young and creative people that keeps you inspired.Hardest part of the job: The company changing their direction yearly so no room for improvement. The most enjoyable part: the chance to learn new things and you will make friends for life in this company."
good,"Was the highlight of my career...until my turn came up in the continual layoffs. "
good,"I love the industry and the company has been a pioneer BUT upper management has a tendency to be hit or miss. While others benefited from flexibility and balance, my group was very sneaky and rigid and did not appreciate employees. There was high turnover and no matter how many times complaints were filed, they were ignored because of who upper management knew and they were buried."
good,"The company culture is okay. They pretend to give you amazing job perks. In reality, they just have tiny incentives to keep you from leaving. You will want to leave as soon as you realize that Viacom has the lowest salaries in the industry."
good,"I learned and made wonderful connections in viacom. Unfortunately, there is no room for growth and mobility within the company. The culture and environment made it a great place to work."
good,"As a scrum master for the mobile apps team, I'm in charge of facilitating the scrum rituals for both the iOS and Android platform.  Most of my team is in either Italy, Poland, and Germany. As a result, of the team mostly being in Europe, I travel quarterly for PI planning, so the team is prepped for each quarters work.  My main goal for the team is to encourage them to be self-organized.  For example, I motivate the team to communicate across the platforms, so there is parity for the technical solutions.  "
good,"During my time a Viacom there were pros and cons .My experience at Viacom with my co-workers was very positive. The work environment was great, the projects I worked on were very exciting and challenging. My team pushed me to really grow professionally. Management typically has a difficult time making decisions on just about everything. Expect little value on work/life balance.If management put more into their employees they would have better retention. A single ticket here or there does not make up for time lost while in the office."
good,Great place to start your career in media.  Must be willing to work very long hours and be flexible with constantly changing priorities.
good,"Fun entertainment workplace, relaxed but hectic due to new show releases. open to bringing ideas to the table and keeping the culture updated."
good,"Viacom is a traditional media company and as one still operates that way. Information is hoarded by management and does not get disseminated down. Focus is never on the future but on the immediate operating quarter."
good,"Depending on the department you work for, you are able to enjoy the many different work place parties and educational meetings. Very environmentally forward choosing to have everything compostable. Loved working with my manager and team, they definitely made my work days."
good,"Nice company to work. Fun, environment. Friendly people. Easy commute. Some managers should not be managers. Non corporate structure in some departments. Other than that great company."
good,I learned to take one day at a time and never take anything for granted. The climate at the time I was there was of low morale due to layoffs but I had an overall good experience.
good,"Management doesn't care too much about your advancement, but you do meet great colleagues and have a fun time. It feels like college - nobody really takes their responsibilities too seriously, except for me."
good,"Working at Viacom is a great experience depending on the department you are apart of. Upper management is definitely understanding and knows you have a life outside of work. Which is why getting a day off is never an issue. Workplace culture in Viacom is great. No one judges you based on your appearance, there's always an event going on, as well as they always give out free items to employees."
good,"pretty good, I worked there because it was over there. It helped during a time where I needed to be and I was there. I would do it again if I could go over there again."
good,"A typical day at BET Networks was a family-like workplace.  Times of stress occurred closer to award shows, however, everyone was a professional and worked together in order to get the job done."
good,Good work life balance depending on your department. Supportive of mothers. Pay is decent but nothing outstanding compared to other industries. Good vacation package. Culture can be a bit unsupportive at times.
good,"Didn't hate it, didn't love it. I saw many shady things go down and chose not to be a part of it. Met many wonderful colleagues."
good,Not enough work to do. Management was pretty relaxed. I wish I had more work to do. Internship only. Would've like to stay on only if I had a stronger sense of belonging.
good,Good experience and increased my knowledge of the media and entertainment industries. Great opportunity to expand talent and to experiment and grow as an artist.
good,My job was very interesting.  Enjoyed the employees that worked for me and my co-workers.  Although the commute was long the job was very gratifying.  Management was fair.
good,"As of now, it's not a stable company to work for. A lot of people who are an asset to this company are being let go, their workload gets dumped on other departments causing stress"
good,"The day was smooth and laid back, some people that I have talking to I Didn't even know they were high corporate people. It was my first time so when I started to find out i was stunned and amazed, these high corporate people interact with famous people all day. working as an inter i developed more excel skills and also obtained knowledge on how to use sales force. I would love to get another internship at Viacom."
good,"More interesting than working at a bank but Viacom has declined over the last decade."
good,"La filiale française se porte bien, bonne ambiance."
good,"Unfortunately, Viacom has been in a creative tailspin for years now.  The lack of strong leadership has proven to be the downfall of many of the networks.  When other organizations were putting content first, Viacom was cutting costs on programming and other lines of business.  "
good,"Old and slow moving, I wish there had been a younger faster pace at the office. I was brought on as a freelancer, and was never given the opportunity to advance."
good,Generally a good place to work. A lot of employees had to be terminated because most of the work was being done from the studio in California. Employee morale was low.
good,Ok work environment. Interesting creative people.  Lots of fun. Stressful and fast paced.  Cutthroat. Exciting.  Involved in a lot of areas.  Wore many hats.
good,"Good place to be if you are looking for best in class salaries. You are ultra aggressive, ambitious and go all out to market yourself, you will be successful here."
good,a place to work with people in the city in a big building that is not as big as some other buildings but still pretty big by regular building standards
good,Need to offer more staff based jobs for long time employees.  Workplace culture is fun and exciting.  Lots of parties to attend.  Hours are very doable.
good,ottimo ambiente per confrontarsi quotidianamente su diversi progetti in un ambiente aperto ricco e stimolante con possibilità di continuo confronto internazionale
good,"the most enjoyable part of this job is being creative. i love the dynamic of my core team. however, we're poorly managed and poorly compensated for what we do. no space to grow."
good,A typical day at work will start with checking with my team and our ticketing system learning and creating new process working with the management servicing our clients for that location for all VIACOM Businesses... The hardest part of the day is trying to leave on time as my co-workers were always ready to step-up when needed and the best part about working was discussing our strategy to work smarter and being more productive...
good,The work place is very laid back many go to work in shorts and sandals but there doesn't seem to be any focus on software developers. Something Viacom needs with its competitors advancing in VOD platforms.
good,Organization in translation. Talent strategy evolving and shifting culture. Creative environment effected by changes within the industry and media landscape
good,Oversee the buy vs build assessment for sales business applications which processes over 4 billion dollars in yearly revenue and manages network signal launches.  Lead all day-to-day operations of sales applications and support staff.
good,"A typical day was very busy and I learned to pace myself and how to create balance between work and personal life. "
good,"High work volume, but great place."
good,Het was leerrijk maar moeilijk op afstand te werken. Elke dag leerde ik iets bij zoals Social media management en best practices daarin.
good,"The job was never the real problem. The culture of the site was based around people who abused power being bullies to great people trying to do the job. That was the culture of the company, overall. "
good,"Corporate atmosphere with a ""corporate casual"" look. Great company but difficult to move up."
good,Great place to work and network. You get to be apart of a many networks. Family friendly environment.
good,Had a great time working for this company which offered a lot perks and benefits.
good,"My first job ever, and it was a great experience. I learned work ethic and it has helped me throughout my college years greatly. I also learned time management and tolerance. My boss was super nice and respectful towards me."
good,Extremely busy days assisting customers and co-workers. I learned how to resolve issues for a person that might be angry with the company. My co-workers were a wonderful group of people. Unfortunately they sold the company and soon after I left they moved the office people to another location.
good,"Overall Viacom is good place to work, representing great brands and working with very talented people. I've been in the company for over 7 years, in different roles including sales, marketing and now product management. While I've learned so much about the digital advertising industry, I am now looking to grow and expand my knowledge with a new company and new brands."
good,Very rewarding place to work.
good,"I worked independently on the broadcast networks of MTV, VH1 and Comedy Central. I learned a lot from scheduling, broadcasting and deadlines. I became accustomed to a fast placed workplace, where deadlines were mandatory. My reviews from the supervisors was always above average and I scored highly within the review."
good,"Worked at Viacom / Paramount Pictures for close to 4 years. Great place with great people, somewhat challenging industry given cord-cutting, but many other industries are facing similar challenges with evolving consumer preferences."
good,Work culture is great.  There is tremendous talent to tap on.    Excellent benefits.   The location is right on Timesquare so its a bit of a challenge to get to but at the same time the vibe is fantastic.
good,"I only worked there briefly for a pilot show, but had a good experience. I felt very supported the entire time. Like any production company there things that can be improved, but nothing out of the ordinary."
good,"I was employed for many years at Viacom. For most of those years it was a great, creative environment. With media companies scrambling to keep costs down, it has become an assembly line kind of job."
good,"It was a lot of work, but I had a secure job and supportive team behind me. Not a lot of growth in the Midwest office.All planning roles are on the coasts."
good,"Great starting point for out of college, great opportunities to network, low pay for anyone below upper management and poor treatment of assistants/planners in the dept I was working with."
good,"Not a bad place to work but could be so much better. American corporate culture does not promote innovative working practices, or focus on needs of employees."
good,"I was not considered full time so did not get benefits so cannot give that a high rating.  Otherwise, people are friendly and very company-oriented."
good,"Fun exciting brands, nice people. Took the position as it was a promise of contract to perm, in reality there was never a budget set aside to make this happen."
good,"Viacom is a great place to learn about the industry.  With a lot of extremely talented and senior people, you can really grow professionally, Of course, with any large company you face challenges.  There are a lot of people working on any given piece of business, which can become challenging.  In addition, once you reach a certain place in your career it is hard to move up.  Being very top heavy can provide challenges and hurdles."
good,I enjoy what I do because it allows me to learn new things and adapt to ever-changing technology.  My manager allows me to grasp new techniques to improve upon my own skills and train others.
good,"I loved my coworkers. The people made it easy to come into work everyday however, however the resources and attention given to our department had an effect on morale."
good,"Great culture, great people, tough work, lack of management support additional training needed."
good,A high amount of invoices and expense reports received daily.  Learned how to manage my time to keep up with the demand.
good,"This was an internship I took while in college.  I was responsible for writing blurbs, transcribing and editing audio interviews every day.  "
good,"Work/life balance is pretty solid; after leaving, I learned to appreciate how good the company's benefits are. Compensation is weak. "
good,"It is a very easy going, productive and collaborative environment.  I've learned to become more personable with my colleagues, as well as how to better manage work related stress."
good,"I enjoyed my time here. Good people to work with, always kept the work environment enjoyable and the work is interesting. They offer free coffee on every floor, have beautiful views of the city and people care about their work."
good,"As an 8 year employee, I can say I have met some of the best colleagues, mentors, and friends at Viacom.  It's a building and environment you enjoy walking into every day.   Nobody breaths down your neck to punch a clock so you have freedom and some flexibility with time. "
good,"Viacom, because of it's youth oriented and pop culture brands, has a hip and open sensibility but can definitely go further in embracing the values of the American workplace.  I have found that there is always plenty to learn if you have the initiative.  "
good,"At work I spend any down time researching entertainment news and staying current with celebrities, knowing what celebrities are popular and current. Everyday I research up and coming movie releases, television premieres and stay current on weekly ratings. Also I research and watch up and coming talent and comedians that have success potential. I attend casting sessions for any of our shows."
good,"Worked at Viacom during a corporate transition and had to leave after my director supervisors left the company, as my position was contract based. It was a very friendly enviornment and enjoyed working there"
good,Forward thinking company with weakness at the management level. Not well organized at the top level of management. Diverse product base. Staff members were not the best qualified.
good,"Walking into Viacom gives you a ""I made it sense"". It's very colorful, high energy and working in development, everyone really is competitive and are trying to break the next big tv show. I loved being there!"
good,"Viacom's culture is one of fun and very casual. It is fast paced a cut throat as far as job opportunities and advancement go, but if you are able to stay without getting laid off, it is great."
good,"so many affinity groups and activities to get involved in which may the company a fun place to work. Great work life balance. "
good,"Viacom is a fantastic culture that allows for creative minds to thrive.  I look forward to coming to work every day and love the people that I work with on a daily basis.  Unfortunately, the toughest aspect of my job is my commute into the city every day. The commute has inclined me look for options closer to my home."
good,"Typical day consists of 3 internal meetings or more, 10 phone calls to clients and agencies, client lunches, many internal reports, late hours, clients entertaining. I've learned detail, communication and organization from Viacom."
good,"Interning at Viacom my sophomore year of college was a dream come true! The environment is great - not too strict of a dress policy, everyone is very in touch with media, a wide range of ages across the employees which made for many learning/teaching opportunities, and there's always something fun going on! I learned a lot and felt that my work actually held value for the company."
good,"Large company with a lot of room for advancement, I personally did not work with the company culture. I enjoyed my coworkers, but had a frustrating time working as a permalance employee."
good,A great place work and learn at but there is no gender equality; there are mostly more women than men. This may have an effect on office dynamics and the working culture.
good,Great departments that have the potential to really be an outstanding channel on linear and digital. There is a lack of leadership and a generational gap.
good,"I spent some great year, some not so great, depending on management at the time. Promotions were few and far between for many talented people, yet nepotism allowed many to move up quickly."
good,typical work day is handling emergencies for everyone.  Your specific job has to be done in overtime or if you come in early or stay late.
good,"If you have a supportive manager you will love it there.  If not you will run for the door.  Overall the culture is great, everyone loves what they do.  Unfortunately my manager didn't realize what she had until I was gone."
good,You can still get a free cup of coffee if you're ok with not having Starbucks.  Most people work here for years.  Some people grow while some stay in the same roles for years.  This place is what you make it but it's not as fun as it used to be I hear.
good,This was a great job for a temporary employee. My co workers were friendly and I was able to learn quite a bit about accounting. I was also able to utilize my customer service skills.
good,"Pretty busy work environment, fast paced and a lot of assistants who some time believe they are the boss. A fairly young culture that allows you to take meetings with different departments, and different networks. Many opportunities to be apart of networking groups to help you create your own business contacts."
good,"As is everywhere, it all depends on where you land at the company."
good,"Viacom is extremely big, so it depends on what department you are in. Overall it is a very fun environment with a lot of brands to find the best fit for your style."
good,loved working at viacom. great place to learn and grow. good perks. beautiful office. nice people and mentors to help grow. always an exciting time around the office
good,Very nice place to work. The culture is great and for the most part the people are too. Great benefits including summer Fridays and a good amount of PTO days during the year.
good,"Employees are awesome, management can do better to support their teams.  The overall environment is positive and great to work in, building has events and special activities that liven the atmosphere of the workplace."
good,"The Creative and Innovative people and environment was always exciting to work for. The benefits were great for a large company, they seemed to care for the future of the employees. It was only difficult at time to receive direction or mentorship to learn about the companies benefits and other rewards."
good,i'd recommend anyone to work here. great fun atmosphere. everyone is social. chill vibes. they even have rooftop concerts every now and then for all employees.
good,"Viacom è sicuramente un'azienda interessante che offre la possibilità di lavorare in un contesto giovane e internazionale. La grossa pecca è il lato contrattuale: nella maggior parte dei casi si tratta di contatti a tempo determinato, rinnovati ogni sei mesi. L'assunzione a tempo indeterminato è allo stato attuale un miraggio."
good,The atmosphere in the office was always positive and pleasant. I learned a lot from working with the producers/writers at BET in the creative services department.
good,Fun workplace and environment with people who want to help you succeed. Good for internal mobility. Offers professional development classes and happy hours on Thursdays.
good,If you want a good name on your resume then its a great place to be. Otherwise I didn't really learn much here. Not really worth the time but at least it was paid which is rare in entertainment.
good,"Viacom presents a multitude of opportunities for interns to discern which career path they are most interested in. "
good,Viacom is a great company for a starting point and to grow within the industry. Better opportunities to learn bigger picture after you gain experience there.
good,Independent operator working all over the city delivering products working with people having deliver times and late night orders that have to be completed.
good,"Viacom has a great culture and very nice people. Unfortunately, my team and function was not what I looked for in a job. Also, the pay was a bit below was I was accustomed to."
good,"Risk takers, lot of fun, lot of creativity, great mates. A very commited company that believes in its employees and care about their professional growth. "
good,"great company. I enjoyed working there. People were nice, and my voice was heard. I hope they are able to redirect in order to ensure future success of their brands."
good,A fun place to work and in a great neighborhood. I was sad when that office location closed. Aggressive deadlines but many talented and dedicated people. Learned a lot there.
good,"Viacom is a good place to work, there is community service that is done every year, other activities are provided for fun throughout the year.  Benefits are good."
good,"Viacom is a fun place to work with a lot of fun people. I think its a great place for your first job. However, there are a lot of network politics and a lot of people that are placed in positions without any knowledge of what they are doing. There are no growth opportunities and a lot of false promises made by management."
good,Working at Viacom was a fun experience.  I interned for my whole senior year a Comedy Central and Logo.  There were no entry level opportunities when I graduated college.  I worked with some great supervisors that cared about teaching the ins and outs of the business.
good,"The glitz and glamour of Viacom's shows and markets are fun and energizing, and there can be some fun perquisites, but at senior management levels it is serious business."
good,The building itself is a great atmosphere.  Located in Times Square.  Most of the company is young including middle management.  Hard to become staff if you come in project based.
good,"- all co-workers are very professional and fun to work with"
good,Great atmosphere to learn!  Would definitely work here again.
good,Fun place to perfect a trade while also building a portfolio. The co-workers are kind. The most enjoyable part is never knowing who you may bump into in the elevator.
good,"Oversaw the 24/7 day-to-day operations of the Digital Encoding Services department for Viacom Media Networks, managing a staff of 15 employees.  DES is the digital archiving and distribution facility within Viacom responsible for digitizing and distributing television content for broadcast and multi-platform use."
good,"A typical day at work is not quite ""typical"" at all.  In the wonderful world of production each day to day tasks varies, whether office work is required for an extended period of time or production travel. I've learned a ton in relation to production, i.e. technical skills, time management, communication skills, planning, and production delivery."
good,"Viacom Media Networks is a good place to work.  It offers good health benefits, 401k, learning opportunities, wellness,"
good,"Great management with traveling department and fast-paced environment. Work hard to play hard mentality. Hardest part of the job is dealing with talent, but can also be very enjoyable as well."
good,Demanding and good work in environment. The projects are really interesting.
good,"Viacom creates and fosters a culture of winning. Each brand and property is protected, nurtured and distributed to maximize all potential revenue streams."
good,"I loved interning for one of the MTV Networks companies! Depending on your company placement, the Viacom Internship program can be excellent! I lucked out with great coworkers and cool projects to help out with, but was really proactive about contributing to the team. The more effort you put into the internship, the more you will get back.  "
good,Positive experience. Inclusive atmosphere where senior managers are willing to guide and teach. Great coworkers. Good hands on television experience
good,Typical large corporation with all the usual benefits and problems.
good,"Viacom was one of the best companies I worked for. Professional staff, management, and Executives of all levels. There was never a boring day at Viacom- always full of excitement and diversity. I performed many tasks at this busy place of entertainment."
good,I enjoyed working for the radio station. I met amazing people and learned so much of the real world. I had this position while in college. I highly recommend this company. There are no typical days but its always amazing. The hardest part of this job was leaving and going back to my dorm.
good,"Very coordinated and hard-working teams and departments focused on high corporate goals. Department Heads, managers and supervisors are demanding but fair."
good,Enjoyed working there as an intern and definitely had the opportunity to see all phases of production. Ever yday was different and I was always doing something new.
good,"Viacom strives to adhere to all things progressive and forward, however, most of their efforts fall short or are abandoned. The people at this company are 1 in a million."
good,Temp. Only - friendly environment. I worked as a temp but the working situation seemed to be good for regular employees. Nice building and contemporary setting. Often provided meals for special occasions.
good,"This is a great company to work for but only if you have no desire to be promoted.Most people love the company so will never leave their position, and IF they do leave the position, the company will hire an external candidate over an internal one almost every time.  Amazing benefits but they do not give people the correct titles to avoid paying for the job the employees are doing."
good,"Viacom & it's management treated me well during my tenure. They willingly advanced me,acknowledging my accomplishments through the years. The employee base is one that is willing to make the company great and will strive to meet company goals."
good,"It's a very family orientated environment. Love the colleagues, they fun and helpful. However, job advancement is a problem."
good,"Perform day-to-day systems administration activities including maintenance, backup, utilization and performance monitoring on a variety of Windows based computing platforms. "
good,Passionate about what I do and ready to move to a higher position
good,"	On Line Assembling of AIWA, AKAI, TCL Television and Audio System,"
good,Working at Viacom has been such a pleasure. I learned to interact with various departments as well as interact with digital gaming programmers and engineers.
good,"Very active and fast paced. There were always new challenges to conquer, and a very supportive staff. The hardest part of the job, is ensuring that a live program can air without error. Then to diagnose any issue, and expediently correct. My fellow co-workers made the work atmosphere more enjoyable and pleasurable."
good,The people here are incredible. Fun company culture. The Benefits are next level. They really care about the whole person and work life balance. Pay could be better
good,"Viacom is a good company to work for. While jobs have been cut, it is to be expected when a company is trying to right the ship and cut costs. Great people work at this company. It is turning around, but work needs to get there."
good,this was one of my first big job and it help me to understand how to be a great employee while working with a great team of folks that collaborated on many issues as a team to improve the outcome of most of our tasks.  great place.
good,"A ""neat"" place to work. Casual culture and many young professionals working cohesively with older ones. Much knowledge share and respect. Management created a comfortable environment where personal or family needs could be addressed without stress."
good,"Depending on your position and years in the company, you have great benefits since they have amazing very grateful execs who appreciate your work. "
good,"As a past intern, I had many responsibilities. My co-workers were passionate about their jobs and made me excited to learn more about the company. I had a lot of exposure to different departments."
good,"Fast-paced energetic atmosphere. However, if not careful on can be swallowed whole. It is an environment where if you are paying attention you can sharpen all of you production skills."
good,My offices were a fun environment surrounded by very open spaces and lots of cool people to work with. Times Square office is very easy to commute to.
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Viacom - I spent over 7 years working there starting as a summer associate. It was my dream to work at MTV and that dream came true. I enjoyed the culture and everything I learned here. My only criticism is that due to low turnaround, a very top heavy team, getting promoted is not easy nor is getting a salary increase."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the events and co-workers. There are tons of networking opportunities and a very laid back culture. Management can vary per department.
good,"Work environment is very fun and laid back. "
good,"Working at Viacom Media was a completely new way of working."
good,Thoroughly learned the day-to-day responsibilities of working in TV Production. This job offered great on training and also allowed for growth. Collaborative environment where you will learn from industry professionals.
good,"Great place to learn about the Media Industry. Difficult hours , low compensation (strong benefits package and ample paid time off) and slow career advancement."
good,"Good place to learn about the industry while interning in college.  Don't have much info regarding actual employment, but I learned a lot through my internship."
good,"1. Good work culture"
good,"flexible working hours, people coming in to the office between 8 and 10. we start off the day by having a cup of coffee and a brief chat with coworkers. easy going working environment, people are free to organise their own tasks during working hours. A great creative and stimulating environment."
good,I truly enjoyed working at Viacom...  Great culture that allows their employees to be innovative and successful.  Viacom offers great work and personal environment.
good,Difficult to navigate internal politics if direct upper management not at same location. Frequent recent layoffs lead to no sense of job security.
good,"Fun place to work. Lots of perks, however any coworker will back stab you for an opportunity and the compensation is not what is expected.The company itself was fun to work for however. I could be myself, listen to music in my office, and just grind out my work."
good,It's a good company if you want to learn in IT industry. Everyday you face new challenges but most of the times it has too much work pressure.
good,"This internship was very intimidating just for the simple fact that I worked for the President of Programming at BET.  Stephen Hill is the only Executive that has an intern working under him, and I understand why.  I was supervised by his executive assistant Danielle Carrington.  The work wasn't too hard, but I never felt relaxed doing any of the work, because I was so afraid to mess up.  I was always afraid to ask questions because my supervisor made me feel as if I needed to know everything, even if I was never taught it, but she would always tell me ""It's okay to ask questions"".  I still didn't believe her, because she would always imply otherwise.  She always made me feel as if I needed to know everything, even if I was never taught it.  That was my problem. It was a great internship but I never really felt content being here just because I never felt relaxed.  I never really felt as If I was trusted, which I did not appreciate because I know what I'm capable of.  The office maintained both a professional and laid back demeanor.  I loved that I could wear almost whatever I wanted because that me feel a little more relaxed.  Overall it was a great experience, but I feel as if I left without displaying my best work."
good,The business model became out dated as technology expanded the competition. Leadership failed to grow with technology fast enough to stay on top of the market.
good,"Great people, Great environment. Always something going on at Viacom and work-life balance is great."
good,Hapy to work and loking forward to work.very exciting place o work. Working environment wtith friendl people made me learn lot from oter people. very god company yo work for.
good,Great place to work with driven and intelligent people that love to create. You get to work with people who want to challenge themselves and the way things were done before.
good,Viacom is a great place to work. There are opportunities for advancement and most people either stay here for the duration of their careers or end up returning later on.
good,I enjoyed being there and working with  talented group of people   I learned a lot about working I television as a photo editor and I networked and net people within the company  oh and the cafeteria was delicious!!!
good,I enjoyed my time with Viacom. I learned alot with them. Some good and some bad. Alot of politics happen there. The environment was great and loved the perks that they offered.
good,"Interesting diverse place to work, very chaotic.  Long hours are expected.  "
good,la compañía tiene productos muy divertidos y permite la creatividad en muchos sentidos
good,Great work environment with fun activities and events for employees to participate in. Summer Fridays and other great perks for employees as well! Great place to work
good,It is a very fun place to work with. The people are generally nice. Very diverse and creative. The work/life balance is great. I learned a lot from great managers and leaders.
good,Being in a lower position of power you do not make that much for working in New York but the work is exciting and the people are fun. The hours are flexible and depending on the amount of work you have you could stay there all night or come and go within 8/9 hours.
good,Viacom is a fun place to work because of the perks you wouldn't get at a normal 9-5 job. This internship gave the ability to look into other jobs other than the one you signed up for.
good,"I started at this company as an intern and eventually got hired full time. Company has tons of turnover, only a few get promoted while full teams will be let go"
good,Fun place to work and a great culture. Managers were very knowledgeable and were willing to help. The company was stable and had good advancement within the company
good,"The only consistent at Viacom is change! "
good,"Wonderful place to work with great benefits and time off. Lots of interesting, creative work to be done. Senior management needs to improve communication and stop competing internally."
good,"After all my years in print, the move to linear sales was a bit of a shock. Viacom promoted a high degree of individualistic chest beating vs the more team-oriented sales approach favored by print publishing firms. My position was difficult by it's very nature. Attempting to cultivate adult-targeted brands and categories while representing a kids network was not easy, although I didn't expect it to be easy. Strong, creative management and players in Marketing, Ad Sales and Research in the home NYC office helped the cause as did Viacom's tendency to promote young producers quickly. The most enjoyable part of the job was putting all the pieces together across TV, Digital, Mobile and Print and selling the right idea to the right partner. The least enjoyable part was the weekly video conferences with the sales teams."
good,"A solid company withgood brand recognition.  Great platform for learning about mulitmedia, digial, print, tv, radio etc.  Nice people, good management and good corporate culture"
good,"Overall, Viacom is a great place to work.  I started my career here and I learned a lot.  A very fun, fast paced environment.  Great benefits and PTO but pay is fairly low"
good,"Working at Viacom for 11 years meant working the hardest, being pushed the furthest and knowing exactly when it was time to leave. I miss the people more than anything because they taught me everything and I am a better person because of them."
good,"I was a contract freelancer here. Or rather the ongoing joke is permalancer. For the department I worked in becoming FTE isn't impossible it just takes time. Different teams are different sizes and if you want to become FTE you have to wait for a current FTE employee to move on. That said the work atmosphere was fantastic and everyone was very nice. I worked as a Media Coordinator for the digital post production team and I got to work on all sorts of awesome platforms like Comedy Central, Spike, and MTV. I also got to do a lot of different things week to week. Sometimes video editing, sometime audio mixing, other times actually going to shoots to media mange on site. Learning is highly encouraged and there are plenty opportunities to learn across different disciplines. All in all I really value the time I spent working at Viacom."
good,"A very diverse and fun place to work.  They seem to really care about their employees.  Unfortunately, not enough stability or growth within the department I worked in, but overall a great and pleasant experience."
good,"The company goes a long way to create an inclusive environment with multiple opportunities for self-growth.  There is always talk about re-inventing MTV or approaching the business as a start up in some cases.  But at the end of the day, it's a bottom-line, publicly-driven company that is concerned more about short term results without the stomach for short term pain that could lead to better things down the road."
good,"Great place to work and meet great people. However, salary is on the low end. Great work/life balance, activities for employees and fun place to work."
good,"Good Place to work at, Learned a lot of cool stuff. Lot's of opportunities and facilities for every employee. It was a great experience"
good,I had a solid word environment at Viacom. I enjoy my fellow coworkers and the benefits supplied. I recommend for those interest in this company to apply.
good,My time at Viacom was great. I would recommend it if you're looking to beef up your resume. The staff was great as well as the culture of the company.
good,"Excellent collaboration across groups with everyone being co located. "
good,Exciting media environment with a lot of areas of growth.  Learned the media world from the bottom up and gain valuable experience.
good,"The environment is amazing, the office are extremely cool, the culture is young and hip.  Unfortunately, being a large creative company there is little synergy or standardization across business units.  Upper management is now completely immersed on cutting costs and does not value the long term employees."
good,"Good life/work balance.  Professional, intelligent co-workers."
good,I worked with a great team at VH1 and was very happy there for 8 years.
good,Fantastic culture and great people with greater minds. Love working at Viacom.
good,"	Coordinate conference rooms for Nickelodeon Executive Floor, Nickelodeon Burbank CA Office, VIACOM Media Networks, MTV, MTV2, VH1, VH1 Soul and Viacom International;"
good,"Good Place to work, however advancement opportunities are hard to find."
good,A typical day at work for a Media assurance Librarian/Quality Control Operator. Locating and finding missing media. Scan in any incoming tape to in to our system then give to the caching department for processing. After the media is processed it then given to a Quality Control Operator who will watch the material and make sure it is ok air.
good,"My most recent position at Viacom has allowed me to work on complex marketing executions across all of the company’s networks. This role has given me a vast network and strong understanding of an ideal marketing program and what makes it successful. In addition, I am required to work with both the creative and sales teams to coordinate the marketing ideas and ultimate executions, which has allowed me to experience all sides of the marketing process."
good,"VIACOM est une entreprise très sympathique pour une expérience de travail, malgré quelque défauts l'équipe est au top pour vous accueillir et vous aider dans vos missions."
good,Viacom is a great place to work. The people are awesome and the work is good. Management is a bit scattered and lots of change there so its not the best time with the merger with CBS
good,"Nice company to work. Fun, environment. Friendly people. Easy commute. Some managers should not be managers. Non corporate structure in some departments. Other than that great company."
good,"Freelanced  there.  Really enjoyed my time there.  Good people, good times, good culture.  Would work there again.  I have the feeling I will work that again soon."
good,"Day to day was managing and dealing with digital deliveries to LATAM clients, at the same time dealing with customer support to our clients. The hardest part of the job was meeting deadlines, and finishing last minute deliveries. The enjoyable part of my day to day were the people I worked with, they made the job appealing and pleasant to work with while having a relaxed working environment while maintaining deadlines. What I learned is that everything you do is being part of a team, you need to manage expectations and sometimes take action when iy is not presented to you."
good,I enjoyed the monthly networking events and culture at Viacom. It made up for the stressful workload at times. Also the youthful environment and meeting people with similar interests.
good,"It's a great place to work however there is extremely high turnover depending on the department you are in. Significantly more job security at the corporate level, however more learning opportunities and a sense of community on the brand side."
good,"I have worked at 3 different networks at Viacom. Each was filled with extremely talented employees and a general work environment that was relaxed and creative. Although, pay and career advancement wasn't great for the entry level."
good,"Working her was a great experience. I was trained really well and learned so much from the manager and all who worked there. A heavy work load, but very much enjoyed."
good,I enjoyed working here for a brief stint. I was able to learn new skills while working on multiple assignments. The staff I worked with are very experienced and helpful but there are some changes in structure going on so I often didn't have any tasks assigned to me.
good,I feel management was supportive and offered opportunities to learn and grow within the department based on your willingness to do so.  Please refer to my resume as a perfect example of how I moved ahead.
good,"Good work place. If you wish to start with a company that provides good exposure, go for Viacom . It is a good place to learn basics. "
good,"Nice place to work. Basically it is a media company and there were lot of challenges everyday. Good management . Friendly environment , should be ever ready with your knowledge."
good,"Viacom has so many awesome channels that immersing yourself in work for any one of them is great. The different teams work together in unison in order to make things happen and you get to learn a lot about other departments."
good,"Viacom has a great company culture. With some exceptions they do value their employees which is shown through various company events, initiatives, and perks. "
good,"Good relations between coworkers, direct exchange of experience amongst different areas. They had good carrer plans for their staff and the opportunity to help in other events of the company."
good,This is a great company to work for however the pay is always less that what it should be for the position. It is very hard for employees to move up as the managing positions are usually hired from outside of the company.
good,"Viacom is a dynamic company with so many brands that appeal to different generations of people. Get work life balance, relaxed work culture and open door policy. The people here are great! However, they do not pay their entry level employees well at all. Competitors are openly paying employees of the same role at least $10-15k more and sometimes even more. It can be disheartening that a company this large and successful focuses so much on compensating the big whigs, but then forget about the work horses that are keeping the company a float."
good,"Great people."
good,"Overall it was a good experience. It was not quite the right fit for me. The work load was a bit too easy for me. I was able to get though work quickly and ended up watching a lot of tv on the computer. Supervisors were often surprised how quickly I got things done but, did not give me more of a workload."
good,"Many perks including free coffee and soda bar on every floor. You just might meet a celebrity in the elevator and compensation is pretty fair. Atmosphere can be competitive, but the work facilities are nice."
good,"People are not only friendly, but really go out of their way to help you with anything that you need. I love my team, they have supported me in every way regarding my personal life and career. They have a great work/life balance."
good,"Large company with flexible professional culture."
good,Great company to learn ins and outs of the industry and being on the forefront of what's next in line from the media and technology perspective. You can and will get your hands very dirty learning the portfolio. 
good,Viacom offers a great place to work with fun people. I've learned every aspect of production and management working with my coworkers.
good,You are exposed to the latest trends in media and you and you are part of a company who is leading the TV industry by setting trends.
good,"Viacom is the type of place that has a collegial atmosphere. Supervisors practice open door policy and are very supportive. The company also has a cultural feel that promotes diversity and inclusivity. The organization offers a great tuition assistance program, mentoring programs and other great employee incentives."
good,"My internship experience was great. They give you projects and tasks that help introduce you to the corporate and entertainment world."
good,"Very Fun place and work environment, very professional and fair, good team and a lot of work. I will always be grateful to have been part of this family."
good,"Great opportunity to see the reality tv industry up close and personal. As an assistant, I answered calls and emails, scheduled meetings, booked travel, and created decks for new show ideas and content."
good,"At Viacom we work as a team, and live/work by our key company values. "
good,"My supervisors are great in helping out for my career needs, especially their advice for helping me succeed. I should definitely reach out if needed!!"
good,"This is a great company with focused culture, good work perks and we feel spoiled most days. However advancement within the company seems out of reach, raises, and job security seem hard to come by."
good,"Have enjoyed working at Viacom for the past 4+ years.  There are many great opportunities for advancement, for learning, for collaborating, for training."
good,Was a pretty sweet job got to see the inner workings of a major company like Viacom. Staff was cool and management was awesome. The pay was good at the time
good,"Viacom provides a great work/life balance.  They give employees the time to spend with their family (Summer Fridays, PTO).  Salary isn't as comparable to other networks, but the time you have off balances it out."
good,"Worked alongside some great talents who taught so much and were a delight to work with. Then and now. A creative-driven culture, especially in my hay day."
good,Really great internship experience. People within the team were willing to help you become your best self. A typical day at work included looking over newspapers for any recent coverage on our programming. I learned how to be a very strategical writer. The hardest part about the job was keeping up with press we were receiving. The most enjoyable part was conversing with everyone on the team on a daily basis.
good,"Viacom was a creative, fun and inclusive work place. During my time at Viacom I was able to use my skills to help produce thousands of pieces of original content alongside some of the most talented staff anyone could hope to work with."
good,My 9+ year tenure was an experience with some of the best brands in television. The best part of my job was getting to work with amazing people that felt like family each day.
good,"Great environment and benefits, but pay is way below industry standard. Co-workers are friendly and helpful. Management is great in assisting and communicating."
good,"Good company. Good problems to work in the media industry. Low salary. Amazing view of Times square. The company needs to hire more people, low staffed in technology division."
good,"One of the best experiences of my life.  Very fast paced and competitive environment.  The hardest part of the job was extending deadlines, especially during holiday season"
good,Global Team using latest technologies for complex projects.  Team was well staffed and spread across six countries.  Excellent support from Senior Management.  Friendly co-operative culture.
good,"The role at Viacom is pretty standard as one would imagine. As you know, Viacom is a major media conglomerate so you are dealing with high volume calls, clients, requests, etc."
good,"On a typical day I would report on the status of the various projects I was producing to my direct report and would oversee multiple projects.  "
good,"great work to life balance, managers are open helping you learn new things and facilitating your career advancement. the company provides great benefits, as as well a resources to further develop your brand."
good,It's a very active job that keeps you on your toes and involved in the project at hand. While exciting it has very long hours. Overall it was an exciting experience.
good,"Good company with good benefits. nice place to work, It offers a lot of paid time off and company perks which is nice. Nice people overall, nice offices."
good,A good experience for internship while you are still in college. People are really nice there and you learn a lot if you talk to more people and embrace the environment.
good,"At BET I learned how to sell without excuses. The sales force was expected to win at all cost. We made as much money as we could for as long as we could,"
good,Lead team to obtain goals.  Learning each day to grow and surpass budget.  Good teamwork and focus on improving competencies of a good AE to achieve goals
good,Overall good place. Building is really nice. Management is okay but could be improved. Work culture is fine. Just overall a good place to work with good work life balance.
good,Viacom is a great place to get broad exposure to the media and entertainment industry as its size and reach encompasses nearly every aspect of the space.
good,"It was good environment with amazing people to work with. I developed interactive charts using d3.js, bubble chart, pie chart, bar chart, etc"
good,"Great environment! People are friendly!. You get a lot of training. The overall vibe of the company is fun, spiriting and exciting. I can see why people tend to stay here for a long time. It's encouraging."
good,"The industry is going through a major restructure and this company is ahead."
good,"Opportunity for growth, development and lateral thinking."
good,"Perform day-to-day systems administration activities including maintenance, backup, utilization and performance monitoring on a variety of Windows based computing platforms. "
good,A fun environment to work in where you are given complete freedom to learn. Although i was freelancing with them yet I did get to learn so many things. Very open to new creative ideas and they encourage freshers.
good,"During the time that I was employed at Viacom they just merged with Paramount/MSG.  The company was young and growing.  Management was diverse and they promoted diversity.  It was a fun place to work and they were innovative with their technology. My position was responsible for HRIS related responsibilities within Viacom and the subsidiary companies. That required a lot of responsibility, attention to accuracy, detail and deadlines. Again it was a very good experience for me."
good,"challenging job, 7 days a week, meet business owners and learn how to grow there business with radio advertising."
good,Working at Viacom was fun and interesting. I learned how to write script coverage. Working with the Exec. Producer taught me the inner workings of how to produce TV shows.
good,"Most days are spent sitting at your desk processing requests. While I was there we launched a new software system. unfortunately not everyone was properly trained. The best part of this job was the HR department tried to keep everyone happy with monthly activities for the office including a happy hour, game night and office olympics."
good,I would work for them again. It's been a while since I worked for them but a good company to work for.
good,"Viacom is an amazing place to work. The management team in the sales department is all about creating a work/life balance. There is no such thing as a typical day in the office. Every day brings new, exciting challenges. It's very much a work family environment with a chance to attend amazing events and meet clients."
good,MTV Networks used to be Awesome. It's entertainment. I don't know how they are doing now with all the reality shows.
good,A typical day at work would include sourcing and finding the best manufacturing companies to produce quality kid clothing and hardline merchandise.
good,"Make sure you are well prepared for an interview. Don't be late and be yourself no matter what."
good,"Although I was an intern, I was given many responsibilities that made me appreciate the role I was in. A typical day did not exist as I was always doing something different. Granted, these different things were great as it helped me expand my knowledge. The management really depends on the team you work for. I had one manager who was very strict and always sought for the work to get done. I had another very laid back and understanding manager who was open to me exploring other options while I worked on her team. The hardest part of the job would have to be picking up and learning the role. The most enjoyable part was definitely the company culture- it is very relaxed and most of the people working there are relatively young."
good,"The work is similar to other companies in the industry, however, the work life balance and other perks provided by the company are unmatched, especially by companies similar by size and content"
good,Great collaborative environment with a very diverse cultures.  Lots of employee engagement activities and events.  Incorporated employees thoughts in the day to day work culture and believed in evolving with the times especially social media engagement.
good,Overall good experience with lot of work. Benefits are good. People are friendly and knowledgeable and location is very good. Right at the heart of lincoln Mall Road.
good,"Viacom provided an environment where you could learn and excel."
good,I worked at Viacom full-time for more than a year. Young and relaxed work environment with opportunities to connect with people in different brands. Fun place to work.
good,"A typical day working at Viacom will strongly depend on your department.  However, as a former Logistic Specialist our days would consist of placing commercials on a specific network on a particular day.  I've learned how the sales team and logistics team work hand and hand to complete the process of airing commercials.  The culture  at Viacom is employee friendly.  The hardest part of the job is staying late due to busy times during the year.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you become close to."
good,"Great atmosphere. Almost as if you are getting paid to work with your smart best friends. the news industry by nature is competitive and constant. You can't control the cycle so you are always at the whim to what people are doing across the nation. It's exciting and important and it never gets old. "
good,"Viacom provided the kind of work environment where I was enthusiastic about coming into work. It was the first major fast-paced production company I had the pleasure of working with. The projects assigned to me allowed for me to gain a greater knowledge of broadcast media as a whole. If I get the opportunity to work with them again, I would do it in a heart beat."
good,"It's a very fun and inspiring company to work at, however salaries are often/always lower than market price. I advanced from an assistant producer to a software engineer in three years. They do invest in your growth, but then eventually you reach a ceiling that's not as high as you want to be, and it's more difficult to get raises or promotions. So the deal with this company is that you take advantage and learn as much as you can and you become very valuable to the company, but when you feel it's time to grow and the opportunities and challenges stop, it's time to move on."
good,Relationship building should be the goal while working at Viacom.  It will go a long way toward advancement.  Remaining focused and paying attention to detail are paramount.
good,"I went here for an internship program. The company itself is really well maintained and organized. I learned a lot in my internship but I wish the program kept a better handle on supervisors of interns because my supervisor during the program was not great at all. Other than that, fun place to work."
good,"My co-workers were some of the smartest professionals I've ever worked with.  Management was at time very demanding, which made for a very tense work environment"
good,I love working here - such cool work environment. People are extremely nice and I crave to come to work everyday. Sky is the limit to growth and your managers are always helpful to help you grow. I think one of the best companies to work for to learn and grow
good,"Working in the Television/Media Industry, my days are long. I've learned that time management skills are essential and establishing trustworthy relationships with co-workers are critical elements for this career field. The hardest part of the job is being away from family due to long hours worked. The most enjoyable part of the job are the individuals that I have met throughout my career."
good,"Good and Helpful people around, lot to learn from each other."
good,"The people I meet there and the skills and knowledge that I gained will be forever be with me while I go through the next stage of my professional career. The time I spent with BET will be a experience that I will never forget, after meeting countless prominent people in the television and music industry and listening to them as they taught me on what it take to break into this cut throat industry.  "
good,"Great benefits, perks and company culture. I enjoy working here and enjoy the people I work with. Great internal mobility and opportunities to advance."
good,"Great culture and creative mindset, values employee contribution. The industry is going through a major transformation as linear television viewership is going down, but the company has been handling this well."
good,Extremely recognizable brand and deep history but hard to transition internally. Must go above and beyond to network and meet people as there is not a standardized method of moving people around and up.
good,"Typical day at work, is normally full of meetings. I have learned how to better synchronize myself with the team at VIACOM and the Management has been very supportive."
good,"Viacom was a an amazing experience. I was only an intern, so I have to limit my experience to the limited amount of time that I was there. However, the internship program was fantastic."
good,Managed day to day financial activities for Viacom's licensing division.
good,"There is not a day to day schedule for the interns so it is up to you to make the most of it and see if anyone needs help. Otherwise next thing you know, the semester has gone by and you haven't really learned much."
good,"Viacom was a lovely company to work for, as well as a great company to start at as a first job. Although a global and well recognized company - Viacom  Lacks company culture."
good,"Although I worked on a quick turnaround contract, I thoroughly enjoyed my short spell with the company."
good,I worked at the 2018 VMA's and I worked with the event staff. I helped explain the schedule of the weekend to the VIP guests. Everyone was very professional and helpful. It was a great experience.
good,"As a junior coordinator at Viacom I helped in the Special Events department to plan specific aspects of large scale events, from planning and designing t-shirts, ornaments, and signs, to screening and hiring Production Assistants. There were always opportunities to show my leadership, skills and ingenuity, because they are always looking for the most efficient and intelligent way to execute projects, so if you've got good ideas, they want to hear them. I honestly came in as a production assistant for a New Year's Eve party that someone had referred me to, they saw my leadership abilities, interest in the work and my can-do attitude and just kept brining me back until the Junior Coordinator position opened up and I was a shoe in for it by that point. I'd established my work ethic, built relationships and showed how reliable I was. I had literally just landed from a red eye flight from LA to NYC, went home, showered up, put on my best suit and went into the interview prepared, confident, and with all of my answers and questions ready."
good,I really enjoyed my time interning at Viacom several summers ago. It is such a creative and high-energy environment that I love to be around. The people who work their obviously love their jobs and have a passion for what they do.
good,"This is a great place to work, with a friendly environment and a company that takes care of you"
good,I loved the team I was on and the projects I was sourced on.  I always had a challenging problem to work through with my team and looked forward to going into work each day!
good,I enjoyed the projects I worked on and the people I worked with.  My direct management team was awesome.  If given the opportunity I would definitely return.
good,Gained simple entry level experience learning beginner tasks. Management was rarely available. Culture was very relaxing. The Viacom building is in proximity to Times Square
good,Great place to work. Lot's of freedom to do what you need to assist with a comfortable work ambiance. Which in turn allows the aesthetics to flow. State of the Art equipment for you to execute .
good,This was internship...review is the same for Viacom overall. I very much my internship and that's why I was so happy when I was hire full time within the company.
good,Viacom is an excellent place to work for but getting promoted has been proven to be difficult. The commute is especially grueling and the salary does not make up for it.
good,"My experience at Viacom/Paramount Pictures was a good one. Their expectations were high, but it was an opportunity to learn a lot.  They  always allowed you to try something new."
good,The work environment and people were great! Worked with an excellent team who were very hands on. They reviewed my work with me and gave me opportunities to participate fully with the team.
good,Wonderful co-workers and exciting place to work not really a place to grow your career though.  No advancement from within you had to leave and get a title/pay bump and then you could go back over.
good,"Work remotely to help with creative and production design for Retail, Packaging, Events and Illustration groups. Am hired for projects when their internal team has overflow or a need for my expertise."
good,"Loved my time there and the people too. Friendly environment, very skilled workers and amazing talent. Made a lot of good friends that i still keep in touch with to this day."
good,"The benefits were good but the salaries are usually lower.  Great place to start your career in media but you must be willing to work very long hours and be flexible with constantly changing priorities.  I loved working at BET, many cool people and a fun working environment.  The people were extremely nice and I enjoyed going to work.  Always areas for growth and the managers were always helpful.  Very talent group of people, dedicated to creative work.  I learned so much and would do it again in a heartbeat! I think one of the best companies to work for to learn and grow."
good,"Working at Viacom was an amazing experience and I am so grateful to have been given this opportunity. A typical day at Viacom was productive, yet relaxing and I always managed to get my work done without leaving the office feeling stressed. I learned a lot during my time at Viacom from simply asking the right questions about a project or assignment to how to take well-written notes on a quarterly report. Overall, I enjoyed my time at Viacom and I would most definitely consider working there again come gradation."
good,Viacom provides interns with a great learning experience along with the ability to understand different areas of the media industry.
good,A typical day at Nick Digital was always exciting and something new. Learned a lot about developing content for online and for apps. Always work to be done. great environment with great people.
good,"creative, productive,, friendly co workers, I enjoyed working there really good place to develop and learn."
good,"I have played a role for many years to administer financial applications, server as a liaison between the finance and IT teams. I have managed many large projects and served on steering committees to implement new applications and build better processes and provide support to the stakeholders. I have worked with Senior Management across many levels to understand their requirements and meet their timelines. "
good,"Viacom provides a lot of benefits for their employees, as well as plenty of opportunities to improve on your skill set."
good,Viacom was fun and challenging.  I was able to challenge myself and have fun at the same time - the perfect combination.

good,Greeted guest and celebrities. Employees were all very energetic and creative.
good,"Having the opportunity to work with an established group of people, for an organization that I had been keeping my eye on since I was 12 was the best!  The department that I worked in had a strong handle on the pulse of current times and constantly looking to evolve.  Professionalism, comfort, family bond and evolution are the words that come to mind when I think of them."
good,"•	Participated in a formal internship program"
good,This was an amazing opportunity.  I was able to work in many different departments completing assignments for nine different attorneys. 
good,"Viacom was an excellent company to intern with.  I learned a lot through my two internships there, and I was happy to be involved with meaningful projects.  "
good,"I helped Viacom to help set up their retail division and overseas sourcing and development network for their flagship entertainment retail stores. The plan was to also retro fit the existing Blockbuster stores to sell product based on many of the Viacom properties (Nickelodeon, Nick at Night, MTV, VH1, TV Land, Paramount Pictures and Star Trek)"
good,Viacom Media Networks allowed me to be an independent thinker as well as allowing me the ability and freedom to improve processes.  It was an enjoyable place to work but it was very difficult to receive promotions.
good,"What I learned from being an intern for the MTV Research department at Viacom is that every moment is an opportunity. People may forget your name or your existence, but you make yourself memorable. I learned how to make myself stand out and find projects to work on. I worked on my own plans and presented my ideas to the Vice President of the Research Team every opportunity that I was given."
good,Learned a lot about the entertainment industry and about the goals and culture of Viacom Media Networks.
good,"I worked as an intern for Viacom. It was unpaid with a long commute but I loved every second of it. I always had something to do and was able to learn what it's like to work in a real world environment. A typical week included constructing media lists, attending creative/press meetings, filing clips and mentions, and running errands through the city. It was fun and I miss it.  There were no openings in my department to continue working there."
good,I have learned a great deal with this company in all aspects of entertainment. There was not a day that went by where I didnt learn something. Viacom is a great company for growth
good,This job was like basic training or boot camp for working in any support position. I learned a ton of skills that I was able to apply to other positions.

good,"I was on a laser focus track for growth and career development at CMT. I was AMAZED how perfectly my career path was leading exactly where I hoped it would. It was the highlight of my career. I was doing things I loved to do and thrilled with my position. I never wanted it to end. "
good,"I would work for Viacom again in a heartbeat."
good,You work hard and play hard with the best in the business. Playtime for employees is second to none. One of the best companies to work for with easy access to advancement.
good,Awesome company. Behind the times with content but catching up. Management is lacking people skills but everyone can't be perfect. Would definitely recommend working here.
good,Worked closely with Executives and independently to provide support in the absence of their regular Executive Assistants.
good,"Good place to work. Great work/Life balance."
good,• In charge of all fixed assets divisions of Viacom (MTV Networks/BET/Paramount Pictures/DreamWorks/Corporate Division). Any asset Viacom places (hundreds of thousands in quantity) into service during the fiscal year I am responsible for maintaining the GAP/TAX/ADS lives of each asset. As well as computing and calculating Viacom’s bonus depreciation adjustments each year by legal entity based on current IRS updated regulations.
good,"One of the best AE jobs I ever had - Learned a lot on the fly and worked with a lot of great people. Wish I was able to stay on, but moved to LA, and there was no opp in LA for me"
good,I learn something new at every event. They are very professional and willing to help in any obstacle we may have along the way in the events. Team work is very strong here.
good,"20+ years and definitely fun, fair and a great experience."

Obtained Rights and Permissions for all content included in programming over various media platforms.  Included programming: Awards Specials, Benefit Concerts, Music Festivals, Documentaries, Promotional Campaigns, New Media Platform content partnerships and branding."
good,It was very excited to meet and greet celebrities and have experience more about on- ground sales and online marketing. It was a very different experience.
good,Great group of professionals collaborating on putting together an event that gets broadcasted on the network. Safety standards are high and we take risk management very seriously.
good,My experience at Viacom was an up an down one. I really like the team I worked with in the talent relations department but my internship coordinator was disorganized and unprofessional.
good,"Viacom was a wonderful place to work. There were a lot of strong leaders and people who wanted to be there. I was with 4 other interns during my internship, and they were all girls, which made me stand out if I did anything slightly different. But overall, I wasn't treated differently and enjoyed my time there. "
good,Im working freelance now and love everything about it ! highers up are helpful and its a great place to be. Advancing to full time is hard but I am optimistic.
good,"Great Experience with one of the largest media companies in the world. Technologically advanced, but times are changing with the recent news. Promotions/Career advancement are hard to come by."
good,I had a great experience at Viacom as an intern. I was able to learn and apply myself to real situations that happen throughout the work week on a normal basis in my department. I had the most amazing mentorship from my boss and other colleagues at Viacom and loved the youthful environment.
good,"Having worked on a set of projects at Viacom, I was pleasntly surprised to be in a company who was sensitive to its workers needs and requirements. When I saw the fountain soda machine and the coffee machine, I thought that I had died and gone to heaven....I could have all the soda I wanted and all the coffee I wanted....without paying, too.  Thank you. "
good,This is probably once of the best companies I have worked for in a long time. Great co-workers always willing to lend a hand and support each other. The clients were always great to work with and trusted our choices and suggestions.

good,"-collaborate with sales, marketing, inventory, and pricing"
good,Great environment. People oriented. Stable and well put together
good,"Working as an intern for Viacom's MTV Networks and Comedy Central was amazing. A typical work day was filled with lots of administrative duties, but this is normal in entertinment companies. This is also where I learned to work with multiple executive staff members while understanding how to adjust to different work styles and maintaining organization to benefit everyone. This was challenging in the beginning; but it was necessary for me to learn how to balance working for all of the staff members so that we could all continually contribute to the legacy this company had worked to build and maintain. The staff was always nice and interns were always allowed to ask questions to attain knowledge that could ensure career advancement. The most enjoyable part of my job was watching many of the shows that I viewed on televison being created from the ground floor."
good,Very good experiences and opportunities. Worked with a great team of technicians and the projects were interesting.

good,Culture/environment conducive to productivity. Intelligent group of employees with integrity.  Company with great benefits and opportunities to grow within the organization.
good,"Viacom has become a family and a home away from home. Their hiring practices are top of the line and their employees are as well. I have never worked with a more dedicated team of professionals and am proud of my time spent with the company. Every new day comes with new challenges and focus as the Media distribution filed is ever changing. This requires constant a ability to adjust and a fast paced attitude. Sometimes the hardest part of the job is remembering to take a lunch break. I have learned flexibility, dynamic work flow and above all how to work in a team whose whole is greater than the sum of its parts."
good,"The best thing about this company and that people rarely leave and everyone is happy. Hours are flexible, and there are great access to a lot of perk not to mention the location its a great place to work."
good,"Really nice company and team. It was a fun job that was very fast paced. There is always something to do, and while it may seem pretty hectic, it is always manageable."

I was so honored to be offered my position. The culture is absolutely fantastic! There's always something fun going on in terms of events, training sessions, mixers, etc. Also, I was fortunate enough to work with the fantastic talent acquisition team. The TA team is more of a family. It was a pleasure working with them and being able to connect with hundreds of people throughout the organization across all of our brands,"

good,"Great place to work, company culture is team oriented and encourages to branch out beyond ones department. Internal mobility is slow but not impossible."
good,Really fun great place to work great bosses. You get to see all the great people in entertainment work with the best production crews in america and sometimes be on TV.
good,"Viacom is a great place to work. They really focus on the employee and provide a lot of great benefits. The company is very progressive and forward-looking, keeping up with the latest technology and trends."
good,"Well is was a three day work  week for the bet awards."
good,"12 hour shifts. Balanced 65 networks. Co-workers fantastic. Daily chores never ended. Management constantly looking for ""whose to blame"" with all employees. Learned the value of good operating team and efforts between teams."
good,I work with great people who are passionate about working at Viacom. Our brands are fun and are the best at what they do. The best part of my job is meeting with hiring manager and solving their business needs by presenting great candidates.
good,The people at Viacom are super nice and very willing to help you grow. You learn so much and acquire new skills easily.
good,I was the research intern and my typical day included gathering data and analyzing it. I also assisted in the development of questionnaires. I had the opportunity to work with a diverse group of people that worked hard and enjoyed their job.
good,Great place to work if you are at all interested in the film/television business. Learned a lot while I was there from all aspects of the company. Really good to their employees as well.

good,"As an intern working at Viacom (MTV) was my first job in an television production company. It was amazing. I learned so much and was exposed to everything I always wanted to learn and be apart of after majoring in Television Productions at Howard University. After this internship, I then received production assistant positions at MTV and BET Networks. They were all great and the only down fall is that when the project is over, you are no longer employed."
good,Viacom was a great company to work for with access to senior leadership.  They were an open organization that listened to their employees and welcomed their suggestions and feedback.  Excellent at communicating with their employees through newsletters and town hall meetings.
good,"As an intern at Viacom for two years, I have had nothing but fantastic experiences with encouraging mentors and bountiful opportunities for career advancement. I feel as though the company cares greatly for it's interns, as Viacom provides a number of outreach activities, guest seminars, and career development panels to help further an intern's career."
good,"Granted I was only an intern at this office but the job is really self taught (for the most part). I worked with their IS and IT departments operating multiple floors within their 52 floor building complex. When I say self-taught I mean they will work with you to understand how the work flow is but if you are fully capable of taking on task on your own they will treat you as if you are working fulltime there. I got to the point in my internship where I wasn't under any major supervision but I could handle pretty much any task on my own with minimal supervision. Pretty much if you're good at what you do, they will take notice and let you take on task on your own as they become available. I love this. Great place to work."
good,Great people. Snacks all the time. Great learning experience. I loved it so much. Great environment. I learned so much about recruiting and I feel so confident moving forward in my career because of this experience.
good,Would recommend! The company culture along with the guidance from management truly makes Viacom a great learning experience. Hard part is finding a job afterwards since lack of spots available
good,"I would normally get to the office, log into the systems that I needed and check my email. Because I dealt with Europe and the US, if there were any issues from Europe, those would take priority, unless there was an emergency situation. I would then review any invoices that had not been scheduled for payment from the day before. Once those had been addressed, I would start on the invoices that needed to be addressed that day. "
good,Love working with Viacom has great flexibility in writing freedom as well as great direction on what they need as in projects and new jobs. Very well organized system highly recommended!
good,"Viacom Staff Reception, cover other team receptionist  for relief breaks time and for lunch time. Answer the phone, schedule and confirmed meeting for new clients with appointment. Respond to email request file or faxes.  Answer phone call and screen direct calls, take a messages and relays messages. Resources information is mandattory to be updated"
good,Love love love this company! Such a big company but the teams are small and personal. My supervisors wanted me to do nothing but learn with my time there.
good,"At Viacom I learned how to be a better engineer, you are around GREAT and strong engineers and they as our lead architect would say ""Stay with us, we will make you better"""
good,"- Monitor content promotions on partner platforms"
good,"Viacom has the greatest employees.  I was blessed with the greatest co-workers.  We all worked together, helped each other, and always taught each other new technologies each week.  We supported each other goals and accomplishments..  The people make it a great place to work."
good,"Great company culture, it will surprise you in so many ways. People are so kind and hard working. There are so many great events and open bar, parties for everyone. "
good,"Wonderful place to work."
good,"I was an intern for the Digital Production team. It was a wonderful experience. I participated in all meetings, helped build the VH1 app and wrote for the VH1 Blog."
good,Great Management. Recognitions of my performance and structure to learn more about accounting and collections. Given progressively greater responsibilities and opportunities.
good,Great ten week internship. I learned a lot on the pre and post production aspects of a television show. I know how to run a popular show. Also MTV flew me to LA to film a special.
good,"Viacom offered many opportunities to gain knowledge and skills in the entertainment and publishing industries.  As a member of the young and energetic audit team, I travelled to many locations of Simon & Schuster and Paramount Pictures to examine their internal controls and provide recommendations for improvement."
good,I enjoyed working at Viacom. I look forward to openings at this company in the future that might be a better match for my skills / talents
good,The hardest part of my job was not having enough hours in the day to master all of the different principles that I wanted to master from the experience.
good,I never worked for a company that really praticed team work. I think everyone says it but not many people practice it. the hardest part of this job was being so young it took a littlle extra effort to be taken serious. The most enjoyable part was that it was a very fun and relax enviroment.
good,"I learned so much while interning here, more than any of my previous internships. This internship program was well organized, and super fun! I would recommend to anyone."
good,"A typical day at work was fostered my enormous creativity and easy to come by productivity."
good,"Happy employees are healthier"
good,"Viacom has a wonder lax work environment. Coming into work every weekday was not stressful and could work at your own pace which was very beneficial. Management and staff were always pleasant and always available to assist you when needed. "
good,"Great company with great environment. Open to new ideas and up to date with new trends, technology.Great teamwork, the management has great respect to their employees"
good,"I loved my internship with VH1. The staff is a made up of a group of super hard working, friendly and knowledgeable people. They were able to teach me a great deal about the industry."
good,Viacom is wonderful place to be immersed in every imaginable aspect of the media landscape.  The people there are incredibly interesting and creative -- hiring the right types of talent has been a priority there for decades.  And the work I did there was always challenging.
good,"A day at Viacom's Service Desk entails:"
good,"I worked for Viacom's ""BET Experience"" two years in a row and each time was amazing. I started as Production Assistant the first year. The second year I worked I was an Associate Producer with my own crew. The producer didn't show so they allowed me to prove to them I could produce and handle the task. The footage from my team was used the most. The guys I worked with, on the my team, were awesome and professional. All and all, the entire staff for the BET Experience was professional, quick, and open minded. I would love to work with any one of Viacom's stations."
good,"A wonderful atmosphere to concentrate on work related stuff, with a great culture of group/team effort. "
good,"Positive work environment, great team work and associates.  Excellent benefits and compensation."
good,The environment at Viacom is very casual and comfortable. Employee interactions are always positive and encouraging. The benefits the company offers are motivational for strong work ethic from their employees. Overall a great company.
good,Great and fun atmosphere. The projects and day-to-day work are completed in a timely manner due to management not micro-managing their employees.
good,I enjoyed my time with Viacom and working with my team directly.
