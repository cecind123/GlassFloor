rating,review
bad,There is nothing positive to say about the SIU. Manager turnover is an issue. Training is huge issue. The dramatics of the staff are and issue. Overall I have never heard anything positive about the SIU.
bad,Worked on four projects concurrently for 16 months without title or compensation because I was led to believe it would result in a promotion. Boy was I wrong.
bad,"They expect you to do everyone else’s work without any training or experience. Send you escalated claims expecting you to get them done ASAP, without any previous experience in those sort of claims. Horrible management, never in my life have I ever been treated so terribly, degraded and disrespected. They talk to you like you are a child, that needs to be talked down to... :-("
bad,Management does NOT communicate well at all! It’s like playing a game of telephone  by the time information makes its way to staff there are several versions that differ from the original content. That’s if staff is told anything at all.
bad,"The people the staff the environment the culture is toxic. The training environment is delusional, it's like walking into the Lion's Den with pork chop drawers on. And it's the worst job I've ever had in my life! Everyone there is a liar! Actually hate being there!"
bad,"This company values those who are lucky to get into management but even those positions are a joke. Those in management look like they were chosen by luck of the draw and most of the time while you are slaving away at your job, management is taking their sweet time, joking around, and acting like they have better things they could be doing with their lives. I have never worked in a place where my past education has been so disregarded. At Centene you either hand over your soul to them or they will penalize you for it. Going to work everyday is literally walking into a building where everyone hates their job, you get penalized if you are out of adherence with your stats or if you get sick and have to miss a day, AND you are promised compensation for your work but you never get it. Not only have I become mentally and emotionally unstable due to this job but my physical health has declined as well since working here. So do yourself a favor, and don't even think about working here. You will save your health and a daily headache at that."
bad,Working here was awful i was in the call center for years huge favoritism and if your not in the right side of things life is terrible for you. Seeing people move on to other areas and other states with the treatment just as bad made me happy to leave.
bad,Told by tracy the supervisor that i dont need to attend the meeting as its for full time ppl and i was a temp. Meanwhile the meeting was there near my desk. Humiliating. I left then was fired. Great to not work there anymore
bad,Couldn’t stand how boring it was. No work was offered. Sat staring at a computer all day. There was an odd tension in the air. Manager was suddenly weird.
bad,You only advance to another position if you know someone. It doesn't matter how good you are at your job. You are a worker bee that is it. Coming to work and doing your job great means nothing.
bad,"The people that I managed, my director and other employees. I enjoyed the people but did not enjoy the organization and the goals and direction of the department."
bad,The company worked with an insurance company that is just horrid to customers and you have to deal with customers who are upset because their insurance denied their claim yet you can't do anything about it.
bad,"This company has great benefits. Management was terrible, not enough help.  Working 14 + hrs a day plus weekends.  Calling into meeting frequently that was useless."
bad,I did not like the job or the people I worked with. The job was physically stressful and I asked to be moved to a different department and they laid me off instead.
bad,This is not health insurance it is straight up medicaid quality insurance. Clinics only. If a person got cancer it was a literal screw you wrong company to buy from also if you need pain management it is a bigger screw you.
bad,Poor leadership no one know what they are doing. Say they care about people but it is a lie. Management attempts to process client contract but lack proper skills and knowledge. Considering suing the Chicago office Envolve particularly the customer service director
bad,"Centene does not give two hoots about their employees or members. Centene is all about making profit."
bad,I worked for this company for several years and tolerated a lot of injustice and favoritism go on in all department! Management do not value their employees at all if you don't bend over backward for management then you will not get far with this company.
bad,"I would not recommend this company to anyone.  They have a difficult management structure, lack of leadership skills, lack of training, and  high expectation of you'll figure it out."
bad,"Age discrimination practiced there. You sit at your desk with no access to programs for months and then they say"" you are a nice person and you did nothing wrong after the supervisor has been beating up with saying       "" you cannot remember!"" Then she let's you go!!"
bad,"Unfortunately the micromanaging and management were so awful and very nature of a call center allowed zero deviation from your schedule or you were docked points for your day.  You were docked points for using the bathroom if you were not scheduled for a formal break.  They promise to bring contracted staff on within 3 months during the interview but once you spend 4 weeks in training the management tells new hires that nobody gets benefits until 6 months of being a temporary employee.  All of the employees confirmed they were not hired as full time with benefits until after 6 months.  Beware of the temp agency's that say anything to sign you on and then try to get you to pay for their benefit package after 3 months.  Culture is bad, pay brings some unsavory people.  Management brings everyone on as the Resolutions Team which is nightmare position dealing with all angry and upset people.  Management did not promote from within to new department's and brought new hires on who were allowed to go to better teams like authorization and home modification teams."
bad,"My manager was a bully who engaged in the following unprofessional behavior:"
bad,"This place is a meat grinder. Only apply if you need a big name on your resume. Some teams are OK, mainly IT. Teams like Marketing and Compliance... just stay away!"
bad,The company is a complete joke.You get 2 15 min breaks.If you have to go to the bathroom before your break you have take the time out your 15 min break. Mangement is a joke alot of favoritism.The trainer is a complete joke with cavemen feet.
bad,"It was not a good FIT for me...Management plays games with other peoples lives,  do not care about the impact. I would not work there again, but other people may find it tolerable."
bad,"This is the most dysfunctional company I have ever worked for. They say all of the right things, but behind the scenes it is not as it appears. My department had a leader that came from the outside and never took the time to even learn what we did. He took advice from people within the department that have historically shown they lack any leadership ability, yet still had a major say in the decisions. The main concern was how things look to management at the corporate office. Things were overlooked and not dealt with appropriately, all the while upper management was given the impression that all was great. Skill or knowledge got you nowhere as it was a popularity contest and the Director wanted you to pretend like everything was great. Rarely anything was communicated and decisions were made with very little explanation or use of data or logic. I would describe it as emotion based decisions. I know they are a big company, but they have grown way too fast without the proper controls in place. If you have a choice and are weighing whether to work here or not, I would suggest to run away as fast as you can."
bad,"The day consist of nope."
bad,Pay VERY low. Cost of employee benefits doubles each year. Poor training. Bad technology always down. Call adherence/performance measurements unrealistic and discouraging to those who really want to help customers. Claims are a mess.
bad,"Management treating people like dogs. The management blamed workers instead of poor management. Buddy system for hiring management, Note: when I left Centene, they did not payout my remaining PTO vacation. A custom nearly all companies do."
bad,"Very busy, unorganized environment. Very helpful with training. Alot of meetings to attend takes away from working desk work needed to be done. All ideas are welcome."
bad,Management is disengaged from staff.  Meetings are excessive to the point they impede getting actual work done and things resolved.  No concern as to the reasons behind the alarming attrition.
bad,Talk about a waste of space.  My supervisor didn't even interact with me for 57 days straight.  On time and completed all my work.  Still got canned FU
bad,"Centene is not a good company to work for.  The management at all levels are idiots who lack the mental capacity to lead, guide and direct mainly because they don't know how to do the jobs of the people that they manage.  I am a former employee of Ferguson and the environment is very ghetto and unprofessional.  There is no consistency at all and HR Rep useless."
bad,"Unorganized-- "
bad,Not a pace I would recommend for anybody that doesn't like constant change. Everyday will come with a new operation change and you will have to get used to completely abandoning what your used to dong on a daily basis.
bad,Centene does not promote hiring from within or really concerned with their employees and bettering them. The managers still want to hire contractors.  Working for the company has gotten worse since they made the service desk into a call center.
bad,"Terrible Place to work, solid time off to start, but not worth the salary versus the time.  Treats employees horrible. Was told I work a few extra hours on Monday,  I work every day Sunday-Saturday even on holidays when the companies is closed.  I get paid to be off, but I work all of them."
bad,This job is terrible. It’s a call center so all they care about is numbers. Management is terrible and they don’t care about employees. I’ve witnessed employees walk out on the job in the middle of the day. Prepare to be micromanaged and have someone stand over you telling you what you should be doing. They micromanage everything!! You have to finish the call within a couple of minutes. You have to read the script verbatim. You have to have a certain percentage on all of your calls!!! If you really try to help a member you will have your manager behind you rushing you off the phone because they don’t really care about helping the members. Not enough training is provided and they hire so many temps with the high turnover rate.  I would say only work here if you really need a job but you will get tired of it.
bad,"Very disorganized. This could be a great company in Camp Hill but in my short time there, they are clueless on how to manage staff and the workload.  Management walking around with laptops trying to look important."
bad,Management is horrible and they do a lot of racial profiling at this company. If they get rid of the Management and Director of the Health net department and start over they might just succeed as of right now everything is horrible and they don't have a good quality team there that has know idea how they are grading reps that's why it's a high turn over please stay away from this dept and the Resolution dept and trying to become a MA (member advocate) Horrible place to work
bad,"I am still trying to get my first paycheck!  The management and HR are disorganized.  The management tells you it's the HR Department that needs to release your paycheck.  The HR Department tells you the local management is responsible. It's been over 3 months and I still do not have my check.  I have filed a wage claim with the Arizona Industrial Commission to get my back pay. This company does not treat its employees right. You are a number.  If you produce and maintain your numbers, you are kept. If you question anything, you are ignored or fired. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this unethical company."
bad,Would never recommend someone to work there. Promise pay increase upon more certifications and classes but never follow through. If your a woman don’t expect to move up to supervisor. High employee turnover
bad,"First of all, i'd like to state that management is extremely clicky and advancement is totally based on popularity. That's a small community for ya. But it should be based on experience and resume credentials. Also adding to that, I believe they target struggling communities for two reasons: 1. the land is cheap and easy tax break. 2. They are taking advantage of these communities by bringing promise to a struggling town, knowing that the people that do make a living there, have no other choice but to stay, (keeping them under their thumb by paying just enough to keep them there.) Every person that has been there longer than 5 years is completely miserable and rude. A result of this horrible environment. They do not care of each individual employee, they care only of the entire picture, which is you as an individual do not matter. "
bad,"I relocated to the central valley last year from the bay area where finding a job is no problem yet I was happy to have this job working as pharmacy technician insurance rep here. I was told by the gentleman that recruited me Rx relief, that there would be breakfast at the job for new hires. So I didn't eat at home since I thought I could eat there. Let me say this first though, I was also under the weather and the people there didn't have any material for me to work on. So once I gotten there, not only was I sick, I didn't eat breakfast, they didn't have any refreshments like the recruiter stated to me and they didn't have any work material for me to do training. I was literally just sitting there with an empty growling stomach, sleepy due to no energy, not feeling well and no work material. I checked my phone like 3x since I was just sitting there and of course I was warned yet I also asked if I could go home. The woman there told me if I did then I would have to start the process all over. But if I have no material to work with then what process? I asked because I wasn't well. At the end of my first day, I gotten a call that I was terminated. I was crushed and they didn't allow me to explain myself like look I said I wasn't well, I asked if I could leave and you didn't have any material for me. They took it as if I was uninterested in the job. No! I WAS SICK AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY REFRESHMENTS OR WORK MATERIAL. I felt like I was dying. I have yet to find another job here and I blame them for a**-uming that I was uninterested when they didn't even have their stuff together."
bad,"I worked there for about 2 weeks and all of a sudden they let me go with no explanation. You can not do anything there and they are not fair and show favoritism. If you laugh, burp, cough, sneeze you will get in trouble I was there for those two weeks and got in trouble everyday for those things alone. Although it was a job you cannot be yourself but if you hear other people talking and laughing that's totally fine they don't get in trouble. JUST DO NOT WORK FOR THE COMPANY IT SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,"I think it's horrible that I was making almost $20 and hour as a temp for this company and then when I get hired on permanent I have to take a $3 cut in pay.  Nobody seems to know what is going on half the time, training was inconsistent."
bad,"A hostile work environment in which fake interactions between fellow employees occur on a regular basis.Everyone worked in fear daily to the point that they keep quiet.Team leaders would develop personal ""cliques"" and if you were not liked or a part of that leadership you would be cast aside, targeted daily by management as well as other members on the leadership team. Morale sucked and team leaders along-side the managers would bring out the worst in everyone. If you were not a favorite you would be criticized, shunned by the ""clique"", treated disrespectfully, harassed, and gossiped about. In reference to the fake interactions, many of the leaders and their associates would become friendly with an employee just to find out their weaknesses so it could be reported to management or used as fuel to disseminate amongst their peers. Clueless team leaders would monitor and micromanage all of your interactions; if they found any faults you would be reported to management instantly to be reprimanded. Anyone within the ""clique"" would receive immunity making them exempt from any company rules and or policies that were broken on their behalf; while the least favorite employees would receive a scolding. "
bad,Very stressful!  Being demoralized regularly.by management  The company doesn't care about their employees or the members just the money.  They want average time for each call to be no more than 8 min. Very unethical and corrupt company run by evil people.
bad,Poor management and very ghetto place to work. Not a fair place to work. Pay not enough. They talk a lot but don't follow through very unprofessional place
bad,"I worked at Centene for 9 months.  Brought on board right before open enrollment at the end of last year and it was a nightmare.  Management great about getting on your case if you're numbers were down but spent most of THEIR time in meetings, so no one was on the floor if anyone had questions or needed help.  All the snacks and worthless 'moral boosters' in the world don't cover up the fact that this is a c**p place to work."
bad,"No work is recognized, Software leads has no knowledge of basic software development. Friends with Manager or director will get the promotion. Not recommended."
bad,The training did not cover EVERYTHING! The management is poor and if you try to go over a particular sup head you will be fired. Has been proven twice
bad,"ITOC GROUP HAD THE WORST MANAGEMENT (in Clayton, MO)!!!!!!!!!  They weren't looking out for the techs and engineers there, they only cared about the company's needs.........PERIOD!!!!!!!"
bad,"Management was undesirable and very ""clicky"".  Exceptions were made for friends of management regarding assignments and paid time off; other coworkers were not taken into consideration in regard."
bad,"Centene Corporation is one if not the absolute worse companies to work for.  The work environment is extremely polarizing, and stressful.  They provide staff with Supervisors/Managers who lack experience and knowledge and they micromanage staff memebers like they are overseers on a slave plantation.  I would never recommend anyone to work for this company."
bad,"No culture, bad management and no support from the leadership"
bad,"Performance reviews are a great way to boost productivity and engage with your team. Sometimes, however, it’s not quite that simple. Especially when you’re faced with having to give an under-performing employee a negative review."
bad,"I have been at this company for over 10 years, it has gotten worse, the management holds no one accountable and it seems more like high school than a corporate company."
bad,"i joined Centene because I liked their mission statements and core values which was to treat every person with respect. While the upper management does do that, they hired a bunch of mid-level managers with cut throat culture who are an extreme opposite of the culture that Centene advocates."
bad,Horrible customers and ZERO doctors in the area for your customers. The average person lasts about 4 months there. The training was decent but the center itself was ghetto. They only exist because of Obamacare which is going away.
bad,"Need ethic training, For all departments. I Made the best out of each day. The most enjoyable part of my day was helping each customer to enjoy there day better by providing exceptional customer service."
bad,"Management is the problem. Arrogant and doesn't listen to the people. Too much gossip. Upper management put a freeze on tranfers to other Centene companies back in April which hurt chances of people leaving. The so called raise wasn't enough to by a postal stamp. Management cares about the numbers not the employees. Good luck getting time off. Members of leadership will hold you down and talk bad about you to other reps. Centene itself is decent. Acaria health is the problem. Don't get sick more than 4 times a year, anything after that you are penalized even with a doctor's note. Don't let your kids get sick either."
bad,"Employee turn-over rate was pretty high because the trainers, supervisors and managers were awful! Very hectic work, very critical and hurtful reviews, can't go to the bathroom without asking, poor morale among employees."
bad,"You have to know someone in order to get a promotion, it seems with this company.  Not fun of a call center, but it is a job, so that's why I am still there.  The pay is decent and the benefits are good."
bad,management only cares about ordering food and what they did on the weekend. management talks badly about employees loudly to other workers on the floor. very unprofessional
bad,Unfair and illegal business practices.  Forced to work weekends and not get paid for it.  Discriminatory.  Management does not fairly promote or evaluate employees job performance
bad,This place will put your license in jeopardy. They have a bipolar manager who is not qualified running the STAR KIDS program. It's not what you know but if you kiss managements butt to keep your job
bad,They make up rules as you go. Not fair environment. No training everything is based off opinions. Nothing is based on polices and procedures because they don't have none.
bad,"Easy work bad environment horrible managers/supervisors"
bad,As a nearly Deaf person this was a very difficult company to work for as a contractor.  Company worked people 16-20 days and only paying for 8 hrs a day.  Many Management issue
bad,Typical day at work for the most part is assisting our CSR with difficult escalations and assisting them with resources. That is the best feeling to be able to help someone with all the available resources in order for them to get the job done.  The hardest thing about this job is the lack of communication between upper management and our reps.  I've enjoyed the experience but I would like to be with a company that views my opinions as an equal and communicate what exactly it is that is needing to be done as well as an opportunity for improvement.
bad,"Work you to death and lie on you, threaten and you will starve and drop dead.Aerotek sent me there and believed their lies when they got rid of me"
bad,"The management was bad, in the department that i was in. If i got another chance to work here i would definitely be in another department not in the call center members side."
bad,"Horrible experience, very unprofessional atmosphere, HR & Management at CENTENE / SUPERIOR HEALTH in San Antonio, TX and Austin, TX locations were a joke. "
bad,"I was a Manager with this company.  I have had a 20+ year as a healthcare executive.  This organization is the worst healthcare company that I have worked for in my career.  Their operational systems are broken.  They do not seem to care.  Consequently, the stress and pressure on human resources is intense.  Staff are overworked and there is no work/life balance.  Management staff does not for the most part care about their employees.  They have allowed the company to grow organically over the past several years without a strategic plan to grow business and operational infrastructure."
bad,"I worked as a Temp Employee for 9 months and was not hired on for a permanent position. I was told that I would be hired on after 90 days and that didn't happen. I had exceptional audits and reviews and was also a Preceptor training new temps. I was told my contract had ended without any reason at all. Peachstate had no intentions of hiring their temps. No matter how hard you work , or if you are a great employee you will not be hired on."
bad,The company has been growing at a very fast place thus adding quite a bit of strain on people and systems.  The work environment is less than ideal given the composition of the current leadership team.
bad,"Centene itself is a good company to work for.. All of the people there are related and it's a very hostile environment. Furthermore, it's alot of clicks within the work area. The only way to get a position is to be friends with the supervisors. Definitely more training to needs to be provided."
bad,"management is unaware on how to work claims, they take your bonuses make you work long hours with little breaks. they do not care if you have children or not the food in the cafeteria is expensive and not worth the money."
bad,Worst place to EVER apply for employment. Management has no knowledge of the job that they are managing. Management lie. Lied about being hired permanently.
bad,"This is the most unorganized, unorthodox place I have ever worked. The management is pure trash, no leadership or core values whatsoever. Everyday I walked in feeling as if I was going through the motions and not making a bit of difference. From training to walking our of the door on my last day was a huge blur in my life and even more a waste of time. The paycheck was a nice part, I guess...lol. The staff isn't that bad, but the morale of the employees have gone down the drain due to the tops (corporate) inconsistencies trickling down. I am so sad my tax dollars are going to racket companies like this one. With companies like this on place there won't be a penny left when I need Medicare. Huge misappropriation of funds due to untrained and terribly managed staff. Sad, depressing, and sloppy place to WORK, if that's what they call it."
bad,"Lots of favoritism, cultural clicks, abusive, dehumanizing, consider yourself a nurse at a factory,,, its all about the production.  You sit and get fat like the rest of them. They encourage you to rat people out, if you rat out one of their own moles then its going to be how bad of a worker you are after and you should be minding your own work."
bad,This job might seem very interesting for therapists but believe me if you like to be stressed this is the place. You will be working 10+ hours a day and one day of a weekend still the work will not be finished. You will be asked to do so many things in between that you will have little time to actually review the auths. And the time that you are asked to spend with doctors and providers is not considered work time. You are only judged for the number of auths you review. Everyone is so stressed that nobody wants to help learn when you are new. Its a mess. You will see this job posted over and over because very rarely can they have the therapists stay for 6 plus months.
bad,"Not a good company to work for, too many lies, daily threats of termination, rules being made up every 5 minutes.  Unorganized, no class from management, dress code is a joke.  Dress proper on friday and like a stripper during the week."
bad,"First off, they lied about my job posiiton i was hired as a claims processer but i never processed one claim! i worked customer service speaking with providers about there denied medical claims. Management was horrible! we were treated like children our calls monitored, ever call! we were not allowed to even have causal friday we had to dress professional with skirts, not pants for females and stockings?  even though we never saw one patient or provider, our pay was low, with no bonuses. We were allowed to work some overtime once a month for only 6 hours. this is what they considered a bonus! We had to work every holiday even christmas and thanksgiving, we were allowed to choose one of the holidays' but had to work the other. This place was a sweat shop and a heck hole! dont apply here its not worth your time."
bad,"RUN, RUN, RUN!!! Do not apply here unless you are looking for a dead end job. As a care support representative, you are expected to call Medicaid members and perform health assessments over the phone....sounds easy, but most members are wary of people calling them out of the blue and asking for personal information (name, date of birth, address, etc)..most people will not answer your call and if they do answer they think u are trying to steal their identity. You are required to make at least 72 calls per day...work 3 nights per week & 2 weekends per month. This job will be a job for someone straight out of high school or in college with no kids. This company is not a place for someone who needs a job with a home/life balance....if you are looking for a job that allows you to advance your career, then Nurtur Health/Centene is not the place to work. I read the previous comments regarding this job and thought they were just comments from former employees that wanted to paint the company in a negative light b/c of some grudge they had against someone in the company....I was WRONG!!! This is a horrible place to work....favoritism runs rampant!!! The manager mostly hired her church members and allowed them to come in and take off as needed. When those of us that were not members of her church needed to take off, we had to do so w/o pay and it was counted against us, even if we asked for time off in advance....I cannot stress it enough....do not apply here unless you are just desperate for a job!!!"
bad,Only apply with this company if you need a quick check. There is no room for advancement unless you are a nurse or respiratory therapist. They do not allow for any type of balance between home and work. The hours are horrible and favoritism runs rampant....apply at your own risk.....I was with this company for only 3 months and hated every minute of it. The only reason I gave this company/position one star is b/c the website wouldn't allow me to give it less than one star....
bad,"RUN! TOXIC....I can't say enough!!!  This is by far the worst establishment, I've worked at.  Work is meaningful, but management is a joke.  You will regret working at this place.  I read the previous  ratings, but ignored them, hoping things would be different with  Centene, starting out new in California. Employees here are stressed beyond their limits to the point of seeking medical attention. I know this may sound dramatic, but it is the truth."
bad,"I worked in management at Superior HealthPlan in Austin, TX and San Antonio, TX.  I left because I could no longer work in such an unprofessional environment.  They allow non-clinical staff to review and approve highly complex medical care so that they can appear to be keeping up with the state mandated turn around times.  The management is a dictatorship where only a few people actually have a voice.  If you don't go along with that person, they make your life miserable.  It is full of friends who have their positions only because they know certain people.  Almost the entire management, and the majority of the staff, have worked together previously and they are getting positions and promotions based on unethical practices.  RUN.....FAST!!!!  I wish someone had told me before I went there."
bad,"My opinion and my review of Centene Corporation..."
bad,They suck! they work you like a dog and pay low! only if you are desperate dont apply to this company.
bad,"No breaks, no lunches, no job security, descrimination. Management talk to employees like they're animals."
bad,"My wife started working for them and was told that after three months she will be a permanent they have employees that have been there for more than 6 months and are being told that no permanent positions have come available, but during the process they are not being offered permanent positions and are told to qualify they can not be absent even if they are sick or have a doctors appointment. They have to meet a call average of 80 to one hundred calls a day. Each call they have to do a health assessment on every call they make which is will make it impossible to get hired for a permanent position. Every employee either finds another job or just quite and the recruiter is aware of this companies practice but tells you it is a great company to work for and they have great benefits once hired which never happens. They have two women walking around and constantly pushing you to make your quota or you will be let go. They call the recruiter and have them tell you they don't need you to come in any more. very deceiving company if called for an interview decline it or you will be sorry!!! This place is a joke and will be good for someone you do not like......"
bad,Centene out of Texas may be a great place to work but the office in Columbia is a mad house. I worked for the previous Supervisor they fired and she needed mental help. Literally she was crazy and she had gone through so many employees and was very disrespectful and upper management did nothing. It took this lady going through 12 employees over the course of 3 years before she finally made somone off in upper management enough for them to be done with her. I have heard managers yelling at each other in the office. It's really not the place to be. You must be really hard up to even consider working here. Sorry but the truth hurts and I am not disgrutle just honest.
bad,Very unfair work culture.  Management is not helpful in resolving work issues in a timely manner. Too much favoritism in the work environment. No loyalty towards employees. Difficult to be promoted unless you know management in another department or you're friendly with your manager.
bad,"If you are not passionate about health care or insurance you may feel over worked and under a lot of pressure on a daily basis. The work is very repetitive yet frustrating because the rules change constantly and a lot of corners are cut just to meet deadlines. It is not a company or a position I would recommend unless you see yourself pursuing health insurance for many years and you'd like to use this company as a stepping stone. However, I've even see individuals who love health insurance walk away from this company too."
bad,"Middle aged white men making horrible operational decisions while still being promoted without any accountability. "
bad,"Centene really is a good company, Except for the Medicare department. I have worked in this department since 2017 I have seen mangers get fired several supervisors quit and the director quit as well. This is not a good department to work in."
bad,"Compensate your employees before hiring new teams for the same job at a higher rate. Micromanaging is an understatement. No one has the same answer to one question. Supervisors are less than helpful and pass the buck to the next clueless supervisor. You're lucky if any team lead or supervisor ever are available. Some supervisors talk down to you and have no professional filter. The plus is the hour lunch offered that's IF it's not a busy phone day then you get 30 minutes or you have a position off the phones. Management will hear you enough to have a meeting with you, write down your frustrations as an employee, then they say ""we'll see what we can do"" and nothing ever gets done. It's a vicious and stressful place."
bad,"Talks about training, tells you to do in on your own time."
bad,"as the company may have overhired external nurses they weeded out nurses not based on work ethic and professionalism and dependability but rather based on a false accusations about what one may have have been accused on commenting about a person of color or politics and would not weigh both sides of a situation fairly. Management and orientation was disorganized and most employees and supervisors were off site. This company leans very far left in terms of peoples opinions (which should never be uttered of course in the work place naturally) Employees know not to discuss politics, religion or any non professional content, however, a person can be easily accused of saying something that was misheard and instead of being confronted for clarification one is simply axed at the end of the day with no explanation"
bad,"Felt compelled to try and make a difference with the ,Medicaid population and was very alone in my commitment to serve the underserved.  "
bad,"There is no room for advancement at ARTC, supervisor   and upper management always threaten to write Care Coordinators. There are daily emails from supervisors stating ' if you do not get your number up you will receive a verbal and then a write up'. The manager does not know what she is doing and it causes confusion from the supervisors on down."
bad,"Even for a call center the environment was horrible. Promotions or lateral moves were based on whether or not your supervisor liked you,not merit or job performance.Morale was low and management did nothing to assist. We were micro managed to the point of harassment and upon promotion,management is not given any sort of training to make them capable of performing correctly in that role."
bad,this place is a joke! management doesn't care about their employees morale is low and I'm so glad I got away when I did. you are working for quality not the member no matter how much members praise you they are all about numbers they make quality impossible to pass people are stressed everyday coming into this environment it's ridiculous. you have managers who care more about flirting and being on their cell phones then sticking up for their employees. all they do is stuff their faces and gossip. stay far from this place they need to be shut down
bad,"Crazy making place to work. Rules change on a whim. If you’re a favorite then you might stay there more than a year. Lack of transparency, managers will not be on your side, and the main focus is on metrics. Horrible place to work. It was like being in grade school all over again. Coworkers would complain daily. Don’t do it, you’ll regret it."
bad,"The Corporate offices in St. Louis lack clear communication to Health Net of California which causes last minute scurrying, confused senior leadership and an atmosphere of constant chaos.  The hours are long and extra efforts not appreciated by management but are expected. There is zero work-life balance.  The culture is depressed since Health Net was acquired by Centene two years ago.  Senior leadership lacks ability to lead and they are out of touch with the middle and lower level employees. HR protects senior management and not the general employee.  There are opportunities to learn in a trial by fire environment but other than that there are no positives to working here."
bad,"Limited exposure to the culture of the company, as this was a contractual basis  Meeting and engaging with different individuals, but the opportunity to assist was tremendously rewarding"
bad,The place is a DISASTER. The Management is utterly clueless. Underlings basically running the company because the Supervisors are just dense. And there's a lot of reverse racism and sexism there as well. There's a lot of good people there who work for complete morons and get crapped on. Theye so disorganized there's no attendance policy or dress code in writing. It's like they're making it all up on the fly. Providers and participants are leaving them in droves because they're so disorganized claims aren't being paid. Stay away from them. Stay far away from them
bad,"While they do pay you well, I have had 4 or 5 different supervisors in 2 months, they are disorganized, change their minds hourly, have no idea what they are doing, workflows are incorrect so that you deny claims you should not deny, but to get it changed takes an act of God!  Your questions never get answered, you object to anything, you are treated poorly, and you have to take breaks when and how they say you will.  They are definitely denying claims constantly incorrectly and they KNOW they are!  If they decide it is a big enough deal, they have you hold claims in YOUR queue for months and make you work claims for which you were NEVER trained!  Then when you leave, you can't get your stuff.  Make sure you take everything with you before you leave.  They decide what is yours and MAIL it to you...you can't pick anything up."
bad,Un-realistic work environment. Management have favorites and clicks. Very un-professional vibe.  Not empathetic to needs of employees. NO flexibility for restroom breaks and sick time.
bad,not a good company to work for. HR IS NO HELP. They write you up for any little thing. Even if you are 1 min late. They can careless about your health
bad,I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone with self respect. Upper management is terrible. This place is a revolving door. Under staffed to the point you are stressed. Cannot keep employers because they enjoy firing them and the good ones find something better. Their processes are so unorganized it’s uncomfortable. Managers are pure evil.
bad,Upper management openly states that all employees are replaceable even though they have some really good employees and do nothing to keep them. Star Kids is loosing employees at a 75% rate d/t poor management practices. They have a lack of insight on just how much they can push people before they(management) actually cause them to fail. VERY unrealistic expectations for the CM II and service coordinators. I have to wonder where these people got their degrees that are currently in management. Last time I checked it cost quite a bit to train employees and most never make it to the field to work before they quit and if they do get in the field they leave shortly thereafter. Those who have remained get dumped on to the extent that they have no personal life anymore. The pay is decent but does not off set the amount of hours people in SK program are currently forced to work. Employees have had to work 3 federal holidays that other employees got off and employees were not compensated for those days. All employees have heard is it will get better. FOR WHO? Upper management. They will get some big bonuses off the backs of the people on the bottom.
bad,"My co-workers were great.  It's a great concept. This is a call center.  As much as they want to tell you it's all about the patient, it's not.  It is about productivity.  Your phone calls are recorded. They will pick one phone call each quarter to evaluate you on.  It may be a great call but the focus will be on the negative and how to improve.  You are required to make a certain amount of calls per week.  You must meet 100% every week.  If you care about the patient and believe they come first it could be very difficult to reach that goal.  If the goal isn't reached you are reminded over and over.  It doesn't matter if you have 95% each week, they want 100% and can be written up for not reaching it. There are always changes being made and it is difficult to keep up.  Their systems are down half the time or so slow you have to wait and wait.  Always have a test or meeting.  Have to put your schedule request in over a month early.  Jan 29 was the deadline for March schedule.  Someone is constantly looking over your shoulder.  No autonomy.  BEWARE !  Seriously, most of the reviews here are negative.  Turn over rate is high.They don't give you much time to know everything.  Extremely stressful.  Benefits are good. Occasional breakfast or lunch provided."
bad,"awful experience.  Dept  had a ""fear and uneasy"" atmosphere towards management.  Contract workers have difficulty  becoming full time employees--they drag out the process for up to 2 years so they don't have to pay benefits.  High pressure for overtime.  Do not promote actual ""teamwork"" even though management promotes that they do.  Pressure for production leaves employees feeling they are ""watched"" constantly so rarely take a ""real"" lunch break and so eat at their desks."
bad,"Disorganized.  Poor communication among management.  Micromanagement.  Terminate employees without explanation.  Very poor training, nonexistent, in local offices.  Didn't get to attend out-of-town training.  Expected to do job without functioning equipment or support.  Sent out alone miles (over 100) from home office without sufficient training or equipment to perform assignment. Hires under ""temp"" title so they can fire you within 90 day temp without penalty.  Discourages interaction between employees.  Orientation to office was non-existent."
bad,"The management has no idea what they are doing. They never give you a straight answer and always expect you to figure things out on your own. They change the rules from one day to the next and make you work whenever they want including long hours and weekends with no incentives. They give you a hard time when you need time off and belittle you for having a life. Sadly I left a really good job for that mess and regret it big time. They sold me on the hype of flexibility and working from home but its all a lie, they make you come in to the office for meetings once a week and have made us come to the office from 8-7pm because they treat us like children and still expect us to visit patients and run around with the calls, constant emails not to mention no help with our huge caseload! Ridiculous place to work, please avoid it at all cost and save yourself the heart ache and possible health issues related to the severe amount of stress."
bad,"Speech, Physical, and Occupational Therapists: You might be attracted to the STRS department of Cenpatico if you're burnt out on direct client care, but run far, far away from this place. You will benefit from the insider knowledge of managed care, but other than that, the excellent health plan benefits, and a couple of cool co-workers, it's an awful, dehumanizing, and soul-sucking place to work. The environment is pure corporate cubicle blandness. The hours are long, and for Utilization Managers it's 99% sedentary work staring at a computer. Worst of all, though the department mission is ostensibly to ensure that members/patients are provided with the highest quality care, by the end of my time there I heard far more discussion of our monetary contribution to corporate than what was best for the members. Meanwhile, the salaries are not competitive, and company management thinks that jeans days are an acceptable substitute for bonuses, and that a ""thank you for all you do"" signoff (on an email telling you you need to stay late once again) is a sufficient to show employee appreciation. In the beginning it felt like we were doing work to better our respective fields and advocate for members, but in the end, it felt like the stereotypical evil insurance company, chasing dollars and falling out of touch with the realities of direct care."
bad,"I was hired as what they titled ""Data Entry"" clerk. The position was actually a call center Eligibility Rep.  We asked on the first day of training ""Is this for the data entry position?"" Because the trainer was going over the agenda and it was clearly a call center position.  She said that for budget reasons HR had to title the position as ""Data Entry"".  Because I needed a job, I stayed. My training class was suppose to be 8 people, only 6 showed up. At the end, only 2 of us completed the 2 week class.  I had let them know on the first day that I had to take 1 day off in a month for my spouses Dr appt in Houston, it was ok.- then when our shifts were being determined she said I wouldn't be able to schedule the day off in their work force program because they were shorthanded. She said if I had to take that day off, the best thing to do would be give notice then afterwards call her so I could come back.  I asked my trainer about this and she said ""Oh yesh, you better call her when you're back, only 2 people made it from your class and you're doing great, they need you !  What did she say when I called her??? - Sorry we don't have anything right now, you can check our career section and reapply when you see something. Leaving me with no job and my spouse was just put on disability for a terminal illness.  Horrible!  It's a typical call center job that I didn't really sign up for any way - horrible hours, constant monitoring & criticism,  miss your break - oh well. Plus they expect you to do a demanding Eligibility Rep call center position but only be able to list Data Entry Clerk"
bad,This organization allowed for people of color to be verbally abused by management. I have seen HR tell managers what POC have said about not feeling apart of the company then managers using that information aganist them. The hardest part of the job is trying to be a team player. Management divides the teams and make work aganist each other. I would not advise POC to work here.
bad,I cant speak for any other department but stay away from broker commissions unless you like mandatory overtime consistently and completing the same work multiple times.
bad,horrible place to work especially if you are in the call center. too much gossip and it feels like high school. you will not succeed/get promoted if you don't suck up to managers and supervisors! RUN!
bad,"The company Healthnet was much better before it got bought by Centene. Centene do not care about lower level employees. The give you mor work without extra pay. Consistent system issues and no fair opportunity for promotion as it is mostely based on nepotism. They also singled me out and picked on me for 5, 10, minutes lateness here and there untill they fired me for it . even though there were lots of people who pepertually come in later than i did that never even got warnings."
bad,They promise you the world to entice you to work there.  Those promises aren't kept.  You won't even be working in the same building that they tell you.  Beware!
bad,No support from upper management. Manager severely micromanaged. Worst Manager in my 24 year nursing career. Department was understaffed and there were unrealistic expectations.
bad,Lots of different technologies. Hard core agile. Too many meetings and ceremonies. Toxic culture. Bad communication. Challenging. Big changes in direction happen too frequently.
bad,Non professional salary wage does not compensate the stress that comes with the job. The work environment is very childish and unprofessional. Management is not your definition of what a manager should portray ok stand for.
bad,"Although I worked for Illinicare Heath, Centene is the parent company. I had the worst management,supervisors,training and coaching at this company.There is do diversification, only 7 white people in my building. There might have been a few more at one point but they left the company. They will beat you up and bring you down by giving you goals that re not obtainable due to the fact that they cant handle the members they have and doctors don't want to be in the Illinicare network. They hire temp to perm and don't hire you on, they will try to cross train you in everything for like a week and then wonder why your scores are low. Worst company culture I have ever worked for. Too many chiefs not enough Indians."
bad,"Pro:  Decent pay"
bad,Once you are in certain departments they will trap you and not let you transfer to another due to high turnover and no one wanting to work in said department. Company is all about numbers and not the members. Unrealistic turnaround times and workload with pressure from management to work unpaid as they pay RNs a salary so that they do not have to pay overtime.
bad,"HR is nonexistent. Training, if you get any..is a joke/nightmare. Management is less than knowledgeable and plays favorites. Supervisors and managers often bully staff or ghost employees if you speak up and/or ask questions. Most of them have been promoted quickly (since the majority of historical staff have been pushed out or ran for the hills) leaving new management who have no idea how do any part of their jobs. The few that tried often leave when it becomes apparent this is the everyday standard. The phrase work harder not smarter is very much the theme. Work life balance does not exist. EXTREMELY high turnover in the last few years."
bad,Do not work for Centene Behavioral Health....They are not about family friendly. they talk to you any kind of way and the managers and CEO;s allows it
bad,If you want to have continuous anxiety and lose hair. If you like walking on egg shells and working with snakes Centene/Envolve is for you. Never trust HR ever.
bad,Poor supervision over the  Medicaid contract versus the Medicare contract. Typical day was loud in the work place. Supervisors fraternized with staff and pitted staff members against one another. There were physical altercations in the work space. Management was unavailable to provide supervision when the staff had questions about their work responsibilities. Management was unavailable to diffuse the arguments and fights in the work space.
bad,"I loved the people I worked with , loved my members but Management is NOT what it should be. Its a dictatorship not leaders. They are not encouraging except for one boss I previously had before being transferred to a new one. They dont care about you , your work load or you having the time to complete it. They would be very hostile towards you , no matter how much you worked, got everything done and up to date and current on all work and tasks they find the littlest thing wrong and make a HUGE deal out of it when it does not warrant it at all. Although company states its illegal for them to target or retaliate against you, it happens all the time and HR does NOTHING about it... I would NOT recommend this place to anyone.. The stress from the job alone will affect your health, trust me I know.. The money and benefits are not worth it.. thats how they trap you. STAY AWAY there are other better companies out there for you!!!!"
bad,"Company has zero integrity, none. If you find that hard to believe just google “Centene shareholders heath net.” It starts from the top and trickles down. The primary focus of management, from executive to supervisor, is to deflect any ownership of blame for anything and everything. The company is not interested in actually fixing problems or issues, they only care about cleaning up messes that in turn create temporary yet perpetual pats on the back that mask the actual effects of their ineptitude which the customer inevitably pays for down the road."
bad,"I didn’t enjoy the sweat shop, cut throat environment that I witnessed. Having witnessed employees throwing others under the bus in order to make themselves look good, I’m glad I was on a short term contract. Hated going to work and the frustrating part was that it didn’t have to be as awful as it was. Team structure & morale could be imporoved upon and having meetings about meetings could be stopped."
bad,This was the worst place that I have ever been employed.  The job was not enjoyable at all.  I was very disappointed with the work conditions.  I do not recommend this place for employment.
bad,"Management is highly unqualified & expects unlimited overtime. They have a bandaid culture, which means everything is done at the last minute. Unrealistic deadlines are a regular occurrence."
bad,Don't do it.  Just don't.  The expectations are unrealistic. I was evaluated by four different people every quarter and that did not include the expected productivity rating of 100% every week.
bad,"Let me start off by saying that this job was offered to me in June 2017 with orig start date of July 5, 2017.  The Friday before I was set to begin with Centene, I get a call from the talent specialist telling me that the start date was being pushed back to mid july due to the facility not being ready.  I had already given notice to my current employer so I was left in a bind.  I still had high hopes based on the offer that I was given salary wise, facility amenities (gym, ergonomic desks, onsite medical, cafeteria and childcare that I don't need, but nice that they had it) well mid july comes and I get an email instead of a call stating that it would now be September.   Long storyh short, I was finally given start date in October.  The facility that was not actually completed, and still isn't complete, does not have one of the amenities promised.  The bonus is a joke, it is not up to 6% of salary and the reason given is that we are a new location in Tucson and the amount of mistakes made and penalties paid is taken out on employees.  Also, do not expect management to know ANYTHING about the insurance industry.  Half of them are from CS call centers or even a few from the GAP  no lie.  I would strongly discourage anyone from taking a position with this company."
bad,"good company poor management ,managers unprofessional loud ghetto and gossip about other managers & employees with each other. have their ""favorites"" who get promoted by who they no not what they know some of the mangers don't even know what they're doing low raises"
bad,"This is by far the worst place that I have ever worked. The goal expectations are unrealistic. They do not focus on actually helping the members. Its all about the numbers. How many calls we can take per day is most important. Managers are very unprofessional. The computer systems rarely work. When the systems do work they are very ineffective and unreliable. If you value your sanity, please stay far away from this company."
bad,"I would not send my worse enemy here to work, management is poor, supervisors gossip and show favoritism, there is no room for advancement unless you are a brown noser, customers and providers that you deal with are very rude and talk to you anyway that they feel like it and the company doesn't care. They will have you taking calls for departments that you have had absolutely no training on and when you say something to them about it, they do not care at all. "
bad,"Unless you are part of the incrowd you will not go anywhere. Was there for more than 5 years. Look somewhere else, unless your down for kissing butt and working your butt of for nothing."
bad,"Managers who come and go like the wind. "
bad,More than once I was offered a position and then it was rescinded without any explaination.  They talk about culture and ethics but have none. Who plays with people livelihoods but offering a position then even before a background check is initiated says we are going with another candidate. Seems that the brining managers here are discriminatory. Stay away!
bad,"I was recruited as a temp. and told the job description was tracking and triaging Prior Authorizations. Had 5 days of subpar training in that area. Turns out the job is mostly being on the phone all day - not tracking (half-day of phone training). Was told ""you either sink or swim""."
bad,Leadership and corporate not on the same page.  Too much control at the local level.  Feels like two companies.  Whose in charge?
bad,"San Antonio location."
bad,The staffing service tell you it's a temp to permanent position until you meet with upper management. They quickly tell you they have no intention on hiring temps and the company is currently hiring direct employees. Lack of crucial training and spent a lot of time completing work from other departments. Took over 2 weeks to receive some of the equipment needed for the job. The equipment was slow to be delivered. It did not function properly once received and was still waiting to receive additional work equipment. The department was very disorganized and training class functioned day by day. The direct hire staff was very negative which turned out to be a negative experience. The IT department was not able to troubleshoot the faulty equipment. Job processes were not provided during the training class. Upper management functions primarily from an office in another city.
bad,"Reviews are so true.  Temporary employee are told after 3 months you will be permanent.  A background check is conducted and if you pass your background check but off in one of the employment verification guess what you are disqualified from being hired permanent. A way of not hiring the employee permanent. The company has a quota of 50 plus calls, adherence policy 95% or better, quality calls must be 95% or higher. No ACW or after calls available.  You must multi-task in ways that can be difficult. The documentation is difficult. Calls must be answered in 6.30 minutes, guess what 90 plus of those call, you must process pcp changes, address changes, telephone changes, add email, what a joke here you cant even email out to any one or these members. You must also provide lookup tools for locating specialists in the members areas. The documentation to their CRM system is the worse I ever saw and can imagine.   Your told you can not take off for 6 months.  The company does not value employees; its all about numbers.  There is no flexibility of this company.  They don't care if you have a family or children.  Many people passed out on the floor whereas the ambulance came to take them to the hospital. Guess what they will still give you an occurrence. Your 15 minutes late that's an occurrence for a 1/2 days now.  Before it use to be 1 full day occurrence.   Company wants you to provide empathy to this members who receive free Medicaid and disrespect you on the phone because they want entitlements and free services.   This place is a joke.  Your wasting your time working there if your"
bad,The people I worked with were great. The company would work their temp. agents like they were permanent while the permanent workers rarely did anything. They will tell you that you can be hired on after 3 months but then they will tell you something is going on with the budget but you will constantly see new people come into new hire training with permanent badges.
bad,"Not a good place to work!!!!  Unfair treatment to minorities. Management not knowledgeable, no training, no positive feedback and upper management intimidating and rude."
bad,The worst company I ever worked for. They do not care about their employees. They play favoritism . people that do not qualify would get promoted. No job security what so ever. Everyday someone is quiting or getting fired.
bad,"The team I as on has a terrible manager. She is hateful, vindictive, and has no developer experience, but acts like she is the greatest developer but was business analyst before this. She micromanages and shows extreme favoritism to two of her employees that tattle on all the other team members. If I had different manager I would have given Centene five stars for everything."
bad,This company  has no loayilty  to  employee and they have no rules and guidelines things are made up as  they go along
bad,Poor management.  No confidentiality from HR. Nothing told up front is true.  The rules change as they go along.
bad,Bad management unproffesionalism the worst place would not ever go back there star plus program department is horrible
bad,"I never felt valued ! didnt even get th bonus they told us we were getting in our offer letter...I spoke with human resources several times regarding not being able to break or have lunches and the feeling of my manager not willing to help with the overwhelming amount of work. SOOOO much expected and demanded and not enough support. It was hard to watch my manager taking credit for my work, with no thanks, or appreciation. It was and exausting and painful experience. I regret working for this company and glad I left I now feel like I am respected and can use my skills and knowlledge for someone who will not abuse it."
bad,This has got to be the most unorganized company I have ever worked for. They overload you as much as possible to avoid hiring additional staff and are very unappreciative. Please do not pursue this company. You will definitely regret it.
bad,I have previously worked for this company and the management team is extremely dishonest and unethical. Why are they always hiring? that is the question you must ask when you are thinking about applying for a nursing position with t his company. An extremely stressful working environment
bad,Culture is generally unprofessional. Stay away from Naperville until they at least replace the current managers. You will learn a lesson when you accept a position with this company.
bad,Toxic environment and I would not recommend working there.   I was only there a short time which was was enough to know this was not the place for me.
bad,"Poor management. Employees were moved from one department to another. As soon as an employee learned one department and became very familiar with that department, they were moved to another department to work and learn from scratch. And the revolving door cycle continued. Employees working from home for years were eventually made to come into the office to work on-site. Very unorganized."
bad,"You’re expected to do 4 people’s job and you’re under appreciated. Management does not know how to talk to their employees, they’re very rude and they want you to stay past your shift. Your help is never in the actual state that you work in, which delays your work."
bad,Unqualified leadership team and they are more concerned about dollars and cents instead of the consumer. The corporate culture is terrible and if you disagree and speak up in a professional manner you are treated poorly.
bad,"No matter what job description says, No matter what interviewer tells you. There are no REMOTE positions at Sunshine Health. Was told position was remote . Then told position only required us to go one day a week to hospital. Then increased to 3 days per week. Then increased to whenever we had a new member in hospital. I had over 10 hospitals assigned to me. Manager for medicaid was extremely unhelpful. The only good thing about this position was the pay, but even that was only temporary. I was told when you are made permanent you take approx $5 pay cut. Stuck it out as long as possible and then found another job. Workload is way too much. expect to get the worst assignment with no access to electronic health records. Literally every other CRN had access to EHR. Manager made a lot of empty promises."
bad,"When hired from the Job fair was told several inaccurate things concerning PTO, wages, etc.   Wages were considerably lower than hiring information.  When you arrive to orientation you are required to sign forms with little or no time to read them- one of which is your wage agreement hidden in a stack.  Once signed there is nothing that can be done as you have legally agreed to what they have offered weather it is inaccurate or not.  As an employee the stress of arriving to work and not knowing if you have a job was simply not worth it .   HR would stand and wait for us to arrive to work and dismiss those who did not make productivity percentage for the week. Ushered out when their time badge would not allow them into the main building.  Management was scarce to say the least -ESPECIALLY when needed. They scattered like flies if something was required of them.  60 sec bathroom break that was scheduled with the restroom being on the other side of the building- Failure to keep the predetermined schedule of 60 sec would result in loss of productivity points for the day.  40 women in one restroom was atrocious all running to make the 1 minute time! not possible .    They run on a 12 point system - no exceptions ! However, what the fail to say is any time not put in 3 months in advance is a point taken off. In my case, I had given 2 months for court date was told it was approved- two days prior to approved time was then emailed notification of NON APPROVAL time .  PTO was stated at 40 days per year but please note that you will be competing with 3 other offices from upstate that"
bad,"Horrible management, directors spend majority of the day on the phone talking to each other while sharing very little of what is/was discussed with employees, favorites are played constantly, there's no collaboration and because it's start up a lot of people join because they see opportunity. It's hit or miss if you will actually get that opportunity based on whether you're a favorite or not. The culture is toxic and many people stab each other in the back while smiling in your face. It least it pays well, I guess."
bad,"Management sucks, you'll never advance like you should, and you'll hate your job.  The work days are long and boring, no remote opportunity. The money is good though, but you'll hate coming in everyday. If you are an African American especially, stay away."
bad,Training is terrible.  They expect uptraining after work and on your own time.  No time to do what you need to do.  Environment is bad.  All are unhappy there.
bad,"I worked at Centene for six weeks."
bad,"The work load in the office I worked in was intense & unreasonable.  Many of the staff worked through lunches because they could not put in overtime.  I also felt under constant pressure to send cases to our MDs with the hope they would deny treatment.  Management appears to be very chaotic.  They give lip service to listening to staff, but I never felt I was actually listened to.  Over the time I was there, there was high employee turnover"
bad,"This review is for Home State Health Plan and not the Corporate office. It was all about quantity and not quality. Poor training. Their moto, get the job done and we will correct the errors later, which turned out to be too many."
bad,A terrible culture that leaves you feeling stressed at all times.  Directors are gossipy and make you feel as though you can do no good.  Timelines are unrealistic.
bad,"I've been with the company for 3 years. Case management director, supervisor and HR are bias and races. The supervisor show favoritism by decreasing work load on people they like. HR will cover unethical problems and back managers."
bad,"For the most part, im content.  The compliance is nearly imposible to maintain so you wont get your bonus and even the best CSR's end up on a PIP at some point."
bad,Difficult and racist place to work. I would not recommend anyone to  work here. The company is infiltrated by a dog eat dog/backstabbing culture in most departments.
bad,Worst place I have ever worked.....Nothing but miserable messy women.....highest turnover rate I have ever witnessed....Management very unprofessional
bad,Total lack of leadership. Managers and supervisors stay in meeting rooms doors shut while you are stuck on the phones given no information about anything at all.Would find out very hard to believe that this place will last another year. No way! Would not recommend anyone to leave there current position to start working for this company.
bad,"Imagine a room full of people getting so much information a day that there is no room to improve the system but rather, all the labor is towards cleaning data."
bad,"This was customer service for AmBetter insurance and that company is just terrible.  Customers would call in complaining non-stop and there wasn't anything we could do about it. The managers were just as rude as the customers could be, but I don't blame the customers."
bad,"Busy environment, very loud, hard to concentrate on your task due to the busy activity around you.  Not a lot of training more of assumption & not very friendly."
bad,"No one is on the same accord within the company, form upper management down. The company is very unorganized and the system go down more than they a up."
bad,No support from management staff. Always focusing on the negative instead of the positive. Very stressful. You are nursing the computer instead of the patients. Micromanaged.
bad,Don’t even bother with this company. The lack of management is absolutely horrible. All they care about is productivity and not well rounded care. Lack of communication between employees and the upper management.  A lot of gossip which interviews with getting work done.
bad,"Stay away from this company. They over work their employees - expecting you to work through your lunches, no breaks, and staying late every day. No one knows what they’re doing due to the extreme disconnect because of it being such a large corporation. Communication is non existent. I worked there for 5 months and it was the worst 5 months of my life. They don’t care about their employees at all. They only care about profits. They pay well so it’s easy to be pulled in.... but do yourself a favor and stay away from this company."
bad,"The pay is good....everything else is awful.  The management is horrible and incompetent.  They don't see employees as humans but as robots with unlimited ability to work.  I cried every day and hated life when I worked there, and I was certainly not alone.  I'd be homeless before working there again."
bad,"No business leadership.  Executives were nurses, not business people.  Zero vision.  Zero leadership.  Literally, by far, the most toxic place I've ever worked with the lowest level of talent."
bad,"Poor management, unfair promotion processes, unfair work processes. This company just was not a great place to work, I think it was management but they did not care about the employees."
bad,"I was expected to work 75-80 hours a week...even though the center was only open about 8 months, there had been 3 center managers before me.  My supervisor was very difficult and very demanding.  She is the reason I left."
bad,Leadership at this organization is terrible. They have favorites and pretend to know information rather than actually learning the jobs of their employees. They gossip about employees to other employees.
bad,Management is unprofessional and heartless. Employee turn over is amazingly fast. Poor morale. poor training to do your job. I have been here for almost 2 yrs and am the 2nd most senior person in my field
bad,Typical work day was working help desk tickets.  We were also required to take 40-60 phone calls a day at a very quick pace.  The hardest part of the job is when I was promised advancement after 2 months with the company and a pay raise when in turn I had money taken away and no advancement was available.
bad,"At first I thought this would be a great place to work.  Unfortunately, everyone around me walked on pins and needles. Why?  Well everyone was afraid of getting fired, everyday!  I wouldn't recommend this place to my worse enemy."
bad,"Farmington MO location, high school games. Management does not have a clue how to do the jobs that they manage. It is ashamed because this company employ's a lot of employee's and could be an awesome place to work and when this company started in 2000 it was an awesome place to work, everyone was like family, but now people stab you in the back, and people get promoted that don't know what they are doing, they overlook the individuals that should get promoted. The money is great but the stress isn't worth it when you start having health issues and high blood pressure and anxiety issues."
bad,"OMG. This is the worst company that I have ever worked for in my life. The Management Team is totally pathetic. The only people that know anything are those that do the actual jobs. Management is always unavailable for questions as they never have any answers. Training is horrible and inadequate. The Management Team for MYCare is great at harassing the employees and making life totally miserable."
bad,referral Coordinator- 1 week of training hired on through LK JORDAN thrown on the job with no instructions.  they want you in by 7 and will let you know what time your shift would end. sometimes not till 11pm. keep you on as a temp then throw you away after 90 days hire on more temps.
bad,"I REGRET accepting this job and leaving my previous job. Have I known that I would be working like a mad man at all hours of the day I would have DECLINED and stick to my lower paying job. Don't get me wrong the pay and benefits are great but the work environment is not what I had expected. I am very disappointed in management and it seems like every week there are changes. I can barely keep up with all of the changes. I am all for changes but it comes to a time when we need to mainstream the forms, workflow, etc. One thing that bothers me is that you don't have the ability to provide quality work... It is all about production."
bad,"JOB SEEKER HEED WARNING!!!"
bad,"This place presents as a great place to work. During the interview process it is painted as a great company with a good mission. The mission part is right but the rest is all a façade. "
bad,A typical day at work consists of back stabbing from the un-qualified managers who are only there to crack the whip. I did learn the world of medicaid but from nurses that did'nt servive the current nursing manager. Most of my co-workers were great but most have left due to the current nursing manager. The work load is huge but manageable.The benefits are some of thee best but for some reason the management in the Austin office did'nt get the memo that slavery is over. The upper managment turn a blind eye on how people are treated.
bad,"Semi-productive workplace. Company loyalty to employees is low. Job Stability and Advancement are stated as being available, however no real job stability or assistance with advancement when needed."
bad,"The company lacks sorely in communication between management and the employees.  There is a lot of favoritism and special treatment by management and supervisors and the others, like myself, who are loyal and dedicated, are treated very poorly. There are managers and supervisors who do not have your back."
bad,The Manager let the seniority (Grievance coordinator II’s) run the place and do whatever they want. The Supervisor is new and don’t know anything about the job very unhelpful just agrees because he has too. The lead has the nastiest attitude and don’t want to help the new people learn the job correctly. All in all a horrible department through Centene.
bad,"Some of the Management in NYC office are completely inexperienced, downright nasty, condescending, hostile and manipulative which does not belong in any business. If leadership doesn't like you, you are set up to fail. Senior leadership needs to keep a pulse on their Management Team oversight and HR needs to change its policies regarding hostility reporting and retaliation in the workplace. "
bad,"MANAGEMENT IS HORRIBLE AND THEY DO A LOT OF RACIAL PROFILING AT THIS COMPANY. The trainer don't know her job, when you ask a question, she refers to the fact that she needs to be clarified because she does not remember exactly. After two weeks that training, you start work under name of training, but they don't provide any support, only require work without errors.  No explanation, no organization of work. Every man for himself. Coworkers cons each other . Don't waste your life for that ungrateful company."
bad,"Centene is a great company unless your in a sales market. Some states have it together and some do not. Florida is not where you want to be if it’s sales related as the upper management is very unreliable when it comes to strategic successful planning. Agents are churned and burned. Major disconnect between the focus of Centene and what really happens at the sales level in Florida. If you want a stable"
bad,"In the beginning I was so excited to start working at Magnolia fulltime. However, it turned out to be one of the worst jobs I ever had. Upper managment were a joke; God forbid if you had any issues. I worked my behind off, great perfomance reviews ect. I was subject to bullying from one of the supervisor. The company as a whole is great, however, I would not recommend the UM depart."
bad,"Centene may pay well, but for it to be an insurance company, the medical benefits are horrible. They care more about adding members then helping the members they currently have"
bad,"This is a company that grows thru acquisition. Before the ink is dry and the handshakes are over, they are off to charm the next company they will bring in."
bad,Centene is the true definition of the Machine....that chews up people’s lives and spits them out. No place to spend valuable life at unless the only thing you care about is a check. Management is very poor and very egotistical and this for a company that supposedly helps change lives. Stay away if you value your health and happiness.
bad,"During the interview, you're told that you would be able meet quota, 10 reviews/day, by the time you come out of orientation. However, by the time you are placed into production, the quota increased to 15/day. Near impossible with all the extras tacked onto completing just one review.  Training consisted of someone who was filling in for the trainer who had left the company. This was not their regular job, so there were areas of information that were not emphasized or skipped over that you're not aware of being essential ,until you're in production. Your supervisor assumes these gaps of information were covered in training by the time you come out to production. Because you don't know what you don't know, unnecessary mistakes were made. When passive-aggressive supervisors throw you under the bus when discussing you to management, you don't have an ally to help you succeed in your role."
bad,I wouldn't recommend this place to work unless you want to leave work everyday day feeling like you have been beaten downdont do it maintain your sanity just say NO
bad,"Very stressful work and unrealistic expectations set by management, which has nothing better to do than to target employees, rather than attempting to support them (I witnessed this several times during my employment). The only positive aspect was great pay and benefits...not worth the headache. Avoid at all costs!"
bad,"Very cliquey. Insufficient training. The people that have been there a while feel theatened by new hires and don’t like to share necessary information to do your job. The hiring manager lied about overtime in the interview. Stay away, you will not have a life"
bad,Left due to Big turn around in management. Poor management. Human resources does not provide support. Favoritism among management. No consistency. Proper Training not available.
bad,"Management is horrible. Employees are afraid to tell HR what is really happening. It's become a depressing place to work. Westmont office is treated different from the Chicago office. Supervisors and managers are given jobs based on popularity with their own managers and supervisors. Morale has hit an all time low. The well being of the employee is not cared for, instead scare tactics are put in place. Inter-department communication is none. The plan president has no presence except when he discusses how much money the company has made. There is a trend of leaving as fast as one could, so retention is waning. But on the best side, The HR lady in Chicago does a fantastic job. She is the one to speak to and even if her power is limited she will listen to you intently. Please change leadership there. It is so much potential in Chicago if you just look at your lower ranking employees. People are going to continue to leave if you don't."
bad,"Good place to work, nice and friendly environment. They don’t work much with schedules but overall they offer a good pay and are friendly individuals."
bad,"A hostile work environment in which fake interactions between fellow employees occur on a regular basis.  Team leaders had personal ""cliques"" and if you were not liked or a part of that ""clique"" you would be you would be criticized, shunned by the ""clique"", treated disrespectfully, sometimes verbally attacked, (especially in meetings) harassed, and gossiped about. "
bad,They have an Awful work life balance and the upper management staff does not care about the employees. Everything is about the production numbers. Great pay and benefits but not worth it in the long run.
bad,"A so called managed care organization.."
bad,"Very stressful environment, had to have script down, call time limited, hard to get a lead on the floor, and unorganized. No family oriented as they described."
bad,"Slave driving work environment, unprofessional case management director who would discuss employee issues with other staff members."
bad,"No matter which of the 6 CEOs we have had in the past 4 years, an actual plan was never revealed."
bad,A very bad environment in Louisiana due to the COO and her subjective management practices based on friendships and affinity for working with prior Amedisys employees coupled with her dislike for doctors and her insecurities.
bad,"I would never recommend this company to anyone, the upper management is a joke especially the jerks in the Florida and Houston location's, heartless, cut throat and are snakes. This company will not last at the rate they are going. They don't know how to treat their employees. All they care about is money and production. Threatening people with their jobs, making the Patient Care reps stay on the phone by limiting their rest room breaks. Very cruel place, they show favoritism they allow people to have positions that they are not qualified for because they are out side of work friends. Stay away from this place. You will regret it."
bad,"Poor leadership and training is short with to much info packed into 6 weeks. to many two faced folks. Cur throat HR, saw many people get fired for looking the wrong direction. Good workers."
bad,"Typical call center environment with unethical, cheating individuals who love antagonizing others."
bad,"Horrible! Worst place ever!  Stay away!  They will entice you with the great pay and benefits and then put you in an environment with no direction, no resources and promise you the world and never come through."
bad,This job is not hard at all but management makes it stressful.  You are constantly harrassed about any and everything you do.  By far the worst call center I've ever worked in.  Leadership has no true direction and it trickles down to us CCPs who are then punished.  There is no where to go within NW (NurseWise) but other opportunities within Centene.  I would not recommend working for this company.
bad,"I worked for Superior Healthplan a subsidiary of Centene Corporation for a long period of time and I would have stayed there if upper management did not change.  This new management they hired has no background experience in Managed Care or even dealing with Medicaid SSI recipients, but its not what you know its who you know.  As a Service Coordinator you are over worked, unappreciated and if you don't appease to management they make sure to make your time there a living hell.  Management ethics its more quantity verses quality, these are peoples lives your are dealing with but that does not seem to phase management.  The average caseload is 400-500 but they doubled it because the turnaround time with staff is high. They will get you with the salary which is good if you didn't have to come in early, stay late and come in on Saturdays your salary doesn't even out in the long run. They are in violation of so many issues and I am not surprised the State has not audited them or even have the State pull the contract from Superior.  They sure aren't living up to their name Superior its more like Stuperior.  I would never recommend a colleague to work there and I feel sorry for the few that have stayed.  They are the only ones holding it up and stay there because of necessity.  There is more to life than Superior Healthplan."
bad,"I have a lot of work experience.  I had never worked at a place where everyone is stabbing each other in the back, the front, the side every where you can think of.  Management and higher management care for no one but themselves.  I don't know how these people can sleep at night knowing that their work ethics are just not there.  And they know and don't care. Do not work there!"
bad,"This company is very disorganized, has very low moral, poor management, sucky pay for the work overload, and just a mess. I can go on and on about this company and how they make up rules as they go, bullying, constant picking, lack of support fro HR, etc.... I sure got the bad end of the stick at Centene and would not recommend this company to anyone. "
bad,"The management is dishonest and secretive.   Management but the blame on workers for there mistakes and this was the norm not a one off.  No real management professionalism as they seem to be making things up as they go along only to change them.  If you do work for this company keep everything well documented through email.  No real teamwork, felt isolated.  Not very inclusive of people with disabilities."
bad,A Fortune 100 Company with great benefits and pay. However the upper management and administration is very tricky and can be difficult at times.  Would consider as a place to start your professional career.
bad,Company states they want to be well connected to the community and help serve the underserved population.  Complete HOGWASH!!!!  The company only cares about sales and higher stock prices.  It's actually quite disgusting.  I resigned because I like to be able to look myself in a mirror.
bad,"Training is terrible and minimal at best then you are given more work than you can do.  Computer issues, software issues, making the simple things harder than it needs to be with layer after layer of time wasting moves.  Not compliant with NYS guidelines so now their program is in jeopardy.  Will be looking for other employment...."
bad,"I was a director for this company for almost 4 years, and I was very successful.  However, the department that I oversaw was constantly understaffed, which required my staff to work overtime for 3 years.  Also, there is this ""good ole boy"" mentality that upper management had.  The CEO often promoted his friends or people he liked, whether they were qualified or not.  People in my department were never able to get promotions, but other departments were able to. I was terminated for filing a formal complaint with the company and the state's EEOC. The healthplan is currently under financial scrutiny due to the poor choices of the CEO and the under qualified leadership teams, even though my department made them millions of dollars in profit."
bad,"They hire a sleu of unsuspecting temps with the promise of being hired if they do a , b  and c  and when you do a , b and c — it’s never good enough. Between QA scores , adherence and attendance you are very likely to get fired before hire anyway and that’s on purpose. Don’t let them tell you otherwise, their intent is never to hire you . I saw some really good , dedicated agents get fired just for being late 5 minutes , and catching that last fatal half point getting them FIRED. This place is extremely top heavy with more leads, supervisors and managers than people left actually taking calls. It is impossible to pass QA on a regular basis— anything under a 95% is a FAIL.  One low grade can destroy your monthly average and quality assurance sets the standard so high that you literally have to be some kind of savant to pass it on a regular basis. . You can take 15 calls and do really great on 14 of them  and QA will seek and find the one call where you made A mistake. Instead of feeling good about helping people and enjoying your work,  you are filled with anxiety and dread every single day, all day long  about when the next QA audit will be coming in . Then they try to tell you that the QA team gets rewarded for giving 100s so they are trying to give you 100s !  please believe me when I say this is definitely a bait and switch situation and emotionally abusive. when you point out what you see and what you are experiencing  to your supervisor they will turn it around and blame something you are doing that is uncompliant, or some skill in which you are lacking and blame that for"
bad,Company started off good but as it progressed it turned in to any typical call center with poor leadership and lazy supervisors. When things start going south with stats and work functions the leaders are not there to help but sure are there too address the issue after its escalated.
bad,"The moral of this company sucks becuase of the questionalble ways Management runs the call center. They are loud when you are on the phone trying to assist a memeber or a provider. They have no level of respect while you are assiting however they continue to repremand the ""smaller"" people for the same things the we observe the upper management team doing."
bad,Management was horrible there was no direction. HR did not properly handle situations or did nothing at all. Lack of communication from all aspects. No work from home or flexibility with hours to accommodate the commute.
bad,"Three words -don’t do it. "
bad,"Training was poor, trainer was replaced after 1st week so we had to re-learn everything and the 5 weeks of training was shortened to 2 weeks.  Work flows were not correct many times so we had to wait for things to be corrected."
bad,The work environment was very stressful and quotas were very hard to meet. A new supervisor was very unsure of herself and seemed to need more training.
bad,"Poor Management!!  Reps were never fully trained to handle claims and appeals. Omni constantly crashes or continuously slow. Supervisors never available because they are more worried about where they are going on their lunch breaks and gossip. The one Provider Service Supervisor in Particular constantly talked down to her team members. Total lack of respect. the only good thing about Centene is that for a call center, the pay is very good that is, if you are hired as a Centene Employee and not through an agency. Other than that, I wouldn't send my worst enemy there to work!!!!!! And I gladly stand by my statement!"
bad,"Significant resources are repeatedly devoted to a non-stop crisis mode, while no support is dedicated to establishing the people, processes, and tools to prevent the crises in the first place.  Decision-making and work are conducted in silos, with little appetite to change nor the framework to collaborate effectively.  Many ""big ideas"" are spoken but most never take shape because firefighters aren't properly skilled to execute strategy.  And, too many leaders demonstrate poor leadership - not responding to enquiries, not following HR protocol to confirm with internal job applicants that another candidate was selected, not governing their teams to behave professionally."
bad,Cut throat environment.  No matter how successful you are you must be in the right click.  Management tends to allow workers to decide who stays or goes no matter what skills or potential a new worker shows.
bad,There is a revolving door of people steadily being fired or walking out.No trust between managers and employees.Worse place I've ever worked! People are very unhappy and disappointed all the time. expectations of management are way out of possibility to accomplish.
bad,"The culture of the company is very bad, The management are uneducated, The management are argumentative and spiteful.I did not enjoy working for Centene at all and don't have any good things to say."
bad,"Stay away from Cenpatico. They recently changed the name of the company, Typical day at work was dealing with reporting and compliance related issues with a constant managing. Please leave the agency within 90 days of their hire date,"
bad,Be prepared to work 9.5 hour days and mandatory overtime every weekend.  The job is not at all what I was hired to do.  Save yourself some time and look elsewhere.
bad,"They said when they hired you the position was 40 hours a week salary..never did they say it would be 15 and more hours a day, 7 days a week without being compensated for those extra hours!!! It is a case manager position but in reality it is a numbers game.. They are only concerned with the bottom line and that is the number!! There is no true case management and this is a disservice... it is paperwork and more paperwork.  You cannot time manage because management says one thing and then it changes the next day. All they look at are numbers and reports! The management team is very unorganized and tells you one thing and the next day they tell you something totally different!! Management set us up for failure as there are not enough hours in a day to humanly do this job !!! They lied about everything they said and continue to lie daily!!! Advice...RUN THE OTHER WAY!!! Do not get sucked into their web of lies !!!"
bad,Management is horrible. Centene was great and my position was great but management does not know to respectfully talk to their employees. Then when you stand up for yourself and tell a supervisor they fire you. So much for open door policy
bad,Leadership is clueless...one day its do this and literally the next day its do the opposite... after staff has clearly informed them that's not the best way or the way it works.  Corporate really need to come save them...it your brown skinned don't worry about advancement unless your in customer service.  Incompetent case managers who are all RNs with no case management experience fresh off rotation at your nearest hospitals. Turn over is high...which is a sign of a red flag.
bad,managers are petty and micro manage and have no compassion or sympathy. Managers do not listen to you they think everything is justified. caseload is overwhelming
bad,"I worked this job several years ago and I just saw this job posted via Indeed.com. I felt compelled to write this review as a warning to people before hitting the apply button. First of all, the job description is very misleading. This is not just a simple ""data entry"" like the job description states on Centene’s website or how it is explained during the interview. It is way more than just data entry and it is very difficult. You have to create the data. It’s harder than it sounds, I'm serious. This a deadline driven high stress position. It's stress full because you have to be extremely detail oriented. If you make a mistake on any of your groups it can affect you job. They hang that over your head everyday with reports on you accuracy percentages. Co-workers bully and talk behind your back if they think you are not up to par. They will also go to management tell them anything you do wrong right in front of you. Believe me, they are not very good people. They are strict with literally everything you do. The lead has access to your computer, so she sees everything you email out or save on you computer. Micromanagement is encouraged. Very rude and nasty people made me miserable working here. I never been threated like this in my life. The pay is not that great either because they expect a lot from you. They claim there are a lot of advancement opportunities but the only position you can move up to is Sales Assistant, which is even more work and stress. Then most people leave the company after that. They have lost a lot of employees to private insurance brokerages paying better"
bad,"Management is horrible ,favoritisms is a big thing , management doesn’t understand your needs to succeed ,pay was good , unrealistic expectations, stay away"
bad,"They micro manage you there, feels like you are under a microcope! You can't leave your desk without signing out of your phone to a particular number that fits why you are leaving your desk. God forbid you leave your desk for to long under that number, they will come find you and ask where you been then tell you to get back to your desk. But hey, if you need a job then apply! Don't say you wasn't warned!"
bad,"The pay and work schedule is great. However Management  is the worst I have ever seen thus far. They want to micromanage your every mover, while they it around talking , eating and on their phones. If you need assistance with a call, you have to IM them and they take 10-20 minutes sometimes to respond, by that time the customer is frustrated you are frustrated because you could not give the customer your full assistance. If they would change management and the Director over the Medicare, Medicaid, etc. program department and stop micromanaging this would be a great company to work for. Also they want to dictate your PTO time, you have to request it, and it is approved by an out of state person. Sometimes you could have a doctors appt and they decline that day off, so you take off and get points deducted. Oh everything is point based...ridiculous. This company has lost some very good hard working employees due to management. HR and VP's really need to look into their Little Rock location!!! Be concerned about people. Great benefits, employee appreciation was great but you couldn't enjoy it because you are constantly on the phones and they bring the food to your desk, cold and you never leave your desk."
bad,"6 weeks training,no hands on,sharepoint,training center, lots to learn,lots to do,new wing,good pay,lots of test,perfect attendance required, must meet high QA and high test scores,diplomas"
bad,Better to look elsewhere. Company culture is all profit driven hidden behind the facade of “member care”. Communication is nonexistent and high turn over is rampant. New “leadership” every few months that does more good than harm. Promotions to management positions are given to those who play the political game and it’s evident that they are in no place to lead a team with lack of experience and overall incompetency. Employees that do stay have either vested way too much of their life with the company to part or are stuck due to the lack of jobs especially in the Eugene market.
bad,"Look on indeed how many recruiting companies are working to get people into Superior Health data analyst role.  Then look at the frequency.  Ask yourself, does this sound like a company you want to work for?  These job openings are not organic growth but people leaving in droves.  8/10 people left the team in my 1 year with the company.  I knew something is seriously wrong here. "
bad,"High turnover"
bad,This company is horrible. The managers need EEO trainings. There is not much growth for people of color/minorities. Management cares only about competing with the other companies and looking good for the president of the company. People are miserable working for this company.
bad,The pay and benefits at Centene were great. Unfortunately the management was terrible. I meet some great peoplt and i learned a lot working there. the location of the job was great also.
bad,"This entire operation is a call center. Unless you are a member of management you will be on the phone taking incoming client and provider calls. You will not be provided with this information during your hiring process and will be extremely frustrated when you accepted a position, figure this out and have already left your former place of employment. I didn't even mention the best part of taking incoming calls that are not part of your ever changing job description. These calls are recorded and you receive a score on your call performance based on there script/criteria. If your score falls below there ridiculous expectations your receive a coaching session. These coaching sessions turn into write-ups and eventual termination. My position changed from the time I was hired until the time I had enough and quit 6 times in 8 months. It was always the we need you over here to help speech. Translation we are understaffed, are not actively recruiting and have fired a third of our staff over call scores. If you want to take the leap and jump on board at PA Health & Wellness you better have a back up plan and get out as quickly as you can. The management team is also extremely unprofessional, rude and plays favorites. You are micro-managed and treated like a ten year old. Especially if you are not constantly logged into the phone system and ready to take incoming calls."
bad,"This company is not employee friendly, if your not management your expendable. As supervisors would rather talk and gossip amongst each other than help with customer issues on a daily basis."
bad,"This company is the worst that I've worked for in my career!  As a result of the HealthNet merger, HealthNet culture is taking over and the CIO (HealthNet) gets rid of anyone that doesn't drink his Kool-Aid."
bad,Position was very misleading based on interview and the role of a concurrent review nurse. My expectations when accepting the job were that it would be a remote work from home position after 30 days and that there would be thorough training. Neither were true after hire. Very disorganized.
bad,"Your supervisor will be driven by numbers, period. The overall tone is "" do as I say"".  At times you might get the silent treatment (subtle micro aggressions) or experience subtle intimidation tactics in meetings by young supervisors who want to prove themselves and advance.  Since your success is driven by numbers, ""clouds"" of pressure appear over most interactions with supervisors and co workers. Those who risk rocking the boat become a target. It's very easy to lose your professional identity in this type of work culture. Favoritism happens. Supervisors usually adore the people pleasers and those who submit."
bad,"The position & pay was excellent. However, the management team is unprofessional, does not display a team environment, does not adhere to their policies. They enforce excessive work hours & have no regard for the health of their employees. When I resigned, I had 40 vacation hours. They did not pay me that vacation time & told me since I was only giving a 12 day resignation notice, instead of a 14 day resignation notice, that I would never be eligible to work for Centene  again."
bad,The recruiters are AWFUL HORRIBLE!! I have never worked with such bad recruiters in my entire life. Do not expect anything from them because they are terrible.
bad,"Centene as a whole company is a good company to work for. However I worked for Centene  west, we serviced California, Arizona, Washington, Connecticut so there were no options to come in before 10 am. The managers sucked, we worked our butts off, but they played favorites, so people that didn't earn good shifts got em, if you were a ""teachers pet"", the people that were really deserving got nothing. they change their rules, and policies every other day. The environment was extremely stressful, which explains why they pay higher than the average call center. it was not worth working there the time frame I did."
bad,One of the Worst place I ever worked for.  Micro management and constant unprofessional harassment from supervisor.  So much work that an 8 hour work day is not enough time to complete it all.
bad,"The work was nice and the pay and benefits were great, but having to deal with the people there was not worth it. People would constantly complain about little things like what people were eating for lunch and whether it was refrigerator worthy, complain about typing too loud even though it's computer work, and other petty things and management refused to listen to coworkers opinions on things. They also chose favorites and treated others like they didn't matter."
bad,"Very unorganized, very communication, inconsistent performance expectations,  favortism and intolerant to process improvement suggestions.  Decent benefits."
bad,"A typical day at work was full of problems and not at all productive. The system used for the entry of data did not have clean data. You had to guess a lot of the times as to what would be the best way to handle and complete the entries. The 4 years and 8 months I was there, there was not a professional position profile stating specific responsibilities in order to know where you stood within your current position or what you needed to do to advance to the next level. I never understood, and no one could tell me, the process of which employees would get promoted or move to the next level. There were positions that were not necessarily needed such as Lead and Supervisor positions.  It was constant change; nothing was ever consistent."
bad,Your are lied to during your interview they make it seem like its a great job. From the first day of training I knew I had made a mistake the trainer is rude and condescending she rarely answers questions. HR was horrible at answering questions. After 2 weeks of traning on the software to be a program coordinator I was separated from the rest of the class and told I would be part of there utilization management team I was given 1 day of training on this and then thrown to train with another program coordinator who thinks she is a manager because she does the directors hair. She expected me to know everything on my first day and after me speaking out she went and threw me with another program coordinator who was the only one nice enough to actually train me. I hated every minute of and glad I left immediately.
bad,"Management makes the company horrible. They don't follow the rules they enforce, rude, and look down on call center staff. other than this th company is not too bad, But mamagement can make or break the company so they should make some changes but I'm sure they won't."
bad,It was alright. Not very exciting. Little direction and not a lot of feedback. At the end of the day I felt like I had no idea what they wanted me to do. what the budget was. or if i was doing a good job.
bad,"Position interviewed for was not what I was hired for.  I was told hire as one title to be another title because they couldn’t get approved for the title they wanted.  Manager was absent and not communicative.  I was at one time told switching managers but never told.  Communication was lacking and my department did not care about you and if an employee came to department with a concern, staff was not friendly and referred you elsewhere.  I’m glad I’m gone.  I’m much happier"
bad,"Centene is the worst . They hire tons of temps only to FIRE them all for  idiotic reasons . Trust me when I say if you are temp,  they WILL NOT EVER HIRE YOU. The troll manager with bad Teeth , cackling witch laugh and frizzy hair is HORRIBLE. don’t trust anything she says , she will not hire you in the end . So many managers, supervisors, leads MA’s yet no CSRS because they all get FIRED"
bad,"Atypical days work is usually about 30-40 calls a day from members and provider inquiring their health benefits, setting up transportation, going over copay and coinsurance information. "
bad,As a person attempting to get a job with this company I would suggest to not make any errors on your application as you will be disqualified immediately without the opportunity to appeal.
bad,"Great company, but the call center part is just awful. Back to back calls are non-stop and very stressful. If you see a call center position for this company do not apply for it because it has a high turnover rates. The management is absolutely terrible. Assisting providers with their claims is just absolutely mind-blowing awful. Half time you're not trained enough to know what you are talking about. The providers screams, shouts and never takes no for an answer. This type of position will affect your health and wellness physically and mentally."
bad,"Unethical practices for their medicaid and medicare policies and procedures,  does not report proper data, conflicts of interest for employees whom work for this company.  Unsatisfied with human resources review of any issues reported by not only one employee but multiple.  Does not follow appeal and dispute guidelines set by the state of arizona.  "
bad,"n/a rather not say. Walking into a burning building. Management has no clue what they are doing. Always changing, and no policies in place"
bad,"There is nothing else to say except, run from this place as far you can! Extremely unprofessional and cliquish!  This place only likes you if you kiss butt and nothing else!! I have never been in an environment that condones such unprofessional- ism,disrespect and extremely childish behavior!! The best thing that I can honestly say that ever happened to me was the day I left!! "
bad,Please do not apply  unless you want to stress and hurt at the end of your shift.  The place sucks people treat you like your dumb and stupid.  The team that is talk to you any kind of way she always want it done her way. The department doesn't make you feel like you apart of a team.  They always re not very welcoming at all. You will be scheduled to attend meetings but you have no input you will be sitting there like a sitting duck.
bad,"Mcallen tx, a lot of favoritism. If you don't know the supervisors and the managers you would not go from a temp to permanent. Also 99% hispanic, if you are white, you would be ignored. Meetings are always conducted in spanish. Nurses working there are backstabbing they will sabotage your work hoping that way they will get a permanent position. They're training is mediocre. If you ask the same question to all 4 managers, you get 4 different answers. They contradict each other. Our tax money is spent by this idiots, that are making up authorizations for services left and right. By nurses that are temps that did not receive the proper training and are just trying to get each other fired with hopes of getting hired by this company because of the benefits. Overtime to fix the mistakes that are done by the temps, because again there is no proper training."
bad,I loved when it was just Lifeshare...... I know we didn't get all the benefits and bonuses but at least we had better staffing and people didn't stab others in the back or favor one another. I just see it going down the hole and I'm not sticking around and going down with it. Sad cause I've been here for so long. I love the individuals too and all the staff cause we are so big hearted. Oh well I guess that's what happens when the big companies take over and can care less right!
bad,My direct manager had no sympathy didn't care about her workers at all.  But if you kissed her behind  you get  1st dibs on PTO or vacation  But for the hard workers she has she didn't really gave them 1st dibs on anything.  She is a bully    Period.
bad,"great temp agency to work fpr , worked very hard to make sure that i was able to find the best position that suited me , high recommended for people that are looking for a company that will work with you and not against you"
bad,"No growth potential unless you're in the clique, then sky's the limit. All the managers have their own agenda so don't expect any support for your projects or initiatives."
bad,Not a good working environment very stressful  on employees. A lot of micromanagement. Under staff and under paid for the amount of work being done. No good training and no there is no specific answer to any questions.
bad,"Very dependent on who your manager is.  "
bad,"Their call quality team = biggest joke ever. They wouldn't know what constituted a quality call if it struck them with headphones. They have no idea how to run a business there, what they are pandering is really not that good...always struck me as a DGS health plan - Don't Get Sick (Hopefully free healthcare for all will end all the madness). The training I received had absolutely nothing to do with the job I was being prepared for. It was like signing up for Military Basic Training and being taught history. They are terrible people when it comes to your schedule and breaks. There is no team support. This place gave me a panic attack."
bad,"opportunities are assigned based on friendships and not skill set"
bad,This company is extremely top heavy and do not have many middle level layers for advancement.  The compensation is on the lower end of the spectrum and management and job culture is of poor quality.
bad,"As a Supervisor, there was little to no autonomy with my nursing staff, my Manager was very much a ""micro-manager"" and very inappropriate at times. When I told the Director, she did not listen to what I was telling her, she told me to talk to this manager about my concerns.  We were forced to be On-Call weekends and had to man the phones most holidays.  I did enjoy my nurses who were all very professional and a great staff."
bad,"Building Prior Authorization"
bad,"Very high turnaround,"
bad,They dont have any flexibility. All desktop are VDI. No laptops except for higher manager.  8 hour fix schedule like call center even for system analyst.
bad,"Management treats employs poorly, is malicious, gives tainted food to their staff, always put down staff and never encourage them or let them know what they are doing right."
bad,Management refuses to send staff home to work unless you’re in a click with them. Managers live to micromanage because they don’t know their jobs. Run
bad,"Sorely understaffed, poor management, little supervisory support, severely incompetent training-if any, from day one of hire. Technology is far below what is necessary. Extreme favoritism. Constant, nearly daily but definitely weekly changes in protocol with great confusion, one hand doesn't know what the other is doing. Was very disappointed, I was looking forward to being a part of a foundation for a new product and although I enjoyed my job duties when looked at individually, overall it was a great disappointment. The company has such an upstanding reputation but every individual I know is deeply disappointed."
bad,"A typical day at Illinicare (a company under Centene) is chaotic. Staff are inundated with emails and back to back conference calls.  Many of the conference calls are redundant.  Unfair pay and work assignments. Lack of support and clear directions. Lack of insufficient trainings. Unclear or lack of clear job descriptions. Lack of advancement opportunities, unless you belong to a clique."
bad,Just bad management all the way around. The ones at the top keep on rolling while those who are at the bottom stay there. No upward mobility and tons of politics involved with every decision made. No work life balance at all. Management is not good at all and makes the job that much worse.
bad,"Pro's: "
bad,"Lots of hype, no action.  Not recommended. Very old school management style with an emphasis on your dress and how well you kiss as*.  Not a lot of substance.  Everyone is terrified of their boss, toxic atmosphere.  Setting themselves up for acquisition."
bad,"Work involved crisis calls, case management, care plan development, discharge planning, intake assessments, skill development, continuing education courses etc"
bad,"Prior to Centene's acquisition of my company, the culture was one of openness, family-like atmosphere, and dignity.  Post acquisition, none of those values apply.  Each day, no one knows if they will be termed.  Write-ups are frequent and nonsensical.  Management is so busy trying to catch up with changes and CYA, they don't lead.  Micro-management is rampant.  Favoritism is the culture.  Such a waste of a really great company pre-Centene.  Basically, they are the cheap retailer of healthcare."
bad,I choose not to answer this question regarding my last employer and I do not see why I have answer this question. It is not important at this point and time.
bad,Cyber security analyst. Pay is bad. Hours are long. Bad scheduling.  Trying to find another job with another company doing similar work. I want a regular schedule with weekends off.
bad,The leads treat you unfair. Management is not direct with you and will never give you a chance if you are not kissing up to them.  There is no job security from day 1. You dont have a life outside of work cause you are told mandatory over time is only for a couple months but thats not true its been that way for years
bad,The work environment would change drastically with better and more equipped management. It seems as if everyone is shooting from the hip and there is no communication between staff members. Its unorganized and it frustrates front line employees.
bad,"Management is lacking in common sense. All they care about is meeting quotas. Customer service takes a back seat to meeting numbers. Absolute chaos with management and training.  Always finding a way to cheat employees out of their bonus and changes job title to ensure they will not have to pay overtime and then make you work 60 to 70 hrs week. Refuse vacation time unless you meet their unrealistic quotas. They made my department work the Easter weekend as well as Memorial day and forth of July while management was at home celebrating with their loved ones. I always wondered why nurses who work here were stressed out, now after 1.5 yrs  I know. Management has the mind set that everyone is replaceable. Guess they never got the memo that it takes money to train people and with the revolving door believe me they spend more to train people who will never make it on the job because Centene sets you up to fail."
bad,"Starting as a temp employee was my mistake. No one could answer any question I had about when I could be permanent or how long I had to remain temp before submitting an app. no benefits (no sick days, no holiday pay) as a temp. After 6 months I had to fill out an application and interview for the position I was already in and already mastering.. hated it! Mean while the job can be stressful you are given a different schedule everyday of when to go on your breaks and lunch. Parking is horrible so if you come in after 8:30 be prepared to hike. Management is ok. Be expecting to meet quality at 94%, adherence, documentation and new demands monthly.  Also to monitored with everything you do."
bad,I came on at Centene as a temporary employee and the entire experience was horrible.  The initial job training teaches you nothing ro prepare you for the job load one is to face.  The work load is unbelievable considering the rewards and job security.  this company is unreasonably strict and doesn't provide the training to match.  The management team is supposed to be there to provide assistance and that too was a flop.
bad,A Medicaid pharmacy benefits provider for state Medicaid departments.    Recording and reporting transaction or encounters on a weekly or monthly basis.   Work is done in Oracle PL/SQL and korn shell.
bad,"There is no work/life balance...unable to take PTO when wanting to.  A set schedule so you cannot miss work unless you have someone to cover for you which is impossible."
bad,"Management always changes, unstable consistency, poor follow thru with"
bad,Inept management. Ridiculous workloads. Compensation levels are all over the board and not equitable. Highly political. Lack of vision and lack of impartiality from senior management keeps employees in an uproar and very dissatisfied.
bad,"Just feel as though it’s time to stop traveling to work and feel that I can be more productive working from the quiet of my home. Safety is an issue, as well"
bad,The training is extremely disorganized and discombobulated.  There are so many systems to do just one task it is confusing.  The training is rushed and the systems don’t work in the training environment.   So not really a good trained.  They only give you about 1-2 two days to listen then expect you to jump on the phone.  The pay is better than most call centers but it almost has to be for what they are asking on a daily basis
bad,"I have been there precisely 5 weeks  and realized 3 weeks in that I am totally mis-cast and miserable in my position. If things do not start to improve within the next few weeks  I won't be gone long -  I will be long gone. Job is not commensurate with my education, knowledge or aspirations. Job was misrepresented by and large. I am an MSN and am pre-authorizing wheelchairs,wheelchair parts. and formatting letters.  Might as work for auto parts company. Excessive, pointless and irrelevant meetings non-stop. Additionally I took a $3,000 pay cut for this travesty. I give it 3 more weeks and I'm out of here!"
bad,"I was pretty happy with the job until a new Manager replaced the previous one.  This one had a foul demeanor and by that I mean she would give you dirty looks, never respond to you when you greeted her and made sure the bathroom door would hit you as she passed you.  The workplace culture is ""never say anything to any one""  as it will be taken out of context and reported to HR.  Employees are encouraged to tattle on one another to H.R.  I would not be a bit surprised if the work area is taped to hear employee conversations.  I would work 2 hrs of unpaid overtime on a daily basis to keep up with the work load I was given which was immense.  It was never acknowledged or appreciated.  I left because I did not like the way I was treated by the Manager and felt her attitude towards me gave me no job security there.  Also the job performance measures were conflicting with the reality of what health plan members expressed and my license code of ethics is client's right to self-determine.   I felt pressured to pressure them into signing up for case management when they expressed they did not wish to participate in it.  Besides member's refusal to sign up for case management was the other dilemma that they would not even return your outreach attempts through calls and letter outreach."
bad,In the 3 years I worked for the company there were 3 different manager changes and 2 director changes.  Advancement was only offered to caucasian females with children.
bad,There is favortism through out the department. Many staff members are not treated fairly The moral in the deaprtment is very low and we have persons that do not have the proper qualifications running the department
bad,"Very difficult environment to excel in. The productivity measures are extremely unattainable, and if you are 97%, you are still reprimanded for not doing your job. The position as telephonic health coach will lead to burn out quickly. They require you to gather a large amount on info within 15 minutes and then provide coaching after filling out a huge database of health questions first, in which you are given negative feedback if you miss any question even if it is not pertinent to the needs of the customer. Expect to be on the phone for 8-10 hours with only a 30 min break. My co-workers showed me how to extend my calls by 30 mins which they would consider wrong but everyone had to do it in order to do their job. This is a call center environment and you are treated like a prisoner. If you are late even 2 minutes on a call, you have to bring up instant messenger to tell a CSR so they can document it rather than helping you."
bad,"Honestly, Centene as a company is good, but AcariaHealth as a branch, is horrible. Good health benefits, decant PTO, opportunity to grow (within centene as a whole, not AcariaHealth), and “OK” pay, depending on the branch you work at. "
bad,"Micromanagement is the cornerstone of CNC. If your idea doesn't coincide with upper management as it relates to performance improvement, it's better to keep it to yourself."
bad,"...for this company to treat it's employees as poorly as they do. This is a very very profitable company, who works closely with Indiana Medicaid. Unfortunately that success is not shared with the employees at the call center.  I had been with MHS for almost 2 years and had not received a raise. There is no employee engagement or incentive to stay. Please stay far away from this company.   MHS works hard to cheat it's employees out of their quarterly bonuses."
bad,"Horrible management!nt, since the merge w/ Healthnet it has been a mess! No one from centene works in Sacramento so everyone from healthnet is trying to teach centene systems but dont know how.  A lot of idk, well send an email.. but auditing as if systems were 100%. PTO is cool 18 accrued days 11 paid holidays. very strict, business casual. NO Overtime what so ever in Centene. bottom line stay away they underay just like hn. claims $16 per hour. waaaay under the average salary range for that title"
bad,"The hardest part of the job was my manager was just evil.  After going to HR, I was offered a severance package to leave because I was told she would make my life hard and I would loose my job."
bad,"Company  does a lot for employees  I must say that, but it is well deserved, you are just a number at Centene, they don't care about you per say. Management is horrible, my manager calls out every week, but is constantly writing others up for attendance, you can be great at your job and members can love your but if your not in good with the Quality crew, you wont get your bonus, or get advanced in this company, It really could have been a good place to work if someone comes in and cleans house around there. Also I've literally have seen people walk out crying and on a stretcher, its so crazy."
bad,"I can't make a fair statement about Centene however Sunshine Health is not one of the top places I have worked at  A good amount of people that started with me are now gone The management is unorganized and sets unrealistic goals.  Very questionable, shady business going on at least from what I see. You only get a promotion if you are very well liked."
bad,"Centene of Oregon which includes Trillium and Health Net do not communicate to employees the goals or outlook for the company as I believe management is not sure as both companies are very disorganized.  Managers for the different departments are not onsite so they are not aware of the actions of their employees.  The local HR department is not professional and do not return emails or calls from employees or managers, they have a bad reputation within the company.  Employees do not feel comfortable reaching out to HR but when employees have they are told you need to contact Centene Corp.  Centene of Oregon have lost several good employees for lack of caring for the welfare of their employees."
bad,"This position requires a Type A personality to survive. P and P changes daily, and expectations for workloads are unreasonable for many people. Inadequate staffing, and unreasonable demands. No support from management; if you are struggling, do not expect any assistance except from coworkers."
bad,It was ok for what it was. Some good people there but also horrible but cover it with a smile. I will never work there again with snotty females with funny attitudes.
bad,"Hardest part of the job is managing 120-150 Long Term Care cases with little to no support from management. Driving long distances are an essential part of the job. Work from home position, but little time for family and personal life."
bad,"CAUTION!! Headache waiting to happen!!! Management is over-zealous, pompous, know-it-alls. Any complaints will be in one ear, out the other. Unorganized. Lots of ""SOPs"" that don't really exist or they simply not implemented at all locations. However, management like to turn the other cheek and act like they don't know that or realize that. The right hand never knows what the left hand is doing. Too many chiefs, not enough Indians. Must I go on?? The whole team is unhappy, and if they are happy, you wouldn't know it. Everyone appears fed up.. a coworker even left the job in tears. It's out of control. I think the most enjoyable part of everyone's day is BREAK/LUNCH. You rarely get one... h*ll, you spend so much EMAILING back and forth with ""CHIEFS,"" that the concern for the patient is sometimes lost. I don't take well to disrespect on or off the job. There is no tactfulness or level of work etiquette with upper management. They see things one way: THEIRS. They scream TEAMWORK, VALUES, ETHICS, but from what I can see...they possess NONE. Perhaps, location-wise everyone on a team, is displaying teamwork...but as a Company - it does not exist."
bad,NO advancement . I felt as expendable as a trading card. no job secuirty with layoffs they just put the extra work on others instead of investing in the people.
bad,"Imagine: A picture that shows a beautiful corporate campus, nice water fountain, well-equipped workout room, healthy lunches, etc. Then suppose that the picture is only a temporary sticker that can be peeled away from one of the fraying edges. Upon peeling you will see a typical day at Centene..."
bad,"Everyday the attire for work is body armor, especially the back area. Management promotes back stabbing because they are trying to cover their behind for upper management. The dynamics are very cutthroat at this place. And the managers crack the whip as previously stated. The nurses are the ones that do the teaching, as much as they can because they are under tremendous stress. This is a horrible place to work for."
bad,"I worked in the call center, worst job I’ve ever had. Management had no direction, experience or ability to lead a group of 50 new employees. The corporate office didn’t have the infrastructure to keep a process in place long enough to matter for employees to succeed."
bad,Management needs adjusting. Management would select certain people and micro manage but not do the same for favorite employees. Had to have meetings with HR regarding my direct supervisor and the harassing behavior he had.
bad,The entire IT organization is having serious issues regarding trust and giving clear direction. Multiple change review meetings with requirements constantly changing.  IT functions under command and control philosophy; most areas lack any form of autonomy.
bad,"General computer training was provided but little to none for department specific training. Told during the interview on occasion I may need to stay to finish cases but that was a lie. You're expected  to stay long hours whenever the need arose(daily), the lunch hour is BS. I took 20 scarf food down and go back to work; multiple steps to perform one task.  No work flow mgr's attitude 'you should know this' and its been a few weeks. Mgr was new like me."
bad,The management over Projects lacks the knowledge to operate efficiently. The do not have people management skills nor to they listen to the advice of their employees on what is really happening on a project. The company has given too much autonomy to the companies they purchase.
bad,"Poor management, too young didn’t even know the job role depended on others to do their job , didn’t take initiative to learn the role. Very poor coaching given, no grooming for advancement, you have to beg to be cross trained in anything else."
bad,"Pays well but very political. Promotions are doled out by preference over performance throughout the organization.  They talk a good game and say all the right things, but behind closed doors it's a different story."
bad,"Centene offers 18 days paid vacation to FTEs.  Unfortunately, you can’t use them if you plan on keeping up with your work, but you will use them for doctors appointments, taking care of sick kids or anything else that requires you to be out of the office for more than a couple hours.  There is a culture of working yourself to death and burning out at this company.  It’s everywhere you look.  There is no work from home policy, professional dress is required and overall the company’s culture seems to be stuck in the 80’s.  There is also a strong culture of closed door meetings, hierarchical leadership, poor forecasting and inability to properly manage workloads, whole having no standardized professional development or training.  Avoid this company."
bad,They over hire so as they let people go or most quit they will still have people to cover the calls. Unrealistic job expectations. Unwilling to work with you for health or family emergencies.
bad,"Pros: 8am to 5pm "
bad,"Flying by the seat of their pants, Centene does have a lot of growth and has been lucky.  Most of their accomplishments have been on the back of their employees who work hard to enrich the CEO.  Many people don't know what they are doing much less understand the industry or their own department.   Some people have been here forever, they still don't know what their really doing.  Antiquated business culture combined with ignorant upper management didn't sit well with me.  Welcome to the early 1990's."
bad,My experience at Centene was not pleasant.  Average work week was 60+ hours and there was a high turn over rate. It wasn't a good fit if you want a work life balance.
bad,"I worked here for well over 3 years when suddenly I found out I was being laid off, along with several others. In the mean time the company newsletter was stating congratulations for a bunch of new hires. (Why couldn’t they have tried to place those who were laid off in other departments?) I worked hard and my productivity was good. About a week before I was laid off, I was told my numbers were good but my coworker needed to get her numbers up so I should not talk to her very much. Well she wasn’t laid off. Favoritism will get you far here and hard work will not. "
bad,"If you're employed servicing the Ambetter product, RUN!  Centene does not pay well at all and you are provided sub-par training regarding this product.  The metrics set for representatives are almost unattainable to avoid paying any bonuses.  When it comes to quality reviewing your calls, it is subjective to the analyst that is reviewing it.  I have made multiple complaints to HR and Centene's compliance hotline, they will not do anything regarding any concerns you may have.  I was ran off from my position and was bullied by my supervisor almost daily."
bad,"Supervisors were only semi-professional when corporate visitors came around. Otherwise they would ALL leave for two hour lunches ""meetings"" with operations manager. Only chance of ""advancing"" with the company was if you kissed up to supervisors. (CSR2 was the most you could advance within the company)"
bad,"This company looks amazing on paper,  but at this location (Lenexa,KS) -  I had never seen so much unethical, biased, unprofessional, & disgraceful examples of treatment towards the employees by Management (& above) than any other place I have at worked before. People were continuously singled out & targeted one by one with unfair treatment based off of some of the managements’ personal biased opinions, resulting in many of the employees being “pressured” to leave the company despite all of their positive work productivity & contributions. Also - many employees didn’t feel safe or comfortable reporting any issues to the HR department because nothing ended up staying confidential (many were confronted about any of the issues reported to HR by their managers or coworkers). But pertinent information regarding changes made to the companies policies/employee benefits/etc. were too often withheld from the employees. “Shady” would be an accurate description to describe the company & many of their actions during my employment there. It’s sad because this is an state insurance company for the people of KS & you’d hope for them to have better Medicaid company representatives for their care."
bad,"Terrible management. Favoritism, Lack of Advancement and Education. "
bad,"To much ""politics"". Employees are under-valued and not heard. Cut-Throat - I have witnessed many excellent leaders and employees put through the ringer (aka set-up to be fired). I, however, resigned and took an opportunity with a competitor."
bad,"My time there I enjoyed the company as they would buy us lunch, and sometimes fun activities, but your department is never stable as they will ask you to help other departments with little or no training. PTO is good but trying to schedule this time is always hard. Supervisors are clueless about everything and they never help. And if you’re thinking about moving up, you need to be a favorite otherwise forget about it"
bad,I had over 4 Managers in 3 years. Executive Management (Director and above) was changed out 3 times. Ever changing direction with unestablished measurables. No job security or Manager support. I enjoyed working with my local colleagues.
bad,"There was a lot of pressure to produce a lot of claims and there was too much room for errors and not enough explanation for the errors. Management was thin, assistance was thin, training was grueling. I was reprimanded for getting up and going to the bathroom."
bad,"Poor communication, poor management, poor treatment, impossible number of members to manage on case load. Very disorganized company with constant rules and policies changing. No support; poor moral"
bad,"Too much catty behavior. A lot of ""my way or the highway"" type of days. Micro management is fully enforced. The only thing I liked was the actual assistance I gave to the members."
bad,there was no training available and felt completely out of the loop with management. Also there was no training material readily available and often had no actual work to do
bad,"When first coming on board with this company everything seems typical with a few glitches so you think nothing of it. After a few weeks you start to notice the reality of the environment and why you are there.... the high turn over rate. This company has horrible middle management that lacks organization rendering it highly unpredictable. Favoritism was used making the environment very catty and juvenile leading to a toxic work environment. Training was mediocre as you are rushed through training only to be criticized later for not knowing the software in and out. Be prepared for unrealistic and unethical practices. Even with all of these indicators that there is a problem with management, upper management continues to neglect their duty to analyze mid-management and their day to day operation. This allowed mid-management to target and dismiss employees for their own faults as a team leader, this typically was done in a humiliating manner in the presence of several other co-workers. My advice is to do your research and be very cautious when considering this company as your future employer. Unfortunately it does appear that this company plans of changing it's practices anytime soon as they have a lengthy history similar concerns."
bad,"I worked as a Long Term Care Manager for Sunshine Health in Sunrise, Florida. However, I covered Palm Beach County.  I provided care coordination for individuals at home."
bad,"hard place to understand the flow of management.  Hire individuals in management that should not be.  Poor hiring practices. Somethings needed to be looked into."
bad,"Was hired as RN case manager,  Had a generic orientation with six other nurses.  On the last day of orientation I asked to speak with my manager to ask her to define my job.  Her response while laughing was "" I really don't know"".  She truly did not know and I was immediately frightened.  If she didn't know, how would I learn the job?  It all went downhill from there.  Management had airs of superiority, gave mandatory overtime, had no respect for the workers.  I oriented with five other nurses and within four months, they and I had all resigned.  Only apply if desperate."
bad,"If your a LPN dont even bother applying unless your are tired and just want to sit in a cubicle be micromanaged and everything you do and say is scrutinized. This is a CALL CENTER nothing to do with nursing because the same questions and plans you work on so do the other telephone agents aka ""customer care professionals"" the supervisors are only worried about numbers how long it takes you to get from one call to next...no place for advancement"
bad,"This was just a temp assignment so it could have been worse. A typical day included calling Medicaid recipient to complete surveys. The management treated the employees in an infantile or slave type manner. We were not allowed to talk to co-workers during work hours, they didn't like us going to the restroom or getting a drink if it wasn't our scheduled break time. There was no lunch so you were pretty much at your desk all day. They also micro-managed employees."
bad,There are no policies and procedures in place. They are made up as you go. Some of the managers have bully type attitudes toward their employees and they are known to make your job difficult just to get you to quit.
bad,Verify members insurance coverage for services. Verify providers contracts for services as par or non par for behavioral health services based on medicaid and medicare.
bad,The management team doesn't act/perform with your job requirements.  They are too busy trying to be the employee friend and not their boss.  The professionally has left this office
bad,"Centene is a growth company.  What that means is they are constanty growing and aquiring other businesses.  This leads to ""controlled chaos"", there are no processes or procedures in place for most areas.  Management is in a constant state of flux, meaning they are either moving around or being cleaned out on the regular.  CEO is only concerned with climbing the Forbes list.  He is also a dinosaur who refuses to bring the workplace into the present age.  IE...there is no work from home despite everyone being issued a laptop devide and the coproration having all the technology to support remote workers."
bad,"A handful of staff/mgmt from the UM Dept do not hold ethics where they should. They do not treat the hard workers well, in fact they take advantage of them. Overworked, underpaid and no real support when you inform management of valid issues found.  No true management support because most of the time they are not in the department or they are working from home.  You cannot manage a UM Dept remotely.  This is a very toxic department where the individuals with nasty attitudes seem to get promoted faster than those who put forth blood, sweat and tears.  You will tend to be working OT a lot and that is due to people not showing up on Mondays/Fridays, call-outs can be excessive which causes the workload to inflate and you get backed up.  If you find legitimate problems within the work and report it, it is more than likely management will not see it through.  Staff who have caused such work-place harassment, back-stabbing conversations, talking trash about other people does not stop.  These folks are the ones who tend to simply be able to get away with things while the actual good people, the hard workers, are badly taken advantage of.  Dont expect growth in opportunities.  There are none."
bad,"very toxic, not paid as well as other MCO's. high turnover , I did gain great experience here, poor management, some work at home options but it is limited and not consistent"
bad,"Management is loss - promotion based on who you know."
bad,"This is an overrated call center. I was under the impression that I would making calls to members (that were expecting my calls) and helping them to improve their health and decrease the amount of ER visits. What this really was was a script that I'm supposed to read and ask imposing questions of the members and not really help them at all. If I knew this was a typical call center to gather information for insurance companies, I never would have accepted the job."
bad,Working here has pushed me to learn a number of new skills. I have learned new technologies from peers and being proactive. Overall it's the people not the company that make the days go by. The corporation has a vision as software first which should help to provide consistent experiences for members.
bad,This job started off as advancement for me compared to where I was heading. Once i learned to adapt to the working environment I had to learn to eith either go with the flow or find somewhere else to go. Once the company or managers find out you want to grow they make any attempt to block your growth. The hardest part of this job now is trying to get out of the company it like they wont let me go. I dont want to end up with nothing but this job is really a bad place to work. I come in and do my job and I am out the door.
bad,"The rules constantly changes as far as how to log in for the day, what's allowed for dress code, hours you are to work, never liked talking. never know from next day to another what your duties were, always changing."
bad,"I worked in Case Management. It is the most unorganized and dysfunctional place I have ever worked. Upper management does everything at the last minute an expects perfection from staff with no leadership whatsoever. If you want to make a difference and have work/life balance this is not the place for you. The managers and directors are pulled in a thousand different directions because it is so unorganized that they can never spend time helping the team be successful. The turnover is HIGH!!  If you like stress, dysfunction and no leadership then this is the place for you!"
bad,Typical day at EPS involved many hours of meetings.  Many times with the same people. Many times with vendors.  Unless you know (not going to put anything else up right now) but later check back.
bad,"Compensation's great, but the workplace stress was unnecessary. Poor organizational skills seem endemic to management, and micromanagement or complete absence of guidance were the only two other options."
bad,"""Project management"" is a 4-letter word here. Most of upper management/senior leadership is housed in offices within 100ft of each other, yet an outsider might assume half of them have never met based on the amount of difficulty they seem to have coordinating even basic project tasks. "
bad,"a Typical work day as a Behavior Case Manager included but was not limited to, handling crisis and warm transfer calls, completing assessments,  case management work with clients. mandatory meeting with staff, mandatory online trainings, and  lots of Paperwork."
bad,"Go elsewhere, unless you like having to use 20 different systems to do your job, many of which work poorly. High stress. Supervisors who have never done the job therefore they don't understand what you are asking when there is an issue or how to assist you thereby forcing you to hunt down one who does. A lot of unscheduled overtime which makes it hard to have  work/life balance. You can ask 5 different supervisors/leads a question and get 5 different answers, only one of which will be correct."
bad,Centene is an umbrella company for under insured or the uninsured. Their management and training programs for their federal government contract divisions are horrible and some of their division managers are awful. They do not involve themselves to issues in a positive manner....ever.  Lots of hostile environments.
bad,"After we bought out Healthnet things appear to have spiraled down hill. Now instead of implementing things the Centene way, we are going backwards and implementing the less effective Healthnet way."
bad,"Set up for failure. Was provided a salaried position when onboarded with 10 reviews per day. Mid-employment, the managers switched everyone to hourly which affected our vacation, PTO days, and how much we actually made. The reviews per day changed from 10-12 (max) to an unreasonable 15-17. Unobtainable goal. Some people were allowed to work remotely while others were not. The employee culture was that of a bullying one with no onsite supervisor to intervene despite multiple requests for assistance, help, even met multiple times with the HR rep & for of HR."
bad,The culture of Sunshine Health has changed.The company has lost focus on quality work with members and appear to be numbers driven. Leadership is disorganized.
bad,Management is horrible here... The people I work are great.  I would  recommend you to turn around NOW and apply to another company... Benefits are decent here but that’s all you will got out of it. Manament rule with a iron fist!!!
bad,"I was hired here and was told it was a work from home position. I left my job and was excited to start the 2 week training. It was going to be a long commute but well worth it to work from home. Once I started, I met my team and some had been in training for months. Management voiced training was now a minimum of 5 weeks. The trainer spoke about the poor operating systems and company culture. It was horrible."
bad,"When I first started working at Centene, I valued the fast pace of how operations were moving along. A month later, I regretted my employment. There was lack of leadership, lack of training, lack of communication, and lack of management. I was unable to do my job to the best of my ability due to the company's culture. Every one was quiet as church mice and when you ask for assistance, no one knew anything or could help."
bad,"Health Net, Inc. was aquired by Centene. I had an open mind at first but was quickly shown that the culture is not collaborative. The management style is more dictatorship and questions are not welcome."
bad,"Too much of a cut throat environment.  A public company just feeding on the back of the Federal government's healthcare subsidies, and focus on quarterly profits. So, micromanagers send nasty grams on daily work timelines. Not a job for any serious longevity."
bad,Leadership positions are filled with inexperienced individuals without healthcare background. Not a lot of concern about doing what’s right vs doing what’s cheap.
bad,"It was not about what you know, its about how can kiss booty more. Management was horrible and need experience and education. Women were nice. People ate each others food and drunk each others drinks. People stole small things like staplers and headphones for no reason, probably to have at home."
bad,"Team members are difficult to trust as they like to talk about someone to other piers. Favoritism plays a huge roll in the company. There is a couple of immature examiners that like to talk  about the work of another among each other. People pretends to be nice but they are really not. They think highly of them self. During quiet time, you can hear gum popping, complains about how other examiners process their claims. They like to choose a target and stick to that target."
bad,"Get in, do work, leave. Don't need to communicate too much with others. Good place to get in overtime as it becomes mandatory seasonally. Management depends on department"
bad,As the years have progressed this job has gotten very stressful in addition to altering our Vacation & PTO time.  The compensation doesn't match there  high level of expectations. They also changed some portions of our medical insurance which was not in the employees interest.
bad,"standard hours"
bad,"I can only speak my office, but it was 3 floors of dysfunctional office politics, interdepartment feuds, unwillingness to collaborate.   As far as the job, the compensations is great. They pay you very well, high if not the highest in the industry.   You will work with you hair on fire, fast paced, metric oriented work.  Lots of reports, initiatives, and goals.  Many personal hours will be spent completing reports etc because the normal fast paced work day schedule will not allow for time to complete.  Working there did teach me extreme time management (like be efficient or get rolled) and the nuances of office politics.  So if you like long hours at a blistering pace, without much mid managment support for GREAT PAY.  This is the company for you."
bad,"Uppermangement cares more for making numbers then employees,  understaffed departments makes work stressful for staff, inconsistent breaks and lunches and reducing or taking breaks away. HR not helpful when it comes to medical leave."
bad,The benefits are excellent comparatively speaking. Pay is higher than average. Decent work-life balance. You pretty much know what is expect of you.
bad,A typical day at work involves management; supervisor; leads and anyone else sending emails all stating the same thing. You will work all holidays and every other Saturday. You really don't get much time to get to know your co workers because of the demand placed on you to get HRS done. The job is not hard especially if you like to talk with the members. However it is a lot of repetitive calling.  Actually it is enjoyable knowing you are helping people but really feel bad when you are not able to find the right resource needed.  The worst part of the job is that some of the members are rude but that's just a small percentage.
bad,"This company is okay if you are desperate for a job. The work environment is unsatisfactory. Most employees seemed unhappy, stressed, and depressed. Management is unprofessional and rude at most times. I am glad i resigned from this company."
bad,The co-workers treated most temps like you were a temp. The flexibility is the only good part of the job.
bad,The pay and a few others that are unhappy and understand the favoritism is rampant.... it's just a pay check. There are some supervisors who want success for reps but most are just repeating the typical corporate bs
bad,"At first, it seems like a great place to work. But once you get on the floor everything changes. The company is very uptight and hardcore. A very strict place to work."
bad,Many changes going on. People come and go in a flash. There is no consistency with management. 2/5 start working rate. Left hand and Right hand argue more than siblings in a long car ride
bad,"Contract to perm hire RN responsible for pre authorizations via computer.  My computer log on credentials were not prepared in a timely fashion by IT , so I was unable to have hands on until the final day. of a week long software orientation  The server would consistently go down due to system wide over load, yet the expectation from management was such that quotas must be met as per contractual agreement.  Turn over was tremendous in all roles based on observation from IT, to nursing management, to security. "
bad,"Although the pay is good and the benefits are excellent, it’s not worth the stress that you experience working there. They micro-manage the employees and treat them like children. They are biased toward the employees and let some get away with murder while others are yelled at (yes... yelled at) for minuscule things. It’s not worth the money."
bad,"Not a positive environment for the clinically skilled behavioral health provider, poor management, constantly changing priorities, corporate driven monetary goals override clinical recommendations"
bad,"very difficult to balance work/life"
bad,"For the most part, I felt I wasn't heard by HR and didn't benefit from the manager I was under. My manager was constantly over me micro-managing every part of projects I was handling; providing no trust in what work I was doing. I had let HR know what happened and the information was shared to my manager. Whenever I had asked questions, she used my questions against me making me feel incompetent about my position and would write me up for no reason. HR did nothing about it and my manager retaliated when I did say something."
bad,"If you like being chained to a desk, micromanaged by your supervisor, valued only for meeting ""metrics,"" being watched at all times by surveillance cameras and your computer, and lying to the patients you are supposed to serve, this is the place for you. This company is a holding company that buys up smaller insurance companies and removes all benefits it had to customers before the purchase. The supervisors are not properly trained, and the computer system is unnecessarily complex, cumbersome, and difficult to use. They do put time into training the line staff. The company cares only about the bottom line, though, and it is driven entirely by metrics, not by any corporate ""mission statement."" They do pay well, but the dread I felt going in every day was not worth the salary."
bad,"After completion of basic position training, there is virtually none on the critical aspects of the job to be successful. Each new investigator is required to reinvent the wheel when learning how to complete data mining searches. It was crazy and inexplicable! The SIU is cliquey and it is imperative you fit in. There are a dozen ways to be pushed out."
bad,"RUNNNNN! Extremely high turn over because once people are hired they realize that Management knows nothing! Goals and expectations are constantly changing - for the worse! Not enough time in the day to meet your goals. Centene also makes you take loads and loads of silly trainings! For example, I’ve had 3 trainings this week in which only one of them actually impacted my role/position. Constant meetings about nonsense, high utilizer and ICT meetings are sometimes helpful but most times not. This company is constantly “restructuring and reorganizing” but still always seem to be going back to the drawing board bc nothing they do works. We lost a VP, Director, Senior VP, and CEO for FL all in the same month... not sure if they were forced out or left on their own accord. That speaks volumes! Managers don’t know the work processes and are basically little puppets of Corporate. RUN far away from this place unless you like wasting your time."
bad,"the job entailed sitting for prolonged periods with very strict breaks and lunches and not always condusive to  one's personal needs, and "
bad,Company has competitive salary but the work culture is not good. You have to constantly watch out for someone trying to take your job or discredit you. Promotions are not based on experience and hard work but rather favoritism and age.  A total corporate environment where you are not valued for your efforts and loyalty and treated as a mere body that could be easily disposed of in a heart beat.
bad,This is by far the worst job I have had as a nurse.  The atlanta site is partial to one ethnic group which is about 95% of staff.  Overt racism and general ugliness if you dont fit into this group in some cases.  Very poor morale. Even managers are leaving.  Unprofessional atmosphere with alot of loud talking and laughing. Often amongst managers. No consideration for nurses on the phone and how the loud noise can be heard by paying customers.
bad,Convenience and close to home. Pay was descent for the position.  Management was horrible. Co workers were ok as well but it was a cut throat environment
bad,"I was paid well, but there was a weird and toxic culture and subculture. Very educated and skilled people in a group setting that did not support each other or work as a team. Lots of clicks. Some upper management could not direct me or provide guidance or leadership because they did not know themselves or were unprofessional. Other upper management and administrators wouldn't even speak.Too much to do, half of it unnecessary; inefficient systems. Poor work environment and unattainable goals. If its just about the money, go for it. My happiness and well being is more important."
bad,Pay and benefits are fair. Talented coworkers dedicated to doing the job right the first time. Company direction is not communicated well. Organizational structure changes without much notice.
bad,"While a supervisor who is assertive and goal oriented is necessary, cutting out team members is not a way to achieve goals. When a team member is struggling to understand a concept it is imperative that all steps are taken to insure that employee understands the processes necessary to get the job done. Threatening to fire an employee or writing them up for misunderstanding is not conducive to educating the employee. There are more options that can be explored, yet, supervisors tend to simply jump the gun on writing people up which, frankly, does not help the employee at all, it merely motivates them to get out of the company while they still have time to find another job and before there is a huge break in paychecks. EMPLOYERS, SUPERVISORS, MANAGERS NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE EMPLOYEES UNDER THEM ARE NOT JOB FILLERS OR MACHINES, YOUR INFLUENCE ON THEM RUNS DEEP. EMPLOYEES HAVE BILLS, THEY HAVE CHILDREN THEY HAVE PLANS AND GOALS FOR THE FUTURE. Try to remember that next time you're to sodding lazy to up-train or reeducate a budding employee."
bad,The pay was excellent but I didn't feel like I was given the same opportunities as others to advance. There was a lot of favoritism but it was a great job that I sometimes worked remotely.
bad,Centene while more recently trying to improve suffers from mismanagement and unclear guidance.  This results in miscommunication and unclear guidance on performance standards and achievements.
bad,Centene is growing rapidly and that makes the management schizophrenic.  Managers come and go rapidly. There is never a consistent plan for a department for more than 6 months. There is never time to institute a plan before a new manager has a new plan for the department.  Work loads can be insane due to hiring not keeping up with rapid growth.
bad,"As soon as you finish your training you go on the floor. They assume that you know your work immediately. Training on floor only a week long. You are in your own, supervisor expect a lot from you. Lots of overtime with not enough employee to maintain the work load. Please to fall for this trap. Pay is OK but the amount of work is a lot. Think about it before you commit."
bad,"Favoritism is felt left & right - senior mgt maintains a constant vigil of the work area to give a feel of ""working in a warehouse"", no special watch dog required - if you got no job else and can enjoy being looked down upon, this is your best bet!"
bad,"No work life balance but in fairness, they don't say that they offer that."
bad,"Key words: Micro-managed, unknowledgeable management, high school culture, messy managers, old outdated systems and processes.  They pay good but is it worth your sanity."
bad,"Well working for centene was hmm interesting. I liked it at first the pay is nice but the actual job is torture. The software is god awful. The worst I have ever used  with no contest. Everything needs to be notated at least 3 times and you will fail your call even if the customers questions are answered and the customer got all the help needed if you forget a detail of the many many questions a member would ask you have failed your call and are punished accordingly. BTW passing is a 95 percent or above anything underneath is a failure and you are punished accordingly. No jeans are allowed men must tuck their shirts in and are far more scrutinized than women, formal shoes are required.The supervisors are not helpful and do not like to be bothered or questioned. It seems like they work somewhere else and direct you to the chat where the people are rude to answer you and MOCK you in front of everyone for not knowing an answer on a daily basis. They do not like the same questions asked and expect you to read the chat while getting back to back calls and having to notate paragraphs and paragraph on every call about 3 different times . Very stressful and managers and supervisors are unhelpful and only out for themselves. Mangers also like to play god and will move seats for no apparent reason after you have made a friend. Literally seats are changed every 3 months . An ok place to work but the software is seriously bad and has soooo many ridiculous glitches and everything needs to be notated multiple times. A very gitchy horrible unorganized slow software that you are forced to be"
bad,I was contracted and went above and beyond my daily goals as a Business Analyst. My contract ended abruptly due to a so-call budget cut. The new VP made this decision to end my contract without considering my productivity. They lost a great worker. I had high expectations to get hired on FT.
bad,"Not great management, long hours, low chance for advancement. The training for a new managers are very generalized and not job specific. The engagement and retention of employees could be better. Employees not motivated for stay."
bad,Management has horrible communication skills and they leave out the “little guy.” The work itself wasn’t difficult but getting straight answers out of anyone was difficult.
bad,"Very weak, disorganized orientation. Different instructions were given to each group of department new hires. No onsite, credible source to answer the ""how-to"" questions. Poor leadership. More interested in output quantity instead of output quality."
bad,General work culture is difficult.  Management always looking for a way to blame employees instead if asking themselves what they might be doing wrong.  Poor orientation and training. Management does not respond or resolve concerns.  Great benefits and average pay compared to other companies.
bad,"If you enjoy working in a position that is highly scrutinized by supervisors and managers, this company is for you. You are required to sit all day and not encouraged to speak to your co-workers. If you have a question, they encourage you to ask your floor supervisor, but he/she may not be immediately available to assit...which will affect your claims settlement."
bad,"Fast paced, challenging environment.  Every day is different.  Culture is to be typically under staffed, so there is a lack of work/life balance.  Expected to work beyond 40 hours per week regardless of position."
bad,"there is favoritism and it's not what you know but who you know in order to move up with this company. the ""non favorites' are stuck doing the dirty work and getting reprimanded if they are not at 100% on QA or adherence but the favorites get a free pass"
bad,"*very isolated work tasks, and repetitive"
bad,"Overall a great company with great pay and benefits. The biggest disappointment was poor management; both lack of skill/tact and unnecessary micromanagement. Not all departments and/or individuals are held to the same standards and there is definitely favoritism in a few different areas. During my employment, I witnessed several great employees leave due to inept management, unfair treatment, and childish practices (including rules irrelevant to some jobs and people being thrown under the bus). My manager was probably the worst I have ever had...hypocritical, poor people/management skills, and had no backbone when it came to supporting/defending the team/individual members. Serious consideration needs to be taken concerning employee work life balance and autonomy for one's on work/schedule. The way employees are treated and appreciated, bottom line, determines their level of performance and dedication to the company they work for. However, they seem willing to see excellent employees leave over petty reasons."
bad,"This is a call center- basically you just sit and call people all day, pay is good, but this is more like high pressure sales and not health care.   Chaotic"
bad,"You work hourly, and are under much stress to do more.  OT is mandatory, and you are told that day that you will have to stay late for 2 hours."
bad,"The job itself is easy, but the incompetence of management makes work-life unbearable. I am constantly harassed for matters that are being displayed by persons in leadership, however I never receive feedback on my actual work."
bad,Roles and responsibilities are always changing. Company is in a growth phase and has no time to wait for you to catch up. Compensation and benefits are good but its hard to justify with the lack of competent management.
bad,"Day starts out quiet with communication with management through emails. Learned policies & procedures for the Affordable Care Act also known as Obama Care. Management was rarely seen or heard unless new policies were implemented or policy violations were incurred. Co-workers were key to learning much of what you didn't learn in trainings. Hardest part was being that the policies were new, being able to get sure answers from management. Enjoyable part was customers."
bad,I was a health and wellness coach.  I enjoyed educating the members and learning about their lives.  The co-workers were fabulous.  A typical day was sit at my desk make phone call after phone call educating patients if they were available and rescheduling for the next call.  If they weren't available I reached out and did cold calling.  The hardest part was having to cut off the call with the member due to time constraints.
bad,I have been with the plan for 5 years and like many of the other reviews it is all about who likes you and who does not. Your promotion is not based on job performance but how brown your nose is.
bad,"Management department is terrible. If you go complain to HR, nothing gets resolved, HR will not hear your side of story. They end up firing you for complaining/ reporting management."
bad,"Centene is business all the way. Breaks are taken all at one time with the whole company of 300 plus employees. Atmosphere is very rigid and cold due to emphasis on production and accuracy. After the break you can hear a pin drop, there is no communication between co-workers except for employees being helped by team leads. It is a very sterile environment. Training was intense and quick. Security of information on the computers is of the utmost importance with you having to log off any time you leave your desk. On the plus side the benefits are wonderful and they offer day care with a complete learning program for children of employees. Starting salary is good."
bad,I thought I had found a great company to work for but my time here has been absolutely miserable. Too much stress and unrealistic expectations from managers and directors. Now upper management is requiring case managers to work at least 200 cases per year; this includes complex cases with patients who have multiple co-morbidities and require much follow-up. Constant meetings take away precious time to get your work done. It’s a joke.
bad,Work Life balance is out of control.  I really don’t have anything to say about this company.  In fact I’m not allowed to say anything about this company.
bad,"Crazy making place to work. Rules change on a whim. If you’re a favorite then you might stay there more than a year. Lack of transparency, managers will not be on your side, and the main focus is on metrics. Horrible place to work. It was like being in grade school all over again. Coworkers would complain daily. Don’t do it, you’ll regret it. The only plus was the insensitive"
bad,"Was excited to work there after my interview and when I started. However, the longer I worked there, the more apparent it became they aren’t who they appear to be."
bad,Worked remotely as a Care Manager. Spent 10+ hours each day at my desk making calls to patients and assisting them with needs or providing teaching for preventative healthcare. Then was obligated to spend 4-5 hours more past the 8 hour workday completing charting in order to meet required deadlines. Workload was overly demanding with very little work-life balance. Majority of responsibility falls to the RN Case Managers and Social Workers.
bad,"Poor management and workplace culture. The work is fairly easy, however, the hardest part is dealing with bad attitudes and people with a sense of entitlement which is allowed by management. Much favoritism going on. Peers doing managerial duties and ordering others around."
bad,"They're in a period of strong transition right now, so there's been pretty massive turnover and very low morale. There's a chance other departments are better, but mine isn't one of those."
bad,Was hired with understanding of mandatory overtime that turned into no job work/life balance until finances questioned overtime and stopped overtime with no clear suggestion on how to get the work done with no overtime.
bad,"It's a great job for the pay, but if you're looking for a career Centene may not be the place for you. Management is nonexistent, and the company is lacking a clear direction."
bad,Bad management and work hours. they don't fallow there policies and don't take security seriously. it's a sinking ship going down fast. i wouldn't recommend anyone working here.
bad,"reviewed charts for medical necessity."
bad,"Nice pay, unhealthy work environment.  Good peers, upper management has no idea what they are doing. Left (toook paycut) to regain sanity and be valued.  Staff is just numbers to make state contracts look good."
bad,They don't have enough staff to do the work needed. Pay and benefits are great. The job is stressful and when you have a problem sometimes they don't want to hear It and they tell you stop complaining and get the job done. No room for advancement with me being a nurse.
bad,"First off, things aren't all bad.  Job security is good, as are compensation and benefits.  Corporate campus is great and you are surrounded by ""prestige"" on a daily basis - more on that later.  If those things float your proverbial boat, Centene may be the place for you.  If you require anything more from your employer in the way of missions, visions, etc. then keep looking.  The perks may be enough to get you in the door but the love affair won't last as you are exposed to the dysfunction, drama, and complete inability of the company to responsibly manage it's growth.  Management philosophy and systems are outdated and a huge cause of stress for employees.  Unfortunately, the culture at the corporate office is reminiscent of one's youth, to put it nicely.  Probably the result of upper leadership being more concerned with image and prestige than reminding folks we are primarily there to serve taxpayers (states) by managing their Medicaid population (although we do have some commercial lines of business as well).  Leadership continually reiterates Fortune rankings and how we are ""the biggest this"" or ""the biggest that.""  Discussion of what we have actually done or achieved as a company to save the states money and improve people's health is almost non-existent.  Even our new campus plans account for ""luxury shopping and boutique hotels.""  Really? If you are looking here because you think it's a place to ""help people"" then keep looking (at least from a corporate office standpoint) - you'll be sorely disappointed.  If you enjoy 1980s-style management in a chaotic and inept process"
bad,Management needs improvement on how to treat employees as a person and not just another number.
bad,"I interviewed through Employment agency for supervisor trainee position. Centene Operations management in NC location offered me the position, with the requirement that I work a 3 month contract to learn associates jobs and cover desks while 2 employees on medical leave. I worked two different desks for 3 months and then was informed their dept function was outsourced to outside vendor. Management lied about about the job and I was used to cover employees on medical leave. Would not recommend this company to my family or friends."
bad,Very poor judgement is used for promotions and leadership the pay is worth it but the management is solely based off of who you know if you aren't in cahoots with upper management good luck or you have to kiss your way up.
bad,"I was hired with Centene through a temp agency. They job can be a little overwhelming but if you have call center experience it should come easy. Very high turnover do to required expectations and attendance. They would rather fire someone verses trying to help them succeed in their position. QA the only thing this job cares about, your calls can be awesome and customer service could be amazing but if you do not pass QA your job may be at risk. Management also makes it seem as if they want you to succeed and some may but most do not care."
bad,These are the most demeaning and racist people. There is no chance for advancement if you’re not a white male. They promote white men for no reason at all. Dead end for anyone else.
bad,"Worked on the crisis line. Very fast paced, demanding, high-stress environment. Continuous pressure by managers to cut off inbound callers in crisis to keep department numbers looking good. Always short staffed facing critical staffing shortages. Pay was great but there was always pressure to work overtime (daily texts asking you to come in), even mandatory overtime. Loved my colleagues who were very hard working. You need to have thick skin and be able to dissociate in order to handle many of the calls. The worst part of the job for staff was dealing with very abusive, frequent callers throughout your shift. Upper management was not supportive of staff, very toxic. Provided staff no time to debrief after emotionally distressing calls due to continuous pressure to address the high volume of inbound calls. Definitely a churn and burn environment. Very high staff turnover. Stay away unless you are very motivated by money, which most of the staff were."
bad,"I was let go from Centene, supposedly an investigation was done on the matter but if it was it was not done correctly. Management was good, loved my supervisor but HR needs to be replaced."
bad,Will tell any lie to satisfy employee at the moment. Lots and lots of favortism you will not move ahead if management friend ot family is employed. Their favorites have a better chance moving ahead then a hardworking employee.  Very petty and very judgmental....also do not have kids and work here. Your child could be a on their death bed Centene do not care as long as you satisfy their workload.
bad,"I liked working with the members and providing Services for them but, the work environment is AWFUL. The supervisor has certain people she likes & if someone stands up for themselves she becomes hostile towards them. Some of the employees there are very unprofessional because they make fun of other SHP employees that they don't even know. The supervisor reciprocates this behavior and allows this to go on. She even instigates it at times. I have never worked in a worse place where a company allows this behavior. If they will make some changes then it would be a nice place to work but until they get rid of the Supervisor& at least 2 other trouble makers I WOULD NOT recommend this work environment to anyone. I have had professional jobs and worked with good professionals but this place is the most hostile environment I have ever been associated with. It really is utterly despicable. Do not work in this office!!!!"
bad,"Productive and busy work place. A typical day at work "
bad,"In New yok, Centene is a company with a lot of favoritism, you might be the best employee, but if you are not friend of the one who makes the big desicion you will be in the same position ever!"
bad,"Centene was good in the beginning back in 2017 When I first started. It stayed that way until around the eighth month and it begin to change for the worst. I looked around just about all of my co-workers were gone that started with me. A new manager came in and it went from well organized to no organization not communicating . I was approved for vacation time, but it conflicted with training that I had coming up.  The manager asked my supervisor to call me at the last minute saying not to take my already approved vacation time. When I  took my vacation the manager retaliated by not allowing me to go to another department and continue to use tactics by trying to find reason to terminate me. This is to the manager I hope you are reading this, because you didn’t know your job it cause me a lot of mental anguish and distress unnecessarily because you are the one that didn’t know what the heck you were doing  Mr. R."
bad,"The training is a rushed affair. If you are struggling they make little effort to help. They have very confusing and outdated software which is difficult to navigate. Once you learn one concept they go right on to another, leaving you no time to absorb what you just learned before."
bad,The job I held was ok. When I first sat down at the desk things did not seem right so I was immediately looking for an avenue out. People around me are still there and they are trying to get out of that place too.
bad,Overall not a bad job suffers from management disorganization among st leadership. Has a great overview of family oriented and looks out for the employees tries to create a good working environment but management lacks.
bad,"Under-invest in systems environment and antiquated culture. There are many hardworking, good people, that will hopefully be running the company one day."
bad,Was not happy at Centene as I was just reviewing completed contracts and validated all nec. documents were attached. Scanned completed contracts and were then sent to corporate in sunrise Fl.
bad,"A typical work day was from 7:30- 4pm. I learned to ask more question about their sales process management, example of current successful business closed, and any current sales cycle barriers that hamper the closing of sales.  "
bad,"I answered phones, took calls regarding members mhs insurance. Management was not as understanding as they should be and they changed the rules on a daily basis"
bad,Management is new and do not know the positions they are managing. This is very frustrating for the Analysts. The goals are unrealistic and they try to strike fear in you to get goals accomplished. Very underpaid to put up with the above working environment.
bad,"The disorganization is legendary. Even though they pay excellent recruitment bonuses for bringing persons you know on, no reasonable person would recruit family or friends to this workplace! Leadership is a revolving door, and with every change in management there is a shift in direction. Hiring is postponed until operations reach critical mass, and then there is no training. It is learn as you go with little direction. Killer workloads in a stress laden environment makes pursuit of employment with this company an unwise move."
bad,"I had a director that was just totally unprofessional, causing a hostile working environment. I was harassed weekly for taking 4 hours for therapy which I was approved for under FMLA. Any an everything I did was downgraded. I was laid off while in the hospital fighting for my life!  The company itself is great but the leadership sucks."
bad,". The plan is a very bad and for that reason the members that called in were always irate, causing the meteics not to be met . The management were all good people. But the metrics were unreasonable and causes alot of stress during each call."
bad,"Not so great with work life balance, but the people were very nice and the pay was nice as well. If you are looking for an enviornment with alot of collaboration and close working friendships, this may not be the place...."
good,"Typical workday consists of monotonous activities. Danger of becoming stagnant without setting personal goals.  Inadequate training. Poor leadership. ""Figure it out yourself"" culture."
good,I Have worked this company for almost a year and seen many cry because the work is ill defined and overly demanding. My manager berates us and then refuses to answer our questions. It is frequently a problem  (even though you work from home)...that you are expected to immiediately answer emails and phone calls while you are trying to chart or speak to members in their homes. HR refuses to help stating that we should tell the manager we feel she is abusive...overall the work wouldn't be bad- but toxic people and a disconnected/too large company feel ruin this job.
good,"I was contract in the pharmacy area to review usage of medications and compliance.  The multi computer programs with no auto dial on spreadsheets was overwhelming.   There was no patience in rph training.  Unorganized pharmacy work flow orientation and on boarding was a mess."
good,The way its ran and by whom is terrible. Management was the worst I've ever experienced. Centene as a corporation is amazing though so I doubt the people who could make a difference even know the half.
good,"They only focus on numbers, there is never any break for semi fun, all work."
good,Centene is a good company but Envolved People Care isn't a department that I would try to grow within. Pay isn't enough and the management is very bad.
good,"This company is great, good pay, but what you have to go through to get your pay is awful! Forced slavery, overtime is ridiculous and management doesn't care if you have a life and kids to go home or not! Lack of  communication, nepotism, and unfair hiring practices are at play here. Never a thank you, or any praise or appreciation given for the team that works most holidays. The only good thing is pay and benefits. They also need to give more sick days, they are pitiful giving 4 days a year!"
good,Was not a company that I could see any growth. Also lacked training when you did complete the training. There was no additional training for the call center reps we were left to depend on each other a learn as you go.
good,"If arent the ""right"" color you wont go anywhere with the company. They do not treat everyone fairly and do not take harassment claims seriously. Worst place I have ever worked."
good,Stable employment with fair compensation. Overwhelming and blatant favoritism in promotions.
good,"Be careful if applying for the admin 1 position that is currently open in Austin. The group that this position is hiring for has been through a number of admins and NONE have worked for them. As a seasoned professional, I must warn other administrative assistants. It is internally known that the group has issues that extend beyond the professional/business setting. Yet, the company continues to onboard professional admins only to have them fired like the ones before - Don't waste time on this one - unless you are willing to deal with the emotional and psychological issues of the group; then be fired after a few months."
good,"Management was not flexible with workers who had school aged children. There was no flex schedule or remote work option for employees.  Salary was low for an experienced persons.  Team environment was composed of cliques, therefore there was low team moral.  There were bonus incentives.  Company is a Fortune 500 company and seem to be growing."
good,"Unorganized, did not follow any discernible mission or vision. Good benefits but zero work/life balance. Flexible hours and remote work made it worth it for around 1 year but that was it."
good,Some departments don’t have formal training and most times it feels like it’s not what you know it’s who you know which is crazy but I just come in do my job and go home
good,"No leadership, management does not know how to manage employees. Good work life Balance. I was a contract and I cannot tell about the compensation or benefits."
good,"The training and communication was lacking to say the least. I believe it would have been a good company to work for, but some of us got short changed, unfortunately."
good,For the most part its a pretty relaxed environment. There are a few vocal racist women there. Upper management is very rude will send out rude discouraging emails to staff members. Supervisor has little to no knowledge of daily staff assignment therefore unable to assist when there is a problem. Work processes are outdated. work is being audited but only the auditors have the up to date work processes therefore anything that workers do will be wrong because we have no knowledge of doing it the correct way. heavily micromanaged with breaks and lunches being scheduled. management will even go as far as checking your badge time in and out on doors to see if your coming back on time. upper management wants no talking on the floor even if you are getting help. basically anything you do here will be wrong in someone's eyes. we all do the same work but get paid totally different amounts ranging from $16-$21 an hour.no work life balance
good,This company shows favoritism to the gossip group (male or female). I witnessed misogynistic behavior from a choice few in higher management. I noticed there were never more than two minority men in the department and management typically goes to shady police officers looking for corporate desk jobs. Too much office gossip and many lies from management. I wouldn't recommend anyone working for Centene in the St. Louis region.
good,Management was not good at all. Overtime was constant and never ending. I spent 14 years there and I did learn a lot and was able to advance within the company.
good,"With the worst managers, everyone was like on edge all the time. had to put up with favoritism, come in each day hating to be in thier presence"
good,"Different departments at Centene of Baton Rouge have entirely different cultures. I was, unfortunately, stuck in one with a very oppressive culture and terribly insecure, micromanaging supervisors."
good,Centene is very divided.  The different departments do not work together as a team.  Excellent employees are bullied and purposely overlooked.  Management will make decisions based on personalities instead of employees performance.
good,"Centene is a growing company in a competitive health care insurance industry. Their compensation and benefits are fair and competitive. It is a great place to get a start in the IT industry, primarily because of their compensation package and exposure to multiple technologies. "
good,"My typical day was going in, reviewing the nightly processing to make sure all jobs had completed successfully, and starting the daily processing and tasks. I supported a team of 40, and enjoyed helping and training others."
good,"Cool company and the good that they copany provide. the company works on a senority typr of vibe. If you been there longer you'll get more benefitsand leaway. Comfortable as in no one is over your shoulder but somethimes they should be. The training is very weak and every week new information is presented by telling you, you did this wrong do it like this now. Overall cool place to work but not ideal for me"
good,The culture is terrible. The focus is on the bottom line without regard to the customers we say we want to serve or the employees they expect to handle day to day tasks. Very hostile working environments and mostly poor management.
good,"wonderful place  to work except for management. Managers over networking and contracting are snakes to say the least."
good,"50k+employees nobody knows what's going on.    No communication and very unorganized.  Never proactive always reactive. Training, none. Difficult to change positions."
good,"With not to many positives I would much rather leave this section blank in details. Although the people are wonderful to work with, opportunity is not something you will get with them."
good,"The manager has direct favoritism and if you complain management will just state its unseen, even though just about all except the favorites say it. She is rude and speaks down to you and nothing is done. Her favorites get the best raises and promotions . If you try to go into another department, it will not happen. They say they hire from within but you have to have a supportive manager or your screwed for managers stick together regardless of their department. Prior authorization department is a revolving door, so many have just left one day without notice. I’m truly happy I’m finally getting out, I feel delivered. It was such a horrible experience to go to work and be totally drained knowing what was coming. Change is constant but not clearly stated and your held accountable regardless. Be careful coming into this department. They expect you to spend your whole life here trying to get faxes out. They say your a team but management encourages backstabbing and gossip. They talk personally about some employees. I have never seen such high school behavior by grown women. Even supervisor don’t stay."
good,"Excellent commitment to underserved population; however, rampant progression only for those without necessary skills in area to which accountability has been given."
good,"Very little consistency, constantly hourly changes. Unable to resolve majority of issues without supervisor assistance.  Incredible frustration at not being able to assist customer in reasonable time frame. Micromanagement."
good,This employer made it easy to maintain a team atmosphere with fellow coworkers working on the common goal of productivity.  The management couldn't manage the teams very efficiently due to the quick growth and need for constant on the job training.
good,"Very horrible management, all three of the leads left supervisor quit same day after 8 years with company she stated to me she couldn't take management anymore. Micro management runs rapid and again only numbers matter. I do understand that because they want to keep the VA contracts though."
good,I really do not wish to review this company as a whole. But it used to be the place to work. Many people were basically begging to gain employment here.
good,"Centene is a company that has experienced exponential growth, but the infrastructure (IT, culture, workflows) has not kept up with that growth. I would normally say that there is one culture within a company, but due to Centene's expedited growth, the culture that's defined by Sr. Leadership has varied from one dept to another. You never know what learning style, work style, freedom, or coercive action you are going to get. Balancing work and life has become a challenge like never before. I hope that it gets better soon!"
good,"Top-heavy with management. Centene  promotes and hires Managers & Directors who are good at doing the day-to-day job but terrible at people management. Most people leave because of poor management who take credit for others work, don’t show appreciation or give recognition, micromanage, and are unable to trust their employees (control freaks)."
good,"Centene is a strong performing company.  The company is continuing to grow in the Medicaid, Medicare and ACA arena and is consistently looking for new growth opportunities."
good,Unorganized. Under trained. Constantly changing. Customer service representative are graded unfairly. Too much work expected for the pay given. Hard to get to bond with co-workers bcuz they won't allow you any breathing room.
good,Somewhat stressful not a lot of training. Management was not very professional.Favoritism in the workplace.Unprofessional co workers.Some coworkers were super rude didnt want to help.
good,Not much room for advancement especially for individuals with advanced degrees. Employee are required to work long hours and some Saturdays and inaddition a few holidays.
good,"Once they merged in the Tempe Az area they didn’t have there act together "
good,"Change is the name of the game here some good some bad.  With large mergers, there is a lack of job security. Each department has a different way of running things."
good,"Isolation, insufficient training, management that is too overworked to provide sufficient guidance and feedback. It's all ascribed to ""transition"" since acquisition by Centene, but it doesn't seem to be a good example of change management."
good,"There are two cultures now at Centene, the business side, which operates under integrity and high profitability with a great CEO and the IT side, which has become, since the Healthnet merger, a bad place to be with a very bad CIO.  They are attempting to move the IT side overnight into a ""Google"" like environment, but are ignoring the lack of infrastructure in place to accomplish it, so the failures fall on the developers."
good,is a good company to work but you cant move up is not what you do is who you know unless you are close with directors they wont let you move up the benefit are good and the pay but you will be miserable
good,Unrealistic about the changing workplace. They refuse to let employees work from home when it is much more feasible. They have no clue what today's workers are looking for.
good,"prior management, structure was different. regarding the teams, there is room for improvement but the culture is pliable and educating for life changing skills."
good,"Centene is a company that offers great benefits, however, the management will work you all type of hours. You will find yourself working even on weekends just to catch up or stay ahead. The management will frown on you working outside of business hours however they will do nothing about balancing the work load they gave to you knowing that you are already overwhelmed."
good,Great company not a lot of gowing potential in Tucson. Compensation is good compared to other call centers. Sick time rolls over but vacation does not. Ample amount of PTO is given 5.54 hour bi weekly.
good,Has a Very strong gossip culture. If the wrong people don't like you they will attempt to get you fired. There is no opportunity for advancement. they will often fire management then hire from outside to fill new management positions.
good,"Company can be good for others who are willing to accept the salary. Conditions have improved, some are able to take their vacation now. Company is managed by new people now. Company has improved"
good,"Very Stressful, need more Diversity, better Management. Better processes. need training for new hire staff. Open Door Policy. need to hire adequate staff for several departments"
good,"nice place to work as long as you do not try to promote.  Great company for the most part.      "
good,A lot of growth in risk adjustment though headcount has not matched the workload added to the team.  Benefits are decent though very corporate in many aspects.
good,Very stressful. Unrealistic expectations. No room to move in Eligibility LTC Department Poor Management. Too much Drama for a small department. Not worth the salary if treated poorly.
good,Business analyst position is rough in the beginning. There is no training. You learn as you go. People around you are busy on their own projects and most of the time don't have time to help you thoroughly understand something. Being a BA with Clayton is different than being a BA with one of the health plans. G&A position in Clayton in very thorough great management who is knowledgable. This is not the case with a health plan. Management outside of corporate with the health plans is very inconsistent. They are not knowledgable. They are not willing to listen to employees who have ideas and suggestions to make the job run smoother. They do not understand NCQA guidelines. They do not care about personal life or emergencies.
good,This company has some great intentions but is too focused on metrics and not focused enough on patient needs and nursing support.  Productivity is the only marker that is valued.
good,"Typical days include looking at the clock at 3:00 p.m. and realizing you haven't stopped working since you walked in the door. This is an extremely diverse company, but it's clear who is protected and who is not. I have over twenty years experience in expense reporting, but a boss that has never done an expense report in her life.  I book travel for multitudes of people, however she is unable to understand how to plan travel properly.  My work is used to assist others in being promoted, receiving bonuses, and being recognized.  The company offers free educational benefits for your position or one you would like to try, however many supervisors refuse to approve based on losing a staff member to a better position.  This company will hire from within, but that sometimes comes based on who you are ""closest"" with rather than your experience or desire to move ahead. I haven't been an ""administrative assistant"" since I was very young - it is demeaning to be one at this company. I have actually been told, ""remember where you are on the totem pole"".  After working over twenty years managing different offices, this was my last straw. The company itself is a good company, but the administrative assistant issues are known throughout the company between the admins and there really isn't anything that can be done outside of seeking a new position. You will never get bored as work is being stretched 4-5 jobs to one person.  The CEO is amazing, most senior executive are outstanding and some are kind.  The company however, cannot relate to folks that are living paycheck to paycheck and it makes"
good,Company has recently acquired Health Net in CA and many changes are taking place with several needs to improve processes.  Different management cultures are being worked through with several positions being eliminated or moved.
good,"•Document all correspondence with members and providers in Customer Service Management application "
good,"Benefits are good, but the insist on an average 55 claims a day. While completely doable, they only audit 10 claims a month, with is less then 1% of the work done in a month. All pay increases, bonuses, and advancement is based on these 10 claims, and all 10 must be right every month."
good,"Plenty of work, not enough training, their was alot of changes with an hour or two training and  they expected the same processing goals. They also never had an accurate numbers due to something always being down, people were constantly being let go without a one on one meeting to correct any error or more training. Business  needs is what they would announce in meeting leaving everyone feeling it could be them next when told we are doing good."
good,"Great Pay initially but does not balance with hours worked, must always be available even during vacation.  Vacation does not roll over and can not take vacation time due to work load.  Overworked management, No Ownership or Accountability to Senior Leaders, Senior management pass the incomplete work load on others without ensuring accurate."
good,"Company is in constant growth.  Great place to work if you like a fast paced environment.  Work/life balance isn't always respected, but many opportunities for advancement exist."
good,Company has good benefits. Management needs bigimproving but job is laid back and not hard to do. Hardest part of the job is dealing with lack of help
good,"health net is becoming Centene. they are a large company in st louis.  be prepared for corporate culture. it is like working for any large company, impersonal and run by a rigid set of rules."
good,"I do not have anything negative or positive to say at this moment in regards to Centene. One thing they did make it fun at times,with slot of different activities."
good,"The communication in the work place is very poor. Instead of addressing the issues, upper management patronizes employees with an attitude of just deal with it."
good,"My manager could not decide between micromanaging and having a laisez-affair approach.  Would call me after sending a email as if they didn't even trust you sending an email, not exactly a way to management employees.  If you hire someone just trust that they will do their job and don't hover over them."
good,I almost wish I never landed this job except meeting my good friend there. That is the only thing I got from working there that was good. Leadership did everything to mess up the job in order to serve their own selfish purposes. My manager was fired and the supervisor never advanced.
good,"New Director- personable, knowledgeable.  She  clearly communicates more with and favors the new manager that she brought in."
good,The job can be stressful due to the industry but there a little options for stress relief. The pay is lower than other industry leaders. The opportunities for advancement are there but take a year to be able to apply for regardless of performance and attendance.
good,There is no real job security. One day they tell you that you are a great asset but the next you are told your last day is in a month. Everything is numbers not people or how well you are working. I used to enjoy my job then I started to hate it. I even considered switching careers because I was so devastated in how bad I thought of health care. We all thought it was not going to be so bad even when we saw the RUN comments.
good,"Centene overall is a great company to work for, but the subsidiary Envolve People Care that is terrible to work for. I would not advise anyone to take the role as a Care Support Coordinator management isn't all that great the hours are awful 11:30a-8p.m."
good,"Fidelis care recently bought out by Centene, this is your typical medical insurance call center. You sit at your desk, 2 monitors, and take calls all day long. Constant system issues which cause mishaps in their insurance and members constantly being contacted without a break. It seems purposely done so people keep calling. Then as a representative you’re on the front line so you take all the BS while you can barely get help, and management, as well as other departments are nasty to you when you ask questions. They think they can treat you how they want. You have a 20 minute break 30 unpaid lunch. ANYTIME you’re away from your desk there needs to be a reason why! If you have to use the bathroom you have to use your own break time. If you are in the bathroom for 2:54 you need to subtract that time from your 20 minute break so you don’t go over and get an occurrence. You have no arrival grace period and no extra time outside lunch and break. If you go over that time by a second you get an occurrence which leads to being written up and fired. Horribly micro-managed you’re striped of adulthood and treated like a child.  There’s no trust. But there normally is always another position open in a different department however you can only transfer after a year. You’re forced to work 1 Saturday every month and there has been mandatory overtime however, you only get 37.50 hours so you don’t get paid overtime until you hit 40"
good,"Centene is a growing company with lots of room for improvement. The claims analysts in Ferguson, MO are not paid as much as the claims analysts in other parts of the country."
good,Great to be able to work at home with a great schedule.  Multiple positions for all nurses.  Working Telehealth is very rewarding and you are able to help a diverse population.
good,It was a good job with great benefits but I grew bored.  I needed more challenge in my life and did not enjoy working solely over the phone.  Otherwise it was a good place.
good,There is no work life balance. Training is limited. There is no clear communication between departments on levels. An annual survey is perform with outcome communicated to employees with limited action taken to correct areas with a low score.
good,"About 50% percent of the management is rude and half the time the managers themselves did not know the work processes.  the SCs had to constantly refer to emails and sometimes had to remind manager about the emails with the work process to correct them. You won't advance unless you know someone, they micromanage you constantly and since you work online you can't even get up or away from work area  without them calling your cellphone to find out why you are away from the computer. if equipment is lost or needs replacement you can be sure that you will be waiting for weeks for replacement. The pay and benefits are great, but my biggest mistake was transferring departments where I ended with some of the worst managers.  There's a lot of gossiping and animosity between employees, and a lot of what I saw was with between team leads and some mangers."
good,I liked the people I worked with not so much the actual job. We had some special project which took us off of the phones that I enjoyed. We had slow days and busy days so sometimes the day would go by slow and some days fast.
good,A lot of opportunity for advancement within the company.  Management is a problem overall.  The company is very large and growing so rapidly it is difficult to keep up with communication within departments between upper management and staff
good,"My hiring manager was amazing and give him 5 stars, but shortly after being hired, the split the team  into design and operations and adopted an Agile methodology.  Past experience has proven that Agile is not a good fit for operational roles.  The environment doubled in size in less than a year without additional personnel.  The new delivery manager wanted to bring his own people in, so it was only a matter of time before the veterans were being let go.  The on call rotation was nightmare.  You basically on house arrest for 7 days, when not in the office.  Working 60 plus hours a week was the norm.  The compensation was good, but the culture was stressed and volatile.  Perception was reality, so they were more focused on numbers and statistics rather than people."
good,"Completion of several, multiple spreadsheets and make multiple phone calls per day. Requires  a lot of sitting and being able to multitask. Get a lot of paid time off, but doesn't want you to take time off. Several emails per day."
good,Worse training EVER!!!!! If you ask management a question they always say that they don't KNOW!. If you ask a trainer a question you get a different answer every time or they direct you to someone else. Then they expect you to be productive!
good,"Because of the poor management, communication was very ineffective. My department never had to work overtime and staying late was discouraged. I had the pleasure of working with some very knowledgeable co-workers."
good,"Before you reach for sky, one would need enough staff to go along, to achieve that goal, the only people that will suffer, is the member you service. If everyone cared about the member enrolled in the insurance plan, for tip top to the very bottom. Member would not call 5-6 times in one day with the same question."
good,"Centene is a great company to work for. They have many job opportunities  always available. A typical day at work is speaking with numerous members, informing them of the offerings that their health plan has available to them. Many health risk assessments were performed and always verifying that information in system was correct. Welcoming new members to health plan and updating information with current members. My co-workers are very good people, the environment is basically self work environment, positive, and hardworking. The hardest part of the job is the long 10hr shift, the most enjoyable part is knowing that you assisted the member and answered all questions to best of ability."
good,"I usually arrive at work around 8:00 am until 5:00 pm. I then began my work as an auditor under Provider Operations Department in which I audit several different areas within the department: Claims Liaisons projects, Configuration, Provider Data, Credentialing, Contracting and Provider Relations. I work with an okay management team. The hardest part of the job is auditing co-workers that I consider friends. The most enjoyable part is coming to work every day to see my co-workers. It is very hard to get promoted or get another job within the company without knowing somebody."
good,It depends on the department how good your experience is. Benefits are good but expensive.  Make sure to haggle on salary when getting hired. Raises aren't that good.
good,"Remote positions are not available, however the company mandates that employees work from home when it suits their needs; fulfilling contractual requirements.    Additionally, employees are expected to use personal equipment when working remotely and are not reimbursed.  "
good,"I think Centene is an overall good company, but for the right person, and I was not in the long run. "
good,I currently work here and the company tries to encourage us but the management is why people leave. This is a great company to work for but management is back stabbing and underhanded. My Director started harrassing me when I unfriended her from Facebook! I don't feel appreciated and I came here with a bubbly peronality and now I feel like my soul has been sucked from me.
good,"Daily high stress and not much backing from management. My position was handled by three people including myself, when the other two people left no replacements were hired"
good,Supportive management was good.  Interactions between central/shared services and local plans was dysfunctional at times.  High growth was great for fostering new ideas.
good,"Very fast paced environment. Things are always changing, you must adapt quickly. Quality is always changing and never seem to be in unison with their grading. Rebuttals are usually backed up."
good,"A bit unorganized, and a lot of favoritism , if you are not on the good list, you will be bypassed for promotions, no matter how good you are at your job"
good,The workload is extremely heavy and you must work overtime to keep up with the workload.  But I've had a positive work relationship with the managers.
good,"work/life balance is very bad.  They expect you to work 24 hours a day, they operate on a ""come to work with no expectation of going home at your scheduled time'  Poor managment; could be more successful, but too worried about the ""quantity"" instead of the ""quality"" of work being put out.  Very stressful environment."
good,"This job is  very unorganized. Very stressful, micromanaged. They want to control you tell you was important or not. The coworker are cool but the manager and supervisor need to work on there attitude.  Overall the job pays good wages and the benefits are good also."
good,Integration of corporate acquisitions were poorly managed. Centene had minimal experience in the capitated payment model. Their operational systems and corporate data warehouse required significant modifications. The assessments and implementation time lines were constantly in flux.
good,"A typical day at work was a routine of logging into your computer, helping reps with any questions, taking escalated calls, reviewing daily numbers and company goals. I learned a lot about the medical field, how to coach & manage large teams, delegate tasks & be a better leader. I feel that management could have been better at promoting, based on skill levels not friendships. Also treating employees like human beings instead of cattle. Workplace culture was fun amongst staff, but was also micro managed by upper management which sometimes made uncomfortable situations occur. The hardest part of the job was how upper management treated the rest of the employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help customers resolve their concerns, watch rep's grow & move on to new endeavors within the company and the friendship's & bonds that were made with in the company over years."
good,I  had a stressful experience here. Would not recommend them as an employer. It took them a month and a half to verify several of our back round checks  just to let us go in the end for silly reasons
good,"Working through the request to complete them"
good,"Should not have hired local management until corporate had the place in order."
good,Good company but  some of management challenges its ability to be great. During the hiring process they push how they prefer to promote from inside but that hasn't proven to be true.
good,Centene is great at winning new government but very poor at operationalizing new markets.  The Management Team is always in flux with no stability. The culture is not collaborative across the departments.  The hardest part of the job is lack of effective direction from C Suite Leadership. The most enjoyable part of the job is wome of the awesome people that I worked with at Centene.
good,"The new vp took over and changed the culture where everyday is a fire drill.  It now has that mega corporation feel, where day to day, you as an individual are no longer important and you are just waiting for the ax to drop."
good,"A typical day is responding to requests and emergencies."
good,"Really fast paced and stressful. Mind numbing and monotonous. If you like doing the same thing every single day with little to no training as to what you should know, then this is for you."
good,"Loved working remotely, loved working with my co-workers and clients.  Worked as a temp employee for 2 years before the ability to work full time.  This was a contract position, contract was extended but with a smaller staff need, my position was eliminated.  Company provided counseling, HR/Marketing assistance for finding a new position which was very nice."
good,The team I work on is severely understaffed.  Putting out daily fires prevents us from keeping up with requests.  In 5 years no one on this team has been promoted.
good,All jobs depend on what you are looking and where you are in your career. Centene is a fast-paced company that want someone to come in with knowledge of insurance claims and coding.
good,"They are very unorganized and not on the same book. Pay should be more, they are constantly changing things making it difficult to make bonus and if you are not liked by management, your time here will be depressing!"
good,"Growing company with many opportunities for growth. Management at times seems more like high school than a professional environment. Should focus more on making sure line staff are trained accordingly and less on "" meetings""."
good,"Tremendous opportunity to meet new people and service the network providers in claims corrections, training, policy interpretation, questions regarding coverage.  Traveled extensively throughout a 17 county area."
good,It was an alright place to work.  I learned quite a bit about how medicaid works.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping those who needed it.
good,A typical work environment. Great benefits and wonderful personnel. A great deal of change is happening with mergers.
good,"The only call center that had a call script that was longer than the actual call you took. They term squeezing blood from a stone is an understatment here. Management would push many projects on you, and give no recognition for your hard work. They did eat a lot. Most coworkers were supportive and friendly. Hardest part of job was the changing shifts. Company has a very high turn over. Not much opportunity for advancement from call center."
good,"They have good pay, you get to meet good people.  They have good benefits. co-worker are the best support of all."
good,"Centene has grown exponentially over the past 5 years, and unfortunately the infrastructure is not in place to support that growth. System challenges are a major headache on a daily basis. Also, it's very much about who you know here; it's a very political culture. There are a lot of people who have been promoted simply because of who they know, not what they know, and there have been some poor leadership decisions made because of it."
good,"Although I was terminated shortly following the passing of my mother, Centene was a great place to work. I would love to return to the company. It was a great company as a whole."
good,Take heed. Do not work here. Very unorganized (pulling half your agents and supervisors off the phone during open enrollment is dumb) supervisors and team leads don’t really care about you (then again how could they when they’re off the floor doing meetings and such all day) and don’t get me started on the metrics. You HAVE to meet them all..it’s all or nothing. They will fire you for not passing! If you decide to work here BE CAREFUL AND GOOD LUCK!
good,Centene is a good place for work/life balance depending on your department. Fast moving environment which can be good because you have an opportunity to learn something new. However it can be bad when they make too many organizational changes that you fall between the cracks. Beware of nepotism. Hard to advance unless you go to happy hours with the bosses.
good,"I worked in the prior authorization department. There is a ridiculous amount of oversight, auditing and on-going training. A lot of activities for employee involvement and inclusivity. Overall, a good company if you don't mind working in a highly stressful call center environment."
good,"Overall, the highlights are salary, benefits and peers and coworkers.  The negative aspects are job culture and a feeling of job insecurity and organizational instability."
good,It's a start to the career  you want as long as you come to work and do your job you will succeed at all things within the company. Attendance and numbers are important
good,They focus on employee health and offer free flu shots and gym in the main building . They also have holiday party and costume dress up.  They also reward you with perfect attendance.
good,Little opportunity for career advancement and growth. They have many talented employees that go unnoticed due to favoritism and nepotism. Upper management can be clueless and promote who they like. The company is under new leadership and going through a time of transition that will hopefully change the way they operate.
good,Its is a different company to work for. I work on the federal side you do have to pass an extensive background check through the DOJ.  They have several shifts ranging from 5am to 12pm
good,"High stress and fast paced, high turnover rate for  management , good community involvement influenced by corporate.  Processing medical claims for medicaide and medicare"
good,"okay place to work, okay pay, management needs work, stressful environment, face paced. okay benefits, paid time off, sick pay, very thorough background check"
good,"A new employee may find it very hard to acquire the skills needed when starting out in the  new position. Work is very fast paced or very slow paced depending on flow. Training consists of mainly high stress on the job duties as training is insufficient when the manager has to train a new team member as well as fulfill his duties first. Senior management seems to change often with constant changes in procedures."
good,"Pros:"
good,Overall a good place. Growth rate keeps departments in a reactive state. Needs more enterprise planning to avoid burn out. Work life balance can be a struggle.
good,"Centene is built on the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing. The communication is awful. "
good,"I really don't have much to say about the company, it was a good place to work at, the people was very nice and you had a chance to grow at the company"
good,I was responsible for Facilities management.   I did real estate searches and  negotiated and  constructed 70 small to large  offices in 11 states over the 10 plus years I was employed.
good,"Contract position, fast pace, inconsistent QA reviews conducted by various QA analyst. Almost  impossible to pass metrics due to the inconsistencies of different QA scorings. Lack of communications. Low salary and no pay increases. Time off is without pay."
good,"It's a booming company with a very bright future.  There are a multitude of positions and the benefits are pretty incredible. Great insurance, employee stock purchase program, $10k/year in grad school tuition."
good,Growth Company - constantly changing - great learning experience - statutory accounting principles - GAAP - fast paced - lots of variety in products and accounting scenarios
good,"Medicare call center inbound and outbound call center where helping, empathy, and conceiger service is a must. Helping with claims, pre auth, dental vision provider"
good,"I applied for different positions at Centene over 8 times before I was interviewed."
good,"My time at Centene was both enjoyable and fraught with dismay.  My first year was great; loved the management team I was under, and the work I was doing.  I really felt like my voice was heard and my contributions mattered to the team and company.  Starting pay was competitive, and decent for the cost-of-living in my area. "
good,"I do not wish to talk ill about them, I just wish they would focus on quality over quantity and truly put patients first. The mission statement is ""changing healthcare one member at a time.""But it does not cross over to the authorizations dept. Leaving the member half-served."
good,"Favoritism is very bad in the sunshine plan. You can be a very hard working person, but management will not help your advancement if you are not either white or Spanish."
good,I was able to adjust to the very fast pace of work and changes. Some managers are very bad micromanagers. But - hang on - you might get a new manager very soon!
good,The people with in the teams are good workers. Communications in other departments is limited and none helpful. POSITION is like a punching bag for all other departments. There is no accountability for other departments to complete their cases or projects.
good,"It is very  disorganized. There is rampant favoritism and the answer for every management decision is to blame the workers while al they do is have meeting after meeting eating cater food and making jokes."
good,"Asked to process claims without proper training.  Very little feedback regarding quality of work.  Poor oversight, lacking supervision, direction culminating in a stressful, unsettling, work environment."
good,Centene gives you an amazing opportunity to grow and allows you to still have the home life needed. I have worked other places that do not have that same approach.
good,"Tenant Appreciation Day"
good,"Love the job and the company, but the compensation is not equitable across the company nor does it compare favorably to similar positions iin the market."
good,"Management top heavy. Fast corporate growth without good planning, with negative effects on staff. Management is a club. Limited advancement in my area."
good,The manager of my department is new and makes a lot of mistakes. I'm not hopeful that this division of Centene will last for long. Im planning on transfering out as soon as possible
good,"The case load is ridiculous and there's not enough case managers or program specialist to staff with case load. Lack of support from management."
good,"I had a family and would get written up if i called in due ti a sick child. At one point of time, i was involved in a vehicular accident and even though i was told by EMS to go to the hospital to get checked out, i knew if i did i'd lose my job. My family is my priority however Centene would rather their employees choose their jobs over their family."
good,Stressful environment with resentment towards contractors.  Their trouble / help ticket process was unwieldy and difficult to use and permanent staff was reluctant to help.
good,"Was very satisfied and happy in my role until Oct. 2016, then everything changed for the worse. New leadership at AcariaHealth took over with a very cut-throat attitude. They managed by creating fear in everyone. This started the biggest turn-over I had ever seen anywhere. The morale of every department was very low, but this was acceptable so zero would be done to correct it-and still hasn’t."
good,A mediocre place to work. Outdated technology and upper management more focused on their own advancement than leading their teams. Better than average opportunity for growth.
good,"The culture at Centene is very reactive. Management utilizes their power to levy projects, direct reports and ad hoc request to the top 20% of performers at their leisure. The culture has become one to burn out employees and replace them with external candidates to continue business operations at lower levels of efficiency."
good,"This has been a very fast growing company with many changes.  Training is poor, unorganized, support services are not adequate for success.  Company does have good intention"
good,CEO has a good attitude regarding the treatment of employees. Some Federal Services Division Execs have the same attitude; but it stops there. Mist local management forgot where they started. The site manager has zero respect for a majority of the staff. He hates the town and most of the people working here.
good,"Culture is pro-employee, very secure both career & facility-wise, fast-paced, compliant with state and federal guidelines/expectations, opportunities for advancement unlimited if willing to travel/relocate."
good,Work load is structured and manageable. Some managers would be great to work for but others can make the job very stressful. The training was not really sufficient for the work required and found that I needed to get training from others on the team rather than a structured training course. Computer issues were too frequent with not enough bandwith to cover the number of people using the system. Slow system with it taking almost a minute for a page to load at times.
good,The environment is fun. There just isn't any calls to be taken so it gets boring. Their system changes every week. They need to stick with something and stay with it.
good,It is a good place to work if you enjoy fast-paced environments which require a lot of flexibilty and adaptibilty. The vacation/sick leave benefits are not as competetive as companies similar to Centene.
good,Great place to work if you want good experience. Not much training so be prepared to learn on your own. Great opportunities in Centene if you're willing to relocate.
good,The job itself pays very well but the management is less than helpful when having to take escalated calls I understand that as an employee you must do your very best to assist the caller and prevent the call from being escalated  but sometimes the provider would just rather speak to a supervisor and when that happened my sup would either refuse or do everything in his power not to take a sup call if he could so my experience there was not the best
good,"Stressful place to work, Needs more employees to help with the massive overload of calls. More training needs to be in place on a quarterly bases. More supervision is needed to handle the calls that are received."
good,"Unable to plan anything. There is constant talk of moving my department, but date keeps getting pushed back."
good,Centene was a good company that allowed me to learn and grow within for approximately 7 years. The culture is vast and leadership in different areas is better than others.
good,"new comapnay to atlanta in the growing process, the copmapnay has been open a little over a year & we provide services to medcaid members"
good,At this job no one is on the same page. We need stability. There isn’t enough training to do the job effectively. There is also a sense of favoritism within management.
good,They take your productivity very seriously. This company wants to see you excel and are very open to feedback. The also acknowledge your hard work and show employee appreciation.
good,The job is not very structured but compensation is very well compared to jobs that are similar in duties. Work atmosphere is somewhat welcoming but could be better.
good,"offers nice amenities. Nice culture. average work life balance. I would recommend this company, just not the position currently in as company is unable to keep department fully staffed"
good,"Centene at its best is a great company overall and has multiple state plans across the US.  However, I’m employed by the Mississippi Plan of which I’m certainly grateful for the flexibility and the great benefits.  However, I’m ready for new growth opportunities."
good,New management. Some individuals were rude and did not know how to treat interns properly or assist them when needed. Would have liked if someone showed me to do tasks instead of not show me some ropes.
good,"I really have noo comment at this time except to say when I started, so did everyone else. We all had to learn our jobs together so at that time it was chaos and a lot of it and training wasn't that easy to get. Hopefully no they have it all under control and everyone knows there roll."
good,This was a friendly place to work and the people at the organizations are passionate about their role. It was a laid back atmosphere and everyone did their job.
good,I was reprimanded for closing too many cases successfully with no callbacks from users. I don't understand a help desk that criticizes someone for success. Also there was no way to just turn and ask a technician for some assistance on an issue. all the tier 2 techs would tell you is look at the database. Not everyone learns that way.
good,"Centene is a excellent place to work, excellent grade company but the job sometime can be very stress, they provided excellent benefit packets, give you time sick"
good,Good company to gain new skills and move up as company is growing and getting larger. Centene has good tuition reimbursement as well as long as training modules.
good,"Supervisors are micro managers. If they don’t like you-they will find a reason to let you go whether it takes 3 months or 3 years. 1st job I’ve ever worked where prejudice was evident. Very stressful, duplication of work given every day by different levels of management. Coworkers were fine."
good,The only thing i will mention is going through an agency with Centene. Centene doesn't have correct info when hiring you through a temp agency and like to prolong you Only default of this company.
good,"Hectic environment.  Load of growth, but company needs to slow down to work on process, people and stability of  systems.  Stressful.  Good company with much opportunity."
good,"Centene offers a competitive salary in Little Rock Arkansas. Job Culture is changing monthly, not sure if this is a good thing or bad thing. I’m optimistic about my future with this company"
good,"Big growing company. The culture sucks. Territorial. Silos. In-fighting. The corporate culture is old-fashioned. They claim to be progressive but the culture is stodgy and outdated. Programs and services are legit, but the culture runs the day at Centene. And that culture sucks."
good,Not really much to tell. Their helpdesk postion wasnt for me. they thought I was too experienced. They wanted me to reapply for NOC when they had positions available
good,Centene needs management to work harder on creating and work enviroment where everyone is on the same page.The training is all over the place and everyone tells you something different when you ask questions.
good,Developed great leadership skills. Great company. Great mission statement. High volume of work. Never a boring day. Work life balance needs improvement.
good,Centene provided a great environment for learning new and advanced technologies in healthcare. Unfortunately the leadership was rigid and advancement slow or nonexistent.
good,Pretty stressful but has good benefits.  Lots of gossip goes on.  I liked my team though and my manager was very fair.  I liked learning and the training was good.  The hardest part was the stress of claims per hour and meeting the goals.
good,"Centene may be a good place to work if you are in the corporate office in Missouri. Definitely more opportunity to move around or get promoted. If you are in a remote office, Arizona, Florida or Texas, it is harder to get noticed. Company was going through many changes when I left a few years ago. It was very disorganized and processes were unclear.  There were a few issues with inexperienced management and a lot of them got let go. Things may have gotten better since I left."
good,"As a CPhT in the prior authorization department the job was kind of boring, same routine everyday. Manager wont bother at all, supervisor are pretty chill and you are good as long as you meet your numbers. Now they put A LOT of pressure for you to meet them every single day, pushing people to cheat and brush off for others to solve the problem. Work environment is very pleasant and flexible its just boring after a while, you could be there doing the same tasks for years without learning new skills or moving up."
good,Have nothing really to say. The department I worked in had a really good trainer who was really helpful. My manager/supervisor was always available when ever I need to talk or need something to be done.
good,I really enjoy the departments and people I work with. There is opportunity to grow and great mentoring. Onsite daycare is great for parents and cafe on site is helpful.
good,"As one of the smallest Centene Corp locations, we are located in Ferguson, MO. There is no structure within the location. Things change daily. There is never a consistent answer between upper management when asked a question. The workload is beyond the amount of analyst we have at the site. The workload constantly grows with no compensation. There is constantly mandatory overtime and no room to juggle life outside of work."
good,I found it boring and monotonous when calling members and receiving no answer.  It wasn't a job where I felt I was making a difference in many aspects. Because it was based on productivity and a point system I found that to be negative and a non motivation factor for job satisfaction.
good,Good place to work. not sure about other details as the job was that of a consultant. brief involvement with other departments. work atmosphere was good.
good,"It was just not the right fit for me for the time being. I needed more flexibility at the current time but overall, it was a great company to work for."
good,"good people, opportunity with the company, there was nursewise that i worked for and started as a data entry clerk which was really awesome and also had the option to be on the phones as well"
good,Job okay. Management fair-poor. Had a manageable caseload of clients. The best part of my job was interacting with my clients. The hardest part was getting notes in on time.
good,Has the potential to be a great company there are a few areas for opportunity. If those areas are addressed it would be able to live up to the potential that is there.
good,"This company was just going live/starting out and I feel the training processes was quite inadequate for some. I believe they should have started the procedures and training long before they did. And, many of the team (which I knew from Family Health Network agreed) just felt like they were out in the cold with no support. Also, my commute was over 3 1/2 hours a day, which was quite grueling when you have a family to care for."
good,"I served as an Interim Claims Director under a contract and as part of my job I recognized there were some areas where the chain of command was a little fuzzy.  Compliance is a major concern of mine.  I voiced that concern and then suddenly let go.  Contract ended abruptly."
good,"I enjoyed working at Centene.  The work was challenging and fun.  "
good,Great place to work for if your are looking. Great benefits ability to advance within company . Typical work day would include reaching out to providers in regard to services requested.
good,Everything is perfect except for the management that was supervising me. They need more professional capable supervisors. Other than that the job is great.
good,It's OK but balance of family and work is difficult. Much time spent working through lunches and evenings. Travel more than expected. Seems to be too busy to take vacation time.
good,It's a cool start up job. They should keep their employees in the loop about employment status also keep up with points system when it comes discplinary status
good,I was recently hired in Janaury and 3 months into the postion was told that our contract would end. no information has been given as to what will happen to us or what we should do next.
good,I appreciated this opportunity because it helped broaden my education scale and taught me new things in the healthcare business. I also learned about Medicare and the advantages of having it later in life and being able to apply the knowledge to my own life
good,"This job can be very demanding at times and it has constant change. The best part is, you are able to make a difference in the lives of the members you serve. Management style is different from person to person so what works for one does not work for the other. You drive a lot and put a lot of mileage on your car. You do receive reimbursement but you have to subtract mileage from your start. Some days its not even worth submitting. the hardest part about the job is dealing with entitled members or caretakers...but again you have those members that make you stick around a little while longer."
good,"This is a good company to work for to gain experience, however the room for advancement is limited in my area. The job is easy, but is sometimes made very complex by the lack of leadership and communication."
good,"Healthnet has a typical call center atmosphere. There are probably 150 csr's, 15 leads, and 15 managers. We work monday through saturday from 8 am to 7 pm."
good,its like any other call center dealing with health insurance. They have a wonderful staff that are very helpful. The work is repetitive but easy to get hang of
good,Centene is a great company.  I will recommend this company to anyone who ask. I never had a issue with my manager she was awesome. The benefits are good.
good,Work/Life Balance could be better.  This is a Monday through Friday job.  Work can be redundant and stressful at times.  There is a good opportunity for advancement in the company.  Salary and Benefits are good.
good,"Centene has many divisions.  I can only speak to the health coach position"
good,Quick growth has led to unsustainable processes and hectic day to day operations with little consideration for tomorrow.  Accountability is lacking and fosters a culture of kicking the can.
good,Serious lack of work culture and work/life balance. Management communication is poor and there is lack of structure. Employees just worked and left...
good,A typical workday was average.  A constant flow of work. Working at Centene gave me an opportunity to learn a new operating system and become more familiar with the healthcare environment.
good,The Arizona Centene office is still trying to find it's own identify.  Since the merger of Health Net and Cenpatico the company feels fragmented.  Much work is needed for the Arizona market to feel cohesive and have one identity.
good,was a laid back place to work with people who took the time to help and answer questions. Would still be there if it wasn't for a sudden unfortunate event
good,Everyone is new including management. No one knows what's going on. Lots of different answers to the same questions. Many favorite employees that get all the choice assignments. Too much I don't know or I don't care attitudes.
good,Thought the hiring process was long.  Takes too long for them to make a decision and get through the corporate red tape.  The atmosphere at best was slow and not warm.
good,used to be enjoyable working for this company but then they moved our locations and are adding extra work with no extra benefits and no choice. the new location doesn't seem to care for the employees like the other site did.
good,I would never go back there and they ruined my name for 2 years I worked for an insurance company that didn't offer me insurance since I couldn't get. HR was bad.
good,It's a okay job . If you like customer interaction and don't mind frequent changes . It may be a good fit for you. There is always something to keep you on your toes.
good,"great company to work for"
good,"Work for a specialty vision company owned by Centene, Envolve Vision. Location is an.inbound call center environment servicing health plans and members with various needs."
good,I love the energy at this company and the corporate messages. Company is in constant growth and always looking to expand. The people are all very friendly and approachable from the bottom all the way to the top. The middle and upper management of Centene are frequently in meetings and open to questions and feedback.
good,"Management isn't the best. Feel like I don't get paid enough. Repetitive work and it never changes, seniority take over when you apply for a new position. If you haven't been there for a long time you won't be considered for any new or higher position."
good,"Company has great benefits, however assignments are not real, goals are not attainable, employees are very stressed and most of them quit as soon as they can, is normal to see 4 to 5 resignation letter in 1 week."
good,"There are Pros and Cons working with Centene, but I'm thankful for my job. I have been with Centene since Nov 2015 which was their first hiring wave for agents"
good,Great company to work for.  The company has several divisions here in Florida and offers great benefits and development opportunities.  Centene is active in the community.
good,"The company's policy is no working from home.   Some areas/departments do get by with working from home, while other areas/departments  can not work at home unless they are management.   It is a real issue at the company."
good,Centene is a very friendly place to work.  The hours are flexible and it is a relaxed environment.  Management staff is friendly and understanding when personal issues arise.  They are very involved in community charities with numerous events throughout the year.
good,When I first started mgmt seem to be all about making sure you succeeded. Things have changed with new mgmt style mimicking a micromanagement where you are being watched at what you are writing you co workers about.
good,"a lot ofgossipping"
good,"Travel throughout chicago land area to members homes to provide care coordination. That include forging relationships with members and their primary care providers, medical specialist and medical suppliers."
good,"Was care manager for approximately 50-60 managed care members who were eligible for high risk care management.  Reviewed inpatient census daily for members that were admitted to the hospital.  Daily outreach to members telephonically to review care plans, update assessments and care plans with member medical or social changes.  Attended meetings as directed.  Completed face to face meetings with the members as directed by Ohio Department of Medicaid in the member's home, provider offices or a neutral location.  Position was transition to a remote/field status where most of the work was completed at my home office.  The most fulfilling piece of my job was working with the ""expansion"" members.  These members were people that did not have insurance until there was an expansion within the Medicaid product."
good,the pay at this job was great but the people were very rude and treated their employees horribly. the work was not bad being a call center but the emplyees ruined it all
good,"The workplace itself is great! Compensation and benefits were good. "
good,This is a great company with great benefits. Everyone works well together. I have enjoyed learning about utilization review.
good,"Real team environment and spirit.  Paid well.  Offered incentive bonuses and annual sales trips.  Fun environment, liked going to work.  A lot of colleague engagement."
good,"Work experience is wonderful for new grad RN - educators are good, management has become better, pay is about the going rate and has not increased for experience which is not good in local economy.  Team morale is great"
good,"It was okay to work here, if you like customer service, and answering phones all day, it will be cool for that individual. Personally for me not my thing."
good,Centene has a mission to improve the lives of members. Good potential for growth and to launch new products. All employees receive an annual bonus based on performance.
good,"Employees are pulled in too many directions and spread too thin to be effective with anything. I did learn a great deal about working with many computer programs and to manipulate information into various formats. The hardest part of the job is that we are required to meet goals that are not within our control . The most enjoyable part of the job is when you are actually able to connect with a member and feel like you helped them. They cannot tell you that you have to work overtime if you are a salary employee, but they make the demands of the job so extreme that you must work over to get them done. They also continue to add more tasks to the job on a regular basis."
good,Centene is a company that has systems and supports in place to create a work environment conducive of growth and development.
good,"Lots of work!!! Work from home! Members are great! Good benefits…Hard to find management! Management are not RNs, as an RN you will work under and LVN or someone with social work experience."
good,"Responsible for processing medical claims, member research, and newborn reports.  Maintained contacts with insurance companies for verification of member eligibility"
good,The hardest part of the job was when a coworker was training me but not telling me correctly. A Medicaid healthcare company working with members and providers in the state of ohio.
good,"What I've learned at Centene Corporation is to be more interactive with business partners, always stay positive, the co-workers are very hard working, the people we all work with are the most enjoyable!"
good,"Centene is a wonderful company overall. However, Peach State Health Plan (one of several health plans under the Centene umbrella) is another story... "
good,Very busy atmosphere and the company still embraces the vertical hierarchy of management. Has excellent employee benefits including 401k and vacation times or PTO threshold.
good,"Typical Work Week Day- 100-200 Cases to 'run'. "
good,Not much growth opportunity unless you personally know someone.I was there 2 years attempting to move into other departments and because a friend of mine knew someone and had no experience she was hired.
good,Management is new and inexperienced.  Unorganized and lacks structure at this time.  Hopefully they get it together.  Great benefits.
good,It's a great place to work. I previously had no pharmacy experience before being promoted as a Pharmacy Coordinator. I was nurtured and trained very while by my manager of the time. Workload can be stressful but the gratification of helping those who can help themselves is amazing.
good,It is a horrible place to work.. Only work here if you need a job
good,"Overall, this is a decent company to work for - it is experiencing rapid and sustained growth that should continue for some time. Growth and advancement opportunities are there if you work hard and are flexible with your schedule. For many departments, if you have tight deadlines outside of work (example: childcare issues, other commitments) this may not be the right job for you. There is also the likelihood you will work a fair amount of weekends and/or holidays - this is due to Medicaid and it's requirements for timeliness, phone coverage, etc. If none of this is a problem for you, the sky is the limit with Centene regarding your own personal goals and objectives."
good,"Still too new to write an accurate and fair review. I believe the role of case manager is a very important role within the organization and will eventually develop into such."
good,I would say that overall Centene is a good place to work but a little training on the management side is needed.
good,"Centene Corporation is a great company to work for but there are some things that the company should consider. For example, recognizing talent within the organization before seeking external candiates to fill available career opportunities. There have been several instances where I have applied for a position and was never scheduled an interview. Especially, when the position falls within my area of expertise."
good,"Providing customer service to provider for 8 hours a day. Hardest part of the job is being able to take a break, lunch or go to the restroom."
good,My overall review (as indicated also by the CEO of the Louisiana plan) is that the management staff need more training on customer service.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing the consumers are satisfied
good,"I enjoyed this job because I was able to help students with disabilities achieve and exceed their Individual Education Plans. I taught reading, math, language, science, social skills and life skills."
good,Great company but lacks technological advancement to be competitive. Need for new products and innovation. Limited opportunities for advancement. Great benefits.
good,Company had difficulty keeping up their growth. Many management changes and changes in processes and job duties; changed job description/position three times in the time I was there.
good,Oveall I love working with our pregnant members and educationg them but I am starting to miss the patient interaction. I love the coworkers that I have we all work together as team here for the most part.
good,Excellent benefits and salary . Work life balance can be consuming at times . Company always making unexpected changes each quarter that can cause additional stress. Management is not organized and has a high turn over rate . Advancement within the company is very difficult. HR is unorganized and has high turn over rate .
good,"The work was very challenging, esp. when auditors from an entirely different department set the goals. They had no understanding about how much work it took out in the field. The member's made the work satisfying and worth all your efforts in providing quality of care. Workplace culture was at times unprofessional. Everyone trying to get ""brownie points."""
good,"Very face paced.  Everything is needed immediately.  You have work flying at you from multiple people, all is URGENT.  Be prepared to be extremely flexible.  "
good,"My background was that of a Certified Medical Coder. However after getting the job, found out that coding had nothing to do with the job. It had to do with checking encounters that were already coded and going over the encounter double checking the documentation. Then making decisions regarding pre-pay regulations depending on what state I was assigned. When I asked about training, was told the more seasoned ones were ""too busy"" so I basically had to figure the job out myself and only received feedback for errors."
good,Great job but over worked due to poor management of corporate resources. One technician was support for 500 people. Lots of room for advancement if at the corporate office but not if at individual plans
good,"The pay and the benefits are great. It is a good job for a call center job. However, depending on the week, you feel stable and the next not so much. What I consider borderline abuse is having been followed into the bathroom. That's just completely unprofessional. At first, I thought maybe I was just being a little paranoid, but after a few times, I brought it to the attention of one of the stakeholders and she admitted that she did that because she likes to know where her representatives are at all times. I let her know that that was not ok and made me uncomfortable. After that, even though I had good attendance and work stats, I was let go without given a reason. I assume it may be because they got the sense that I was eventually going to be a whistleblower and report them. Which I am still working on. It can be a good place to work, but I also felt that if I asked 3 different leads or managers a work-related question, I could possibly get 3 different answers. When you're dealing directly with customers, you need to know how to help them. Also, it's a fortune 500 company, and their CIS would crash almost weekly which affected job performance. There were some of management that were respectful and did know what they were doing, but it seemed like others had their heads in the clouds which doesn't make you feel secure as a representative if you dont get the proper training or support you need to do your job. I had never experienced going directly from training to straight taking calls - no nesting period, no extra help. They did have work processes you could spend time looking"
good,"Typical corporate atmosphere.  Good salary/benefits. Was able get job satisfaction from helping members with Medicaid/Medicare, who had serious heath problems. Some micromanagement and discord amongst employees in the office. Also, some very talented, hard working people not getting recognition or career advancements. Favoritism and snubbing occurred from some of the leadership team."
good,Centene was a good company to work for.  They own over 32 health plans across the US and 2 in Europe. Unfortunately getting considered for a transfer or getting a chance to interview for a similar or relative position from one state/plan to another is almost impossible.
good,Overall Centene is a good place to work. Depending on what department you are working in determines your work-life balance. There is a constant change in management and a high turn over rate.
good,It was very Stressful. There was a lot of favoritism. There was not enough training on the actual systems to be used. There is not enough support by leads and supervisor when there are daily changes.
good,Good experience and people to work beside. no real problems other  than taking time off can be a hassle if there is not enough coverage avaialble to cover the shifts or the workload
good,"The company does not understand the proper hiring process.  They think throwing money at the problem will solve it.  Management knows they have a problem, but are frozen in place."
good,"Workplace culture needs lots of work.  With all of my experience, I found it difficult to be properly promoted to a higher position.  It was more of who you know verses what you know."
good,The position was fast paced with high call volume.  There were many changes like there is in the medical field generally.  I learned a lot about how different facilities operate with different government assisted insurances.
good,"You start processing claims at the start of your shift (of course)"
good,"Fun environment with great co workers. Management could be better."
good,"Lot of OT"
good,"Recent acquisitions have forced change in the culture of the work environment. Some management personnel would benefit from coaching services offered by the parent company, Centene Corp."
good,"Productive and Innovative place to work.I have worked as Sr IT Program & Delivery Manager, Sr. Product Manager, Sr. Project Manager and Technical Lead for many fortune 100 organizations. I would request you to consider my candidature suitably. I would like very much to discuss about the open position in your company. I feel that my experience in IT will positively contribute to the services you provide to customers."
good,"Pays skilled set premium for education, which is a huge plus. But once in, very little promotion within unless hired in growth areas. Not promotion for loyalty or merit."
good,Assist providers with claims that was denied/recouped for various reasons. Coordinated with TMHP and other state regulated entities to ensure accurate updated information.
good,MY day was like any call center.  I answered phones did help with emails from end-users.  Worked with other agents over Skype services.  They had a extensive knowledgebase.
good,Currently being a contractor is not as fun as the Full Time Employees there. The FTE get all kinds of perks. Being a contractor we only get to enjoy a few of the perks.
good,Good company to work for. Can learn a lot with the company growth. Lots of diversity and opportunities to work in various states.
good,It's gratifying to help people who have not had health insurance in a long time as well as help them move towards better health. I enjoy the people that I work with. We collaborate on complex cases and bounce ideas off one another.
good,Most enjoyable part of the position was to mentor and educate my team in analytical solutions.  The hardest part was the level of turnover and keeping good associates.
good,this was a high volume call center. the good part is you get to work independently. the bad part is you get jugded independently which can be more stressful.
good,Most of daily works are low level reporting and data extraction with a few of ad hoc analysis.
good,"Centene Corporation provides great Amenities to its employees. There is a great cafe. The fact that we have access to a gym, car wash, oil changes, and dry cleaning greatly contributes to work-life balance."
good,"They are relocating to Jackson, many of us will be without a job, i feel like they were insensitive to our needs, and did not make sure there dedicated workers was going to be okay without them."
good,"Just sit down and do the work.  If you don't like something, just wait because a new manager will come soon and change everything.  Advances based on cliques not merit or education."
good,"Centene is a good company. The work day is busy, learned how insurance decision processes impact health care. The workplace culture in one area can be stressful."
good,Able to choose the level of insurance you need. Insurance is affordable. Adequate days off.  They promote Life/Work balance.  Retirement plan is the same as most employers.
good,Schedules unraveled daily.  Hard to work forward on something only to find the direction changed overnight.  Very good people with passion for the company's success.
good,Indiana vs Arizona i would rate Indiana as being good there was issues but nothing like Arizona.  The communication for Arizona is not all that great.  Where i work at  the staff do not have the Centene experience as other locations.  Management in Indiana was easier to approach then Arizona management.  When i leave work i'm not really leaving work i understand that we are a 24 hour customer service but we have leads that are to take place of supervisors and we have on call supervisors that management do not utilize so that the ones that are off work can enjoy their days off and or vacation. Also its hard when management do not get along in-front of supervisors.  Also we all feel like we are able to be supervisors we are being micro-managed.   What is good with the company is the benefits and compensation.
good,Supportive management which offered attainable solutions and advice.  Management style varies across departments which ultimately impacts employee morale.
good,"Great place to work , management not so great. Loved the company , but new management pushed me out the door. I would consider going back if given the opportunity"
good,"75% Travel required"
good,"They do many things for employess and strive to be diverse, they pay well its just a very stressful job. I enjoyed my fellow employees. Management could have been a little more on the same page."
good,"Work life balance is difficult. Most positions require more than 40 hours per week (even for salary employees).  Communication within the department I work in is almost non existent, which is one of the huge drawbacks.  If creates a lot of ""reactive"" situations instead of ""proactive""."
good,"A typical day at work consists of processing member's claims in Medicaid for the State of Texas.  I have learned to be an advanced analyst with highlights in Coordinating Benefits from multiple insurance companies.  Management of claims operations has what appears to be a high turnover rate, as new leaders are promoted or retired.  The company is constantly behind and cannot catch up the workload with the given employee amount.  Work has increased significantly and analysts are driven to complete as much as possible.  Our work is monitored and kept track of complete claims in a given day.  The hardest part of the job is to continue to meet deadlines and claims per hour with a constant increasing goal.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the employees that have positive and optimistic outlooks on life."
good,"I have found Centene confusing at times regarding directives. This is understandable, as they have just taken over MHN, and are still learning the job to support MFLC, who in turn provide support to military personal and families. I have enjoyed their ability to allow MFLC's to make professional judgement calls when working on the ground with military."
good,A typical day was juggling a handful of conflicting meetings and deciding which was more important or finding someone to cover those that you could not attend.   The workplace culture is good overall and focused on employee engagement. Work life balance is not great.  There is always more work than what one can accomplish daily.  You have to place your own boundaries upon this as it will become overwhelming.  As you move higher up the ranks this becomes worse as you are expected to travel on top of meet the expectations.   This does not seem to be recognized or is just expected as part of your role.
good,"Training is amazing, I really felt like was going to make a difference. Once I got on the floor:"
good,"If you are just looking for a paycheck then this a go-to job. Yes, the back to back calls are annoying, the CSRs who think they are doctors will frustrate you, and the MDOs that act as if every PA is urgent will make you want to pull out your hair, but this job is actually easy. If you try to go above and beyond for the patients because you feel bad for them, you will feel stress. if you go to work, do your 8 hours, and go home, then nothing will bother you. This is a dead end job though."
good,I really miss the medical benefits that was provided. We didn't have to pay out of pocket a whole lot for basics like prescription medicine. Urgent care costs were decent.
good,Peach State is a good place to learn about the role of managed care in the Medicaid arena.  They are a growing company that faces many challenges associated with the changing healthcare market.
good,"Great place to work and good environment, growth with the company is awesome. Recommend anyone to work for Centene Healthcare. I enjoy document management."
good,"As an Executive Assistant you will expect a fast-paced, high stress environment.  Executive Assistants support anywhere from 1 - 5 high level executives and will find it difficult to take time off and are expected to be available 24 hours when needed.  Home life balance is difficult if not impossible.  Best for those who are single and have no other commitments outside of work.  The position requires someone who can tolerate constant change and can juggle many tasks at one time.  You are expected to smile and not complain even when the work load is more than what an 8 hour day can handle."
good,"Centene is a fun, productive, friendly environment that deals with Medicare members and providers only. I enjoyed working around the people as well as the management and nurses"
good,"With the amount of growth the company went through in my period of working there, there was a lot of work and very tedious. However, the department had one goal in mind, help the company succeed."
good,Co-workers always willing to lend a helping hand. Enjoy helping members who need assistance with all aspects of life. Enjoy daily routine.
good,"It is a great company starting with the Top CEO' s and Management. As far as the CSR & PSR department, it is not managed Professionally."
good,Great Company Overall. Still developing certain departments however progressive an productive in ongoing efforts to improve environment and the efficiency of productivity.
good,Working with this company i learned a lot about the way insurance information is processed for the consumer and the provider of the service. I enjoy my work day.
good,"Good company to begin with. Not so good after HealthNet acquisition. It began to seem like HealthNet bought us instead of the other way around. Even processes that were old and bad, we had to adopt."
good,Needs to care more about people and less about the millions in the companies bank account. They should be more accommodating to heir employees work life balance.
good,great place to work with great benefit. good training. expect to received lot of call. it was fun to work at centene however i had to leave as it was too far away. i had to drive 2 hours
good,"A typical day included working on numerous cases for basically doing Managed Care. While doing Utilization Review Nursing within a Concurrent Review department. Using Interqual (McKesson) as a"
good,"The difficulty in reviewing Centene is that the work at the healthplan level is subject to the local state governments. If they are productive, operations would be productive. Likewise if the relationship is rocky, then expect operations to run the same way."
good,"Its a good job, if don't like to talk, and have much customer services, this is the right place for you.  Also, if you love to listen to music and work and eat,  this is the place."
good,Worked here for many years. The Management staff is great. Frequent mandatory OT. OT is great when its an option but I am a family man.
good,I wish to not comment on a previous employer unless asked out right. I was taught to only give positive feedback if you can not do that then not commenting is the best thing I can do.
good,The training process is very knowledgeable. I have learned a lot while working there. I am grateful for the way Centene has helped me to move on to something new.
good,"Provided with flexible working schedule (flex time, holidays, weekends off). Knowledgeable and friendly staff/ management. Opportunities for promotions are available."
good,Needed more one on one trainings. More lead assistance on phone calls. More claims training needed as well. Leadership was not efficient enough. No follow through with assiatance.
good,"Job is easy and pays well. Work load isn't all that bad, management and communication within departments lack however. Some management is biased also."
good,"Centene is committed to the personal growth and development of employees and to attracting the best and brightest talent. However, there is no growth without health and serenity, which is why Centene offers its employees a series of workplace benefits."
good,It's not for everyone.  Needed more written processes and procedures.  The culture seems to be more of a younger generation than myself.  Health Plans can be complicated.
good,Overall it could be a wonderful environment if they had a better supervisor in place for their call center.I enjoyed working for the company and assisting the member and providers as well.
good,"A nice place to work. There is a great work life balance here, however management does not also listen to employee concerns."
good,"If you are just about money, this is the place to be. But the Quality guidelines here are nothing short of ridiculous and unncessarily stressful on both the reps and management who enforce it. The overall people here are wonderful, but whoever in corporate is making decisions for quality is out of touch with reality"
good,Management will tell you what you want to hear and then it will be a different story when you take the job. Training is awful. You are expected to learn difficult tasks in just a few hours. You are told you can ask questions and they are available at anytime. This is not true.
good,"centene has a lot of opportunities for you to move up . "
good,"The company overall is a great place to work for. It is diverse and a fun place to be in. But, the only thing is that they do not values the employees that are capable of doing the job."
good,"Great benefits, daycare on site, flexible and accommodating hours. Advancement options are available you just have to work for it. OT available as needed."
good,"Typically a normal work day was steady, not many supervisor calls. Everyone was one accord. The team numbers were outstanding , every team member took breaks and lunches on time. The growth within the company was simple."
good,However the management and supervisors do not provide a conducive working environment for the staff. The hardest part of the job is not being able or allowed to help your fellow co-workers.
good,"Answer incoming calls, speak with veterans and providers, consult on medical documentations. Correspond with the Department of Veterans Affairs, manage call volume, keep average handle of resolution."
good,"not recognized for the work you put in"
good,"4 years with company, started out great until I realized theres not much room for advancement due to the call center turn over rate being so high. Temps came in making more money although they never stayed on permanently, bonuses were late, raises late. Created a more strict attendance policy, cant read at desk, no phones. Strict schedule adherance, and performance review, extremely high call volume and no room for off phone activity, they want you to take as many calls as possible while closely following schedule. Too many changes, not enough praise or pay."
good,"The organization has a respectable and even noble mission and vision, and outside the IT space the environment is positive and nurturing.  Within IT there are significant growth challenges as the organization continues to change due to growth and acquisition."
good,"Company has great benefits."
good,Since this is a start-up in this state it is hard to have a work-life balance when your salary. The benefits including health insurance are very attractive
good,"This is a great company; however they need to revamp their tools they utilize. Too many systems that don't talk to each other, processes are not in place, not enough training for employees. No integrity in their data. This company has the money to upgrade all of the systems in to one instead of piecing them together. So much time is wasted on the job trying to figure out correct data"
good,"My review, good company but not for someone with disabilities,"
good,"Centene overall offers great salaries and benefits however; in many departments the mid to upper level management is awful.  There’s a “bullying” dictator type leadership culture that exists, that installs fear in employees; which leads to little change because the issues are never presented to those who can actually make change.  I was in Management and resigned due to feeling as if one boss made all the decisions."
good,I have learned a lot about the denial and approval process and getting a new request and approving / denying it based on medical necessity. I have also learned the Criteria used for these requests.
good,"Certain departments as an employee you will be able to grow and prosper within, they are able to teach you skills and give training within the organization for personal advancement. However other departments do not give the same opportunities and work life balance is not consistent within different departments. Leadership is different and hold \standards depending on the business need."
good,"I enjoy the growth and learning experience from the opportunities I have in Utilization Management for this company. There is constant change and expansion. With this comes challenges with staffing, work loads and IT keeping up with the growth."
good,"I enjoy working with this company, They are encouraging and supportive. The work environment encourages personal and professional growth"
good,I enjoyed being a part of the S. Florida merge from Nurse Response and Centene.  I implemented the move to the new location in Fort Lauderdale and enjoyed working with the Nurse staff .  Centene is a great stable company to work for as long as there is no other things in life to do until vacation.  They are a very expecting company because they are doing big things and are very successful and if someone is not ready to dedicate most of their time to their career this company is not for them.
good,"As entry level to claims processing and have an opportunity to be a part of a company that is growing as fast this one is a great option.  As for the "
good,"i would recommend to a friend. good benefits, good bonus, good holidays, lots of over time, three weeks of vacation, three PTO days, lots of good perks"
good,some flexibility . mostly a good work environment sometimes stressfull but has good benefits and stock options and pd time off so. overtime avail on some projects
good,"we was rushed in the training class didn't get all the help we needed to face all the difficult calls that came thru, had to ask experience reps for help the manager we had didn't even know all the answers"
good,"Centene is a big company with great benefits. The main office is located in St. Lous MO. I worked at the Wichita office. It is a great place to work, people working there are fun to be around and respect each other. My reason for leaving was health related and the need for a part time job instead of a full time."
good,"I think Centene is a great place to work, there is structure and growth and more things to come. I have grown with the company over the year and they seem to be getting more and more staff."
good,Typical  day at work includes a lost of meetings. You will learn the ins and outs of contracting. The management is semi knowledgeable. And you get use to the work culture. The hardest part of the job is getting the information you need to complete task.. But at the end of the day it's all worth it because of the pay.
good,"company is new to managing employees at this scale at this location.  Im sure with more time, this will be a top notch place to work.  the work/life balance is not very good due to there are not enough employees being trained to properly do their job functions."
good,"Poor communication from direct supervisors. Great benefits, generous, leave time and excellent insurance benefits. Supervisors very condescending. Day to day stress is high due to lack of leaders to understand employees concerns and or question. Great overall education however detailed orientation poor."
good,"a typical day at work includes:"
good,very fast paced environment. innovative and ahead of their competitors
good,"This Company offers great benefits, and has fair pay.  Centene does appreciate its employees, and shows it on a regular basis.  There is a bonus based on your performance and if you meat your metrics."
good,"Centene encouraged performance metrics with function-focused tools.   They offered excellent administrative documentation as part of their employee onboarding process, which included on site in depth HR training, with subsequent continued education available on line."
good,Centene has great benefits and good pay. Many changes within management. Very high standards. Limited time off. Unable to advance in my role. If you work in the office there is more opportunities.
good,No comment at this time as my review would not be fair due to certain circumstances at hand right now.  Let’s just say you at some point become just a number and no longer a person
good,"Verty disorganized, constant change, computer frequently doesn't work.  Pays well, I get to work from home, supportive co-workers but over bearing manager."
good,"My Dept was severanced out, management did not run Dept correctly, given the opportunity to fix what they neglected. Was not fixed correctly, lost the contract, management all managed to get rehired, a few other employees as well, after 60 admissions to be considered for other  positions in the company, no one ever reached out for an interview. The management who screwed up our department were somehow granted favor and their screw ups overlooked, while others had to be severanced out. Myself included, this has affected my self esteem and who I am."
good,"Centene is a forward-thinking company for those ready to bring their A game.  It is a company growing by leaps and bounds, which requires all processes to grow and morph to meet the challenge.  The environment is quite dynamic and demands high collaboration for Centene to continue to provide high quality healthcare."
good,"Centene as a company is awesome. However, I worked at ACaria Health Specialty. Management there was very unprofessional and favored towards Hispanics only. My manager acted like a child, if She was upset about anything then she will become very petty in the way she handle work issues. They micromanage you as if you are in high school, down to the usuage of cellphones phones and how long you are in the bathroom. You get written up for possible ANYTHING. You never know what to expect day to day, they pick and choose based off their feelings."
good,I was treated fairly by management. I made friends there. I enjoyed the culture. My team supervisors were very helpful and knowledgeable. Good snacks.
good,Overall great place to work. I met awesome people and had a great experience. The environment is fast-pace. The team members are eager to help. The work is rewarding.
good,"Centene was a good company to work for in terms of company structure, but very little advancement opportunity at their Sunshine Health location.  Other than that, it was a typical day at work.  I would recommend to someone that needed a job."
good,"This is a great company to work for if security is priority. However, the compensation does not match the workload and stress. Fair wages would be in their favor."
good,The company is a good company.  They could pay a little bit more for internal promotions.  It is almost better to leave then come back to receive equal pay. Outsiders came in making a lot more than internal transfers.  They just do not pay enough or pay give pay increases for furthering education.
good,"I worked at centene corporation, and I have to say that I loved the work, but the manager, and the work life balance left a LOT to be desired. If you want to work here be sure to figure your salary on working between 45 and 60 hours a week, and then on call ti will be well more. The management as best as I can tell is not an example of my experience with it, but I ranked them low because my manager was overly high strung, not clear in their expectations, and inconsistent in her application of discipline across the entire group. At times I felt as tho I was being singled out and targetted, when other people that did the same things did not get punished as I had."
good,good place to work as benefits start immediately and co-workers are easy to get along with.  Continuing education is encouraged to promote advancement opportunities.
good,"love the company but there are more areas of improvement. work/life balance is currently being worked on, so far its ok. Pay is pretty good for entry level."
good,"No advancement options--they prefer hiring from the outside than promoting within.  If you come in under the wrong manager, it can be very hard to move within the company."
good,Poor management; too much micro-management going on. Unrealistic job expectations. The company is good....with good location and benefits. The problem is the nursing managers.
good,"The company is continuing to grow. There are a lot of opportunities to advance within the company, unfortunately some of the employees are not able to advance to other positions."
good,My time at Nursewise Help me became very flexible in new project as well as train my self for those new projects. I learned how much I enjoyed helping other. The hardest part of my job was the poor flexibility fro change in schedule.
good,Either a position is created for someone or an unqualified or less qualified individual is promoted. There has been actual qualified advancement periodically.
good,Learned alot while working here.  Some people were harder to deal and the job never really felt like it could be advanced.
good,My manager who i have to report was very friendly and its great working with such a good team. The environment was so good in between the team so everyone would love to come and work in the office.
good,"work in Agile with Client driven project , attend scrum call and sprint planning for successful release implementation, Learning includes Health care which covers on Inpatient, Outpatient and Pharmacy/RX Claims and Authorization."
good,Great company at the start.  Multiple internal changes including replacing clinical pharmacy manager with a RN.  This transition did not go well and many people left the company at that point.
good,"Room to move around departments. Opportunity to participate in work groups and learn and contribute to changes. Various engagement opportunities . Like all jobs, it is what you make. Believe in your role and you will make impact and receive recognition"
good,"Simple job, good pay, no real advancement opportunities in IT field with this company, Great job for entry level IT workers. Communication is lacking throughout the company at times."
good,Too much expected with impossible amount of time.  Too many changes too often . Micromanagement to the max.  However the teamwork and co-worker support is fabulous. I immediately felt like one of the family.
good,What was an okay place to work the place is fun and the feed you a lot just work hard and get you bonus it will be worth it. the place is so fun and the benefits are great
good,"Centene is a good place to work. There are concerned about the communities we serve. There are initiatives around educating and empowering, The other focus is employee engagement and career pathing."
good,"It provides many growth opportunites. I enjoyed my time and learned many team buiding skills and a gained very strong,growing knowledge in healthcare."
good,"After 5 years, it was longer the same company.  Severe lack of opportunities for advancement.  Leadership does not listen to their subordinates at all."
good,Must understand how medical groups work within the health insurance field. Willing to learn multiple computer programs in this company. Multitasking is something you must be willing to do
good,"A good place to work, but be prepared to work several late nights and weekends during the busy season. "
good,"I work on the prior authorization team in Columbus Ohio, the team works well together to be productive and meet company set goals for production and turn around times."
good,Fast paced growing company.  Opportunities to move between departments are available.  Fortune 51 company with great benefits.  Centene has a great mission.
good,"A typical day at work was pretty much going in... sitting down and doing whatever project you were assigned to do. The company shows appreciation to its employees pretty well throughout the year. Great work environment with friendly employees. Management is a different story. In the beginning, management was cool and worked with you and listened to your opinions! Now it has become a “buddy buddy/this is my friend” type of environment. If you are not friends with certain people, then being considered for advancement is difficult."
good,Centene is a very good company. I strongly recommend people who are willing to work in a fast paced atmosphere. Centene provide good career growth to the people.
good,Great place to work for the most part. Only thinking about leaving to relocate. The pay and benefits are great for this area. Especially for someone without a degree.
good,"The compensation and benefits are great depending on your position . They are well-known company so it holds weight with other employers. Senior leadership can be very cutthroat and backstabbing. Racism can be very blatant. Depending on who you’re working for and with your experience can be at either end of the spectrum, the  worst or the best."
good,I would recommend another department with Centene in claims due to the limited training received.  The hardest part of the job was when you received new claims to process and the process had not been completed prior to sending to the Claims Analyst.
good,"Working at CENTENE was the highest paid salary I ever received. I did enjoy my role as a Long Term Care  Case Manager, The challenge I faced was the overwhelming tasks to be completed and it was almost impossible that it did affect my health and personal life and that I was obligated to resigned, which I did not wish to do. The option to be working from home was a great advantage and it facilitated me to schedule my visits based on my availability. The most rewarding and enjoyable part was to see the satisfactions and the relief in the faces of the stressed elderly clients when they finally get their issues resolved.."
good,"Tenure with Centene was fair. Very demanding work environments with high volume projects, which were very time consuming. Navigating the ranks is very tricky."
good,"Great place to work to gain experience, I learned a lot working with different reporting applications. My manager was amazing helped me advance my knowledge skills."
good,Fast growing environment in the Health Care Industry.  Be prepared to hit the ground running.  Needs to be more of a work life balance for all employees.
good,Growth Is Possible however the diversity is poor.Executive Management is not transparent. It is all about upper leadership. Your voice can get lost in the shuffle unless your are leadership but once you come across a true leader and not just a manager the skies the limit. The workplace is as good as the staff working. The benefits and are great and the incentives are an added bonus.
good,"Overall a good company, but career advancement opportunities are limited. If promoted, HR doesn't adequately position salary to the current market rate."
good,"*  Began day with objective meeting"
good,You can learn a lot but you have to teach yourself about the job you are in.  Some depts are better than others depending on where you land in the company
good,Handled various claim types every other day and was able to learn how medical claims actually work. Had decent management that allowed for a good culture within in the workplace. Working back to back claims was sometimes straining. The team work element made the day more enjoyable.
good,"This is a temporary position. I have applied for a permanent position,  but nothing yet. This company is somewhat slow in responding to applicants. If you're able to become a FTE, there are great medical, dental and vision benefits. Just applying and waiting."
good,company took great care of employees offered benefits medical dental also PTO management for company was very professional as well as supervisors and team leads
good,"Value face time as opposed to job satisfaction, may spend a lot of time with nothing to do.  If no work available to be done that day, still want you at your desk."
good,Since Centene acquired my former employer I have found myself  learning and growing at faster rate than previously.  They set aggressive goals and empower the employees to reach them.  It has been a fun and dynamic change.
good,Fast paced company in a solid industry. Good for individuals who want to contribute at a high level early in career. Company is going to continue to grow which will add more opportunities for hard workers
good,"Long hours, nights and weekends. Pay and benefits are great for employees. Management can be good or poor depending on who you get as your team lead or manager. Not always allowed to take your breaks or lunch due to your work load. Poor work/life balance and little room for advancement for remote employees."
good,Answered phone for Medicare/Medicaid providers.  Reported trends of callers complaints and compliments.  Changes in guidelines all the time and keeping up with the information.  Did not have training manuals.  continual overturn of employees.
good,"Centene seemed to be a decent place to work. Good coworkers, alot of outings. Most staff worked 45-50 hrs\week but with some simple automation work could work a standard 40 hours a week. The work was not very interesting and made to be more stressful than it should have been do to poor communication between departments. It was ok. I would have stayed there longer if we had not moved for my wife's job. Biggest downside is knowing that you're working for a health insurance company..."
good,"Joining the Centene family has been an interesting experience and not altogether unpleasant.  "
good,Month-end close is too short.  Have to little time for complete close process.  Work 55-60 hours during month-end close.  Corporate Accounting works a lot of OT.
good,I was in the billing department for Centene and I loved my job. What I mean by my job is I loved what I did but I cannot say the same about management. The supervisors avoided supervisor calls all the time and they even got mad at me when I had one. They tried to make it seem like I wasn't doing my job even though the customers demanded for a supervisor to get on the line.
good,cutting edge methods and healthcare advancements. New ideologies and techniques in place to compete and become leading managed care organization
good,The management team really helped you with any issues. The requisition load was very standard. I would work for them again.
good,This is fast paced and growing organization and a great place to learn and grow.The company manages medicaid and medicare for states and assists with better health outcomes for its members. The organization strives to bring efficiencies in the health management for the members of the state health care program and doing so with minimizing cost and maximizing the benefits.
good,"Good work environment"
good,"Was able to set my own hours, however, production expectations were difficult to maintain."
good,"Great co-workers and teams, Skilled trainers and leaders."
good,"A typical day can be were you will take 40 to 50 calls a day."
good,Great benefits to employees.  Centene cares about employees health.
good,"First experience working in a production environment, when computers are not working properly or programs required to process are unavailable you lose aa lot of work time and are juast sitting around waiting for it to come back on line. Most co-workers make work enjoyable, management works hard for the employees and they are a great group of people working toi make our lives better and the work place a more enjoyable place to be at."
good,it's not so bad... just not enough interaction with people for me and it's not manual labor
good,"opporunity to have many different facets to role, opporunity to learn a lot"
good,"My days were extremely busy yet, because of the extraordinary team work, the work load did not phase me. It was a great place to work. It is a company that encourages growth within and makes opportunities accessible to its employees."
good,Centene overall was a good company to work with.  There was a lot of Sr Mgmt turnover and they didn't allow their contractors to participate in any of the training or technology based education.  This was a bit difficult with some members of your team receiving new technology education and others not able to participate.  All in all it was a good company with many great people.  They don't seem to convert great contractors to FTE's would be my only complaint. If you have great team members converting them to FTE's would benefit the company overall and save money as well.
good,"Being able to work remotely is very convenient.  The job is pretty tedious and mundane, but there is a lot of it. I do not feel that management advocates for their employees as much as they should. Accountability is definitely lacking."
good,"Somewhat good work/life balance. Many supervisory changes. Continuously changing processes.  Good benefits plan, training provided needed to succeed in position."
good,"Management was inconsistent and often worked with a process of fear and intimidation.  Otherwise, it was an excellent company overall with good pay and benefits."
good,"I believe this company to be a very strong company to work for and wish I could have been a part of and would love to still be so. They have benefits,  and room for advancement from my understanding."
good,"Workplace culture is a little clicky.  Enjoyed the job and people. "
good,"Good Company to work for expect to work after hours, travel and weekends at times,  the hours can fluctuate and scheduling time off can be at times challenging"
good,The company is a good place to start your career in the Health Care Industry. They offer a good benefits pkge. But management does play favorites in  how and when they discipline and offer promotions...
good,"I love my job with Centene and the people I work with. However, when it comes to raises or comparable pay they should make it where everyone is eligible ."
good,"The pay offered for Team Leads have been overlooked and needs review. We have requested to upper management many times, but no change. Basic Analysts coming in making more than Team Leads (management position)."
good,"Centene corp offers some of the best benefits to their employees, but work / life balance is bad. "
good,"Fast pace very busy.  "
good,"Office was friendly. Great work environment.The staff is very helpful and courteous, focused on improving out communities. It is a very fast pace environment but very organized and management is always there to guide us whenever we need it."
good,"I love my job at Centene but I have been micromanaged since day 2 (day 1 was orientation).  I have spoken up about it, nothing  done about it.  So I'm looking."
good,Centene is a high volume inbound call center with several metrics to meet. If you do not meet the metrics you will be written up. Multiple write ups could cost you your job. There isn't consistency with quality auditors or management across the board. It is a stable work environment as long as you meet the crazy metrics requirements. The hardest part about the job is work life balance there isn't a lot of flexibility with scheduling. If you need to have a shorter shift because of school it isn't possible. Another con is that there is an inconsistency with pay rates. Newer employees come in and are offered higher per hour rates over those who have been there longer.
good,"Productive place / Career advancement place, good place to work, but not for professional advancement, workplace environment good. No professional job open positions for technical skills."
good,"I was a customer service supervisor working on a Veterans Affairs contract. The contract is ending September 30, and my position was eliminated. "
good,They treat everyone like family. Very flexible and relaxed. There was a lot of mandatory overtime (for Full time employees) which can be bad if you are a single parent and do not have time to make those hours.
good,Centene is a good place to work.  They are respective of your life outside of the company and offer a relatively stress-free work environment.  Salaries are fair advancement has not been much of an option
good,Centene was a company that offered opportunities to participate in structure and development of processes.  Most had an open door policy for employees.  There was a large work load with expected deadlines.  Support available from supervisors and staff
good,team members I interacted with were great; projects assigned were of reasonable quality.  Could not argue with the quality of the engineers I worked with ...good experience.
good,"I worked for them a short time, I liked the company. They had a good benefit package that was fairly comparable to other companies for their employees. They listened to their employees. I would work for them again."
good,The work flow is steady. I have learned a lot about the ends and outs of health insurance. Management is great and everyone is very helpful.This company offers lots of advancement opportunities.
good,"Fairly compensated"
good,I believe this company should offer more advancement in management or leadership for employees that are not licensed but degreed and trained to complete the job applied for.
good,"Busy all day"
good,The work and personal life balance is good. This  is a contracted  facility. The  hours are Monday -Friday. I learned their are a lot of veterans that need help. The  difficult  part of the job is when your waiting  for the  provider to review the  history of the veteran. I enjoy helping others.
good,"Great benefits and great salary. It is disheartening to be recruited, resign from a job to accept the offer, only to be laid off 9 months later. It is additionally disappointing to have the company laying off in multiple departments, while hiring in other departments and there is no assistance provided to move the existing loyal employees to open positions."
good,Professional associates good to work with.  A lot of continuing changes within various departments. Good benefits.  Several locations within CA.  Headquarters located in Missouri.
good,"Great employees, very willing to help out and answer questions. Excellent services provided to consumers. Compensation was competitive and benefits were good."
good,"Very draining most days. Management has their favorites. Pay is ok, but could be better considering the amount of work required. There are days I've wanted to quit."
good,"Good company and cool benefits, hard to advance and move from department to department. Compensation and benefits are good. Alot of favoritism. No teamwork, every person for themselves, at least in my department."
good,This is a good company to work for. I would recommend if you want a good paying job that helps you gain a lot of experience and expertise. Good bunch of people as well
good,"I do recommend Centene for people with experience in customer service looking for something different with good benefits. Management are nice but could be a little more helpful."
good,"flexible work hours, I gained a lot of experience and training while employed.  Management was lacking, no Director in place for months, favoritism shown when promotions made to other positions"
good,Good company to work for long hours but not good pay. Management very helpful and involved with the employee and open door policy very much in effect.
good,"Good entry level job.Limited opportunities for growth and tedious tasks cause it to serve as a reminder that it is only a temporary job, not a career."
good,"The pay is great, and great benefits. "
good,"The work is very fast paced, and there are a lot of expectations placed on everyone. It's very hard work without a lot of direction or training, but the compensation and benefits are really good."
good,"Overall this is a good company to work for.  The Dallas location needs better training and staff/work ratios.  Job/Work Life Balance could be better.  Work expectations are high but if you are a high achiever it should not be a problem.  Depending on the workflow, a lot of overtime is involved with tight turnaround times and no overtime pay.  Salary is good but does not compensate for the overtime involved.  Bonuses are given based on the company's performance which is a nice perk.  Benefits are okay but the company does not allow you to carry spouses unless they do not have benefits available to them on their job.  As long as you maintain your caseload and submit timely documentation, job security and opportunity to advance is there.  Management from my experience is fair, not always professional, but fair for the most part.  Management is not always as informed about products and services as they should be and sometimes will make up things as they go along with no policy or documentation to back it up.  As far as job culture I must say that thoroughly enjoy the people that I work with.  I started in the call center and was promoted to a field coordinator and everyone that I have worked with are very supportive.  The tools provided for the job are sufficient."
good,Depending upon the department you are in this company can be wonderful with plenty of benefits or it can be your worse nightmare.
good,"Call center employee assisting in healthcare benefits for Medicaid recipients. Structured lunches, inbound call center, good work life balance."
good,This is a fast paced company with room to grow if you're looking to relocate. Lots of work and long hours for PR. Travel in required in your territory which can be far out.
good,"Learned a lot about AMisys advance."
good,Excellent company. Many software difficulties. I believe educators could be educated better on company policies. The company has been growing so fast that all of the Health coaches are overwhelmed or are leaving to find a less patient load. The company has taken on a massive amount of issurance companies and the training is not up to par. I believe they are  taking on too many companies all at one time. I've had many conversations with other Health coaches and they feel the same way.
good,"A typical day at Centene is full of change and unexpected events. The postion I am in is at a new division of the company so it has been somewhat trying at time. I've learned that every company does billing totally different. As far as management, I expected more communication from them being that this site is new and fresh and employees would like to be kept in the know especially about work and policies. The hardest part of the job is the constant change in work and how to process the claims correctly without receiving any audits."
good,Long days and hard work but there is team work and managers are always there to assist
good,"Company offers intensive training program based in a real life environment. Benefits are very good. Environment is production based with high expectations and standards. Workload is heavy, however manageable. Company offers flextime so you can choose the work schedule that works best for you."
good,"cubicle environment"
good,With constant hiring and acquisitions there are frequent reorganization of teams and desk/office moves in my 4+ years I moved between office buildings 4 times.
good,"It’s a call center but a great company with wonderful benefits. The pay is ok for the type of work that is performed. Lots of room for advancement, it is a Corporation"
good,"Enjoyed co-workers.Clean workplace. Good security. Management fair and attentive. I did not like remote training, training should have been in person."
good,I like the benefit they offer and the sick and vacation time. Advance is always available. There are position opening often and new departments being developed.
good,Good place to work. Good environment. Good compensation and benefits. Great opportunities for advancement. Collaborative environment with opportunities to work with various internal stakeholders.
good,it was like working with the smartest people in your college and enjoying the hard work with each other. I wish that management didn't play favorites though and lead people a little bit more.
good,"I love the mission and vision but this company will only promote you if you have visibility with the leadership. Your qualifications don't matter, you could let everyone one of your direct reports down but if the partners like you, you will be a senior director in no time."
good,"Random set of calls, some situations requires a lot of problem solving and de-escalating. There are a lot of resources to resolve issues. Most of the time there's someone to help but they give you 20% and you have to learn the other 80% as you go."
good,"I have been with Centene for almost 6 years. I would stay if given the opportunity for career advancement. They say they like to hire within, but I just see they give it to people they like. I feel my talents would be appreciated elsewhere. Good Luck!"
good,The typical day included completing scheduled coaching calls for stress management and depression.  I learned to manage my time well and meet productivity standards.  The workplace culture was understanding and open.  The hardest part of my job was managing time and meeting expectations.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping other people/clients.
good,"Process Insurance Claims, such as Medicaid and Marketplace claims. also Authorizations, Adjustments, Correcting Errors/Edits that arise, General Office Procedures, Duplicate Claims, Data Entry, Price Surgery & Pharmacy Claims"
good,"Worked for company for 7 years and didn't see much career progression or advancement for loyalty even when applying for higher level jobs with an advanced degree (2 Master's degrees).  Centene does have fairly good benefits and paid for tuition reimbursement for my 2nd Master's degree.  Company also matches 401K, and provides comprehensive health benefits.  Culture is relaxed and managers were reasonable for the most part.  Primary feedback is the lack of upward mobility for employees within."
good,"Centene is a great company to work for. Management and Associates were very nice and knowledgeable."
good,for sure 4 hours of Quality Monitoring/ making sure everyone does their job / make sure staffing is good for the night / workplace is good but at times to much gossiping/ favoritism/nothing it could get challenging but nothing that cant handle . interacting with Representatives an Nurses /helping them answering questions /
good,"Its a nice company to work for but you dont have no life if  you are on the management team."
good,"good place to work, good benefits and stability, dedicated to helping the health care for Veterans and making sure they get the health care they deserve while maintaining good relationships with providers"
good,"Great place to work and good place to learn new skills as well as learn about managed care and the insurance industry. Difficult to advance unless you are part of a clique and upper management is not aware of talent and over-qualified individuals made to wait a year  or more to apply for a lateral move while friends promote friends. Lack of transparency with management withholding company changes and impacts on employees. Not equitable or fair as many are hired through agencies as temporary full time but never allowed to know future or if being hired and promised in three months to be permanent and then it is extended 5-6 months so the company does not have to pay benefits.. People come and go as they please with remote managers unaware of the lack of fairness as others are held to strict standards on attendance. Morale is low as some are stuck in cubicles for years on end while others get favored treatment, and are allowed to work remotely from home  and come and go as they please. Managers working remotely with their staff stuck in cubicles. No reason  all cannot be remote, as all other MCOs do work remote, as all work is done online. The company makes millions in profits but large bonuses are only given to upper management of affiliate companies."
good,I have been very happy at Centene working as an a Rotational MFLC and CYB Child & Behavioral Youth MFLC. When needed I feel as support was provided although admittedly some Team Supervisors have been more accomplished than others.
good,I have enjoyed working for Centene. I enjoy the fast paced work environment along with the minimum supervision. I can truly appreciate being treated like an adult and to be allowed to work in peace.
good,The Centene SOC is a great community that has a growing knowledge base and always has new topics trends to learn about. The staff is great and there is plenty to learn from the senior security analysts.
good,"This job is not for everyone. It is highly overwhelming if you are not a fast learner and are not able to think outside the box. Training curriculum does not is not adequate for new agents being released onto the floor.  But, you are given plenty of opportunity to ramp up as it is a production environment.  If you are lucky enough  be assigned to the right team, you will be very successful and they will push you to your potential in hiring you perm. Everyone starts out as a Temp.  The company likes to make some promises that they do not keep, which has created a turmoil of turnover. Most of the candidates they do hire, do not speak proper English, and are only there for a paycheck, and because of the clientele we service, we get more complaints about agents not being able to be understood. This is a government contract and if you don't like change on the constant, then this is not a job for you. A typical day at work is scheduling appointments, doing reschedules, calling the providers, and then the patients.  The hardest part is spending an hour trying to locate a provider for that person because every time you call one, they tell you they no longer participate because they haven't been paid. The most enjoyable part of the job, is that it is a more laid back atmosphere at times, but still possessing a professional environment.  The other most enjoyable part is finally being able to get patient x an appointment for medical care they have so desperately needed for such a long time.  Also, I have made a few very good friends working at this place.  These are people I will continue"
good,"I experienced an incredible amount of learning opportunities at the expense of a work/life balance.  Centene is a reasonable company to work for.  However, being an organization working in a razor thin margin industry does not afford the capabilities available elsewhere.  Be prepared to either develop within or be able to spend more time on a project to complete it 'long hand'.  Regardless, a good company to work for that rewards the star pupils."
good,Centene is a growing company taking on new lines of business and shaping their management team to bring up new talent and capable employees.  I think they will be around for a long time.
good,"Productive place to work, would like to see more coaching from leadership and promotions from within. Would like to move to be promoted on merit and job performance."
good,"My current department is very stressful and there is no room to advance.  Once you are in PDM it's like you are stuck.  It's hard to get out of the department once they see you are a good, productive worker.  For some reason, those that don't do much get promoted.  I will never understand it."
good,Management challenges you to do your best and strive to do better. Always a new puzzle to solve which keeps you engaged. Compensation is fair and personal time is encouraged.
good,"Company runs by seat of pants only seems concerned about escalated issues. Worked on putting out fires as opposed to finding equitable solutions. Unless you are frontline non exempt staff do not expect to work a normal 40 per week schedule. If you can't work 50+ hours weekly, this may not be the place for you, however compensation and benefits are awesome."
good,Good company to work with. Very competitive. Good pay and benefits. Acquires other health care companies. Candidates need to work from either of their primary location St.Luios or Rancho
good,"Overall, it is a great place to work.  Like everywhere else it has it's same challenges.  Do to restrictions or policy work can at times be restricted or limited."
good,Not bad just too much tavel to different areas. NOt enough time for home life. Traveled to different areas and over night stays were mandatory for meetings and other needed items.
good,It was very hectic here but they did pay you well if you were in management and they have staff that are able to handle loads of stress. The role of communication between the company and its third parties weren't good a lot of the departments didn't know what they were doing.
good,"Centene is a great company, helping people with health insurance, assist members to meet their needs..   Unfortunately they focus too much on production, wanting  quantity not  quality of work."
good,"This job required you to be on the phone all day, and simultaneously do your regular job. There was a lot of interruptions during your shift, which made it hard to keep on track. Training was horrible when I first started, I'm not sure if got any better. There was no help available if you had questions on how to do something correctly."
good,It is a fast pace environment but worth the time of coming in on a day to day bases. You get help when it is needed. The higher ups are very concerned and will help if help is needed.
good,Fast paced environment. Production is a priority. Supervisors and trainers change but some of the permanent staff is supportive to new (or temp) employees.
good,"Opportunity to learn the different health plans Centene is associated with."
good,I was a volunteer there when I studied to be a psychologist. I learned so much about the mental health field. It also made me appreciate all the things I was grateful for. It was rewarding be able to support individuals in crisis.
good,"It was a great experience to work for Novasys first time having a male manager, very easy to get alone with and to work for. Management listen and very fair and honest, Allow you to work individually or with a team."
good,"great company"
good,"Centene is a great company. Helping others in need of health insurance, assisting members to meet  their medical needs is the companies main focus."
good,This is a good company with good benefits and good compensation but you will work hard for it.  The company still runs in infancy stages although it is several years in the market.  Most people who work here are passionate about their part in the company's mission.
good,The company is great and have great benefits. The pay scale for their employees is above average. They offer relocation benefits and college reimbursement to their employees. They promote community service.
good,"The job can be stressful, but at times can be calm and easy going. You just  need to come in do your work then go home. Overtime is always available, which is great. Internal advancements are available frequently."
good,It was a brand new call center that I helped open from the ground up.  I enjoyed helping Medicare/Medicaid eligible members.
good,"Centene corporation is a strong, solid company to work for.  There is a good sense of job security, and pay is fairly competitive.  Benefits are decent, and the company as a whole is pretty old-fashioned when it comes to schedule flexibility and dress code."
good,"Management not supportive of employees"
good,"Dependable, growing company that has a lot of hard-working individuals that take pride in their work."
good,Centene values diversity and an inclusive working environment. The compensation and benefits are outstanding. They are growing and expanding so there is a lot of work and great opportunity form growth.
good,Centene offers a great benefit and compensation package. They pride themselves on an inclusive environment which is supported by the diverse group of people they employ. Centene could improve on providing more in depth training to its employees and departments which would support less stress in the working environment.
good,A great experience . Fun and reliable position if you show up for work.  when converting form temp to perm you have to initiate the process to begin be persistent
good,"The work culture has room for improvement, The atmosphere is not the best nor is the training or necessary expertise to be successful. It's growing at an alarming rate and experiencing growing pains to say the very least."
good,You work long hours for the compensation. It is great for promotions when you want to succeed.  In a management position you are required to work long hours.  The bonus structure is great.
good,"Good company but growing pains are significant.  Supervisors sometimes completely out of touch with challenges of the employees they are supervising.  Procedure documentation often included errors and sometimes employees who followed this documentation were reprimanded incorrectly.  Staff and are generally"
good,I love the culture at Centene! Great place to work! Management is attentive and caring! I would definitely recommend this company to others. There is a chance for career advancement at Centene! They encourage and celebrate diversity at Centene!
good,"If you don't mind corporate culture and cubicle farms, then you may actually like it here. The whole job is spent on the phone and computer. It is a pleasant place to be overall, and has excellent compensation and benefits."
good,"Good associates to work with good start time, with onsite daycare if you have children.  On site cafeteria with excellent food.  Plenty of parking and easy to commute."
good,Good management over several Scrum teams. A large amount of work in the backlog for the next six months. Excellent developers and Quality Assurance personnel.
good,"Work life balance can be difficult for those with families. I have learned a great deal and can take what I’ve learned anywhere. If work life balance was better, I would stay."
good,"Very professional organization with tons of room for growth and new opportunities. My boss was great but unfortunately the woman I had to work with wanted to be the only star of the office and therefore made it difficult for me. This was an extremely unfriendly person but everyone else I encountered was very nice and professional. "
good,A very good company to work with. Compensation package and benefits @ Health Net are better than most companies. Great working condition and environment. There are bonuses and yearly increase commensurate to performance and also a lot of  company perks.  Loved this company and was very disappointed my position got eliminated (with others) due to company re-organization. I would surely comeback in a heartbeat and would highly recommend.
good,The compnay has a very nice clutire. They tr their best to keep the employees engaged. They do alot of fun activites for the employees. The company trys their best to follow its mission.
good,Several different classrooms ranging from young students suffering with emotional disturbance through young adults managing emotional and developmental disabilities working to gain occupational and life skills along with basic academic education.
good,"My time at Centene was positive overall. I was fortunate to have great managers and team mates. Like many other company of this size, there are operational issues that are not optimal, but proving yourself capable of delivering quality work on time will get you noticed and rewarded."
good,"I worked for the Centene for many years. It can be a tough and rewarding environment; however if your in a management level position and seeking advancement to leadership, the opportunities are not there or supported."
good,Pretty standard office work. Easy environment to work in and supported team building opportunities. I enjoyed the opportunity to work remotely for 3 out of 5 days a week.
good,"A competitive, fast-paced environment. Great people to work with and good benefits. Lots of meetings. Learned a lot at this company and always have opportunities to grow."
good,"Job requires a lot of time management. during the week as well as on weekends.  Job security because the work is definitely there, but extremely too much work for 1 person"
good,"I really enjoyed the opportunity to visit my members in their homes and attend doctor visits with them. I liked the ability to work independently. "
good,"Good place to work; fast paced, busy, constantly growing and changing.  Work place culture varies depending on leadership - it could be great, it could be awful."
good,Centene takes pride in innovation and technology. This is a great company to learn about Agile and IT. They have a lot of classes to teach new skills. There are a lot of opportunities to advance to another position after one year in your current role.
good,"Give benefits & eligibility, help them with what they were looking for with their health plan"
good,I learn a lot and hopeful be able to take what I have learn to a new place. I have learn to work spreadsheet process medical claims. As well if appeal criteria was met create a work. I learn send email and stay with communications
good,"If you are not afraid of hard work and sometimes disorganized work this is a great place for you.  While you will spend many hours putting out fires, there are times where the work that you do is rewarding and beneficial."
good,Centene is a great company. I have been with for a few years. I have learned a lot and used what I have learned to be a great asset to the company. I want to grow in the company but have lately been discouraged and feel stagnated. I am ready to use my full potential in a different position.
good,I enjoy my current position within Centene. I am able to make my own decisions and know that my managers/directors respect and trust me. Although there are a lot of meetings and some tricky situations the comfort of my co-workers always seems to help. I work with a great group of people!
good,"Here at Centene, you will be required to take in and recall multiple healthcare related systems, procedures, and overall medicare/medicaid knowledge. A great place to work!"
good,"I started out loving the job. Loved coming to work, and doing my job. Now every day is a struggle. There is room for advancement. Can learn lots of new things. I started as a member service rep (loved it) now I'm a provider service rep and I'm not liking it. The job requires a lot of research which I dont mind, but it can be very stressful on the providers side."
good,"The short time I was there, it appeared to be a lack of leadership in my dept. Manager was not very knowledgeable, gave bad information and did not take up for her team. This could have been a nice job if a different manager was managing."
good,"I loved working there, I don't think I would have been able to advance and I worked in 2 positions while there and that is why I don't feel I was compensated. But I was 1 of 3 chosen to stay until the last day my location was open so overall it was a great company and experience."
good,Great place to work to obtain vast amount of experience. Fast pace organization due to the continued growth. Geographically located across several states which allows opportunity to move to different state.
good,Great place to work if in right department . Friendly coworkers and good hours. No holidays or weekends. Sometimes good chance for overtime which is a help
good,"Working at Centene is a great experience. You learn alot , my current supervisor is an amazing person. Hardest part of the job I would say is the work process change every day and clarification on certain criteria. Its a learning process like every job but I love my job."
good,"Typical day at work, was very busy, crazy, but, lots of fun."
good,Great Job for Customer Service . This Company is great except for Advancement. I also enjoyed working for the management. Another thing that was great is the PTO.
good,Great pay and benefits. Workload can be very overwhelming and requires a great deal of  time management . Great environment and diverse culture. Good  Annual reviews result in pay increases. The hardest part is stress level can be high to the workload.
good,"I have been told one thing and this company has repeatedly done another concerning my personal relationship to the company.  The workload, etc. is a wonderful balance between work/home."
good,"Good management. Fast paced work environment doing Medicaid reviews. There were different teams such as home health, hospital, and social workers that had to work together to get the job done."
good,"Been with the company five years I have watched it grow.  I'm one of the few employees who started in the Tampa office.  I enjoy my job , benefits,  and pay."
good,Environment is conflicting but is mostly family oriented.  Great training program when I started - has gone downhill since.  Would love to work with that group again.
good,"Managing and supervising the clinical and non-clinical staff was a great experience.  The staff strived to find better and more efficient ways to provide patients the right care. "
good,Easy for the pay. Hardest part of the job contacting some of the members. Typical day is make 100 calls. Co-workers are great.
good,Case management for Medicaid patients. Performing assessments to determine level of acuity for new and existing members to the health plan. Providing members with resources; working with members to create a care plan.
good,Will gain large amount of experience; the company is good. It was located downtown but due to the expansion it has moved to I-10 & Beltway 8.
good,Good advancement opportunities. Progressive environment in some departments. Management is very dedicated and provides leadership for smaller state health plans.
good,Company provided several career opportunities within the business/operations and IT departments throughout my tenure.
good,"I have learned a lot of codes and different state guidelines, the hardest part of my job is not communication with the public."
good,a no nonsense company patient care driven- work diligently to be a beacon in its field
good,"Bilingual people only have a main title: Customer service."
good,Learned valuable managerial abilities. Completed my MBA. Lead multiple projects to research risk areas.  Developed and trained business and claim analyst course curriculum. 
good,"A typical day at work is usually faced paced, with several tasks that must be completed before deadlines. Management provides support in overseeing projects. Co-workers work coherently to ensure all team goals are met daily. I have excelled in my job, I enjoy a challenge; I would not consider any aspect of my job to be hard. The most enjoyable part of my job is the unpredictable aspect that comes along with the territory of working in the health care industry."
good,Centene Corporation has great benefits and excellent tuition reimbursement.
good,For the most part a good place to work. I would recommend them. I had many good bosses and i enjoyed what i did but the balance between work and family was not as good as i would have liked.
good,Centene is a company where you can climb the corporate ladder as long as you have the will to do so. So if you are a hard worker then Centene is the place for you.
good,"Due to the lack of communication between departments, I learned to put everything in writing. After a verbal conversation, I always followed up with an email and carbon copied all appropriate parties."
good,Good benefits and incentives for Employee.  Some management was not supportive of learning but overall was a good experience.  Learned to asked questions no matter how many and how long.
good,"You will be challenged every day, with operational success being the priority. The workplace is very diverse with people with various backgrounds and skillsets all coming together toward a common goal."
good,Centene is a great place to work and offers great work life balance.  The only problem is that their programs are based off of referrals and if referrals are low then your chances of being laid off are increased.
good,"I worked for centene as an RN for over 2 years. I really enjoy my job yes at times it's stressful ,  yes you may have to put in some long hours. I found the nurses to be very supportive of one another. I don't know any area of nursing that is not stressful. The members are such a wonderful part of the job. I feel like I'm paid very fairly."
good,"Competitive Pay and Monday through Friday.  Weekends Off.  Customer Service week, games and prizes. Have been employed since the company opened in Carbondale and the pay is good for the Carbondale area."
good,"I work  with a great team of agents and leaders. While it can be very challenging, we try and create a ""family"" culture to foster empowerment, growth and independence, while embracing your best self to deliver the best possible service!"
good,"Ability to learn quickly and implement policies / procedures according to company standards.  Strong communication skills.  Logical, common sense approach to resolving issues quickly."
good,"Like any company it has things to improve, overall great company! I would recommend this company to anyone and if a opportunity is open in another city I would pursue."
good,"This is a call center environment.  Management is supportive.  As a part of the Leadership Team, I appreciated the Manager's support.  Dress code is relax.. jeans and tennis shoes was implemented this year."
good,Not a great place to advance or grow. Leadership positions are more often hired from outside the company. This is a fast paced company and that makes it exciting and you have opportunities to gain experience but you most often have to leave and come back to get an opportunity to advance.
good,"This was a busy call center that demanded the best of me. Interacted with vendor, customer, health care professionals.  Had to use a multitude of software platforms."
good,"I loved the hours that were available for this job.  It was a perfect part-time position - that's what made it so hard when they let me go.  The lighting in the building was horrible to look at a computer screen all night.  My second attempt at the test was ""in my opinion"" really unfair.  My assistance, with hard to understand claims, was very limited.  They made me feel that any question that I asked was a inconvenience to them.  I've applied for numerous jobs with this company (part-time and full-time) and I've had to luck with anything."
good,Great company to get your feet wet while learning the ins and outs of corporate development.  Management did a great job making sure I was constantly learning and improving on my skills.
good,"Assisted members with claims, EOB’s, billing, advised of all benefit options and coverages, processed payments, filed appeals, Assisted members on Provider Search."
good,"this is a great company to work for, if they selected better people in leadership that would make a difference they are driven by numbers and less concerned with the success of their staff."
good,My team respects your work life balance and is great at flexibility.  I believe that most of the departments in the Tigard office are similar to mine.
good,I  had a  fantastic twelve years with centence.  I enjoyed the three positions I had from a Referral Specialist processing authorization  to Community Health Worker  going to members home providing education to help control healthcare  benefits.
good,"- managing service levels while ensuring agents meet their metrics"
good,An excellent place to work that encourages their employees to succeed.  Providing the tools necessary to be successful in the tasks given and open communication.
good,"high stress in call center low stress in the claims analysis dept. Benefit packages are good with good number of vacation, sick and holiday. Difficult to advance your career from an entry level position."
good,"had great supervisors.  "
good,Overall Centene is a great organization.I have grown tremedously as a professional. The company fosters an atmosphere for growth and advancement. They offer training to help employees get to where they want to go in life.
good,Centene is a good place to work. They offer many areas for advancement along with training simulations. The only draw back would be some of those placed in management are not fully qualified even with a degree.
good,"Fast paced environment "
good,Great people who care about you. Great benefits and culture also has a amazing leadership. They are spread all over the country so you can relocate if desired.
good,Nice people. Always busy and always changing. Company has grown a lot so many opportunities for advancement. Not able to work remotely. Need to be okay with changes and updates.
good,If you looking for a company with great pay and job advance within the company this would be your place to work.  Great paid time how and holidays off.
good,"A typical day starts with daily update on workload status, then review prior authorizations. I would approve or deny requests based on clinical judgement and insurance guidelines. I had just started training when the family emergency came up and had to leave. The workplace is quick paced and deadline oriented. I learned about time management on each case, and the use of Word and Excel to achieve the quality that each case deserves."
good,"Lots of room for advancement, great pay.  Management is average at best. "
good,"Centene is a great place to work. Fast paced and ton of room for advancement if willing to relocate. Philosophy is to act fast but convoluted management structure can be burdensome."
good,"This company is very focused on ROI using technology.  They move fast and without warning, and this is the scary part.  You never know what they're going to do."
good,"Nice organization to be employed. Great Benefits,Great Work life balance, Corporate Responsible, Tuition Reimbursement, and Needs Competitive pay among industry leaders"
good,When working in the office it can get bad. People always know when you're coming and going. That's annoying because we're all grown adults and don't need to be monitoring each other.
good,"Centene is a good company to work for.The compensation and benefits are awesome. The work environment is very laid back. The company is all about productivity, so you cannot be unmotivated and work here. The hardest part of the job sometimes is attempting to meet the expectations of the individual managers, as sometimes the expectations are not feasible."
good,"Again, great company to work for and would recommend anyone.  The company takes a lot of pride in the services they provide and in taking care of their employees."
good,"I worked in a very busy call center environment. I learned a lot about insurance coverage and assisting Medicaid and HIP members via the phone system. I loved my co-workers. We had a great team. The hardest part of this job was maintaining a 3 minute per call average. It gave me satisfaction to assist the members. I also worked two years there as a Data Entry Specialist. I really enjoyed this work, because after 7 years on the phones I needed a change."
good,The hardest part of the culture is work life balance.  Leadership does not like flexibility with the work hours. Insistent on 8-5.
good,Great company.  It is being ran by an awesome CEO.  The company is continuing to grow.  It will continue to be successful. The company will be around for a long time and will continue to be a great company. If you want to work in Managed care Centene is a great company to work for.
good,I love working for Centene. The people make the work place fun. The people are a close net family. We do health insurance for the federal market place. I am the billing supervisor in customer service.
good,"Great place to work, great hours, very accommodating to its employees, ongoing training environment, management is great, co-workers are very supportive always sharing ideas"
good,"Massive growth in healthcare nationwide.  Company starting to go International.  Top 200 of Fortune 500 Companies in the U.S.  Over 14,000 employees in over 20 states."
good,"Centene shows that it cares about employees by responding to feedback.  At a company meeting, an employee asked for a walking path, the CEO responded, right then, that he'd make it happen.  It has been an enjoyable and well-used path.  Adjustable work stations are another improvement, in response to employee request."
good,A typical day included coming in sitting in a cubical and start verifying information and some point of the day there would be a teammeeting to communicate any new changes.
good,"Typical day consists of putting out fires on a regular basis.  My manager is the sweetest person on the planet, but lacks some management skills.  The team at Centene is great.  They are all willing to help out when the need arises."
good,"Production and Quality first"
good,Centene is not for the meek. Excellent opportunity for growth if you are willing to relocate for opportunities.
good,Centene is focused on supporting all employees as far as they want and are able to go. Much effort is made to recognize everyone's achievements and tenure. Everyone is treated with respect and equally and encouraged to perform well. Bonuses are generous as is the compensation package. I learned a lot from my experience with Centene and made some wonderful friends and connections.
good,Great place to work. people are helpful and understanding. Departments work well together.
good,"The company is great to work for and has great benefits, however management can be very micromanaging. Specially when hire ups have been w/ the company for a long time, its their or or the highway."
good,It was great working with them and my team was really good. Experience I gained is useful. That is the place where we can learn a lot. we can play fun games sometimes.
good,Have made some lifelong friends in my time at Centene. The company is growing and merging with other companies at a rapid pace. Starting to out-source a lot of the IT positions.
good,"Process written customer correspondence and provide the appropriate level of timely follow up"
good,"I love my job and have been able to utilize years of culminated skills and management practices to be a very successful fraud, waste and abuse investigator/auditor. I have excellent rapport with many key players at that heath plan that proves very beneficial in my work and assigned tasks."
good,"Excellent place to work and learn about healthcare operations and growth/change.  Continual growth and integration with new acquisitions."
good,Good work environment and good work place. Always helpful through work life balance. Travel was paid for. Enjoyed my time there and my manager was good for the time
good,Centene provided an atmosphere of accountability.  They held high expectations of performance.  Overall I think they were realistic targets and I never had trouble meeting them.
good,"I was fortunate to have an amazing leader who pushed you to strive for your best. She made it worthwhile. The pay is pretty good, it could be a little better. The company stands for something great. They want to give back to the community and make it a better place. They have great ideas but upper management and people that do the everyday jobs need to do a better job at communicating. It is a great place to work at though."
good,Great Company competitive wages room for growth opportunities great life and work balance Management has an open door policy are fair and eager to help
good,"Overall I have enjoyed my time there I feel that the IT infrastructure is something to be desired. "
good,"Work is work, sometimes hard to get PTO approved, depends on the dept you are in but other than that everything is cool. I learned a lot, pay should be more for the type of work and time."
good,learned how to lead a scrum team and work in an agile environment.  I learned how to meet objectives within an IT scrum team and to be a servant leaded
good,"Excellent place to work, great benefits  starting day one. Orientation was great. Great working condition. Employees help each other and work as a true team"
good,I worked as a claim analyst. I learned to adjudicate claims the system could not. Management was very responsive to field concerns/issues. Multicultural facility and family oriented company that was involved with community activities. Hardest part of job was finding a spot to sit as there was desk sharing. Most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things often making us more useful to the company. We learned to process almost all claim types in less than 9 months.
good,"In the claims department, there is a high volume of claim to process  and they need to be processes with accuracy. They celebrate the employees on a regular basis.  There are annual bonuses."
good,I think it is a good place to work. Nice people. It is a very fast paced enviroment. If you are ambitious it may or may not be the place for you. You will need to be patient to move up in the company.
good,"A place that likes to promote from within.  If you're willing to work hard, there are opportunities for promotion.  They understand that not everyone has the time to leave the building at lunch time; the cafeteria offers a wide variety of food"
good,No comment nice job poor management. Field based in nursing facility. Excellent benefits you usually work more than 40 hours a week. Very stressfull working on spread sheets
good,This company was a good place to grow your career.  You had the opportunity to learn additional job duties as well as others around the nation.  I would recommend Centene.
good,It has been a good experience so far. It has a good work culture and fun management. Work life balance can be the hardest obstacle. Co workers are willing to help.
good,"I worked here so long ago, I don't really remember exactly what a typical day at work was like. I have no cons that I can remember about withing there."
good,"Centene is a great company with many opportunities if you apply yourself and work hard. I work at one of the many subsidiary offices Centene Corporation has in Bedford, NH, New Hampshire Healthy Families. The management and people there are great and the company is still growing which means opportunities for advancement. With many locations around the US it's a chance for you to even relocate if that is something you would like to do."
good,Very stressful.  Amount of documentation exceeds ability to provide care coordination.  It appears to be due to AHCA requirements.  Must be able to volunteer for extra duties to qualify for promotion
good,"Pay and benefits are good. The flex lunch and shift schedules are amazing. I like that I have a lot of freedom, I'm not micromanaged, I have my own cubicle and I could listen to music or podcasts while I work. The only thing I could say I don't really like is the inconsistency in work projects and spreadsheets. Seems like no one really knows the answer to anything which could be frustrating but it doesn't bother me too much to say this is a bad job. However favoritism is obvious and some of the people that got promotions to Team Lead or Supervisor Positions surely did not deserve it with their track record on how they treat others. Can feel like High School at times but if you just do your job and mind your own, you will love this place!"
good,The evolution of the company has been rapid and very structured.  They are technically advanced and truly cares about the health of it's members.  My days are generally very involved and interesting.  The best part of my job is solving problems and helping people.
good,This job will keep you busy as you try to meet your production everyday. The training could be better. Management is good and tries to keep up with you on how you are improving and working towards your goal.
good,the job is cool for an internship. the job culture was just too uptight for me. im not sure if I would actually recommend it though. management is flexible
good,"Growing  Company. Great opportunity for Growth and personal development. This company help me to develop as a health care leader ."
good,It is a great company to work for. Really beneficial for individuals fresh out of college to get their foot in the door and gain professional experience.
good,"Friendly and fun place. "
good,"Its a good place to work, lots of growth opportunities. I appreciated my supervisor and senior management. It has several locations and is competitive pay."
good,"I enjoyed working for Centene Corporation. They have an excellent leadership team and promote growth in your job.  They train you for your position and you will receive continued training to excel in your position or transfer to another department."
good,every day is new with new innovative team ready to blow your mind. patient management team with exemplary leadership. workplace culture is very family oriented and purpose driven
good,Productive and fun place to work. Training was always available and promotion too. Centene had exciting project for you to learn and grow with the company.
good,"I don't feel I was in the role long enough to say too much, and part of that was lack of advancement there for me. But overall I enjoyed my co-workers and my direct manager. I felt that the training for the job itself could have been more comprehensive, but my team was able to help me learn if I had questions. The building was nice, good facilities, adequate pay for the job."
good,"Although, my time was short with Centene, it did prove to be a quiet and productive environment.  The environment allowed minimum interaction with coworkers because everyone was involved with their work."
good,"I enjoyed working for the company and helping others in the community. This job was understanding of your personal life and the work-life balance was awesome. They didn't focus on petty things, only getting the job done right."
good,Get to know your co worker and management.stay focus and you can leave your can relocation within the company.I was there for 4 years wish it could have been longer.
good,"Contributed to daily stand-up meetings, contributed ideas with 6 other colleagues and volunteered to take on tasks surrounding JIRA.Gained experience working in an Agile environment while multitasking on a daily basis. Involved in extensive training with JIRA and gained hands-on experience with JBOSS including debugging and making corrections on the code. Successfully worked with senior level and mid-level team members to achieve common goals within Centene’s PEGA team. Gained experience with development within MicroStrategy to help create visual aids for Centene Executives and stakeholders"
good,The organization if fair. There are plenty of growth opportunities you just need to work hard.  There is opportunity to work directly with the health plans and you work closely with other teams.
good,Fun place to work. Great management. Opportunity for growth. Considerable amount of work life balance and decent pay. The salary could be better and promotion from within would make it more enjoyable.
good,Really helped me to interact with people friendly. And gained knowledge. I completely satisfied with the work environment and enjoyed performing the tasks they assign.
good,"Check email"
good,I had good training and opportunity to work in modern languages and tools. I had a good development experience and encouraged training and development. Sometimes new management and managers and some people who are with Centene with long time seemed to show some negativity towards you and probably they were feeling envious of new hires getting paid same or higher than them.
good,"Centene is a great corporation to work for.  If you are goal oriented , focus on why you’re there and what you want to accomplish in your own career. You will do great.  If you have self awareness and understanding of business and corporate America you will survive in the company.  I work in  case management department it can be stressful at times due to the work load and the constant demand of supervisors. . But overall it’s manageable.  The best advice I can give anyone that’s looking to work for Centene is to stay focus  on why you come to work and what you want to gain.  Be friendly and respectful to everyone you come across.  Because  you never know who is who. Or who may be in a position to promote you."
good,"Working for Centene, Inc. has given me the opportunity to grow in the leadership skills and learn new skills. . "
good,The company overall is great. Based on department can be clique oriented. Great pay and benefits! HR Is great about payroll questions and short term disability. There is a family feel to this company.
good,"Good place to work, fun environment, good staff with emphasis on team work. Technical field with emphasis on patient care. Rewarding work with reward and recognition."
good,"Prior to the purchase of Health Net by Centene Corporation, I really enjoyed working for Health Net.  They were very good to their employees and paid well."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is contributing to the quality of life for the members served, in addition, to employee engagement efforts.  This company offers multiple initiatives to drive the member's' care, to ensure the member's selects their preferred choice of living, as well as ensuring they have access to resources."
good,"Working at Centene is challenging most days to very challenging occasionally. I was constantly learning new aspects of the job and technologies. Management was always courteous and provided sufficient latitude to get the job done. Co-workers were very friendly and only occasionally were they any conflicts that resulted in disruptions in the workplace. The hardest part of the job always was learning new technologies, but the most enjoyable was when you understood said technologies and got them to work for what you needed to accomplish."
good,"The actual ""job"" as a Service Coordinator was not hard, but the paperwork and travel are time consuming. Would recommend the job to someone that has flexibility. I had children so traveling 3-4 hours away from them was difficult. Some nurses travelled further. I did enjoy the days I was able to work from home. I travelled 3 days and stayed home 2 every week."
good,its ok working for Centene. As a claim analyst I would change going into the office to work at home. We dont need to work in the office to do what we do. It would be so much easier to work from home especially since the degrees go up to 123 in the summer
good,"Arrive at work set up my station. Check out all the work that needs to be scheduled for the day. Assure everyone has work to do. Once completed, time flies by."
good,"Working fairly at this place and work every day, there will be some overtime work, relaxed work experience , all colleges are nice and manager is very nice to us too"
good,"It was a decent environment to work.  I enjoyed the working conditions and would return to this company. I was laid off. "
good,good company: what I learned is the ability to read and understand on how to view a claim for healthcare . and the ability to read schedule benefits on members healthcare.
good,High turnover but ok place to work.  Management needs to learn the job or at least know the basics of the job their employees have.  Pay could be a little bit better
good,"Nothing of note to mention, just a regular company with regular salary and benefits. Management can be aloof, at times you feel like you're on your own."
good,I obtained the position of a Program Specialist through a temporary agency.  The position allowed me to work with the clients over the phone and assist them with services and provide information that they were not aware. It was a pleasant place to work at and the management was very knowledgeable and hands on.
good,"I was able to learn a lot of client care and building a relationship with each so that I could better assist them in their multiple needs.  Out in the field I was better able to see what factors may play a part in the clients needs.  If they needed transportation, to appointments or finding another primary care provider and many other situations I as there to assist them."
good,Rewarding and Challenging. Pleasant and quiet environment. Wasn't micromanaged. Listened to music while you worked. The job was very resourceful and I liked my co-workers.
good,"overall pretty good, great job. If I had the opportunity I would work there again. I loved my co workers and my managers. I enjoyed my work environment as well."
good,Prominent health plan in the Los Angeles area reaching populations in the most need of quality healthcare delivery. I learned a lot about healthcare management.
good,This job has been pretty rewarding. I get to coach almost all day and provide education to members who really need help managing their disease. Lately the company has been showing more interest in hearing what employees have to say and now the culture is a bit more supportive and managers are not micromanaging so much. This change has been good.
good,"I work remotely from  home typical day morning  meeting  and start  to work  task  load  or  case  load  may  be  manageable  may  not driven  by  member  hospital  admissions  very much  driven  by  TAT(Turn around  Time) guidelines  really  need to  be able  to  time manage and multi  task  also  must be  up for  challenges  day  to  day with  member's also must  be  up  for  challenges for  process changes  often. The  Culture  is  diverse and my  current  management team is  awesome. What I enjoy  is  having a  manger and the team i work on  we are  a team we support each  other with  work load & our  Supervisor is  open  for  suggestions,  a  great listener and  a problem  solver rather  than  just do  it type  manager. the  hardest is  adjusting  to  changes  that have  not  been  fully  thought out  prior to  delegation of  doing the process  but  this is  part of change  ironing out the kinks."
good,"Work from home - working with NH,ALF and home member's to ensure they are receiving proper services,"
good,"Great place to work! Benefits great, management is good. Paid time off good. Employees easy to get along with well rounded diverse group of people."
good,When i work there they were a great company to work for great. Benefits and people to be around. Everyone helped one another to be better so that the company was better
good,"It looks Centene is going through a big growth through acquisition especially after Centene acquired Health Net in 2016."
good,"Corporate Office in St. Louis, Missouri.  Lots of change being implemented. New opportunities to learn. Corporate pretty hands- off, but culture not the same as classic CA."
good,"Very rapidly growing company with great potentials. The growth rate necessarily results in some growing pains, but all said, it is a good place to make a mark and advance quickly."
good,"Centene continues to stay ahead of the game in healthcare.  The salary was not what I expected, but I think they try to compensate for it in company benefits.  I would work for them again if given the opportunity, in another capacity and higher salary."
good,Good place to work. Good opportunities. Experience with different leadership throughout company all good. Would recommend working here. Good culture
good,"They have dojos, like we need to work on developing and design code on games and other stuff based what the team choose. They really invite new employees to participate in coding."
good,This is a great company to work for. It has a lot of growth especially for someone trying to be a part of the healthcare industry.
good,"Productive and fun work place."
good,"Excelent place to workd for have learned a lot,gym is very good great comunication,  cafeteria alway clean,  but needing more money."
good,I thhink it's a great company to work for. it's a lot of growth within the company and great people to work with. THe staff around are always helpful and have a lot of knowledge of the medica lfeild.

good,"I am very new, but if you are looking to be with an organization that is growing fast, hires from within, and pays there employees well Centene is the place to be!  The new Chicago( Loop), IL office is BEAUTIFUL!"
good,"I really miss this position, it's a great place to work.  They pay very well but watch...if you are a healthy...they will feed you all the time lol."
good,I learned the process on how decisions are made using case management and coordination to meet member needs. My co-workers were helpful and was willing to assist if needed. Hardest part of my work was to deny services when services were not needed and having to justify it for member even when they didn't agree with decisions made by Service Coordinator.
good,"This is a very good company to work for. It is growing quickly and lots of opportunities ahead. Each department has its challenges but overall not too bad."
good,"This is an excellent company that has shown aggressive but sensible growth in their field of medical claims processing/insurance products."
good,"Great plan, but unfortunately it did not work out in the state of Kentuky.  Has a great workplace culture and excellent employees.  "
good,"Great group of co workers, good location, great benefits.  Great services provided to members, community and employees.  Overall opportunity available."
good,"Started work at Foundation Health in 1997 as a Production Support Analyst.  Two years later, my role changed to a Jr. Oracle Database Administrator when the company bought Healthnet Inc.  I worked for the next eighteen years and found my way as a member on the CTO team as the Oracle Database Architect in 2009.  Once we were bought by Centene in early 2017 my role changed to Lead Oracle Database Administrator."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Centene and wouldn't have any qualms about going back. The work culture is a bit rigid at times, but you can't truly complain with results. If I had any complaint about the company it would be that sometimes its easy to feel overlooked for your hard work.  The company does however invest into building the skill set of its employees."
good,"Great place to work, my only complaint was my compensation. I have more than 10 years of being in healthcare and really felt like I couldn't negotiate my pay/worth."
good,"Centene in Illinois was a start up company,  it was an OK company. The mangers were nice, the people were like a happy family,  you really enjoyed coming to work."
good,Professional dress was always recommened. You could dress down on Fridays. Allowed for growth and development. Supported you with continuing education. Great pay and Benefits. Office location downtown so able to walk and view the city.
good,Some days were more stressful than others but management and team work made the dream work! Very pleased with the company overall. I had a great manager that did not micromanage me!
good,"great bennefits, great company to work for. they make you feel valued. lots of pluses, lots of rewards. new office. comfortable environment. would love to retire from here"
good,Company provides great benefits. You start with close to 3 weeks PTO and sick leave. hours are flexible as long as you meet the 8 hour requirement. Flexible lunch hours as well.
good,"centene has got good workplace culture andi learned many things. i learned how to manage my work .the ceo is very encouraging.i enjoyed every day at m,y office ."
good,"Good place to work. Job advancement, great salary. Ability to work in just about any state within the U.S. Variety of career fields to choose from within the organization."
good,I enjoyed my career with Centene but things became a little unsettling when the acquisition of another company occurred. Overall it was a good experience.
good,"Centene Corporation enforced high quality work standards.  Professional conduct was mandatory.  They provided a three week intensive training program which I had to pass to move out to my own terminal to process claims for Medicare and Medicaid.  They had their own onsite human resources director who oversaw all employee's daily conduct, quality of processing claims, and instilling proper dress code and professional conduct.  The most difficult part of working there was maintaining quality while processing a certain amount of claims per hour.  I loved working on the coordination of benefits team as each claim I processed, depending on which state plan I was working in that day, brought a variety of scenarios.  The part that I most enjoyed was that each employee was held accountable if they showed up in improper attire, conducted themselves in an unprofessional manner, or were abusing company break policies.  The human resources director would call individuals in, talked to them, and even sent home to change their clothing if they had violated business casual standards."
good,The hardest part about the job is that you have to stay in the queue at all times. It can be stressful when the calls are at 100% but overall my manager was great along with my team and lead
good,"My day starts with me checking my email for any urgent tasks, then prepare for our management meeting to take notes and follow up on any action items. The remainder of the day will vary according to the needs of the agents and the management team."
good,customer service duties over the phone. Reviewing claims and resolving issues with providers. Checking eligibility and benefit information. Going over pre auth check tools. Typical customer services position
good,"I learned how to review claims and and get them paid/denied.  The work processes need a lot of updating.  It is a fast paced job, I was able to listen to my headphones while I worked."
good,"Overall its a great company to work for just  did not like the hours, i have children and getting home late makes things a bit harder. Leads and Supervisors are super friendly and very helpful"
good,Very laid atmosphere. Good work culture. Great bonus potential. Educational opportunities. Leadership went out of there way to get answers for you when needed.
good,Great working place.  Management communication was great.  Always held weekly and quarterly meeting for all updates and projects.  Love working with team.
good,I really enjoyed the fast paced work environment at Centene Corporation; and I have family members who are still working for this amazing company.  I would highly recommend as a place of employment to others.
good,"Typical day working for Centene: Answering incoming calls from medicaid, affordable care act and medicare providers, in regard to claim payments, benefits and eligibility.  Responsible for team lead duties."
good,"Great place to work. Good management. Great benefits. Worked there for almost 1 year so far and had a great experience, the job itself is not hard and the schedules are great."
good,"Management was very supportive and engaged in employee growth and retention.  On site education was easily available."
good,"I've worked for some of the big names in US health insurance, and this is by far the best.  I work in Indiana, for a smaller Centene company and have few complaints. "
good,"Good company and culture.  Mission is clearly established, work is rewarding.  My area is really quiet like a library but can be fun at times.  Most folks are head down and just work.  Management has been changing a lot lately which has caused some instability, along with a new major acquisition to implement.  Many broken or weird processes, lots of opportunity to improve which is cool but hard to know where to begin sometimes, can seem overwhelming."
good,Great company to work for. I gained a more detailed knowledge of the health insurance industry and how it relates to all populations. All employees work as a team to service our customers and ensure their success. Most enjoyable part of the job is that it is different everyday as well as very challenging. The position requires a great deal of problem solving skills.
good,"Rewarded for going the extra mile here. A great place to work for those that are willing to put in the extra work in order to be rewarded. Fast pace, growth, leads to opportunities."
good,"Great compensation. Learning environment in which you see the direct impact you have on your members."
good,"We have to work hard to meet our daily quota (varies with tittle) and that can be stressful, but considering that this is a new program the productivity and expectations can be a little overwhelming.  The management team seems to care for their team members/associates and always encourage to have a work/life balance. The hardest part of the job is that it is stationary. I was not used to being in front of a computer for 8 hours a day, But we are encouraged to take breaks to release some of the tension. Overall it's a nice environment to be in."
good,"A typical day at Centene is fast paced and engaging. Truly, I have enhanced my team dynamics, managerial, and people skills.  Everyone is close knitted and we really need each other to accomplish and meet our daily goals.  We have a very tough population to serve, but overall, the compassion of the people is the best part of this job."
good,"Love the people and job environment"
good,"Answer providers questions about everything, everyday is something new, managers and coworkers are friendly, nothing really too hard most enjoyable part of the day is going home."
good,A progressive and rapid moving/expanding healthcare delivery system attuned to the Medicaid populations.
good,"Productive and competitve place to work.  Company b"
good,"Very though training program. Instructors were very good, answered all questions. Primarily a Medicare D company, worked closely with CMS regulations.  Worked with 13 regions in the US."
good,"Loved the job, the team, but just not the location. Typical day of work is running reports, communicating with co-workers, and attending daily meetings."
good,"The benefits here are fantastic, even more so if you're based in their HQ city (free doctor to go to, etc). But let's get down to the work itself. I suppose it depends on what group you're in but in MY group the work/life balance (right now) is trash. The reason is we're understaffed (however, we just hired more people but they still need to be trained so it's going to be awhile). I like my managers, I have no issues with them at all. But the reason we're understaffed is because Centene is growing so quickly, the work load keeps increasing but the staffing stays the same. This doesn't work. My group has an insane amount of work, I'd say I personally have 45 small projects on my own right now with around 5 real large ones. Some days I can't get anything done b/c the day is spent in meetings. I have very little downtime at work, I'm constantly working non-stop (which is why I work 8hrs & don't take a lunch) with very little time to decompress. Going on vacation almost seems like a punishment b/c when you return you have to spend close to a week to sift through the emails & catch-up on all of your projects: You can't hand them off to your teammates when you're out b/c their workload is just as big as yours so they don't have any time. I could work 12hrs a day & still have things to do. Until the new hires are caught up, it's going to remain hectic but I applaud Centene for finally adding more staff to the group: it just shouldn't have had to take 1 year to do it (which by this time everyone was talking about leaving). I believe that the work load & stress level is going to change"
good,Great employer would definitly go back and refer anyone their to work enviroment is very nice upper mangerment is great also has great benfits to offer
good,Centene is an excellent company to work for. Culture is great Arkansas total care is dedicated to members and families. Job security is great. Management is very knowledgeable.
good,"I love my job! Management is great, pay is excellent for my career, weekly phone supervision, bonding with colleagues is encouraged, and training is mandatory!"
good,"A truly fast paced corporate environment. This company is great if you can free think, drive change and work fast. This can be a high pressure work place but that is what I was looking for."
good,"Managers and Business analysts are very helpful that helps us to achieve the sprint goals effectively. I enjoyed my time in Centene. "
good,I was a temp to hire which didn't pan out. I was let go after my assignment ended. The job training is 7 weeks of in the classroom. Attendance is mandatory and working through a illness is sketchy. Absences are not recommended.
good,"I enjoyed working there for 12 years. They company strives to listen to employees, keep up with innovative ideas, and to do what's right.  I've seen many changes and it's all for the best of the business - the mission."
good,"really good place to work, centene worried about there workers needs and help us grow in other departments. they have great benefits and offer good time off"
good,Team dynamic from department to department varied. Internal processes couldn't keep up with enormous growth. Acquired companies took over Corporate and would continue to run on their own without Corporate approval.
good,"As nice as it is to work at Centene, its the type of job that is hard to advance. Ive seen most people stay at their current role for years with no indications to advance."
good,I worked as a Care Coordinator for a division that got eliminated.  It was the best job I ever had.  I had a very supportive management staff that did not micromanage and allowed creativity.  I was heartbroken that the job ended.
good,Fun work place with supportive management.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with my colleagues and learning from them.  The company is growing at a fast pace.
good,Days are productive on a consistent basis.  I really enjoyed the supervisors and their willingness to assist employees.  My coworkers were nice.  The hardest part of the job was not being challenged intellectually.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working on a Team.
good,"A typical day is busy and always something to do."
good,"Medical claim processing"
good,I  enjoyed my time at Centene. My co-workers were great and made coming into work worthwhile. There is a lot of room for advancement within the company and the cafeteria was amazing!
good,I have been at Centene for over a year and they have treated me well. I have enjoyed my time at the company thus far and they will give you the tools needed to succeed.
good,"I really enjoy working at centene, the leads are super helpful and available at any time that you need them. you have a lot of schedule variety. The only this is that they don't have regular schedule times foe example 8 am- 5 pm."
good,"Work in an agile scrum team, meeting with product owner and other teammates daily, working in 2 week sprints to accomplish our goals. "
good,Temporary employment.. great company.. great work environments. great staff and management.. overall great company to work for..................................................
good,"Need to improve training, resource portal and support group. Aside from that, Centene is a great company! My work give me flexibility and the right amount of interaction with co-workers, clients and manager. I have the time to work on my own pace and with easy access to mentors."
good,Awesome place to work. Hate that due to unfortunate circumstances I had to leave. Management very knowledgeable and well trained. Had to travel for training which was fine but slightly extensive. You feel adequately equipped for you job after training which is priceless.
good,"It challenges you to grow"
good,"Great company to work for."
good,"I have been working at Centene Corporation for approximately 1 yr, and love it. The company is goal driven and fast paced. However, the employees are provided with the tools needed to succeed in their jobs. The leadership team, Managers/Supervisors, are very nice and supportive. They treat all of the employees with dignity and respect; and they provide fun activities to boost employee morale. The workload can be heavy at times, and unexpected tasks and projects with deadlines may be added to your day. But, prioritizing your work will help you get through the most difficult day."
good,"It wasn't for me and didn't play to my strengths.  There is an excessive amount of computer navigation in my opinion for the pay.  This company uses several software applications and also requires lots of other state and independent guides and references you must check in order to do your job right,  I just didn't like it."
good,It was a great place to work and there were opportunities for advancement.  There was an on-site cafeteria with a wonderful food selection and reasonable prices.
good,"There is room for advancement hard work and dedication is all it takes, how far you go is solely up to you. Managers are great. Dual screens, enough room in desk area."
good,"Work with go workers in solving problems connected with the conversion to another companies processing system."
good,No complaints. Definitely a company worth working for. Ever job has its challenges; however this company treats their employees very well. If you apply yourself you have endless opportunity to excel.
good,The benefits are amazing and my bosses are great. Centenne really knows how to take care of their employees and show their appreciation to them. It s not perfect and I believe communication can be better in some aspects but no place is perfect. I really do enjoy my job and I m very grateful for the excellant benefits!
good,I really like my job! Had a hard time I'm the beginning but now very satisfied. The pay and benefits are excellent!

good,"Ive worked for Centene since 2016. I work in their Medicare Medicaid department.  Pros:Love Getting to know my members which assist with the implementation of case management and improve health outcomes. The team i work with are awesome.  They're always willing help, we encourage one another daily and use each other as reliable resources ."
good,"I felt good about the position and loved the team that I worked with.  My management team listened and were helpful and promoted self-efficacy.  There are many positions to move into and many management opportunities.  Still felt I was helping people, even though in a corporate environment.  It was neat to watch the innovation being promoted in behavioral health sector in order to reach people who otherwise could not be reached.  However, with any corporate job, sometimes the focus could be too heavy on numbers and quotas, instead of quality and thoroughness, so it is a balancing act of meeting the job requirements while meeting the needs of the members/clients."
good,"Great company. with great benefits. I had a great experience working with Centene Corporation. They treat their employees very well and fairly. I would to work with them again,"
good,"Management look out for there employees, and great place to advance. They're overall company culture makes you feel like a family, and someone is always there to help."

good,"Centene is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a career in healthcare. Their mission, values and strategic focus is unparalleled in the health care industry."
good,"Things change on a day to day basics.  I was able to attend different superior training, working with different attitudes and learning that a great personality is a win every time."
good,"Great company overall,the subsidiary is not as great. The corporation benefits and diversity are impressive. but it does not trickle down to the subsidiary I work for"
good,"Centene is a fast paced environment, and it gives great experience.  The training is excellent, and the only negative is the hard deadlines that have to be met."
good,"I really enjoy working for the company and have great peers and coworkers. The compensation package is great.  I have met a lot of unique people both co workers and members I have served.  Deadlines can be stressful,  but time management and organizational skills are crucial for success.  I have had little difficulty with I.T. and have had great Supervisors who schedule one to one as well as weekly meetings to keep the team up to date."
good,"I thought Cetenne was great place to work at I was comfortable there"
good,this company is okay i do not really recommended it because the pay is not all that great and the management could definitely be a little more considerate
good,Centene Corporation is a professionally managed company with highly talented people as my team members. I am enjoying the work culture and the latest technologies.
good,Centene was a great place to work for. They truly respect their employees and show them they are appreciated. I would go back to this organization tomorrow if I could.
good,"Great Environment to work"
good,"CC is a great company to work for, but if you become good at your job it appears to be a punishment not a reward. The people that I had the opportunity to work with are so kind and giving. I love the atmosphere among the working level people."
good,"As a claims analyst, I was able to review pending health insurance claims to see if they qualified for approval or needed to be denied. There was a very thorough training provided. My supervisor and manager were very nice to work with."
good,"Overall my experience was outstanding. Always room for advancement. Benefits was excellent and the environment truly friendly and professional. Paid vacation, paid time off and personal/sick days were also provided."

good,I loved the job itself and company has great benefits. The atmosphere is fairly nice. Like any company there are ups and downs but you have more ups .
good,Centene is great place to come work and grow and go to the next level. You are able to progress easily once you master one area. I was promoted after a year.
good,My current position isn't really that challenging and there's a huge gap when it comes to training on actual daily functions and processes. Centene does promote from within but my expectations from my initial interview about the job are a mis-match. Overall it's a good place to work
good,working here form last 1 year !  its going good right now. working as tibco developer. work environment is really good for experience and new candidate .

good,Centene as an organization whole is an awesome place to work. I have been with organization for approximately 5 years and the growth has been exponential.
good,Typical day is such that I process claims for 8 hrs. a day at a production level of about 60 to 80 claims. I am able to listen to music pre-downloaded on my phone to pass the time and read during breaks.
good,Very nice place I was allowed to utilize what I knew and learn and given the opportunity to try new things; unfortunately I was there on a temporary assignment.....
good,"I work for the corporate side of the business and unfortunately, it's disorganized. Our systems are not up to par with the amount of business we currently manage. It makes our everyday ""busy work"" very stressful."
good,I work in a call center. I enjoy being able to help others. I have learned that any one of could become in need of extra help on any given day do to unforeseen circumstances.

good,It is a great company to work for. Excellent vision and great group of leaders. They take good care of their employees.
good,fast paced typical day at the Georgia service center. informing customers on Medicaid information and prescription fills and refills.

good,Great place to work I would like more career advancement that is why I am looking for a new job. However my supervisor wanted to see me succeed and I appreciated that.
good,Not a bad place to work the people are fun to be around and the activities and moral are good. Hardest part of the job is working under a supervisor that is still trying to figure things out.
good,"It's a shame how management treats their employees. Centene reputation is going down, people recommend others but just the abuse and neglecting towards employees it says a lot about the company. The company is great but management also need professional skills and other classes to keep themselves professional. No growth and employees can say anything because management give threats to their employees. Too much favoritism, a high school reunion instead of a professional environment. Management thinks they are superior than others  and no respect. They want people to fear them and for no one to speak back. They think they are always right, if you say something they won't like you at all."
good,"This place was very good to work for. Great environment. Professional leadership. Lots of company provided lunches and snacks and fun, competitive games and activities during down times. Permanent, decorative cubicles. Culture was very friendly and inclusive. Hardest part of job was lack of additional training when requested outside of y-jacking with coworkers. Most enjoyable part of job is place was very clean and spacious. Work acknowledged and concerns generally were immediately addressed or rectified outside of additional classroom training. Great pay and excellent benefit packages."
good,A typical day at work would be logging into the agent web station to begin receiving calls. I learned more detailed information on the pros and cons of insurance. The supervisors overall were nice but some unprofessional. The hardest part of the job was not being able to be help the members decide what was best for them being that we knew the ins and out. The most enjoyable part of my job was customer interaction.
good,"It is a fun place to work. Over the years, I have made many friends here. I enjoy working with people that are considerate and provide support, in order to achieve work-life balance."

good,"You know what is expected of you on a typical day of work.  I was provided any materials, references and assistance needed to perform my job.  Management was supportive.  The co-workers were great and easy to work with.  The hardest part of the job is being solid in your decision making and ensuring that your reports understand that you are working with and for them, not against them.  The most enjoyable part was the flexibility of the job.  To be able to make decisions about your priorities and how to meet your goals."

good,Great place to work at. Great pay and benefits. Hard working people at the Corpus Christi office.
good,Centene is a great company to work for. Tons of positions here in St. Louis but also around the US. Depending on what you do the job can get very repetitive and boring.
good,If you can get past dealing with certain types of people and focus on your work you can be successful. Job advancement is great with plenty of options to choose from.
good,"everyone was welcome,   The job interview process was easy the job itself the duties are in self-explanatory and opportunity to grow .   I would recommend this company to other career seekerS"
good,The work place is fund and very laid back the pay is good and you have room to grown. The insurance for the healthcare is good as well. I would keep working hear.
good,I loved working at Centene and their management are top-notched and very fair.  The training is a bit lacking as the firm is going through transition after taking on another healthcare company and incorporating different practices in Claims Examination.
good,Overall CENTENE as a Corp is a great company to work for. I have learned a lot about the Health Indistry. I love the CENTENE Intranet and the way they keep their employees updated. The work processes are really great. The only negative about this Company is that they micro manage the employees like like 2nd Graders
good,Check daily calendar for scheduled visits/changes. Learned teamwork Is greatly valued and autonomy is a must.  Management always willing to help and goes above and beyond to help where they can.  Hardest part of the job was the one day turn around for all paperwork and the two hour drives for member visits occasionally.  The most enjoyable part of this job is being able to work from home 2 days a week.
good,"This is a fast paced enjoyable place to work.  I never had a complaint on the way the company treats its employees.  Just in the last 6 months we had a complete Management change and this cause the department to decrease in morality and loose it drive.  Many people have left and others are unrecognized.  Outside of this particular situation, I would recommend this company over all."
good,"Great place to work wonderful staff."
good,Do not wish to express my opinion at this time.  Very little support from management.  No interaction with employees..In order for an employee to exceed expectations there should be support in order for employee to provided escellent service.
good,I love every aspect of my job. My department is phasing out LVN's. I looked forward to going to work every day. interacting with my managers and team and learning something new everyday.
good,It is a great company to work and they provide great benefits and many incentives for their employees. They also have excellent training and training staff.

good,"Organization is an excellent place to work because of leadership and fellowship - team work! I enjoyed my 6 1/2 months I worked there - although my job was temporary - not long term, but during that brief period I was instrumental for setting up a new floor with hardware computer, printer, phone systems and ensuring hundreds of new employees and existing employees with operational hardware, distribution of supplies, maintaining facility and security operation. There was no task too small or big I could not handle, and when I left my supervisor praised me for my committment, hardwork, loyalty and great personality....don't believe me... give him a call.."
good,I have a flexible and enjoyable work environment with a great boss. The work is steady and challenging.The hardest part is the deadlines. The easiest part is the atmosphere of hard work equals promotion.
good,Have been with the company only 6 months as Utilization Manager. The work is easy and unlike others I do not work more than 40 hours a week. The benefits are Amazing. Beat job I ever had.
good,"Employees have good benefits and opportunity to grow.  I acquired vast knowledge of long term care.  Met wonderful members and people in need of services.  Enjoy working with the elderly.  The hardest part of my job is dealing with lack of communication among co-worker to complete task.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working from home and not having to commute.  In addition, the most enjoyable part are my clients"
good,Great Place to work! Family and People oriented. Learned plenty about Health Insurance Medicaid in my role as Customer Service Rep
