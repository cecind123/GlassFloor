rating,review
bad,"High expectations, low pay for the staff.  The executives are paid extremely high, at the expense of everyone else.  "
bad,"Will not give you training. Promises you will not stress but yet flood you with projects, at least 60 houses to build in a 3 month period. If a Superintendent gets fired and is close to your area, you just inherited his area."
bad,Worked with a great bunch of guys on the sub division I was on. We had a lot of fun at work. We used the worst lumber I have ever been associated with. it made our jobs impossible to do and turn out a great product.
bad,"Terrible place to work.  Poor management ethics.  No follow through with Employment Guidelines, Systems and Procedures.  Annual reviews are a joke if they happen at all.  No exit interviews.  False promises made often and a fear factor for speaking out is prevalent.  Cronyism and incompetency at management levels is rampant.  ""Personal"" relationships on the job influenced staffing decisions.  "
bad,"You'll be asked to do many things that are not ethical or honest. Customer does NOT come first with this company. You will be working on your days off, you will be working overtime without compensation . Who really benefits at this company? Only the high paid, money grubbing vultures at the top of the feeding chain of this organization. Only a handful of favored, long time employees, with ties to company execs (hmmm how do they find favor?) receive perks and decent pay checks. If you can stomach schmoozing up to dishonest characters for a pay check, you found your slice of heaven! The rest of the ""honest"" workers... forget it! Dying on the vine, with sadness in their faces. Ever work at a company where most people grimace, work in fear, are afraid and look miserable? Welcome to Meritage! Company thrives on fear management. You will NOT be reimbursed for your expenses. If you ask questions about any number of odd looking things or practices, and you look for honest answers, you will be ushered out the door by the HR department, after they call you ""negative."" The company does NOT follow it's own code of ethics, and uses it's code of ethics only for the sake of appearances. Code of ethics is used to sucker unsuspecting and honest people, to reporting problems. However, if you report anything, you get canned. Try to get help, say a peep about what really goes on, and you will be targeted for termination. The real work at all local divisions is run by teams of women, who work in cubicles that resemble a sweat shop. It is so sad to see how offices are set up, and how this company"
bad,"Management has no education/degrees and does not communicate properly to the sales team which is the core that makes the company money.  There are always surprises and they don't ask where you want to go instead they tell you. Sometimes there are people driving an hour in opposite directions for work when they could simply switch them so they can be close to home."
bad,"Major problems with management and construction.  Consistent turnover.  Gone through 2 presidents , no  replacement  yet , been almost 9 months. Gone through 2 sales directors, 2 sales managers , complete office staff let go or quit."
bad,"Construction managers are interchangeable depending on who you know and where they work."
bad,Can't wait to get another job. All they care about is the bottom line it doesn't  matter what it takes. You have to make sure that your seat stays warm.....
bad,Meritage is very stressful & not a good employer. The management team is very good at micro-managing & does not treat their employees well.  They mystery shop every aspect of the sale as if they don't trust the employees & they won't leave you alone to do your job. It creates a very toxic environment.
bad,"They dont know how to communicate with their employees about change, or when new things are about to happen even when you work in that department. They also try and change to man things at one time with 5 people on the team to manage the change that you have nooooo clue about. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!"
bad,Management is very unorganized. Fast paced environment so your work day goes by very fast. Not enough pay for the stress and demands. Extremely overwhelming. Several cliques within the company as well.
bad,"Lower your pay every year. They are not a well managed company in the bay area. Morale is low in most departments, but not all."
bad,"My review if this company is that, where the position itself is well paying, the title of construction manager in this company is not well defined,upper management again tells the tale of the business and generates clicks among managers and causes this industry to be a cut throat business,it is sad what once a set out position has been grossly destroyed by meritage homes."
bad,"Horrible management, core values are applied only when it fits management's plan."
bad,"They only care about a select few, all others are treated like second class citizens even if you produce.  They favor a couple of employee's and they seem to have no issue with time off or even getting an extra day off.  That is the only ones that love working there, I guess so, if I made the club it would have been great."
bad,Meritage homes had terrible management.  Website was being relaunched requiring us to work overtime to load company floorplans.  Many times we would return to work and the work we had done was erased due to IT error and we would be asked to redo the work.  Very frustrating environment.
bad,The company promotes integrity but that is not the case.   IT Management looks out for their own personal gain and not what is right for the company. The end result is the customer/homeowner suffers.  Not good business!
bad,"*Not really worth the time to write a review, since the HR department will offset any real reviews with fake positive reviews* "
bad,There are a lot of good quality people which creates a fun environment to work in. The downside is a less structured approach to customer care and service.
bad,It was a fun workplace however they can improve managerial skills. It is a place where you can grow and I enjoyed working for Meritage Homes.
bad,Their “silo”way of management only serves corporate not a division . Every facet of the company runs independently. There is no common goal or any feeling of team cohesion.
bad,Hiding behind core values that are rarely used Meritage builds an over priced home at average quality.  Cannot and will not meet goals because of land and over priced homes.
good,The culture is just to build as fast as possible and force the buyer to close at the end whether the house is ready or not. Management changes over quickly and you never feel comfortable in your job security
good,I did an internship for Meritage homes in the summer of 2019. While I enjoyed my time there I noticed many co workers struggle with work life balance. However you can knock out your daily duties like a select few construction managers you will excel.
good,"There is a huge turnover in sales associates. They aren't interested in helping you succeed, they would rather just hire someone new to replace you."
good,Management have their preferred group of people. Be prepared to get into their preferred group if you are chosen to do so or your life will be miserable.
good,"The people and the office environment was pleasant. "
good,This company is a growing division with some positives and some negatives. primarily their management is based around fear and job security. Motivation and drive from management streams from the upper management pressuring them to pressure the sales teams.
good,People you work with in communities are awesome but when the corporate office wants a closing at the end of the month they will make you close house even if its not ready and make your life miserable. Working late hours just so they can make a number.
good,"physically a decent place to work; change of sales manager created issues and challenges when he brought in his favorites from Pulte - his introduced requirements of 2 sales per month minimum created undesirable place to succeed - lost several quality sales persons who voluntarily - one high quality sales woman left the day she got the memo. A great loss to Meritage representing a severe challenge to ongoing sales, at least until new quality persons were recruited and oriented to the quality product offered and provided by Meritage."
good,Its a typical work day. The work culture is cool at times when everyone is happy. The hardest part of the job is saying no when its a sales driven environment.
good,"There management was weak, the orientation to company policies and procedures was only fair, but any support to the field was poor."
good,"The position itself was great. Hard work but great benefits. The largest issue that I had was the interoffice fighting between the departments. Sales would fight with construction who would fight with the office staff. They preach one goal one vision, but it is anything but that."
good,Great place to work made some lifelong friends. Middle management like to play games &  favorites who were pretty much missing in action most of the time.
good,"I enjoyed the work I performed with this company until my supervisor was promoted. The VP of construction is oblivious to address issues with customer service and he was the one to take over the process. Laid off another service associate which had all the responsibilities dumped on me at the time when the workload was set to increase dramatically. No attention was given to the workload increase, which meant that I had to work extended hours daily just to keep my homeowners needs in check. Eventually the stress of working the hours and asking for help wore thin. I reached out to HR who appeared to support the need on the surface, but I was unaware of the friendship between her and the VP - this turned out to be a VERY BAD MOVE on my part. After a month, I was being written up for performance ~ even though I was doing more than the work of two people at this point. A week prior to being dismissed, I had a candid conversation with my supervisor who said he was happy with my performance and that he was not hearing any complaints from my homeowners. A week later I was let go due to ""performance"". Political games are very strong in this company - and seeing that they allow some to be counseled time after time and remain in position and/or lying directly to the homeowners and receiving promotions ~ it is obvious that you will need to be friends with the right people more than proven results and true concerns with homeowners. If you want to work here - make friends higher up early and don't express your concerns for your homeowners or anything that might indicate a problem with their"
good,"Benefit package is desireable and potential to make great money. You definitely sacrifice time and family, you have to really weigh your priorities before committing."
good,You learn how to handle customers and their requests/demands. How to read people and what they really want. How to handle yourself in stressful situations. You learn how to become very social and make friends with everyone.
good,"The management needs to be trained before trying to train employees.  "
good,No consideration is given to the balance between work and life.  The work is piled on until failure is immanent and then the employee is berated for poor performance.  The compensation is  not sufficient to overcome not having a life outside of the workplace.
good,I enjoyed working for Meritage when I started 2004.  Lots of great people and management team.  Everyone worked as a team at the time which helps......
good,Meritage had a great environment with after work activities that helped grow the sense of community within. I would likely return should the offer arise.
good,"This company experienced a lot of Management transition, during my time there. This was in the beginning of the economy downturn, and I was part of a 53 person Reduction in force (RIF)."
good,"I learned a lot about the mortgage process. I enjoyed watching homes go up from start to finish. It was a happy time, most of the time, for the people building their houses. The hardest part was the weekend work away from my family."
good,The company is a good company with good people. The company is making moves to put itself in the forefront of the construction/home building industry.
good,"The IT Team here at Meritage Homes have improved the way things work. Such as the processes needed to get anything IT related accomplished to assist with workflow for our team. With changes comes more problems within and for the IT department, examples include software and supporting related issues for the company. The IT Department though has a solid foundation and a great leadership team that makes sure we are taken care of and supported despite the multiple inconveniences that occur daily."
good,Company is great and is trying to head in the right direction but they have to many ideas being throw around. Direct sales leaders and construction leaders are great but the VP of Sales micromanages.
good,"Just a lack in land and opportunities.  The management turnover happen often as well, but as a sales person you have one goal - SALES:)!  Truly enjoyed working with the construction managers."
good,Paid well but not organized. The company means well but not enough effort is focused on the details; like take offs. They schedule from the main office with people that are unfamiliar with the construction process.
good,A great company that develops energy efficient new homes to buyers making their new homebuying experience exceptional. Present detailed information regarding the community and the floor plans available.
good,Great place to work. The closes are a little more arduous than others I’ve experienced but that’s to be expected with the type of accounting that goes on in these positions.
good,"Really great coworkers. Good job, just was not a good fit for my life at the time. I think a different time or another person would fit right in to the culture."
good,A really good company to work for. They have a very good management team. The homes they build are super energy efficient and impressively designed. They have an easy system that allows for efficient sales contracts. They have an awesome marketing team and mortgage company.
good,"My role had developed into a turnaround specialist and every time i was transferred to an underperforming community, i estimated i lost approximately $40,000 in annual revenue."
good,"Rewarding: I was able to lead a smaller team of 22 with great impact. In my previous role I had as many as 300 direct reports at a time. This required my leadership style to be more global. I enjoyed being able to assist each sales person individually based on their unique skill set; providing me the opportunity assist them in meeting their full potential. "
good,"Sub-contractors are allowed to show up when they feel like it, the job is ready and the schedule is accurate, unable to maintain a schedule if contractors don't show up."
good,"Not enough time in a day to walk all homes. Current job site requires 3 Construction Managers, only 2 on site at the time. Over 40 homes in production at all times."
good,Productive enviroment with results driven culture. Friendly coworkers.
good,This company only pays $10 an hour which means it is a filler till you find another full time job that pays well and gives you benefits.  The corporate people are a great support team.
good,"Never felt like a cog in the wheel, company took the time to listen and make changes if possible.  Senior accountants had the ability to impact their division, wouldn't be possible without the trust from management."
good,"I wonderful friend and former colleage of mine just started working as Vice President of Sales and Marketing at Meritage Homes. At the time the real estate market was just beginning to go down. My friend wanted to put together a ""dream team"" to go strong and sell these homes inspite of the economic decline. I was asked to come on board and I was placed in a very high end community. My community was brand new, only the model and 4 other floor plans were under construction. The first month I was working out of a trailer. I really enjoyed Meritage Homes. They had a great reputation and fantastic floor plans. It was very easy for me to stand behind the product. Three months in my husband received a job offer to work for Volvo North America in Greensboro, NC. We started to put things in action to move right away. Meritage Homes were very excited and happy for my family."
good,"This was as a small company when I started out as Hammonds Homes, then it combined with Legacy and became Meritage. "
good,My supervisor was a great person to work with. Some of the Superintendents were very seasoned but overly stressed out. I would consider working for this company again.
good,"They have it down. Little waste maximum use of tools and resources. I cant think of a single thing that could be do ne in a better way.i just clean up,trying to relieve the burden on the G.C.  i am pretty good at anticipationg and averting issues."
good,Could provide more product review to turnover a more complete home.  Upper management in the land department has a high turnover and more boss mentality than leadership mentality.
good,"Being the brand new division of multi-family development in N Cal. was fun and challenging at the same time. We had the opportunity to take existing procedures in place in So Cal. and adjust them to work more efficiently for us. Once the housing market turned they closed our division and laid off my boss. To prevent the same fate for me, they transferred me; same position working for my previous VP's equal in single-family construction. Unfortunately that only delayed my layoff."
good,"There is always a lot to do, for some people.  Our division office had about 30 people. 5 or 6 worked long hours, the rest put in 40 hour weeks most of the time.  I felt that life balance was good but the opportunity for advancement in my role does not exist.  Strong management in this production homebuilding environment meant a lot of pressure to perform.  Great learning environment.  Lots of tools available to the office staff."
good,"never micromanaged. if you are a self starter who can work toward a common goal with others, you will do well. outside the box thinking is encouraged.  here is your goal, here are your tools, now get it done type of environment."
good,"The company has young management at key positions, however the CEO is well seasoned and drives the company with his entrepreneurial spirit and his guidance on keying into the segment that is support by regional markets."
good,"Working during the housing boom was a mind blowing experience. My days began at 5:30 am, and I did not come home till 8 PM. Management was not interested in my family life, but moreover what was getting done out in the field, how many homes were looked at, and who was not happy with the final result. The most enjoyable part of my job, are the homeowners I still talk to after all of these years and my co workers that have created long lasting family bonds with."
good,I had great managers and it was a great family/work life balance with good pay too. I did not experience in house promotion but I had heard that they do promote within.
good,I was given a number of responsibilities at Meritage I advanced pretty quickly from working on the service desk to starting my own project that involved PC and Network equipment configuration and installation
good,"Good company to begin a career and get your feet wet in construction. Area managers and CM's are open to teaching and showing you the ropes. "
good,Every one has been very patient and understanding that I am not familar with the sytem and daily activites. I could go to just about anyone and ask for information and they would gladly help me. I enjoy working with people and helping people with their new homes. The hardest part was not knowing how to answer a question or who to foward the question to.
good,"Meritage Homes is a good place to work.  The people are great.  I experienced a lot of training, sharing of knowledge, and developmental growth.  The culture is very good."
good,"Creates opportunities for growth."
good,Company is now relocated in Sacramento as far as I know. The Concord office was a great place to work with very fair and good people in Management.
good,As a community sales manager I would explain about our company the community and the features of our homes.  I would demonstrate models and home sites and pre-qualify prospective buyers.  I wrote contracts and followed through from dirt through construction until the close of escrow and after.  I really enjoy working with people and finding them their perfect home.  Management changed monthly.  The co-workers were wonderful.
good,Management tries to add fun to the daily grind.  Great bonus program.  I would work here again.  Great work balance with home life.  They seem to care.
good,"a Typical at work was to open up the  model home, set appointment, shows homes.  I learn how the interest work on purchase a new home.  There was no hard part.  The most enjoyable part was meeting new people."
good,"How to be a great salesperson, and to bring a winning attitude to the job everyday."
good,"Meritage is a great company. I had the pleasure of going to headquarters in Arizona and I immediately knew this is the company I want to retire from. Unfortunately there was an entire management change in the houston division including president, VP or sales, and sales managers. No one left to uphold the true values of the company. It was very disappointing."
good,"Was a nice place to work,. Unfortunately the housing crisis caused them to shut the Concord office doors. I was kept on board as long as they could..."
good,Really enjoyed working for Meritage Homes.  Loved working with the customers and building great quality homes
good,"Meritage Homes is a Home-Builder Company. It is a very good employer in such a way that employees are well provided and company is generous and office atmosphere is positive. Due to economic downturn especially in the home-building sector, most employees are laid-off her in the Concord/Bay Area."
good,I enjoyed working with accounts payable 100+ entries a day as well as I re-organized their filing system. The staff was wonderful and pleasing.
good,"This is a home builder company, the employee and management are an amazing group all around. The president of the company so family oriented understands everyone's situation flexible place, I enjoyed all there free breakfast, lunches, trips, gatherings all there volunteer work they help in whatever they can."
good,"Meritage Homes builds a great home and buyers know this.  It makes a big difference when working with them.  Also, Meritage is always making improvements to make the homes more energy efficient and live better."
good,Meritage Homes is a great company that values it''s employees.
good,"Worked hard and helped out when necessary and where needed."
good,Wonderful experience being part of a team that celebrates each other. Possibility for advancement and explore other departments. Awesome work culture.
good,I loved my job. I loved the people I worked with. It was an excellent support group and employees thrived on seeing others excel. The job was challenging but fulfilling. One of the best places I've ever worked.
good,"This was an excellent place to work, all of management is very compassionate, I was able to move quickly up the ladder and able to expand my job skills. I enjoyed most being able to learn as much as I could."
good,"If you are looking for an innovative forward looking builder Meritage Homes is  "
good,Design is my passion. I was the senior designer for Meritage Homes in CA. There was nothing better then getting a thank you letter from your clients saying how they love their home and the design. Our homes are our safe haven and I enjoy helping people make it their enjoyable space to share with family and friends.
good,"Loved working at Meritage Homes, great place to work, has flexible hours and great benefits, management team was great they really care about their employees."
good,"Meritage has given me many opportunities to grow in my career. Great work environment, friendly management, and solid development plans. Enjoy working for Meritage."
good,"One of the top National homebuilders to work for. I have had my own greatest achievemnts in experience, compensation, professionalism and advancement."
good,Great place to work prior to the housing crash when mass layoffs had to be done.I was given many great opportunities when they were available.The upper construction management at meritage is the best in the homebuilding industry.I cant wait for proffitable homebuilding to return. MO
good,Excellent work culture. The executive management team creates an amazing work environment of team work and problem solving. Comparable pay and benefits with work flexibility.
good,Management seems to care great deal about employee work life balance in relation to performance and achieving results. Rewards those who can consistently achieve positive results.  Meritage Core Values are a constant goal and motivating force in daily work to perform and achieve continuing results and customer satisfaction.
good,"Quality and energy eff. homes "
good,"If the economy and hosing market did not colaspe in 2007/2008 I'd still be working for this company. I absolutely loved it. If the right opportunity arose, I'd return to them."
good,Meritage homes is a very fun place to work where if you choose you have the ability to learn numerous positions. Management is is very easy to talk to with any concerns as well.
good,"First of all, my manager is awesome. My job could be a lot worse with a less than desirable boss. Work load will fluctuate depending on time of year and homes closed in an area. At the current price point, customers are very needy and have unrealistic expectations and are very unpleasant to deal with. However, with a great manager, culture and team that has your back, you hardly care. Pay is fair. I have left a bad review with every company I have worked for. I thought it was only fair that a write a good review considering I am very happy here."
good,Overall management of construction of single family homes from the company standards to the customers and co workers I would recommend the company to all interested
good,"Meritage Homes"
good,"Meritage Homes was a great place to work they always believed in what I could do as any employee and I had the freedom to do it.  My boss's were great as well, never any put downs only great reviews personally, and always honesty.  I could always be honest with them and vise versa.  Great place!"
good,I was an intern for this company and did many things from Mail room and data entry to receptionist. They found my strong suits and really worked with me well.
good,I loved working at Meritage Homes.
good,constuction manager i now the job i work almost 9 years but i would like a second chance
