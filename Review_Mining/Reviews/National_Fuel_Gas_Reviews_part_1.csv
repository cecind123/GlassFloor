rating,review
bad,You are just a number at National Fuel. National Fuel operates under the principles of the job is 1st and your family life is 2nd. Office politics is part of a typical work day.
bad,National Fuel Gas is a poor company to work especially for aperson of color.  Management is lousy. The Human Resources department is lacking humans. Not good
bad,"This place is not the gas company if your grandfather. They can’t keep employees and are perfectly ok with the revolving door. You can legit come here, get qualified and go make more money for a national fuel contractor.  Management does not car about you at all. 7 days work weeks with random days off in the middle of the week. Don’t even waste your time here"
bad,"Union position, the union isn't the strongest union around. You work in a team of 2 fixing the gas lines above and bellow grade. You need customer service skills, always going into peoples house too relight natural gas equipment."
bad,"Work in all phases of the weather and maintain gas wells and pipelines everyday."
bad,"Employees are great and helpful, but management is brutal. Management expects too much of their employees. At times, management showed signs of racism and gender prejudice. If you are a man,  this company may be a great fit for you, but any minorities or women, stay away! Also, everything is based off seniority, so YOU WILL have to cover over night shifts. You will have shifts where you have to work with just 6-8 hours in between. You will have to work weekends over nights. This company will suck you dry."
bad,"Training was unstructured, with little apparent knowledge or understanding by the trainers.  Supervisors and managers leave a lot to be desired.  Very strict on attendance and not very flexible at all when a serious life event occurs, such as death in family (parent death).  Great stepping stone for  someone just starting out, but not much to attract a seasoned, older individual looking to build a nest egg and retire from the company."
bad,It’s a normal pace call center. Where there is little room for advancement if you don’t fit in their book. It’s a very pick and choose job and not from your ability but from some unknown criteria.
good,The work isn't hard. Management makes work life difficult.  There isn't much room to move up if you are a woman.  If employed at the Mineral Springs location there is not such thing as a work/life balance.  The amount of information that you learn is overwhelming but it is good to know
good,"People are great, management tends to tell you want tou want to hear with no action. Communication is poor. Advancement is hard to come by unless transfer to smaller service center"
good,"Ok Place to work, has good job security, benefits are at a minimum and dont seem to be getting any better. Management is over worked and stressed, creating a dangerous work atmosphere."
good,"Most employees knew what to expect. The work was mostly the same day in and day out. Lower-level management was friendly, upper-level management seemed disconnected. There was a clear divide between union and non-union personnel. Most union guys did not trust management. There were a lot of opportunities for overtime. Safety was a priority."
good,Not a bad place to work. Pay and benefits are good. Hours are good. Overtime is available at times. Management can be difficult some time. Very strict.
good,"The workplace culture is the downfall of National Fuel.  Upper Management and executives are very far removed from how supervisors feel about their jobs on a day to day basis.  There are favorites picked from the top down and if you aren't one of them, there is no advancement; in other words if is extremely ""male, pale, and stale.""  The most enjoyable part of my job is the team I work with."
good,"This was a great summer job and it was my first job ever. I painted their pipes and worked in extreme heat and some pretty dirty conditions, so it was manual labor and I was only paid minimum wage which was the only downside."
good,Required high attention to detail. Provided great exposure to the background in the industry.
good,I do not have any comments to share about the company at this time. I do not have anything negative to say about the company. My suggestion would be to contact the companies Hr  to learn about the company and its positions.
good,Decent pay for the area communication from management to staff is lacking. Wish there was a way to change jobs sooner than the 4 years you are locked into the job u are hired in for 4 years.
good,"Although I came on board when the pension plan was still available, it still is a good place to work.  Moreso to get your feet wet in the workplace environment.  It is a great place to gain work experience.  An MBA appears necessary to get into management. Because there is no longer a pension plan, it may not be a place you may stay long term.  The people are nice and the office is in a great location.  The company is turning younger, hiring new new people to replace retirees so there are lots of job opportunities becoming available. Hardest part of my work is acclimating to the new billing system that was implemented 3 years ago. Most enjoyable part of my job is the AWS schedule giving us some additional flexibility in paid time off along with the generous vacation schedule. Education is also paid for if you want to pursue and MBA or CPA education."
good,I have a variety of responsibilities. The day goes by fast. Co-workers area pleasure to work with. I am very good at customer service.  I can defuse hostile calls very easily with my skills.  I really have nothing else to add that would benefit anyone. This survey is very frustrating that I am not able to get out of it to complete my posting of my resume
good,"It was a quaint office, only four workers. We a rotating schedule. Had our own jobs. We had a lot of fun working together. I can't go into job duties."
good,"Typical days work was handling customer complaints. Working with employees, providing feedback to them on their calls. Giving tips on how to better handle customer calls. We had a lot of employee appreciation events. Better job security once your inthe union after 365 days."
good,NFG is all about safety and they continue to grow. They also have very good pay and benefits! I would recommend this company to anyone looking for a secure job.
good,"great company, great products, really cares about their staff, clean office, easy to learn with there extensive training and caring management staff.  Wonderful"
good,National Fuel has a good working environment.  I learned a lot from them that I will use in my future employment.  It is a Union Company.  I enjoyed my time there.
good,One of the best companies to work for in Western New York and Western Pennsylvania. I would recommend this company to anyone seeking a rewarding career in the Energy Industry.
good,Great people to work will. Great training for my job title. Safety was very important and applied to a everyday work. Enjoyed my time with national fuel.
good,"Great employees, great bosses. They take care of the employees well. I would recommend working at this company to anyone. Unfortunately it didn't work out for myself."
good,"My current job responsibilities included supervising 34 employees, dispatch operations, new services, and clerical administration.  I provide documentation, reports, presentations to a variety of different groups, and serve on several process improvement and standard engineering teams."
