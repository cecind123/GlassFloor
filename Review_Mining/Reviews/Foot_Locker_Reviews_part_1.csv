rating,review
bad,"The reason I stayed as long as I did is because I had an amazing manager. If it wasn't for him, I would have left a lot sooner than I did. I worked hard for little pay and the company did not care about me at all."
bad,épuisante physiquement et surtout néfaste pour la santé. Ne privilégie que l'aspect financier de l'entreprise et n'a aucun regard pour le bien-être des salariés.
bad,No discount is worth thd stress that it is working in this company. They transfer you from store to store & you have no say in it. Poorly trained superiors as well. GARDEN STATE PLAZA PARAMUS NJ
bad,I need my job so I'm forced to take the inhumane treatment. But the fact I have to take care of my family I'm going to work everyday till God blesses me with something better
bad,"my day would consist of attending the costumers and getting them what they need. they would want you to sell more than $2,000 and their was not commission. they expect way too much from the employe. not enough hours"
bad,The management is a problem it’s has issues with flexible schedule they have a problem with you having a second job they also played favorite when it’s come time to promotion it’s also takes 2 years to get promoted
bad,"In all of my days, it was my first job after being fresh from the military so i didnt really know anything else. This foot locker that i belonged to at the time was ridiculous. The manager failed to even let me know that i was being terminated, which was completely unprofessional and more than likely against their policy. My first and only paycheck was $57 dollars and it was another complete waste of my time."
bad,"Really bad higher management like DM’s RVP’s not treating everyone in the company same. They don’t care about the human, people’s feelings!! And that’s not right."
bad,"Hated working there, I was a minor at the time. Management would miss my breaks, would work long hours only one day a week, and when needing days off management would not comply."
bad,if your looking for something to barely get by then yes this is the job for you. when you have any questions or concerns they will not be able to answer you or give you an explination for anything. good luck.
bad,"Very slow"
bad,"La pire expérience de ma vie  , equipe qui se prend la tête à longeur  de journee , des objectifs trop élever pour le magasin , les responsables de magasin toujours deriere vous avec leur feuille de résultat .. Harcèlement à longeur de journee .. Forcer le client à acheter sinon vous êtes pas un bon vendeur , aucune évolution possible je déconseille fortement ce magasin d’euralille et footlocker !!!"
bad,Worked hard for the company but never felt appreciated. Foot locker doesn’t care about family or your lively hood. It’s a job for kids in high school not for a adult
bad,"Awful company. Don’t know to to manage their staff. The overall company is shocking, don’t know how to improve sales in a certain city, management don’t listen to you"
bad,"Footlocker is one of the worst places to work I worked there for a while and the entire time they are disrespectful, show favoritism to family and friends that have worked there for years and gives credit to people who dont do nothing"
bad,The management is horrible. They don’t care about your life outside of work. The workers are MESSY! The managers talk mess about you to other co workers. The footlocker company needs to be retained because they don’t know how to do their actually job title. I don’t recommend working or shopping there.
bad,"absolutely horrible management. young, inexperienced managers are hired to have a job they cannot handle or maintain. extremely unprofessional work environment"
bad,"Dal primo giorno di lavoro non ho istaurato da subito un buon rapporto con il capo, era troppo esigente, ti faceva fare cose sempre più difficili, le pause te le spostava quando voleva, a volte non c'erano, a volte da un'ora era solo 40 minuti. Mi ha sempre mostrato un comportamento meschino e di superiorità. Avevo un giorno di riposo alla settimana e a volte capitava che mi toglievano il giorno di riposo perché dato che sono stagista devo dare la precedenza all'addetto alle vendite. Il rapporto che avevo con i miei colleghi era pessimo con alcuni, erano egoisti, ipocriti e quando il capo non c'e loro mi comandano a bacchetta."
bad,"How you develop and grow faster within the company depends on your work ethic, drive, and location. Smaller stores offer you more training but limited to hours to employees while larger stores offer you more hours but training is stretched."
bad,"No room for growth unless your entire life revolves around footlocker and you get in with the right upper management. Loved my team which is the only thing that kept me there. "
bad,my store was not good all around it ended up closing down and completely new people worked at the new location after they added on flyzone. other locations are probably better
bad,"Bien accueilli mais mal formé .  Accusé de vol sans preuve  .  La pression tous les jours,  même quand on connaît pas les produits ni rien.  Il ne faut pas être débutant dans la vente"
bad,Do not work for this company they pay below minimum wage and they are all ways hiring people manger don't care about there employs they just what to get paid and go home
bad,it was just bad. I wouldn't recommend at all. The management sucks. they dont care about their employees but themselves. It was truly just bad........
bad,"I worked At footlocker long enough to see that some of my Co-Workers did not care to imply what the customer needs , failed at customer service , also the store was very slow !"
bad,I would just love working here because I LOVE giving people advice about shoes. And I like talking and communicating with people. Only if there’re not rude though.
bad,sometimes work is slow and i don’t like the manager attitude. sometimes he have an attitude with me and sometimes he don’t even talk to me. i try my best to keep a good attitude
bad,They have there favorites and schedule who they want to schedule and when there is nobody left they use you as a last resort and schedule you once every two weeks
bad,Promise it’s not worth it if you wanna get the job for 2 or 3 days as part time then cool do it atleast for the discount if not forget if you’ll be broke.
bad,As a manager it was difficult to work with DM. Little to no communication or direction.  Other members of management are rude and petty towards external hires. Pay does not measure up to other retail companies.
bad,"Aucun respect jalousie envers les nouvelles recrue, foot locker et une très bonne entreprise mais les magasins au niveau du personnel Écœurant je désapprouve"
bad,"I don't recommend working at Parks Mall Footlocker, you are treated poorly. There has been fights, stolen money, stolen items, and things of that nature. The managers ares petty and only go for people they like and if they don't like you they'll lower your hours."
bad,no type of good pay had o sell a lot to get a good check for paymets the pay is only 6.25 plus what ever you sell through the week no good hours giving to anyone unless you sell good then the will give you hours
bad,hated it but it was a pay check at the time tghe mangement was poor the bathrooms where dirty and you ran up to 10 miles a day to do your job very stressful people were rude and there were people who were very scary it was very hot in the summer and cold in the fall
bad,management brutale et non respect des valeurs humaines des salariés
bad,"Very unorganized & not appreciating of they employees "
bad,"honestly the worst place I have ever worked."
bad,The people i worked with was fine the boss we didnt see eye to eye because he wasnt cooperating with my school schedule so my work schedule was running into my school schedule.
bad,"It sucked, I didn't enjoy my time there, was only there for 3 months, coworkers were mean and nasty and nobody helped, manager expected too much from part-time workers that were barely paid minimum wage"
bad,Management and everybody else here they don’t see the best in people not willing to shop here at all finish line has good service I wouldn’t recommend I had a friend that got interviewed here and he kept calling showing interest and all they would do is say we will call u back really just be honest and say u didn’t get the job
bad,A typical work day in footlocker is very stressful. I've learned that this company does not value their employees. The management is so poor that you would think they just started or even got hired with little to no experience. The workplace culture is one of the worst things about it. The environment is literally HIGH SCHOOL. If you want to experience high school twice this is the right place for you. The hardest part of the job is actually trying to get hours. Constantly begging your manager to schedule you or even make a proper schedule is the worst part of this place. The most enjoyable is maybe you'll get lucky to get a sneaker or two if they actually like you.  I do not recommend this job to anyone. Thank you.
bad,"This was probably one of the most frustratingly disorganized ""organizations"" i have ever worked for.  Large scale projects involving thousands of stores were run and managed by temps making $14 having these temps do positions of management with no promise of extra compensation.  Demanding mandatory overtime when hiring more people to complete the task was the answer."
bad,"Not fun to work for, stressful and full of drama, leadership is all racist because everyone is Hispanic or black, whites ""do not"" belong working at Foot Locker, according to people."
bad,"This job is good if you're a high schooler or a school drop out who is still living with mom and dad. The job pay is unfair, the favoritism is noticeable the moment you're hired, and the way you become hooked to this job is by buying merchandise."
bad,I worked here for 6 months then all of the sudden they just stopped calling me in for hours. They even cancelled my associate discount card. While i worked here all i got was yelled at and i made sales so i dont understand why i was improperly let go. Im now too embaressed to buy sneakers in that store. and everyone talked bad about everyone.
bad,"too many lost customers, people who cant afford the shoes they are buying to only return them on monday after they tried wearing them in the club. Sales was driven off of poor standards and ideas"
bad,Hired expecting a normal schedule with some consistency with 9.50 an hour and 1% commission on sales and when I got paid one week was actually under federal minimum wage and with no commission. I was called every night to go in the following day so I had absolutely zero ability to have a life and with the pay i couldnt even run 2 pennies together
bad,in the beginning I enjoyed working there but after awhile they started to pick on me because they thought I wasn't capable of doing my job. I got accused of letting a customer steal merchandise.
bad,è stato l'ambiente di lavoo peggiore in cui ho lavorato
bad,"Ti sfruttano per fare tutti i lavori peggiori e più pesanti compreso ricevere controllare e caricare la merce in entrata pretendendo tempi di lavoro sempre più veloci e ridotti."
bad,"Ze gaan niet goed om met personeel "
bad,This was one of the worst working environments i have ever had to work in. managers were not held responsible for the atmosphere they created in their stores.
bad,"I have been working with foot locker at Milwaukee, its a worst night mare. they dont have a proper infrastructure, to much of micro management, Sr. management is too worst, no proper communication between full time employees and contract employees, unrealistic deadlines,  no proper use of upgraded software...lot of mess....."
bad,foot locker needs to teach management exactly what labor laws are. The way they make employees take lunches before their 5 hours is against the law. You have to pay employees if they are made to take a lunch prior to 5 hours! Management plays favoritism.
bad,"Footlocker and ladyfootlocker both suck, no room for improvements. Toxic company and bad management, little to no hours.  They usually have favorites and if you’re not one you won’t get many hours, and they are not considerate if you have to take time off or become sick. If you call out for any reason expect for them to take away all of your hours."
bad,"terrible not good."
bad,This was the worst place I ever worked and I really don't want to talk about that part of my life. The management was stealing from the store and made everyone else do all the work. I do not recommend this place to anyone.
bad,Typical day at work is just show up for this company. Learned basic job skills I needed to know to do the job. Management make last minute decisions. Culture very low class people. Hardest part of job is moving on concrete all day. Enjoyable part of the job is going home early when the orders go down.
bad,It’s was an job while in high school pay was ok because I was still in school great discounts manager is about her business workers friendly easy job great first experience
bad,your pay is based on commission meaning the amount of shoes you sale. So if you dont sell many shoes on the floor you wont get paid as much. The shoes stacking in the back is by far the worst job ever
bad,good place bad environment employees always in competition when you cac actually work together and build more instead losing.   to me i went in and out
bad,The discounts was the only great thing working at this place. The management team was very unprofessional. Since I was new to the company I started to realized how bias they were. Working here I have learned to not favorite associates or managers because it causes a lot of push back in the work environment.
bad,Not a very well payed company they treat employees poorly management is a disaster a lot of favoritism lack of Career growth not recommended to work there unless you really like shoes
bad,"I really have nothing to say, just that it was the worst experience ever. There regulation on work and family time is the worst nobody should ever have to work like that. its not for me or my busy motherly lifestyle"
bad,Cut throat company. Corporate does not care about the low level guys. Very misleading. You work years and go above and beyond for people who won't have your back.
bad,"hours were terrible, i was expected to do jobs that were not worth me getting minimum wage. i felt out of place working there because i was not knowledgeable about shoes."
bad,"terrible job seriously never work there. its fun for the first month then you just wanna quit every shift. I wouldn't recommend this job to my worst enemy. honestly, youre better off not having any money, place is bad. also if u resell shoes when u buy them at discount u can get fired which is the dumbest thing I've ever heard."
bad,footlocker is an ordinary job that pays he bills nothing special. you do have to meet prodution requirements evryday or your job is at risk. would not recomend
bad,forcer le client à acheter des produits d'entretiens ( limite le forcer )
bad,"Great job to grow up in and great opportunities. Great business, working with a lot of great people. Business always growing and you can grow with it also"
bad,"It sucked. My manager was the absolute worst, never work here. You're underpaid and you'll never get what you want because there's no chance for advancement"
bad,i did not work at foot locker I'm not sure why it says I did. I cant change it I tried too. I'm sorry for this. I worked at subway before as a cashier some days and other days I made the sandwich's.
bad,"Management in the company is terrible including the district manager, the pay is not worth the struggle and stress that the company provides, no career advancement unless the district manager shows they really like you. Nothing in the company is based off of the knowledge or commitment that one shows for the company. Overall I would never recommend anyone to work for the district that I do."
bad,"The people make the job and the manager kills the peoples morale, lack of hours, lack of opportunity and overall not the best place to work unless the location is good"
bad,"the company only cares for the company not the workers. They pay you nothing for what they make you do , mangers talk to people however they like and dont treat people with respect"
bad,"worse place to work as a student management doesn't care if you go to school and have a demanding degree ( accounting, engineering, sciences) you work for minimum wage get treated like horribly and your grades suffer. not worth it in the long run keep your grades up so you can get paid properly when your done ur degree"
bad,i learned a lot but it was like competition in selling shoes and helping customers its a good high school job and peope are not friendly and they ignore at times but everything okay
bad,"It was very cut throat working at Foot Locker, the employees were very rude and didn't carry any morals. The inventory room was filthy. Sneaker boxes everywhere, no room to walk at all."
bad,"The manager at footlocker that I worked for was terrible, he couldn't handle the store and was in way over his head I had previously worked for this company and when I came back I couldn't stand working for this store."
bad,"Very unprofessional work place ( Werribee Plaza ) "
bad,"The managers were horrible and very rude, the pay was horrible considering the hours that i was working every week standing on my feet for 8+ hours. No benefits and very stressful work environment"
bad,The only thing worth working for footlocker was the discount. They give 30% off. As well as they grant you two fifths each year which is more discount on top of the 30%.
bad,Working at foot locker gives a young person an opportunity to get their feet wet. it is not and should not be a job one seeks to be at for a lifetime.
bad,horrible place to work on all fronts. they expect you to make the company your life. they consistently throw employees under the bus with minimal investigation into any customer complaints. only good for a part time employment as a first job for teenagers.
bad,Checks were always messed up poor management always had you going above and beyond for your checks to be short I'm always on top of my hours and job I go above and beyond I expect for no multiple errors on my checks
bad,Company is unfair. Schedules based on favoritism. Lots of gossiping amongst employees which is very immature and unprofessional. Employees are not treated with respect. Very demanding and work is not appreciated or compensated.
bad,"Horrible management, bad people to work with, no sense of leadership, favouritism, if you don't stay on top of your time they will cut you short and its just not fun."
bad,"no money treated unfairly."
bad,negative management and unfair workers not exactly what you expect working in a mall terrible communication and they dont work with you DO NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE
bad,I need something with better pay and more hours. I don't feel the promotion process is fair. The part timers do so much for the company and don't get treated as they should.
bad,"Retail was not for me. And this job taught me that.Over stocked stores, under paid staff, low volume sales due to the economic shift. The first 2 years were great until the economy took a dive."
bad,"worked here part time whilst studying at university. worst experience. low pay compared to other footwear uk retailers.  "
bad,"Footlocker was my first job."
bad,Awful. Be prepared to literally force customers to buy insoles and products on every sale. Managers poor aggressive to staff and useless. Running up 30 stairs for every sale. No breaks leave late and never on time. Have to buy trainers
bad,This company depends so much of their employees and don't pay them enough. $7.50 plus 1% commission is absolutely ridiculous. The only reason I liked the company was for the discount.
bad,"A typical day at Footlocker is people coming into to the store and not buying anything. That is because not everyone can buy shoes every day. How Footlocker worked was if you didn't sale a very expensive shoe, you weren't getting paid like you need to."
bad,"The only time that's enjoyable is the down time, when most people at other jobs would be bored. The company has a really messes up culture and turns even sales associates against each other as if they're not on the same level of the food chain."
bad,"This job is for teens and young adults, not for someone trying to support a family. However it has its perks of getting discounts"
bad,good company worked hard to get to where I was feel like the company knew they where going to shut down soon that's why they had me be the company manager before the store shut down
bad,Ive been with the company for one year and overall they are a great company but there is no advancement within the company. Management needs to improve.
bad,job was fun to have i was mostly in the stock room loading and unloading shoes and on the sales floor i learned how to be a good peoples person on the sales floor
bad,A typical day of work work would consist of meeting a vast variety of people while suggestive sales and inventory control. Great place to work overall.
bad,"journée typique : vente, accueil, conseils, mise en rayon, cintrage, antivoler les vêtements "
bad,worked for 2 years. pay was not good. morale was very low. staff would steal and curse on the sales floor. not very professional.
bad,"I worked there for 3 years where I worked extremely hard day by day to sell the best that I can. I watched employees steal, Managers steal, Managers break the rules, But they fired me because I went 25 days without working..."
bad,"the worst place I have ever had to work for. surprised at the lack of professionalism with management and disgusted by the fact that my superior is not only unmedciated and bipolar, but also discloses all of her personal life information to not only me, the only other female working there, but all our male coworkers."
bad,"managers leave all the work to asst manager, nothing gets done besides DM yelling at associates and manager get off scott free. wonder why they have a whole new team of employees each month"
bad,Typical day was making sure that store stayed clean and that I managed co-workers on things they were doing. You could talk to management about any concerns.
bad,"A typical day at work would be to stoke the shelves with product and resent the product to draw the customers attention to come in and buy. The key the about Kid Foot Locker is to work as a team, so i had great co-workers. The hardest part about work was really no breaks. I enjoyed the job because to see the reaction on kid kids face after getting a new pair of shoes is one of the best feelings."
bad,the place was fully staffed with temporary workers and they didnt care about you at all. you were totally replaceable and they let you know that.
bad,"Foot locker does not give out raises at all. I worked there two years without receiving a raise and there was obviously people who worked there way longer. One girl was there for 14 years and never once received a raise. You would think the pay would be great if they don't feel the need to EVER give out raises but its not. As a sales associate you get paid $6.13 a hour plus 1%commission. Assistant managers make minimum wage with 2% Commission and i am not sure about the actual store managers but i know they don't make commission. As a part time employee you can not go over 30 hours so even with the max hours you can only make but so much with $6.13 a hour and the commission doesn't really help, If you sell $1000 worth of shoes you only get a extra $10 on your check so to make a extra $100 on your check you would have to sell $10,000 worth of shoes. This job only works for people who have another job and just want a discount on shoes because that is all this job is good for. The discount is 30%"
bad,"I checked out customers that were ready to by sneakers, apparel, and other things."
bad,talk to a lot of people and learn about being a sales assoiate .
bad,A typical day work it all depends on the weekday or weekend. mostly during the week it's not as busy but on the weekend its pretty busy. you see a lot of different people come into the store from all over the city and state.
bad,Some of the staff were okay to work with.. laid back job at times but the amount of work managers would give a part timer while they sit on there throne isn't worth the hours of amount of pay we get working for a BIG company like footlocker. C'mon seriously! $5.00 an hour plus 1% commission thats nothing! The hours weren't that good either with only 10/15 hour A WEEK!!! Psssh! Then they want us to push sales onto people as if part timers are even in the store for a long period of time. Also managers have favorites which they put on the schedule more than others. I hated working for them.
bad,This job sucks. Managers get paid minimum wage plus 1/2% commission. Benefits suck. Discounts are too strict. McDonalds is better.
bad,this was my first job and it was fun actually even though the money isnt anything.
bad,"I had high hopes when i started, managers go by favorites or at least the manager i had. I wouldnt recommend any of my friends to work there."
bad,The store never opened on time. The managers hired more people than they needed which caused us all to work 8-16 work weeks. Very unprofessional in that profanity was always being used and managers would argue behind the register over commission.
bad,"Working here i only received three hour weeks, it was a horrible first job."
bad,Nothing to say about this company every person have a different out look on jobs
bad,Managers aren't properly trained. Pay is beyond poor. Company gives off a negative atmosphere
bad,i worked here for ten years and only got promoted once and that was from a sales associate to a sales lead.
bad,This job was filled wit rude management and co-worker also.
bad,"the worst company I ever work for. no respect, pay less, no break."
bad,Previous manager in Information Technology. I would never work for this company again. Hired a new VP and he brought on his buddy as a Director...a year later I am gone after 18 years of positive reviews and promotions. Overworked and underpaid staff.
bad,This was the worst experience I ever had. You made very little money and management was crooked. They made you pay for store shortages out of your own pocket. You never received lunch breaks and had random days off.
bad,A typical day at work at Footlockers was the day that my manager fired sell 2 co-works and left only 2 of us on the sells floor that day. the store got so busy the 2 of us couldn't handle it. There were so much customers that day we couldn't keep up with all the customers. We was runing back and forth in the stock room getting defferent sizes of sneakers. I was handling 4 customers at the same time it was very frustrating and hectick because I forgot most customers and they got very angry left the store. I was worried at the same time because I thought my manager will fire me too because I lost so many customers that day. The most enjoble part of the job is that the more sneaker sell you get commision.
bad,"This place was horrible. Long hours, no breaks, management was not there to help as needed"
bad,"Co-workers were very caty and unprofessional, district manager used favoritisim as a method of loyalty or advancing or promoting, company violates labor laws and covers up alot of wrong doings within the managers and district manager for Las Vegas region."
bad,"the hours are very flexible, great for full time students."
bad,"This Foot Locker is probably one of the worst jobs I've ever had along with manager. The store manager he was contradicting, had favorites, made up his own ""rules"". He doesn't genuinely care about you as a person, your just a person there to work and do what he needs you to do end of the day. Hopefully sometime soon they change the management because they need someone better who cares about their employees."
bad,As much as I worked the pay wasn’t worth it. I was stuck working open-close shifts due to too many ppl in management going on vacation around the same time. I had so many no call no shows from my staff. Not to mention how there’s way too much favoritism going on.  It’s so many store managers that should’ve been fired for breaking policies but are spared because store the DM personally likes them. Good luck growing with the company if you're not kissing the DMs behind.
bad,"Footlocker is exactly how you can imagine. Long hours, treated badly through every chain of command. Progression is pretty much halted at store manager and they have a policy where you must serve a period of time in each position so it becomes a very long process."
bad,"Footlocker in general is TERRIBLE.  The pay for sales associates is state minimum wage.  Commission is based on sales vs. hours worked, so commission is NOT guaranteed.  High volume stores get better rates if commission.  Managers are paid the bare minimum and are required to work 45-60 hours.  Recruitment for management is not considered a priority, so if understaffed, forget about quality of life.  The discount is pretty good, but whats the point if you can't afford to buy shoes."
bad,"I use to be one of Banff Footlockers longest standing staff until I have resigned due to poor management. Don't get me wrong, the people I have meet there were amazing people to work with but the store manager was another story. I honestly don't understand how a store manager can be so incompetent with staff yet alone manage an entire store."
bad,"in this company you don't receive any advancement ,you work for your management team so they can go on trips earn bonuses and rewards for your hard work. you don't matter unless some one high up with power likes you..... all around worst company I have worked for!"
bad,The workers and managers were all team players. Managers forced employees to work harder than they were compensated. Hours were distributed upon favoritism and not evenly. The company should pay workers more money based on how much money the employees make the company per day. This is a big corporation and workers are treated poorly and forced to stand up for long periods of time.
bad,it was a fun place to work for a little while. then after a while hours started to get cut. pay was low and it was overall just not a good place to work no more
bad,"terrible hour, schedule wasn't solid as a part timer and they over work full timers, give hours according to how many ""hook ups"" you make a week, once had 4 hours in a week..."
bad,it was a good place had nicd staff love helping the old people get the legs back hands back there family was great love the job
bad,"I worked for the company for 4 1/2 years. For 2 1/2, u was a store manager. The tulsa district is a joke. While there were just a few managers that actually cared about their jobs, there was too much back stabbing."
bad,Awful company. Terrible pay. Theft of sales. Lack of management. No order. Scams being done in store with managers involved. Co workers made rude customers a joy to be around because they were all spiteful and grimy. You report something to management and you get in trouble for not keeping your mouth shut. Paid less than minimum wage because you work off commission yet all your co workers steal your sales so there goes your pay check. Don't waste your time.
bad,"on a typical work day, you are expect to come in and be ready to work for 8hours or more. At this job, ive learned that it is more to life than working in a factory."
bad,I loved working at Footlocker until the district manager left. After he left the new manager and assistant manager were doing illegal drugs while at work and giving discounts out to everyone. They would also leave me in the store by myself while they were doing drugs. They would also just schedule me one day a week and before I was working 3-4 days a week.
bad,working as a christmas temp cashier in one of the busiest stores. was a very bad experience for me as I was working very long hours and doing a lot of closing shifts. even if your shift finishes at 10 you will have to stay until 11. working 11 hours on boxing day I was only given 45 minute break after being lied to about receiving two breaks. the pay is awful
bad,"footlocker is not the place to be. they purposely overstaff just to cut hours and send people home. one of the managers are very petty. Its a competitive working environment, instead of working together staff is always in a rush to take one of your sales"
bad,"Terrible pay, management is terrible. Work and life balance is terrible you stay long hours for terrible pay and you don’t get raise unless you ask and they still do not give you raises. If your an AM or full time associates you will never see a check over $1000. Best thing to do is be part time."
bad,"Primary responsibilities for Foot Locker sales associate positions involve operating cash registers, assisting customers with sales, stocking and organizing shelves, and answering questions about company policies, merchandise, and services. Foot Locker sales associates generally work on foot for long periods of time."
bad,The job was stressful. Less hours and the pay was horrible. Wasn't helping me with bills. I was the only stockroom employee to fix a big stockroom and with no help.
bad,"This job was the worst job I ever had. This job takes advantage of their employees and works them like dogs. They expect you to run, skip, and hop everywhere. You work your butt off everyday to make nothing when it is pay day. You would have to sale about 10 thousand dollars just to see 100. no!"
bad,Footlocker is a horrible place to work hours are always never known company does not care about their employees at all!! Pay is horrible and you are always yelled at and treated badly
bad,"Foot Locker if not a very good company to work for. Very mean management, unfair treatment, and very selective with the enoloyees. Had two different managers will working there both very mean and picky with employees. This is not an equal opportunity place."
bad,"I worked for this group back when they were Woolworth Corp., then Venator, now Foot Locker.  If you look how competitive the ""sneaker"" industry is, you might wonder what keeps these guys in business.  If it weren't for their relationship with Nike, they'd tank.  Quite a risk of you ask me."
bad,Je ne recommanderai pas cette enseigne pour y travailler.
bad,A typical day at footlocker is usually very slow if its not the summer or a holiday. The hours are very long just because business isn't great so it leaves you with not much to do. The pay is very low and not worth the time of even working there
bad,"incompetent management."
bad,My first year was fine. My second year is when it turned sour under the new management. I would steer clear of this organization. Everything is a contest you will have managers who are nice to your face then talk behind your back the next minute. C level  has an agenda and if you are not part of that agenda you will be fired with no thought. This place is evil and is full of competitive silver spoon types. Run as fast as you can!!
bad,"You'll work a ridiculous amount of hours, especially if they're attempting to reach a quota. Management expects for you to be a robot and work, work, work. Having fun coworkers is the only way to make it through."
bad,always thinking that change is the best chance of success very little chance of a future with this company unless you conform and be something your not
bad,"I have been employed with Footlocker Inc. since November of 2001. In that time I have learned a great deal about products and services offered by Footlocker. I enjoy assisting customers, I believe that is the most enjoyable part of the job, and learning from management. The hardest part of the job in my opinion is not being able to satisfy every customer."
bad,I like that it was my first civilian job. I would like to now find a stable career while I pursue my degree.
bad,"i always was engerize, help me to find my identity, self esteem nd listening skills. gave me the ability to meet celebrity, to know the features of different sneakers for stability, comfortability. when i stay number one for my sales ability employees wanted to train them but not happy with my success"
bad,"Non consiglio a nessun di lavorare in questo posto."
bad,typical day running around greeting customers. organizing shoes. etc learned to fold shirts. hardest part staying on your feet. enjoyable talking with customers.
bad,I worked for footlocker for almost 5 years and i was underpaid and taken advantage of. Our management team was lazy and self centered and didn’t train any of the staff. They provided terrible service and i was forced to carry that burden on my shoulders and make customers feel welcome.
bad,"Overworked and underpaid. Starting pay is not all that bad out of school but they do not increase pay much for seniors, supervisors, or managers. As you move up, you can accept the joke salary or leave the company. No other option. "
bad,",I feel i was singled out because of Medical problems, I also wanted a inventory job and they did not let me have it and also they are advertizing  now."
bad,"Even though I learned a lot through my management career at this company. The pay was terrible for the amount of hardship you deal with on a daily basis with rude customer's. Upper management were never truthful, you were just another pawn to these people."
bad,"The managing staff is very disorganized in managing shifts and paying employees. Overall it was a good working environment that was fast pace and I learned to help out more than one customer at at time, in a fast and well paced timely manner."
bad,"The employees that I worked with were nice, but the lack of job security is very disconcerting. Overall, the company is nice."
bad,"If you're working here in the corporate office.. forget about it. Your bosses just look for people to blame when they are at fault. They expect you to complete task on the day it is due when they forget to ask you when they received it months ago. Then they expect flawless quality and once again, blame you for all faults."
bad,you had to work long hours everyday and weekends and holidays no time for yourself or family
bad,Working at Footlocker was nice but they did not stand up for a geat empl. after putting in years of servie.
bad,"Produktiver Arbeitsort, gutes Arbeitsklima, schönes Umfeld"
bad,"The managers bump heads a lot. It’s not very organized, and you deal with a lot of sarcastic a**holes. The work environment is okay sometimes, just have to be able to handle the pressure I guess."
bad,8 hours a week maybe.7.25 a hour with commission of 4.5% ! Not worth the ride there.The job is a joke.Footlocker needs to up its pay and drop this commission scam.
bad,Le favoritisme prône. Les sois disant responsable qui ont la vingtaine sont hautaine absolument pas compétente et compréhensive avec les nouveaux. On ne se sent pas du tout a l’aise ni à sa place à fuir.
bad,We’re going to foot locker taught me how to be more trendy how to update my wardrobe and how to keep a customer satisfaction happy with the choice of your shoe picking
bad,"First month wasn't bad I made about $200, but it’s more so a job for a teenager still in high school and living w/ their parents. Not someone who's trying to bring in a lot of money."
bad,Footlocker is by far the worst job I experienced working at they tell their part time cashiers that they’re basically in competition with they hours but don’t give you a chance to prove to them you can actually compete for hours because they give you 1 day every other week and only pay $7.25 a hour. It’s very bad management and payment there.
bad,"When i worked there over 12 years ago, there was no work life balance.  "
bad,"Bad environment to work in. "
bad,"a typical day at work required everyday duties which wasnt too bad to be honest. i learnt alot about the shoes we sold. management was horrible, main reason i lost my desire to work there. the most difficult part for me was not being able to work at the largest location in Alberta.. i always have said if you put me in the wolfs den i'll return leading the pack, and what i mean by that is i'd do beyond well at that location because i thrive in the highest amount of competition. the shoes. getting my favorite pair of shoes whenever they were available for discount was the most fun part."
bad,job wasnt what i thought it was going to be. strict and stern. manager enjoyed being intimidating rather than helping. coworkers made certain groups with each other. selfish with sales. worst part was ending my shift at 9pm and getting home at 11pm because we had to clean the store.
bad,"Power struggle within upper management. Upper management does not consult with engineering on technical decisions. Any attempt at planning is rebuffed and due to lack of planning, lots of troubleshooting."
bad,"You can really become part of a family and make some real good friends."
bad,They suck to work for. They treat you like dirt.. They only care about themselves and treat there employee's like there robots. And if you make one your out the door and don't have any health problems there try anything to get rid of you.
bad,Good company for hands on training for customer service and people skills.
bad,"Was fire because I did not disclose person information that had nothing to do with the job. I was going to sue but felt it was not worthy my time and energy. The ppl are racist, and sexist!"
bad,Whilst I was at footlocker I experienced a lot of bullying and poor management skills. However the work culture outside of my store was really motivating and had good incentives for performance.
bad,Poor communication from executives and very disorganized. Got rid of commission in 2018 so there is no longer an incentive to reach sales goals unless you're being paid salary with bonuses. The company expects too much from you while offering no appreciation in return.
bad,The company was very demanding and made you feel like you had to be fully committed to the job specially. The discount is always a nice bonus but the holidays are demanding.
bad,"Je me suis sentie mal à l’aise et mise à l’écart durant tout le temps où j’ai travaillé là-bas. Quelques réflexions sur mon travail qui n’avait pas lieu d’être. Des consignes répétitives comme ci j’étais une illettrée. Ensuite des tâches à faire sans la moindre explication et lorsque je demandais de l’aide on me disait sans cesse «  j’arrive » à la fin de ma journée , on m’a réprimandé car je n’avais pas fini et on m’a dit «  je pense que c’était à ta portée ». Bref tout ça pour dire que je n’ai pas appréciée l’ambiance trop stressante et les réflexions répétitives."
bad,"L'environnement de travail de l'entreprise foot Locker est très agréable. Malgré la volonté de l'équipe ainsi que celles des manager, les résultats ne sont pas a la hauteur des attentes du siège. La cause est sûrement la clientèle qui fréquente la boutique. Celle-ci a un faible pouvoirs d'achat, c'est donc pour cela que les clients sont souvent que de passages, et achètent rarement."
bad,Great place to start working when you are in high school. But in college not a good pay for what you do especially when being a Assistant manager. Great Environment just not good enough pay.
bad,"Foot Locker is a very unprofessional company. It is filled with lazy managers and district managers who do not like to train or help out what so ever. If you complain to corporate, they not listen or hear you out. The pay sucks especially for an Assistant Manager, you get $7.50 an hour plus 2% commission which half of the time you can never reach because you are too busy watching the floor or doing paper work. When you do not reach commission you still get $7.50 and Foot Locker gets away with paying you below minimum wage, the job is meant for you to work a lot and receive nothing in return except a 30% discount that has monthly limit. I recommend that you do not work or apply for this company, you will regret it and will find your self in a lot of stress."
bad,"Horrible place to work!!!... in a dept for 5 years and knows the dept inside and out, a girl comes in and gets lead just because she snitches on other works  to the supervisor for no valid reason... they say there's room for advancement in the company but anyone with a little schooling outside can come in and be a lead or specialist... the only bright side is if you need a job and apply they'll call you within 3 days for in interview and 80% of the time they'll hire you just because they are ALWAYS hiring ( the hiring sign is outside the building in concrete if you don't believe me)  just be warned every beginning of summer they weed people out and if they don't like you they'll set you up for termination. Pay is getting better but you'll definitely be making $12 at the most and probably start at 10.50 or 11.00."
bad,Ambiente troppo competitivo per via delle provvigioni; la scelta del personale dovrebbe essere più alta
bad,Main manager is terrible....... job is easy though but pay is not enough for what you have to put up with.Cool discount though plus advantages on shoe releases and things like that.
bad,"The job itself wasn't horrible but the management was and the company couldn't care less about their employees. You start at minimum wage and ""commission"" but it is almost impossible to reach the sales goals to achieve ANY commission. Half of the time my manager would leave to go shopping when no one in the store had clearance to do returns or handle other business matters."
bad,"Assistenza al cliente, allestimento banchi con  merce, promozione e vendita prodotti"
bad,"J’étais aux anges en entrant chez eux car j’étais fan du magasin et fier de travailler au sein d’une grosse entreprise. J’ai dû très vite comment ça l’était devenu. Compétition à l’extrême entre les vendeurs et aucun respect du client. Il y avait un tableau dans le bureau pour marquer un message au groupe, un jour c’était écrit « les allocations sont tombées alors on y va à fond, pas de pitié! Des rapports tombent toutes les heures sur vos ventes et on vous met une pression de dingue"
bad,Azienda che forma su tutto ma priva di ogni valore umano.Conta più essere ruffiani che sbattersi.Senza futuro perché a una certa età fanno di tutto per farti licenziare.District manager imbarazzante che valuta in base alle sue simpatie con cui ogni dialogo è impossibile se non si è uno yes man...esperienza da fare ma purtroppo alcuni personaggi ai piani alti la rendono un incubo.
bad,They don’t pay you the correct percentage of your sales. They scam you out of your money . The district manager is very rude . He only cares about himself .
bad,"If you dont come in at a higher salary, dont expect it unless you plan to stay for decades, and that's not a guarantee. Too many situations occur where they promote from outside the company. People are complacent in their roles and hold the same position for years."
bad,"Working there was great, I look at it as a great stepping stone to move on to something bigger and much better. Most of the staff are young and energetic which makes it a great experience to meet new people."
bad,"Horrible company to work for, awful managing staff, treat there employees horrible"
bad,"be attentive to customers"
bad,This is a part time job based on sales. And not many hours are offered.unless you are looking to work just around the holiday season then this isnt a job that will pay your bills. They also have incentives that are impossible to reach. Or only the maneger will beneifit from like he will win a vaction if his store does well.
bad,"Work 50 to 40 hours a week sometimes two,12hr shifts in a week with no lunch or 15 it was honestly it was a very bad experience being a part of management"
bad,"poor management, and super unorganized. Managers were back dooring hundreds of shoes each year and the lower tier employees get the blame for it.    g"
bad,Pour former au poste de vendeur il n y a pas mieux.  La relation avec le client se fait de manière naturelle et décontracté. Les challenges boostent. Par contre il faut tomber dans une bonne équipe et avoir une très bonne ambiance. Et s'accrocher à la pression pour relever les challenges.
bad,Foot Locker is a good part time/ summer job. Discounts are amazing for a sneaker fanatic. Management is not good and little room to improve.
bad,Cet entreprise est super bien même leurs équipe. C'est mon domaine parce que j'aime le sport.
bad,"A typical day at work can be very overwhelming, the is always something to do be there is alot to handle especially when the store is busy and you are the cashier and you have millions of tasks to complete."
bad,great fun working environment...pay is not very good or economic for today
bad,Treated very badly. Lack of training and praise from management. Negative atmosphere. They focus on negatives constantly and never positives. Very draining place to work
bad,Hours work were flexible training sessions were very informative communication was very up to par the work was fairly easy overtime was very much available benefits were lovey
bad,Non è un azienda che va avanti per meritocrazia.. Ma anzi....!
bad,"Viel Stress, weniger Lohn, Chef ist fast immer schlecht gelaunt. Keines Privatleben!"
bad,I worked hard and gave them 15 years of my life and was terminated for no reason. They played favoritism for the ones they liked the most. I really loved my job
bad,"Footlocker is downright a typical job for students looking for a PT job. Weekly hours range from 4-10 hours weekly, mostly commission based!!! Room for growth yet managers are barely bringing home 25k annually! Aside from the employee discount, it’s not a career and I wouldn’t recommend working at Footlocker unless you’re willing to make little to no money!!!"
bad,"With footlocker I enjoyed that my manager always pushed us to interact with the customer, even if it was just to spark up conversation. It was like an ice breaker but this job isn't for someone trying to work full time because it is retail you wont get as much hours as you desire."
bad,they give you so much do to for bad pay. they promote you to assistant manager and still pay minimum wage. you are your own security janitor salesman everything they literally make you do everything and act like its an easy and prestigious job I would only work here if this was my first job or I really liked shoes since the 30% discount wasn't too bad
bad,"Constant changes in management, restructuring, and reorganizations mean you never know who you are reporting to.   Many managers and supervisors were let go, or are leaving because they are scared for their jobs that most of us don't have guidance and the people we report to are too busy to give support or assistance.  It really is a sink or swim atmosphere."
bad,footlocker dont give more hours.you can work 3 hours and they let you go home.how can you survive to take care of your self.very rude and disrespectful management and racism is all they do
bad,perfect job for customer friendly employees. also a good job for people that are looking for a flexible work schedule so if you are a student this type of job is good for you in my opinion.
bad,this is the worst workplace ever. there were plenty of times the residence tried to attack me through the receptionist window. the visitors were bad as well. it was a very bed environment and i will not work there ever again.
bad,working at lady foot locker was the worst decision of my life. the pay was terrible and the employees that work there are even worst. do not apply there.
bad,If the advancement opportunities were available in the company I would not be seeking other employment.
bad,Not in business anymore So there's not much to say about the location. No longer present
bad,Management was horrible. Pay was even worse. Employees were treated unfairly.
bad,"good people fun times a lot of training, learn everyday in the heart of nyc, meeting lots of people"
bad,was my first job and was a good company but i wouldnt work there again
bad,I loved working at foot locker inc.My co workers were very friendly and provided customers with their every need.
bad,"At this particular company they had no set training, they would simply clock you in and they send you off on the sales floor."
bad,They will run you until your dry make you feel important downside you spend your paycheck right back with them so they keep winning you pay them they pay you
bad,"ccc Working at FH has been an overwhelmingly positive experience. From the beginning of my time here I’ve felt respected and valued as an employee. The pay, retirement and benefits are all very good, and the work is incredibly rewarding. Most of the people I’ve worked with thus far are very smart and talented, and genuinely care about the mission."
bad,Working at The 42nd street location especially was very unprofessional. Favoritism and bias towards workers depends on the hours given. I would not recommend the job for anyone
bad,"best place to work for teens , no  real advancement or opportunities , the only people making money is the big wigs that sit in the office all day , they force sales but don't equip the store with new hot items all of those items go to bigger stores in big cities"
bad,i learned at footlocker how the customer service world works and how to be a good sales associate. In a typical day at work you are either helping customers find the merchandise they need or in the stock room organizing merchandise.
bad,Would never work there again.  ....very poor staff. Unfriendly  co workers. ......Poor management...........unfair pay....  poor hours............... .
bad,SO many violations within this company. Hard work goes unrecognized with the wrong management in place. I dont know about now but in the early 2000's management was really bad as well as customer service..
bad,"Management is very poor. I hated every minute of working there and it was very unorganized. There was training that was supposed to be done, only certain people even finished it. If the store gets robbed (which happens a lot) It is your fault. Fake/stolen credit card, it is your fault. If you sell shoes online then you get in trouble regardless if they were bought with your discount. Very short breaks. The hiring process for a cashier job is literally a competition. Management always is putting you down and the backroom is super unorganized."
bad,typical work day is long hours no breaks poor upper mgmt fun exciting environment if you are a peoples person. Great discounts  great shoes delivers excellent customer experiences.
bad,It was a very slow paced work environment. Based on commission. Store manager was slack and made the assistant managers work from open till close without being able to leave the store for breaks.
bad,"I would recommend this job to students, part timers but not to adult looking for a job to progress with families. "
bad,I feel that this company is all about the numbers i.e. sales of shoes. therefore many associates are under appreciated and pushed excessively to meet sales quotas.
bad,People on the floor were nice to work with. Place was very disorganized.
bad,"Not wanting to continue in current position, but rather advance within the company proved a turning point in my supervisor's opinion towards my work ability. I was unable to endure nore allowed to advance out of the department."
bad,If you sleep with the DM you could get promoted and he'd care about your complaints.
bad,This job requires you to work many hours and time is limited for your family. Management is extremely unfair.
bad,Very demanding work place with sales quotas and unstable working hours. The wages are bad and the atmosphere at work is very clicky.
bad,"I’ve worked at a footlocker Newmarket upper Canada mall  and got  no hours. Managers hog all hours and leave everyone else to one day a week. "
bad,"had a good time learning the shoes business, would have loved to learn about sales on another level but wasn't offered.Competitive and fast learning, Good job and good place to work"
bad,"It is extremely hard to move up in this company, and they never offered any raises. I liked working with the people, but the overall environment was not positive."
bad,footlocker was the worst place i worked for period. it was more of an work by intimidation type environment and i constantly felt like i was walking on egg shells
bad,Het moeilijkste van het werk is het op neer moeten rennen om schoenen te pakken uit de magazijn en zoveel mogelijk moeten verkopen voor je bonus
bad,"ritmi assolutamente impensabili che non gratificano per nulla il dipendente."
bad,"typical day was sell shoes and socks"
bad,this company could be a good place to work for if they cared about their employees. there's a lot of favoritism shown especially towards hispanics you only get ahead according to who you know.
bad,no one can live off that. not enough hours. rude ppl management didnt work together
bad,"this place treats all its staff who do not work @ a dm or higher level basically like slaves even management, pay is deplorable for the positions management gets less than 14 an hour to do a job that's worth 17-19 an hour anywhere else for the same amount of work, the AM's get little better than minimum wage, and they over hire not managements doing head office again."
bad,"Werkelijk gaaf bedrijf om voor te werken, echter is de cultuur ongezond en de integriteit van het management ver te zoeken. Geen goede plek om nu te werken."
bad,management was very immature and do not know how to train people. Basically leave you to learn and fend for yourself and they blame you for your lack of growth. That and the
bad,Upper management turns you against each other. A lot more mingling and friendly batter rather than being progressive. I had a complaint about the district manager and called Fair Employment office they didn't get back with me until 2 weeks later. I actually called and left a voicemail 2x. They changed the pay scale so the employees don't make as much commission. Bonuses aren't enough for the amount of work the assistant is required to do. Very fun environment if its being run the right way tho. I enjoyed the training of the new employees young and old and the wide range of customers.
bad,I thought things were good until I was promoted to full time and no one communicated that as full time you make less than 7.00$ however at pt you make 9.75 both positions come with commissions and a AM gets salary with a bonus every month
bad,You dedicate your whole life to working not a understanding company very low pay for long hours and hard work and travel company doesn’t really care for their workers it’s all about what only benefits them
bad,"Working here was okay. A typical day at work was hectic and competitive. You are required to sell a certain amount every work week. And if you dont meet the requirements, you were punished for it."
bad,"The job itself is laid back and chill but you do so much extra work to only be getting paid 7.25. They don’t give you any lunch breaks. The manager does nothing but sit in the back on the phone or eating, while we stand in the front and work. The discounts are pointless because it doesn’t change a difference in the price. The job just isn’t worth it."
bad,"It's not a bad starting job to learn and gain skills. But after awhile, so many people fly through the company, there is no consistency. I have gone through 5 managers, and over 30 co-workers, I have trained 5 stock clerks in the 5 years that I've been here."
bad,"When I first started at the company it actually was fun working for the company, once I started to get transferrred to new locations some challenges came about that I wasn't comfortable with."
bad,"***DISCLAIMER: I WORKED AT THE CORPORATE OFFICE IN THE CUSTOMER CONTACT CENTER. THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO RETAIL POSITIONS.***"
bad,The hours are too unpredictable. Management needs a major improvement. I learned how to care for my work though. The job taught me how to take pride in my work.
bad,"To be part time is ok. Management will convince you to do things you don't want to do like skip school to work, or make you feel like you have no choice but to say yeah. Hours depend on how well you work and how much you can book. They make sure that you know you are easily replaced. No respect. No team effort. Everyone is for themselves. Stealing sales. Management does not do anything about your concerns. Overall good place to work but prepare to be stressed."
bad,I made the mistake of having a work relationship and post relationship I was fired over a false statement. FEP is horrible.
bad,Worked many 12 hour days when the scheduled hours were for five eights. Worked to many weekends. Kept changing start times. Wouldn't let You have time off when needed. Work many hours for weeks then it would slow down and you would be lucky to get twenty hours.
bad,An environment were your day can be determined by customers or the typer of relationship you have with peers. You have to thrive in communication and be aggressively assertive in attempting to be helpful.
bad,"This job has a lot of pressure put on its sales associate, and even more once you become a member of management. It would be worth it if one were to be paid good but that is not the case in this job."
bad,"I started working at Kids Foot Locker, I did get some experience I would only get scheduled twice a week, The managers barely taught me anything I had to learn from my co-workers and I also felt like my managers got use to the people she works with so I didn't fit into footlocker due to the fact that she was not welcoming towards me. I do miss the job but I want to work at a different foot locker were I can actually show my progress and customer care."
bad,The pay was below standard for those in management positions. The benefits were also below standard. There was very little professionalism amongst management and employees. The hardest part of the job was quality control (theft prevention).
bad,"Die Aggressive Verkaufs Methode ist schlecht. Es wird sehr gestresst, weil die anderen Filialen miteinander Konkurrieren."
bad,some days were slower than others. the hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers.
bad,"Dans une journée typique, la priorité est le ""client"", bien conseiller et bien servir le client est primordial pour atteindre les objectifs demandés. Il faut aussi s'acquitter des tâches annexes tels que la gestion des stocks et le merchandising. La partie managment est prise en charge par le manager qui ne fait que déléguer et impose à ses subordonnés donc la communication se fait uniquement d'amont en aval. Le travail s'effectue en équipe avec d'autres vendeurs présents sur la surface de vente. L'aspect le plus difficile à ce type de poste est l'ennui qui peut s'installer au fil des années car les tâches deviennent répétitives ainsi que les perspectives d'évolution de carrière quasi nulles. L'aspect le plus agréable se situe dans la gamme de produits qui est très variée et renouvellée très régulièrement ainsi qu'un grand nombre d'exclusivité de l'enseigne Footlocker.  "
bad,A typical day will be cleaning the store making it presentable to the public.
bad,"A typical day at my work would be opening the store, refilling floor stock, opening both registers, pushing every sale and making sure my team and I make more sales than our daily goals, and most of all making sure every customer leaves happy!"
bad,I worked as a manager for four years and was recently told suddenly i do not have the skill set to be a manager. i myself would spend some of my own time during days off to make sure my stores were successful and this is what it got me there is no employee loyalty at all.
bad,"Open and close store, hold safe key and deposit money at end of day, I learned how to direct employees and motivate them to reach sales goals"
bad,When I started at Footlocker I was a junior in High School. Footlocker gave me my first opportunity to work and make my on money. The major benefit of working for the company was the discounts on sneaker and items I would usually pay full price for.
bad,"Ambiente lavorativo stimolante a seconda della professionalità dello store manager del punto vendita,  "
bad,"Fun place to work under the correct management team and alongside productive coworkers. Work environment teaches employees to be alert and aware of products on the sales floor. Workplace culture has shifted over recent years, now has many younger employees."
bad,"I constantly requested for more knowledge and more information on how to advance,  but it really felt that since I was going to school it nearly prohibited me from moving forward within the company. Many places would love to see you strive with education, but I did not get that from Footlocker."
bad,Poor Upper Management. Very Corporate and task can only be done one way. No change happening as they preach change. Same   people working there for years with no chance real change taking place or thoughts from the outside welcome.
bad,It was an okay student job. The pay was very minimal and not a lot of hours for work were provided. There were a lot of coworkers. The mission of Foot Locker was well followed however.
bad,"Overworked and underpaid.  Pay increases are quite low.  Upper management work hard to keep raises below the cost of living increase, due to not meeting sales expectations. Have never had such low increases in any other job."
bad,Lack of training i was at my current store 06916. This store made me lose my passion for this job they never wanted to do anything but sit down and be on they phone poor customer service
bad,"management is very poor and they have favorites that they give priority over other employees"
bad,"They make you work 60+ hours a week, they don't give you overtime, they don't compensate you, if you work until midnight they expect you back there at 5am to open the store. They treat you like you are nothing, if you have an issue with a customer they always take the side of the customer. The closest thing to describe working at foot locker is slavery."
bad,You are not appreciated in the job. It does not matter how hard you work or how well you perform as there are no evaluations to help you in career advancement
bad,Great opportunities for those who are creative and fluent to an ever-changing environment. Lots of communication with outside teams as well as managing inside relationships to continually push the business forward.
bad,If you have the right manger than you'll love the job of not you will hate it the discount and benefits were okay though would be a great part timed your need one
bad,Foot Locker demands so much but offers so little. My District Manager mislead me as to how much I was supposed to be making in relation to how much volume my store was bringing in.
bad,learnt about up selling  staff friendly and helpful did not  enjoy the hours and working weekends discount on trainers were good
bad,Typical day was slow if we got any packages in we would scan them and put ink tags on clothes and put them out on the floor. when we got shoe shipment we would stock them in the back. I learned how to send shoes out and mail them and how to enter it in the computer. Management was really rude but stuck with it and was always kind no matter who it was. The most enjoyable part was helping out customers and picking the right shoe for them.
bad,"Management will stand in their office looking out the window at the pouring rain as their employees struggle to find shelter and ask us to hang in there until it stopped.  They scream at you for every little thing but lack proper training. They show favoritism, so if youre not kissing butt youre stuck getting paid minimum wage."
bad,Work was some what busy but overall it was stressful when it would come to release date shoes because customers would act crazy and fight. I learned how to be a team leader while working at Footlocker and my co workers got along with me very well. The hardest part about the job was dealing with difficult customers mostly because nine time out of ten they would get out of control and make a scene. Even thought this job was stressful i enjoyed working with people and learning new things about shoes.
bad,"If you think competing for sales and ducking the district manager's attitude is a good way to work weekly, then this is the job for you."
bad,"a typical day consist of helping customers fined proper athletic footwear based on their individual need, while pushing socks, cleaners and apparel. You have to maintain an average of two items per transaction.Most of the time there was only one or two employees in the day time to help customers on the sales floor ring customers up or process returns, maintain a neat store front and receive, stock and fill  daily shipments and on line orders. Brakes and lunches were never taken as scheduled due to the fact that you didn't want to loose your commission. As a manager I felt that the pay did not match the responsibility taken on by being a manager. I some times worked 52 hrs a week due to the lack of Managers to cover shifts. Getting sick or having an emergency was not an option. This job was my life and It literally caused me to have a nervous brake down."
bad,As store manager my job was not that demanding because I worked for the company 4 years and knew the business well. Meeting new people everyday and talking to them is fun. I have met a different number of celebrities at the locations I worked at. I love most of my coworkers that I worked with and the 30% off of most shoes and apparel. I manager of the year awards and sales leadership awards. There are a lot of people that are snakes including my former boss who was the district manager. Everyone walks on eggshells because of some of the mangers in the district that believed they were Gods or something. I never kissed anyones behind and just worked my tail off. Because of the snake district manager who didnt like me for personal reason and threatened I would come for his job is what lead to my wrongful termination.
bad,Sales driven company.  Heavy influence of athletics and sports.
bad,"Management training was very slow and at times non-existent. High turn-over rates, constantly changing managers and trainers, making training very inconsistent. Upper management such district managers were rude, cold, and completely focused on everything but the individuals stores, and the staffing and product needs. Down-sized many positions without proper notification to employees. Gained great management experience from the few training modules I was able to complete, but outside of that I'm glad it was just a college job."
bad,I learned the meaning behind customer service and how it can be applied to any setting.
bad,"My manager barely came to work. When he did decide to swing by, it was to make sure everything was in place. My co-workers usually were stuck up and usually had a bad attitude. My pay was not good at all."
bad,"Saling, stocking, working the register"
bad,"Les clients sont super dans ce foot locker, une chose qui dérange on doit forcer pour vendre des produits qui ne veulent pas c'est pas agréable. Si on n'en vends pas on nous fait comprendre qu'on a rien à faire chez foot locker."
bad,Not enough shifts available to work due to the amount of people hired. i was only scheduled for 1 3 hour shift in a two week period.Work atmosphere was positive.
bad,"Management is terrible."
bad,"The job was ok at first. The problem is they promote youth over experience to keep pay low  They also don’t pay non-management well either, minimum wage. The job is not for you if you have family as u work most weekends and all holidays. Promotions are based off of favoritism and youth. If you’re looking for a dead end career, this job’s for you. Total waste of my time. 10 years plus. Upper management could use a lesson in professionalism"
bad,I usually was the one running back and forth in the back of the store to get everyone’s shoes. I liked the company. I like the discount a lot more. Felt that the organization could’ve been a lot better
bad,"They just didn't give me any hours to work. When I was pregnant I had problems (fainted and kept feeling sick), the manager told me to come back to work after giving birth and once everything was taken care of but once everything was taken care of, the manager never gave me my job back. Literally, they would sometimes give you once a week or twice a week to work which sucks."
bad,"Well, I see people being short  but I'm going be the guy to keep it 100000 percent REAL WITH YOU."
bad,Always have to be on ur heels never a dull moment working for footlocker . I Always try to treat my customers with the up most respect . Footlocker Also helped me with my personal life .
bad,Fast alles war negativ. Aufstiegschancen waren da aber keiner wollte sie wirklich nutzen da das Unternehmen sehr unzuverlässig war. Überstunden ohne Ende und die Bezahlung folgte auch nicht nach Vertragsvereinbarung sondern wurde von Monat zu Monat per E-Mail geändert.
bad,Very difficult to make enough to pay bills and feed family on this salary.  The leaders rotate often which requires you to readjust with no problem.  Must look at another job that can offset salary when starting at an entry level.
bad,"Started off as a great and enjoyable job, management decisions company-wide have cut into employee incentive to work. Promotions looked promising, and then pay cuts were made, leaving employees with little to look forward to."
bad,It wasnt that great they stopped giving commision and they pay barely pay eight dollars an hour. I wouldnt suggest part time for anyone over 18. Its okay if you have no real bills to pay.
bad,horrible pay. no hours. and very little room for advancement especially if your new. the only positive was the 30 percent discount you get... and even then you might end up spending your little paycheck on sneakers.
bad,There’s a very hard and heavy work load in every single store but if you manage to work up to the top spot of being a manager be prepared for everything to come down onto your head literally. The upper management is never satisfied and will not be happy with anything you produce even if you’re the top store one week and both so hot the next. It’s very much a hurry up and wait type of environment. They preach about being able to relate to their customers but most people in H/O have yet to be seen in a daily store operations anytime.
bad,"This is it, the most basic service job besides drive thru at McDonald's. A good way to build your resume for the job you really want. Flexible hours too."
bad,"Delivering sales , customer experience , merchandising , visual , and operational expectations. Ensuring high levels of customer satisfaction by being knowledgeable on all products offered , and teaming..."
bad,the way the stores were ran in the southern Ontario region is beyond explanation. Its with reason they're closing so many locations. Almost all of us were screwed out of any compensation.
bad,Buena Compañia para jovenes por su ambiente y los ayudan a desempeñarse en todo aspecto laboral.
bad,Love working for this company. Throughout my time here I have learned a lot about being manager and most of all a leader. If anyone whom never had an management position this it the place to learn your skills from.
bad,I know they're trying to profit and run a business but pushing high school kids to the point of crying trying to get them to up-sell customers and get 'hook-ups' is absurd. The pressure to sell more is unreal. I don't know what kind of kickback the managers get back from getting a certain amount of 'hook-ups' but it must be sweet because they are on your back constantly about them. If there wasn't this pressure 100% of the time the job would be pretty sweet!
bad,"I only stayed for the 30% off discount. The managers were mean, disrespectful, and gossiped about current or former employee's in the inventory room or during closing. The training was very short, a lot of workers didn't know how to sell to customers. Your sales would get stolen by co-workers, the job pay was based on commission. The workers were very disrespectful, a lot of gossip was going around about different workers, which was EXTREMELY unprofessional for the Footlocker Inc. cooperation."
bad,Very collegiate environment and can be a great place to work if you work in the right department / for the right manager.  Pay is OK if you're young and don't have a family.
bad,"Foot Locker laid me off. I enjoyed working there and the people but believe I was let go so others could be promoted which I find unfair and my age was also a reason for their decision. There are employees that have been there for 40 years and because they did not have a degree, they could not be promoted.  Very discriminating."
bad,"Foot Locker is one of those stores that you will be inclined to spend your money at if you work there. However, with the low wage that they pay you, you will often find yourself unable to save money. As a cashier, I only made $0.25 above minimum wage, with no chance of a raise. There were some weeks during the slow season where I would only get 4 hours a week. As a part-timer, I never worked 40 hours in a week, the max they would give me was 30."
bad,Poor organization and no room for career development. It's ok if you are right out of college. The facilities are outdated and good luck trying to get a manager to talk with about your future or any problems you are having.
bad,"Bon setier pour les vendeur en magasin, dynamique."
bad,non enjoyable poor staff conditions and lack of commuication standards throught the company. with there old fshioned slow ways of doing buisness are being outdated. and the fact they force staff into selling terribly made products that rae bad for peoples health.
bad,"although the discounts were amazing, this is not necessarily the place to work at if you have a family. most like any retail company you work for the hours will be crazy and takes time away from your family."
bad,If you're looking for a place to waste 4 hours of your day every other day then this is the job for you. The pay is so low they say you get commission but it NEVER adds up. Management is pretty cool but like any other manager they have their days.
bad,The place is to competitive and they aren't to welcoming. They strive to make sure the company ceo is happy before their employers.
bad,"making commission based sales. the pay is very low, I learned to make sales. the hardest part of the job is low pay. workers are usually nice. managers are not always qualified for job."
bad,"i liked the job and all but just because of emergencies and my week immune system i was left without a job cause i missed 5 days out of my 90 day probationary period. and yet there was no communication between the employees, meaning important information never gets up the food chain, i was having a rough couple of weeks cause of the seasons changing from spring to summer and couldn't travel from my apartment in the Bronx to the store location on 47th st and Broadway. if you were to get a new employee and they told you and their health issues and prior surgeries( 14 to be exact) in the left ear and you were to let this person take the job wouldn't you tell the supervisor or head Loss prevention agent to talk to HR and let them know this is a sick one but very good at their job and have them consider keeping the position permanent. anyway rambling on. good job, great location, bad communication."
bad,i usually went to work and the morning and prepared for shipment to arrive. after i had to figure what and where new merchandise had to go in the store. i was fun doing my job at first with management and other employees until change of management and i was inadmissible
bad,This company is in it for themselves only no type of employee incentives we do all the hard work just for a pat on the back.
bad,"very little pay, definitely depends on which foot locker you are working at."
bad,"Help customers, show demos of shoe cleaner etc. keep store in order/clean, I've only worked low hours making at least $50.00 every two weeks. my co-workers were always friendly and helpful. The part I enjoy most about my job is helping customers find what they need."
bad,A typical day at work I come in on time and start my daily job.
bad,it really helped my experience in sales and i learned alot about my products and really grew with the company
bad,"Foot Locker as a whole is a great company, as long as you have no family, friends, don't need Sundays or holidays off (ever), and don't want any real advancement in the company. If you work in San Diego you will have a DM that doesn't care about his employees needs or the stores needs. The only way you will be rewarded is by the brief moments you are allowed with each customer (I say brief because the customers and shoppers are broken down into one of three groups; shoplifters, window shoppers or unsuspecting victims). The companies goal (at least in the San Diego area) sell them anything that we have, even if its damaged or outdated and no you can not get discounts unless you're a VIP member. Forgot your coupons? don't worry they wont take your word for it. Employee purchasing something? Well, don't buy for the whole family because the company doesn't want to loose money and No they wont give you the newest items first or before your shift because you have to work later on and only the customer can wear these. Finally, if you participate in any company competitions don't expect to receive your prize for your job well done, only your manager (the one with the hangover that only works in the back office) can collect on His prize and yours will always be ""in transition""."
bad,Co-workers at my locations were emotionally and verbally abusive. outside of the workforce 1 continues to verbally and physically abuse me.          .
bad,"Ständig stress och väldigt lite uppskattning är helhetsintrycket på Foot Locker. "
bad,It was okay just didn't fit what I wanted to do. Need something that's going to challenge me more and make me grow personally and also professionally.
bad,"The best part working for them is discount for you n your family like you mom,dad,brother and sister and also you can use your discount at other footlock store in canada"
bad,The Foot Locker office in Camp Hill does not reflect at all the diversity that they are always bragging about. There is no room for growth  for individuals who do not have degrees. Experience means nothing.
bad,Not at all an ideal place for a family man.  When you have small children you want to spend time with them.  But working retail that made it very difficult.
bad,I did not enjoy working in the Harlem store where I was moved after training and orientation. The store was poorly managed. I also did not like the way the customers and store personnel interacted with each other. Not recommended.
bad,"Working here was the most stressed that I have ever been. Leaving work every day was liberating, and going in to work was a chore. A majority of the customers that you would assist will yell at you, spout profanities, and try to get under your skin. Management was not overly poor, however, there is room for improvement."
bad,"Like any retail outlet, the focus is on selling.  Unfortunately, this is really just an entry level employer, so compensation (back in the day) was pretty horrific - that's likely changed now with Minimum Wage Requirements.  When I worked there - ages ago - there was a robust management training program."
bad,As a “part-time” employee I was working 30-40 hours a week and manager wouldn’t work well on my schedule with family and other things I had to do. Best thing were the chill assistant managers.
bad,six 02/ lady's foot-locker is slow pace at times and you have to try to sale something to every customer that walks in the door in order to meet the daily goal.
bad,"A typical day would consist of an extreme competitive environment. My first day on the job, I had to make an insane goal. After not meeting my goal, my manage threatened to fire me."
bad,"I worked there over the summer and it was not an enjoyable place yo be, and because we get paid commision, you have to fight to get your own sales or you dont make any money. The fact we only got paid a little over minimum wage did not help the case either. The management was very lazy and unprepared, the stockroom was always a mess and unorganized, would never recommend someone working there."
bad,Great job for a young person that likes retail.  This job isn't for everyone.  High pressure to sell more products to customers.  Turnover makes it a hard place to work.
bad,"i started at lady footlocker and that experience was amazing. i learned so much in management duties. but as far as footlocker, it was a horrible time. management and the dm were horrible. they cared for themselves and their needs . swept way too much under the rug ."
bad,My job entailed me to basically babysit a bunch of over sheltered 20 year old kids and cater to the most over privileged generation of adults I have ever seen.  All this whilst kissing the ring of foolish people who have some sense of entitlement that is never earned but just.....expected.
bad,"Footlocker was a competition, your pay was mainly based on commissions and you always had to compete with team members just to get a sale. It was a bit overwhelming and work hours weren't good."
bad,"Expect nothing but poor pay and short hours. Over staffed for the most part which,caused problems for a lot of problems. Poor management,and poor customer service."
bad,Nothing really to say...the job is ok I guess....regular retail stuff. Been years since I worked there so I don’t know what has changed.  Great for kids in college
bad,"Work itself wasn't a problem, but management is terrible, restrooms for employees are a disgrace, too much favoritism and unprofessional behavior, people talking behind your back, etc"
bad,"The job itself is fairly straightforward, and I enjoy working with my coworkers a lot - everyone is generally helpful and willing to do whatever it takes to get orders completed and on to the next department. However, the hours required of an Artist are far more extensive than what was advertised and what was explained in the hiring process. The Art team worked five straight months of mandatory overtime in 2017, starting in mid-July and not ending until December. Overtime consists of 9.5-hour days and working every other Saturday (typically for 8 hours). While we were paid time and a half, the work-life balance was nonexistent and morale throughout the team was very low. "
bad,Working at Foot Locker has taught me everything I know about customer service and sales. The company as a whole needs to be revamped and I believe lower level employees are not treated fairly. From the low pay to the long hours and all the expectations that the company expects.
bad,Footlocker is a great place for social purposes. The people you work with is usually okay but the pay and requirement do not match up at all. Not recommend for skilled workers.
bad,"I always feel 'to each is own"", Foot Locker is definitely a major company that brings in a lot of money. What I really don't like is there is no room for advancement. Location is key in this business to be successful. It is possible to be a Co or Store manager but advancing to District Manager or Corporate is slim to none especially without a college education."
bad,This job is great for people in school. Don't look at his job for anything else but to be in school. Doesn't pay well and not a lot of hours. Management was terrible.
bad,"Footlocker company is okay to work for it isn't the best retail company you can work for, Very slow at my location and time went by slow. most of the time the customers were rude and didn't have any respect."
bad,"Footlocker Inc. is good for those that are looking for a second part time job or that are going to school and looking for a part time job.  The company is very flexible when it comes to school schedules however not so much when it comes to another job. The training is very hands on and well documented which is helpful for those that are nervous or shy when it comes to trying to sell. The hardest part of the job is making sure that you do not let your task work distract you form getting to your customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to build relationships with your customers and seeing them leave happy. Footlocker Inc. tries to create the culture that hard work is recognized and advancement opportunities are plentiful. However, it is not the work that is recognized but the yes men and brown nosers."
bad,"Manager is great and friendly who will do everything to help you out however upper management doesn't care. If you are planning on switching positions good luck might as well find a new job, no rehires because they look at it as betrayal and there is little to no room for advancement"
bad,The job was great enjoyed going to work every day but the manger in the Thunder Bay location is impleasable  and completely unappreciative of his staff!
bad,"the manger lies a lot, really need better management or get a better manager. cant really make friends in the workplace. hours are okay not the best if you're looking for a job and a good paycheck this inst the job."
bad,"Very short shifts (3 hours), and would sometimes get cut with only an hours notice. The overall environment was good because I learned a lot, but wish I was provided with more opportunity and time to learn."
bad,"NO hours . but its easy for a younger person looking for a first time job. The commissions not too bad though, Very easy job with little pay . management is alright"
bad,"company expects a lot with very low pay and stores that were under staffed. fast paced, customer service job. very busy back to school season and the holiday season"
bad,"Retail sales with a pay plan that could be better at all levels. Lots of work for little reward. Best for a part time gig while in school, full time can be rough."
bad,"ayant été employé dans cette entreprise il font miroiter une carrière et des perspectives d'évolutions pour les personnes motivés mais lorsque que nous sommes face à des responsables qui ne sont eux même pas motivés et n'ayant pas envie de voir les autres les dépasser et aller plus loin qu'eux cela reste un frein énorme."
bad,pas de commentaires particulier . Une bonne structure cependant
bad,"Got no shifts, wasn't able to communicate with any of my workers including my supervisor. Wasn't able to establish any sort of colleugue relationships due to the tense environment."
bad,"As a former employee I had to find a better job. Management doesn't want to help you to grow within the company and you get barely any hours a week, this definitely is a job for someone in high school if you want only 8 hours per week. The only benefit is the employee discount and the employee promotions Foot Locker does. Foot Locker is a great company but management is just for themselves."
bad,"Not much to say. Great food and service overall. "
bad,"I really enjoy working at Foot Locker because it incorporates all the things I enjoy doing in a job - being able to move around and not be in one spot all day, talking to people about training and helping them find the perfect shoes, and selling things. It's also great to be surrounded by tons of shoes if you're passionate about them and always get excited for new releases."
bad,"For a typical day, my location was slow which I somewhat enjoyed, help customers when they come, take care of tasks around the store, basic things for the most part. Management was sloppy and underhanded, personally in my store as well as higher up on a district level. Co-workers are all cordial. Hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers but the most enjoyable part was the fact we did not have too many customers to begin with so for the most part I was just watching the store."
bad,"Only got paid $6.25 an hour. Didn't know it was COMMISION until I started. For the first like 2 1/2 weeks or so, I sat in the back doing workbooks so, I didn't get opportunities to even get commission. Because of that, I could be there 20 hours a week and only have a check for less than $100. When I finally got onto the sales floor, I was trained so much on how to sale shoes that I wasn't really taught where specific shoes were located. I would feel bad because I would have a customer waiting 5+ minutes because I had no knowledge of the stock room. My location ended up closing about a month after I started."
bad,this was one of my first jobs and going into it so young i loved it becasuse i just became a sneaker head. but going into management it sucked. they do not take care of there employees when you get higher up.
bad,"capi arroganti e per niente amichevoli."
bad,A typical day at work started with logging into my computer and cleaning off my desk... We were assigned small desks that other co workers used and they usually were not clean about using day shifts work areas.  I learned very fast not to keep anything important at my desk when I leave.  My co-workers were very self centered.  The hardest part of my job was the small isle we had to work in with at least 30 other employees and try to block out the sound of everyone else.  I really enjoyed training weeks when I was the trainer to our new co-workers in the department.  I trained 2-3 people at once in a quiet area where I can really show them how to do the job correctly.
bad,Looking for growth and i want to develop more skills for possible careers.
bad,I like the atmosphere and the idea behind the whole sales program but I just felt as though the program was not geared towards anyone except upper management and the rest of us where just kind of there...
bad,kids foot locker doesn't have enough hrs. and pays very little.
bad,Hectic work environment. Always something to do. Time flies by when working. Management was strict. I learned organization and presentation.
bad,"Learned how to work the POS system. "
bad,It was one of my first jobs. Part time and never gave me hours. They had poor managers who where never on task. Or doing there own thing. The worst job Ive had yet. Would never go back to work for them
bad,"FootLocker’s sales associates play a very important role in the company, particularly in each retail outlet because every employee strives to offer exceptional customer service and assistance to every customer. The appearance of FootLocker’s sales associate uniforms is highly recognized and well known for resembling a referee’s uniform."
bad,fun working people but only was a intern so learned everything but didn't get payed for it but still a good experience
bad,"journée de 10h à 19h30"
bad,was very short days that were far and few between was not interested in sales but stuck through it for extra money while I was attending college
bad,"I thought I was going to work for a company that prides itself in how well it treats customers and employess, unfortunately that was NOT the case, as I found out in the time I worked for them. I pride myself in my work ethics and with this company I cannot perform to my own expectations. Shame that footlocker was such a disappointment. I enjoyed serving my customers."
bad,A typical day at work consist of daily operations of the store and setting sales goals and meeting budget. Checking and processing shipment. Making sure sales floor is well attended to insure exceptional customer service. I've learned to be very patient with this line of work. Every customer has different personalities and different needs. You just have to have the skill to adapt to those obligations. I became a manager three months after starting as a full-time sales associate. I've managed 7-15 associates. I make sure all associates are trained and ready for the next step in their retail career. Have trained many part-time associates that have became successful Assistant Managers. My co-workers varies from High school and College students to adults. I had to learn how to understand different personalities and see how they best fit the working environment. The hardest part of my job is finding the next associate that has potential in working in the field of retail. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers who don't have a clue as to what they need or are looking for. It's rewarding for me knowing that I made a difference in someone's life simply by doing my job.
bad,Typical day at work is assisting customers with the sale of shoes and accessories. Process inventory and shipment.
bad,"Work is not really challenging. Management is mostly men and most of the business is very chauvinistic. If you are a woman, your chances of getting into upper management in something other than HR is slim to none. For the most part, co-workers are very nice and very from all walks of life. The most enjoyable part of this job is the benefit package. The pay is not even enough to support any kind of family."
bad,workers compensation need to be reviewed to give employee a better leverage of sales.
bad,If working in Division 3 good luck getting anywhere beyond the position you were hired for and it seems to me like no one lasts very long there. They expect the most out of you but hardly provide the tools needed.
bad,"Pas de travail d’équipe, du chacun pour soi, dommage"
bad,"Sei sempre sotto pressione. Preparati a ritrovarti sempre un manager o uno shift leader che ti fissa pronto a riprenderti per qualsiasi piccolo errore tu faccia. L’ambiente peró varia di negozio in negozio, o più precisamente dalla grandezza del negozio. Se ti ritrovi in un negozio piccolo ti va anche bene, magari guadagni di meno perché c’è poco flusso, ma ritrovi uj ambiente di lavoro stimolante in cui puoi crescere non solo in ambito lavorativo ma anche personale e si creano buoni rapporti. Se invece ti ritrovi in uno store un po’ più grande, le dinamiche cambiano. La performance sarà sempre sotto controllo e giudicata a fine giornata. Non importa se sarai un buon venditore, avranno sempre comunque qualcosa da ridire. Stai pronto a mettere pressione sui poveri clienti che usciranno dal negozio sfiniti. Ti illuderanno ai colloqui con il loro motto “Love the game”, foot locker è una famiglia, c’è lavoro di squadra.. Ma ti ritrovi persone che ti rubano le vendite e fanno i finti amici ma ti accoltellano alle spalle. In foot locker avere la faccia finta è tutto. Fai il finto amico con tutti e ti salvi. Se sei una persona a cui piace tenere il lavoro e la vita privata separati non è il posto che fa per te! Se non ti piace uscire con i tuoi colleghi al di fuori del negozio, allora stai pronto a sentirti escluso. Ah e stai pronto a fare mille straordinari e soprattutto gli orari non sono per niente flessibili! Lo stipendio è ottimo, ma è un’esperienza che non rifarei MAI più nella mia vita. E non pensiate che dipenda tutto dalla solarità di una persona, perché sono una persona solare..."
bad,"This is place for teenagers to work. It’s good money for people who don’t have any bills or responsibilities, not someone who relays solely on the pay"
bad,manager was trash. he would sit in the back and be on netflix or twitter and never did any shipment and instead would put his part time sales associates to work on the shipment
bad,it has changed not for the good either it is more like a sweatshop then it is like one big happy family! You are only a number there they will replace you in a heartbeat
bad,Please feel free to call me for details....upper management was poor at best. Local department staff was an excellent group of people. For my position the workload and hours requirement was totally unreasonable.
bad,"The management at the footlocker I was employed at was not the best. We constantly experienced new managers who all had different ways they wanted the business to be handled; as a result, this made the particular branch I worked at hard to bare at times as there was not a precise way of doing things."
bad,This was my first job in high school and it was possible the worst place to work ever. I got paid minimum wage to work long shifts and be nice to the clientele that walked in. The customers were rude and smelled like drugs. Terrible work place.
bad,Footlocker overall for me was a good first job. But They do not treat you as well as they could depending on Managers. Then if you do not work at a busy store you make nothing compared to the busy stores.
bad,"Through experience all locations are treated differently. If you're a higher volume store you get better material, the DM cares more, your opinions are considered. If your manager is horrible and the DM likes them they keep their job and get to treat their employees any kind of way. Some places work to advance their workers the horrible bosses dont. You have to be hungry enough to get the knowledge you need to move up."
bad,"Footlocker wants a lot from you but doesn't really give you what they require in return. the don't seem to care about their employees. If you are in management, they do not want you to go to school to try to further your education."
bad,"typischer tag"
bad,"Manager played favorites and District management doesn't care. Relocated to a store where manager wouldn't give breaks, had to eat hiding in camara blind spots."
bad,Can provide better flexibility for the amount of worked asked on such low salary. They can also increase the amount of pay for its employees and better incentives.
bad,It was ok but they didn't have consecutive work. What I did enjoy was I always always meeting someone new. Even when the work only last for a week. The jobs they do put you in is physically demanding.
bad,Footlocker was a nice place to work like 6 years ago but now stores are closing all the time the pay is still lowers then most places and the District managers need to be replaced.
bad,"Many unfulfilled promises by management. Told numerous times if I maintain my high sale rate my hours will go up, I started at 8 hours and the most I ever worked in a week was 10 hours."
bad,"The discount is the best thing about this job, 30% everything. The pay sucks. Assistant Managers make $8 plus 2% commission and the commission is capped. Meaning, you can't make more than they want you to. If you work at a slow store you don't make any commission. Most stores only have 2 managers and everyone else are part  time associates. Only a few stores have full time associates. They don't care about your well being or life balance."
bad,"personally, from a previous employee of a year and a half at lady footlocker in vintage fair mall in Modesto. they have very poor management skills, I was treated with no respect and hardly put on the schedule. never got a promotion when newly hired would get twiced the hours and promoted within weeks of being hired. not professional example gossips within employees. the entire work place is very messy and unorganized."
bad,Cut throat company. During my time here I have learned not to trust many people in a work environment. Compensation was fairly decent but could have been better
bad,"Honestly, I got hired at this company in Northern California and fell IN LOVE. The community there really cared about their employees and the growth of their employees but I ABSOLUTELY cannot say the same for the people here in Southern  California. Over here they truly do not care about their people and they will throw you in a very uncomfortable situation without hearing you out and trying to understand where you are coming for or why you're uncomfortable. I can truly go on and on about why I wouldn't recommend anyone to work here but this short paragraph will turn into a full blown essay."
bad,"It is a good first job. Pay was too little and the manager fired me without letting me know , she just took me off the schedule because i changed my availability due to the fact I had 3 jobs, people there are very judgmental. But you aren't there to make friends !"
bad,"6-7 hours per day standing with just 30 minutes break time. This company does not provide room for improvement or has the opportunity for a raise. Although the environment is energetic and lively, the compensation for the overall work being asked of you is not enough."
bad,"Foot Locker is a great and fun to work at on the store front, however from a hierarchy stand point we were not appreciated as much as we should have. I felt as though I learned a lot walking into this company and having built my resume from working here. I believe that we as manager's work very hard on a day to day basis and did not get the pay we deserved as managers. We do not get any kind of revision after the year has come and gone by to even have a chance at qualifying for a raise of some kind. The least we expect from hierarchy is a thank you or to tell us that we are doing a great job, but we did not even receive this."
bad,"Loved working here when I was young! It was a energetic atmosphere with lots of great people. Very fresh, fun experience."
bad,"It is a fun job while working with the kids, is not always fast paced. The work environment varies depending on the type of manager you have or the type of manager you work with."
bad,Horrible place horrible management no structure or security.
bad,"A day at Footlocker can Be interesting at time because you never know who you will catch stealing."
bad,The job consist of handling the day to day management duties.  Following company directives and driving sales to create a profitable store.
bad,process the shipment and hang and sensor shipment do the floor sets and greet each customer
bad,"Its alright, but not a career to me. There is not enough upward movement with the company because they are a distributor and not a producer."
bad,"Great discounts, but retail mall environment is rough. Hard to find people with good work ethics. Job is difficult during peak holiday seasons and hours are long."
bad,I am a sneaker lover so being here was a really perfect fit for me.
bad,A typical day is based on selling and performing the day to day functions which are broken down on the daily planner. Management mostly takes care store of operations and training. Your co-workers are there to help assist you give the customer the best service you could provide. Footlocker is a good job that will truly help you have great people skills.
bad,nothing about this job was hard. It was pretty laid back with little to do not much business on the weekdays. co-workers were very stand offish. Management was ok
bad,"Was my first sales job, learned how to deal with the public. Taught me how to handle stress."
bad,Gezellige collega's Team spirit leuke klanten top producten management alleen een kloof wat jammer (is locatie gevoelig gelukkig niet overal)
bad,"In the team sales dept, people love to gossip, very high school drama. Be aware. The job itself is very fast paced and high demand. The training is lacking for the support team. Management is all about numbers and don’t really have your back. Some of the reps are very mean or not the brightest (due to lack of training). Only plus side is very flexible hours and the benefits."
bad,Footlocker is a wonderful company however my manager made my employment there miserable. Their was no mutual respect whatsoever just commands and stern talking all the time. No appreciation ever. Also she would make rude jokes about co-workers appearance/shoes which I felt was very unprofessional
bad,If your personal life is a big part of your life then footlocker is not the place to be. Your personal time and life is not took in to consideration and the higher up management is unruly and doesn’t care about your life.
bad,Recent rumors point to the company packing its bags and leaving Wausau.  Morale is at an all-time low and they aren’t replacing higher leveled managers so it’s looking grim. They are only hiring for their busier season and then we could see an exodus.
bad,"becoming management your life is literally taken away by the company. working long tiring hours in the store and seeing maybe 2 days off. The only real enjoyable part of it   is getting shoes, and having fun coworkers."
bad,i got lucky and was hired on my birthday. although the interview was a group interview and was kind of predictable. i had a great time working here. twoards the end of the school year i was getting less hours when i needed more. i noticed my checks seemed low and asked my manager where my commission was in my checks. she ignored me and i realized i wasnt getting any type of commission at all. after that day the manager was acting very rude and kept taking hours away for unnecessary reasons. i decided to quit after being told i wasnt able to purchase a shoe as an employee or a regular customer. the manager was being rude and i realized she hired her boyfriend and decided to give all my hours to him. this job is a 50/50 for me. make sure youre familiar with the location and make sure the employees seem decent. other than that its a cool job for teens.
bad,"Do not work at Fairview mall. Management does not train you and it’s learn as you go. They expect you to do things which you aren’t trained for. The 30% discount is good. Every three months they do the 50% off everything for employees as well which is good. You do not need to know anything about shoes so don’t worry if you apply to any location. If you are a student, after the summer (August) is over, there are 0 breaks and the most you get are 6 hour shifts. Maybe two a week. Not weekends if you just start. Only thing they train you on is how to find the shoes. Even then they don’t actually help you. It’s one half an hour review on how to find the shoes and you’re on your own from there."
bad,"This is a great first job for high school students. Compensation lowers your pay to about 6.50 an hour. There are no hours at all, but they are able to work with your schedule which most likely means you'll work once a day."
bad,Bonne esprit d'équipe mais mauvaise relation entre équipe et manageur
bad,"Good place to learn about sneakers."
bad,Foot locker is a well organized company. Depending on your store and who your superiors are will determine if you will enjoy it or not. Company could be a lot better if the upper management actually cared for there employees like they claim they do.
bad,"I wouldnt feel like I was coming to work. For me it was fun. The customers loved me and so did the stafff. It is almost impossible to say that I didnt love the discount, but I did. Being that I am a preschool size I was able to get new releases the majority of the time. Hardest part was working all the overtime and extenuating long hours and not being acknowledged for them."
bad,"Keep in mind that I have not worked for Footlocker in over 9 years, many things may have changed since then. When I first began at Footlocker the environment was fast paced, fun and exciting. I learned how important a good relationship between management and there employee can be. Aside from this I cannot recollect much else of note."
bad,"Métier intéressant, dynamique, bonne expérience. Il faut aimé vendre des chaussures."
bad,"It was decent, yet not enough hours. Management was troubling sometimes but as every other management is. Location of the store and the customers were troublesome at times as well"
bad,"Six:02 is a great concept with great product. "
bad,"Its a very fun place to work as you get to meet different people form all kinds of backgrounds and can really get chance to know and talk to people."
bad,Hard to make moves past the store manager role. The hours are long and the time off is not existent on the weekends unless it's a special request. All time off on the weekends must be approved well in advance.
bad,to many bad attitudes employed in one building. hostle co workers.scared to work there witnessed 3 interactions that all most went to fist fits.
bad,"As the stock room manger at Footlocker. I have notice how this company does not value their employees. If you live home with your parents and don't have bills, go for it, but this job is not employee friendly."
bad,"Footlocker does quite a bit right as far as how fun a job can be.  The people are fun to talk to, the environment is very casual and you can take lunches for free.  But as far as the job goes, because it's as casual as it is, people don't always like to work, which can be very frustrated when you are waiting on other people.  Move to this, the management is very poor, and if you have a job with oncall, prepare to be awake for the 24/7 you will have the phone.  I think it's a good middle job, but a bad career choice."
bad,It's ok to start with as your first job but never let yourself get too comfortable. It will make you feel as though you have been there too long.
bad,"Fast Paced and demanding."
bad,"there was a lot of standing around and ""buying time"" when there weren't any customers which was often. I learned a lot about different shoes and what sort of activities certain shoes are good for different shoe types."
bad,"This Job is cool, fun, exciting, & productive. But the worst hours in the world."
bad,Too much work with little pay. Customers are legitimately crazy. 30% off on most apparel that you don't want.
bad,i enjoyed working for this company because it was overall a busy setting i enjoy helping customers
bad,"By far one of the best jobs that I have ever held. I enjoyed working with customers because it was always a different challenge. Customer service is one of my favorite aspects of retail and being great at it made my job easy. I also have the ability to recruit, hire and train people and I had fun doing it. "
bad,"Coming into work, everything and everyone was always very slow. Employees and managers are very rude to each other. I've learned to work a cashier and how to check for fake money. The manager is almost never working, and is mostly on break. my co-workers leave me to do the work. the hardest part of the job would be creating SKU's due to the fact that I was never taught how to create them."
bad,extremely long hours to work. no flexible schedules unless you are working part time. you work on commission so if you don't sell then you don't make money. extremely stressful place to work. on your feet all day running not standing!
bad,Footlocker was a great job for me. My main priority was to sale shoes as well as accessories to go with them which is one of my strong points. The management were all cool and were reasonable. I enjoyed my other co workers who all tend to have great personalities which made the job easier obtaining sales goals. I also enjoyed the hours of operation.
bad,"I enjoyed my first 6 or so months, however like many things management can and has run morale into the ground, we swing wildly from mandatory 10 hour days, 6 days a week to the opposite extreme - 4 day work weeks with only 4 hour work days."
bad,"Footlocker its a good company that offers premium experience for the customer and the best products, but they DO NOT care for there employee's. The pay is horrible compare with all the things they want you to do. at least in Puerto Rico"
bad,"I learned a lot working at Foot Locker I appreciate all the skills and traits that they’ve given me in the beginning as a regular part time sales associate, All the way up to being a manager and the skills that they’ve given me are skills that I can take with me in life."
bad,"Footlocker is a cool place to work but my location I was in wasn’t so good, we were always getting really rude & drunk customers & people will always steal out of the store & no hours was given at this location"
bad,they go against your requested availability and call you in class at school when they know you have school and they say its your fault when its really their fault
bad,"Un seul mots d'ordre , vendre le plus , comme toutes les entreprises anglaises"
bad,Everyone was always so competitive. That made it fun for me to go to work everyday. I love competing and competition. It motivated me along with my co workers.
bad,It takes time to be really good at selling sneakers to customers. Customers can be really difficult at times. Just be positive and always willing to learn!
bad,trés bon esprit d'équipe au sein de cette entreprise
bad,"Kids Footlocker is an amazing company, but I would say to only work there if YOU HAVE ANOTHER JOB! The hours are only at peek during holiday season. At my current location the day would go buy super slow and if you don't meet day.. Then you don't get scheduled for the next two weeks."
bad,Would be an ideal job if had better management  and scheduling. I ve been employed at this company since November 2017 and haven't been on the clock and when I talk to the manager he says that he having trouble issuing out hrs and he too busy to do my orientation and train me in because of staffing issues. But keep telling me don't worry give me sometime Ima get you in Jus don't know when.
bad,"Took this job while in HS, it's typical of most retail experiences. uneven hours, several managers, dealing with irrational customers * company protocol."
bad,They don't give hours and attend to give people one day of work in a week and other employees sometime steal people sales. Job can be very messy when it comes stock and don't pay well unless in high positions
bad,"Management was pretty terrible at the store I worked in. He was never on time when opening the store, and despite customer and employee complaints, he was never really reprimanded. If it weren't for poor management, I'd probably still be there, but I didn't really enjoy working at Foot Locker. I'm not really a shoe-head, so it wasn't a good fit for me. I mostly just enjoyed getting a discount on shoes when I needed some and being paid. Pay wasn't that great until the minimum wage increased to $10, though."
bad,During my time working at kids footlocker it was very difficult . My manager had a very nasty attitude and was very rude. I've never got into an argument with her while working there nor had an altercation with anyone. My co workers would steal my sales and say things about me to eachother. I did not feel comfortable working there at all to the point where I was scared to even speak to my manager about leaving the job.
bad,"While working it was a fun job. There was always store events which added to the excitement of working there. However I received no hours which defeated the whole purpose of having a job, and trying to communicate with management is like pulling teeth which made me hate working there all together. If you want job security I wouldn't recommend working here."
bad,lots of great products for sale lots of great people to work with. no real grown opportunities beyond the store level. a job where you will put in way too many unpaid hours.
bad,"great environment, short breaks, low commission rate, favoritism. I had a great time working with the customers and my team. I just feel as if footlocker is a huge company that everyone wants to work for and the assistant managers are underpaid for the work we do."
bad,"I enjoyed the interaction between us and the customers"
bad,"Lady Foot Locker is a good companies with qualitt merchandise. Veery professional, but if the current manager is monique jones she is a dishonest bi%$#..if I could give the management section no stars I would."
bad,Most of the people that are hired there at Kids Foot Locker and Foot Locker are all family. The manager at Kids Foot Locker is nice and all but she is inconsistent with the schedules. A normal day throughout the week is slow. The manager puts you on slow days and then begins to say that your numbers are not good enough and to try better. Communication is very poorly used. The most enjoyable part of working here is when you are put to work with certain people who are cool. Being able to work comfortably with your coworkers is a must and you will not find that here.
bad,great hours fun and productive work place management was laid back as long as you got done on time good benefits and the discount was pretty good as well
bad,"Quando sono stata assunta andare in negozio era piacevole e stimolante, cose che si sono affievolite nel corso del tempo. Troppa pressione e scarsa gestione sono le caratteristiche attuali"
bad,"I started working here at 17 y/o. It was a good job to work at while in high school or while in school as part time if management works with you, other than that, I wouldn't be eager to work here as a career."
bad,"En tant que travail job étudiant,"
bad,I was in charge of my staff when my store managers wasn't scheduled. I deter theft to the best of my ability. staff was great but complaint about stealing sales from one another.
bad,This was my first job and I'm glad; it ended up being perfect for me in High school.  Champs could also be a good second job for anyone that loves shoes also.
bad,"Fair place to work if you're in their Corporate Offices.  At Retail, very poorly managed and treated like cattle. The Company is constantly falling behind on trends and struggling with proper product mix."
bad,"People Skills"
bad,Footlocker was a great job for me when I worked there. I feel like I spent a lot of money on shoes with the company because I bought the shoes at a discounted price. I enjoyed helping people pick out shoes it was an over all fun place to work.
bad,For the four months I worked for footlocker i gained a lot of customer service skills that helped me excell in another job.
bad,Bare minimum wages. Work culture varies depending on which banner you are a part of. Access to product and employee discount and a relaxed environment motivate most applicants to become a Footlocker Inc. employee.
bad,work can sometimes be overwhelming for the pay. Have to work hard to be able to be moved up and considered for full time. Have to work during the holidays.
bad,Footlocker was fun but is no longer for me. It’s a easy work environment but the management changes too often. They don’t really appreciate there staff
bad,When i first started gere everythjng was great but then the manager started to get a little jealous because her normal customers that would usually come there to flirt with her would come in there and flirt with me and even thou i didnt persure them in any way she still felt a way about it and started showing me she didnt like me so i quit and reported her
bad,working for the company was ok . Up until you got to management . the pay sucks. the company is actually not as fun as it use to when i first started. they show favoritism .
bad,Worked for the company for a decade. No sick time or calling out allowed because that would mean another manager would have to stay for your shifts. There isn't extra people.
bad,"Werken met topmerken, mooie producten in een dynamische sector. Helaas is men op (top)managementniveau teveel bezig met het eigen straatje schoonvegen en wordt er vanuit de VS nauwelijks geïnvesteerd in personeel."
bad,Its footlocker warehouse not the actual footlocker but all in all not to bad of a place free coffee nice hours pretty good pay no real problem with staff
bad,Product and fun helpful and really friendly everything was smooth and easy to comprehend no harsh time wouldn’t regret working there but when its time to work we get down to it
bad,"Worked there for 3 years and as a part timer it’s amazing. You meet so wonderful people and it seems like after being there for a month. You become family to them. The management on the other hand is horrible. Store manager will not respect you and will constantly disrespect you until he feels like he’s justified. The district manager isn’t better. The assistant there was amazing hope that one day he receives his own store though! Good for part time, will never recommend being a part of management!"
bad,"I enjoyed about two co-workers there, The managers in the Pembroke pines location had to be 5 of the worst managers i've ever had. Very belittling and rude."
bad,"A laid back working environment, but limited at propelling employees forward in their career goals. Working more than 50 hours a week is a must as work will suffer if time is not dedicated. Management can be shaky at times and much of the office environment lacks trust and a team effort mentality. Decisions made to run the business can be confusing at times and ill advised. In a down trending brick & mortar industry, Foot Locker, Inc. is playing catch up in the digital world and lacks the true initiative to get ahead of the curve. Target demographics, marketing strategies, and product alignments have limited the consumer base and inadvertently caused a negative return in sales."
bad,"The company lied to me about the pay I would receive which was pretty unfortunate. However, everyday is an opportunity to grow as a sales person in everyway"
bad,"Hired based on qualifications and availability. Although completed three availability forms and discussed prior to first official I was scheduled outside of my availability. The environment is face-paced, you are expected to meet and talk to every customer, you are not allowed to ensure quality care just brief questions in regards to satisfaction, non stop moving, have to be able to absorb all questions from customers, place orders and listen to earpiece while others talk all at the same time. Manager stated she does not micro-manage but was watching and re-directing me like a hawk."
bad,"c'etait une belle esperience, j'ai adorer travailler dans ce magasin"
bad,"Footlocker isn’t what it’s cracked up to be honestly. Depending on where you work mangement sucks, they over hire so there isn’t much hours to give and benefits aren’t that good"
bad,"Fast work place , have to be on your Ps and Qs . Depending on your work team it can either be a fun space or a stress place . Finding ways to make your day go smoother is the trick"
bad,well while i was there i didn't appreciate the way my fellow employees would work i mean i cant understand how some people go through life under achieving like that
bad,footlocker is a job for kids in  high school. unless your goal is to become a manager or higher. they dont give raises and the pay is little. its basically a job where you have to work off of commission so its best your at a good location that is busy.
bad,Extremely competitive. This job is all about the hustle. Your co workers can steal your customers if you don’t bring their sneakers out in good timely manner.
bad,"-Provide customer service in your best ability possible"
bad,"One day was never the same as the next weather it be the workload managing staff or the customers. Theres always something to be done. There were 12+ hour work shifts that were required as a manager."
bad,"As far as the work is considered, do not go in with the expectation that your work schedule will always be abundant with hours, or that it will be a consistent schedule throughout the month. That really goes for most retail positions. However, with Footlocker, it is fast paced, the level of training is a standard minimum (you will pick up more experiences hands on). The most important thing pulled away from it, was a sense of refined detail-orientation, or in other words, honing the skills neccessary in paying attention to minor or major detail. That could be toward the customer is asking for. The most enjoyable part of the job, was meeting the varied types of people/customers who came into the store, and being able to help them to the best of my ability."
bad,"Job is okay. They're getting rid of commission for Assistant Managers, Full-Time Sales Associates and Part-Time Associates. So, if commission is what your looking for, find somewhere else!"
bad,environment is based more for younger people most likely ones with their first job mostly high school kids and to be my age working their it a big no for me
bad,a typical work day at foot locker was very busy we had customers in and out of the store everyday. The hours were long and it felt like the day would drag
bad,I over worked for such little pay . They don't really care about anything just the amount of sales are made by the end of the week . The commission isn't much either .
bad,"If you are not a male and not in management, good luck! This place plays with your money and hours. Not really for anyone who doesn't want a Jordan Discount!"
bad,Foot Locker is great for teenagers as a starter job. Foot Locker is also great if it is accompanied by another job. I'd say for people who are in high school or leaving and beginning college will enjoy this job.
bad,Amène une mauvaise ambiance et n'est pas du tout professionnel dans son travail.
bad,Very fast paced work place. Get to deal with many people on a daily basis and also are able to learn a lot from customers. Being able to relate to the product is the best part of the job.
bad,I loved this company and I loved my coworkers. But the minute I became management my may DECREASED and my stress INCREASED.
bad,"Same routine daily, poor advancement, co workers are usually easy to get along with and the most enjoyable part of working are the release days"
bad,"The company has very high expectations for workers but does not pay them accordingly. Workers make only 1% commission and is paid minimum wage. Basically if you work at a small store with not many customers, you will not get any money."
bad,"A lot of the managers had favorites working at the location that had been there longer than I have and because of that they would always get the most hours. Regardless of me meeting my sales goal and doing everything that was asked of me, I would constantly see myself getting less than 8 hours a week."
bad,"The company had its perks as far as getting shoes, and meeting new people every day. Management however is terrible, and the way the make the schedule is always unfair."
bad,"way too many workers hired. thus, very few hours given per week. management is poor, but the workers are co-operative. sometimes arguments occur between workers in terms of getting a desired customer."
bad,"Learned a lot about shoes and became a shoe specialist. Good training tools. Most enjoyable part of the job was combining my passions in one place, athletics, shoes, and customer service."
bad,"Stocking any new shipments "
bad,"Was overworked and underpayed for the most part. The only plus was the 30% discount, but all other factors made the job difficult at times. The company is about making their money I get that but it should be a bit more appreciation to the workers. Great job for students in HS or College."
bad,chipotle is an okay job for a high school student very up beat free food but that's about it the job requires a lot of free time and a lot of other stuff that's no big deal at all but I wouldn't work here again
bad,"Struttura di lavoro militaresca. Chiunque può dirvi cosa e come farlo. Ve lo diranno con il sorriso. Il problema è che tutto apparentemente è lecito, ma poi le proibizioni sono innumerevoli. Al terzo giorno hochiesto a un mio collega: ""Ma qui si può respirare?"". Chi ci lavora è gente svegli, in gamba e piacevole. I clienti, ragazzi e doddi. Sei quante Spenco (suolette ad alta tecnologia, nda) vendi."
bad,"A regular day at work would be the same typically everyday. Each day since I was a key holder I would have to open the store up at 10 am Monday-Saturday and on Sundays the store would open at 11 am. Meaning that I had keys to the store I had to be at the store about 30 minutes before the store actually opened. When arriving at the store I had to first print out all paperwork that we needed for that day such as shipment, daily goals, and any mark downs that we have new in the system at the beginning of the day. Working there I was not trained when I got hired as a key holder/sales lead. I started off as just a regular sales associate but my skills were highly increasing that they promoted me. The company was so unorganized that I never got a chance to actually get trained and the people who worked there always managed to quit because of the disorganization. Resulting into me trying to find another job elsewhere."
bad,Good starter place to work not great benefits or pay but if you love people then its good.
bad,"High School job was great to meet friends and new people. However, was underpaid and not paid for the overtime that was done."
bad,"started at 9 had to clean up the shop get it all ready for the day, then we would run through the goals and targets for the day. a normal days work at footlocker browns plain wasn't to busy it was an average day so most days we would just reach our taregts. my co workers were great, we had a realatively young team. but everyone was energetic and enthusiastic."
bad,The customers were mainly rude. I worked here throughout my college years and left after I graduated.
bad,"Slow most of the time, but it gives you time to get to know your customers and their needs."
bad,I didn't enjoy foot locker because i didn't get the hours i wanted and i rarely got to work.
bad,They are all rude including the manager when you walk in. They lie about what they have in stock or not. They talk to other employees when assisting customers.
bad,"I am an assistant manager at my location. I start preparing my day by checking my emails as soon as I walk in. I count my drawer to make sure  the correct amount is sufficient. I oversee the store once again before I am ready to open. Im usually there by myself for the majority of the day so its very important that I pay close attention to my store surroundings. My guest are my number one priority so it would behove me to always keep a smile on my face. Once my sales associates come in, I give them a game plan on what we need to do to achieve our goal for that day. Customer service is very important when it comes to sales so I try to enforce such mentality as much as possible."
bad,"First job, managers were strict and unfair. Co workers were nice, helped me out a lot."
bad,"I give two stars , because the management was not good at all , I worked in woodfield mall . I enjoyed my job , but I would of liked to work more hours."
bad,"I like working here because it basically teaches the basic to handle my customer service skills, I enjoy getting people what they need and what they are looking for with sports wear."
bad,"Great front line retail, You can learn everything about how-to run a retail operation. Has greatly aided me in Big Box managment"
bad,my day was running around and trying to get customer to buy sneakers and other items so that I met my daily quota.
bad,"Not much of an enjoyable situation aside from the fact that you received a nice employee discount. The hours varied and the pay was terrible, management made the environment a little easier to cope with but the re-assembling of an entire stockroom on your own is a daunting task in any environment."
bad,"Usually slow on the weekdays, as soon as the weekend comes around it get very busy. But because of my manager, everything moves smoothly; she had us get accustomed to creating conversations and making the connection, all while selling the product."
bad,"Great working experience , bad payment , hard to advance if we get payed Little from comission.  Discounts are the only good thing really that comes out of working here"
bad,We boxed shoes that came off a hook in a warehouse fast pace all day very fun loved working with shoes and others. Boxes footlocker shoes to be shipped to footlocker stores.
bad,"A typical day at work was sometimes fun or real hectic"
bad,Overall compensation for a sales job is lacking a strong commission base and needs to get better
bad,Travail bon pour commencer mais paye vraiment très faible même en tant que manager.
bad,Working at footlocker was pretty okay. The pay wasn't too great and the hours were low as well. This was just a good summer job to have for extra money in the meantime.
bad,I loved this job but they did not give me any hours for 2 weeks. I think they hire a bunch of students like myself and just use them when they think it will get busy.
bad,"nice place to work and eat and also hang out with the family and friends , cant say anything bad about them but thatnk Them for offering me my 1st job ever"
bad,Footlocker was a great environment. The co-workers were amazing. The job was extremely easy and the customers are what made the day. I learned that all it takes in retail s to put yourself in the customers shoes and the day will go by smoothly. have a positive attitude in everything you do concerning the customer.
bad,"typical day is clock in, 1 30 min lunch break, help customers, hit your goals in sales and clean the store then turn in the money and clock out. I learned how to communicate with customers and i really developed a bond with my coworkers"
bad,"Come to work and you will most likely have a task. If not, you do what you can to make sure the store is always presentable to customers. and throughout your shift you do what you can to assist the customer"
bad,"While working at Foot Locker I really enjoyed myself. The team is really fun and easy to get along with. At Foot Locker you come across a ton of new people. Your work days are sometimes long but if your working with the right people, you'll have fun while working. The pay isn't the best but if you love what you do, it'll be worth the sacrifice. Plenty of options for advancement."
bad,"Questo lavoro mi ha permesso di imparare a gestire un attività molto ampia, poiche si interessava di vestire la donna l'uomo e il bambino/a...E non solo nell'abbigliamento ma anche per le calzature."
bad,"Great environment. Awesome incentives, but poor professionalism. This company had lots of improving to do in due time. I loved my regular customers, they were consistant and patient."
bad,I worked for the help desk for my internship in 2004. The pay was horrible & the hours were hideous. I worked 2p-10:30p five days a week. I had to take some calls from people with payroll issues every day too & that was uncomfortable. Most of the staff was helpful & nice. It was very busy at times. Overall I wasn't happy.
bad,A typical day was either busy or slow. The hardest part of the job was maintaining an organized and neat stock room. The most enjoybale part of the job was hearing funny sotries from clients.
bad,Its a pleasure yo see people Buy shoes Its not the shoes its over millions of shoes on this universe  in all sizes Big small long and Narrow ect... I enjoy Foot Locker Giving me a chance to be part of the establishmen.t
bad,"Making sure every customer leaves with a great impression , we helped customers find what they are looking for like shoes or accessories. Also was a fun productive place to work at you meet and greet new people everyday and it's also about work but fun too ."
bad,"When I worked here, I loved the benefits that came out of it, but at the same time the management and employees were not as helping when it came to first starting out."
bad,"I worked week long 12 hour shifts twice. I had a full time schedule, yet the company paid me only for part time. I hit my commission target on a 90 hour week and didn’t receive my commission bonus in my check."
bad,Footlocker is such a fun workplace I loved every seconded I was on the sales floor! The only thing is that the hours were really bad sometimes only working 4 hours a week and most of the time not being scheduled for a whole week. You get paid minimum wage and commision but when the management puts you in the stock room for hours for minimum wage it just seems unfair. That also brings me to the point where they stop calling you in if you don't have good sales numbers how are you supposed to have good sales numbers if they only schedule you 4 hours a week and that week you are doing stock. I was such a loyal employee with great sneaker and apparel knowledge but my management didn't see that and it made me sad when they just kept cutting my hours.
bad,"I loved working there, everyone is nice the only problem is there is a lot of drama. but if Foot Locker would ever take me back I will go in a heart beat"
good,"I’ve never applied for a job that I’ll have to work EVERY weekend. I have NO life working there. The job is easy, it’s my manager that’s the problem. I’ve tried to deal with the working every weekend and dealing with my manager for almost 13 years. It has gotten so bad that I get headaches every time I walk in the store 😢."
good,A typical day at work at footlocker is pretty easy. I have the ability to learn about the company  in's and outs. Whats expected as an employee. You  have the opportunity of learning  about the different brands that footlocker sells. The job at footlocker is pretty simple. My most enjoyable moment working for footlocker is displaying excellent customer service to my customer and developing a relationship with them so they will be long time customers shopping at footlocker.
good,"Not much to say! I just would prefer a better job for financial purposes, and footlocker isn’t the job for me. It was fun while it lasted but I need something better"
good,"No weekends off, little to no time to spend with family.  No understanding if ill or unable to attend work for whatever reason"
good,"working off of commission wasnt fun and doesnt pay your life bills this job is for people that need side money or just pocket change this isnt a career, but the staff and customers are really cool."
good,"typical day at work was fairly easy; slow at times, but enjoyable. "
good,"not a good work environment, no real managers, everyone think they are bosses."
good,"I only loved my job because of the people I worked with. The manager wasnt much of a manager, she was never there or flirting with men the whole time. A typical day at work was selling shoes, providing great service to ensure that the customer was well satisfied."
good,"easy job, 30% discount, not worth the minimum wage you get paid, assistant managers have to work over 50+ hours a week especially during holidays, only store managers really make good money. takes a while to advance in the company because of how much work it is. overall, dont work here, discount is nice, pay isnt."
good,This was my very first job in high school. It was ok not really helpful. Had to deal with a lot of rude people. The pay sucked and I barley got any hours. It was just a part time job while I was in school.
good,"Customer Service, assist customers with shoes, keep work area clean cashier."
good,this was my first job when i was 17 and i loved it without a care in the world and i loved shoes!
good,At footlocker it has its moments where its fast paced but it also have its moments where business is running really slow. The discounts were great and it was nice having it as a first time job
good,"Foot Locker's culture and the atmosphere is a diverse and dynamic one. Unfortunately, Upper Management does not give you the means or tools to succeed."
good,"I believe that the management at foot locker wandsworth was very poor, nothing to really aim for, the staff did not work like a team and instead everyone was helping themselves out, only times when we did work as a team was when managers would visit."
good,they are a good company but they can do better with prices and sales also they can be more open with hours to people depending on this one job to live off  and stop switching mangers left and right soon as the new ones come you lose hours and pay also have to stop hiring so many people at one store
good,I loved it at first but the management will make or break your experience. If you don't have any help as a manager then being in the store all day everyday can become stressful.
good,"the manger was a liar! I would work 20 hours and he'll cut it down to (ex. 15 hours) he would also take my sales. he did the same things at other stores , so they moved him to a smaller store , and they kept giving him chances ."
good,"When I had this job, I was in school and this job fit with my school schedule. After school until closing so being a high school student i was perfectly fine with my schedule."
good,"I worked as an Assistant Manager in a busy Footlocker store in Lewisham.  My duties included: opening and closing the shop, managing a small team of employees, rota management, handling money, cashing up, ordering change, banking and stock control."
good,working there for a year and a half i enjoyed the most part. But being the youngest worker I can say none of my coworkers were professional except my manager who tried to keep things intact.
good,"I hated working there."
good,Great place to learn how to be organized and fast. Hourly pay and comission suck.
good,A typical do at work a long hot day . We had to stock all the products that came in with the shipment and carry it up the stairs.
good,"Too corporately structure"
good,"Good job to work at . Hours vary due to seasons , everyone has to get hours , but you get paid based on what you sale . Every other weeks pay . Discount 30%"
good,"Management crew need to treat all associates security and contracted workers eg. cleansers with more respect, we all are consider adult and all here for the same purpose, which is to be able to provide for our family, taking into considetation we all are human beings, and neither are better than others"
good,This place didn’t give me hours also management was bad. I wouldn’t recommend to anyone only bc I didn’t have a great experience here. Also it’s full of drama and unfairness.
good,"Okay management "
good,"It's retail, so what do you expect. The positive is that you meet great people, but the negative is the mean a-holes that treat you like you are beneath them. But, that is retail/"
good,Not always a very friendly management team. Performance is key and is not based off of working for a team. Get additional pay when working as a picker or a packer with the paid for performance program.
good,If you don’t wanna grow in this company I won’t advise you to choose this job only to pay your bills as you’ll need to put lot of effort in it. There’s quite lots of stress from managers and colleagues in approaching clients and selling people insoles and other foot locker products.
good,"My typical day at work at times consisted of 12 hour shifts. Management was poor, work moral was at a all time low for most associates. Staying out of management ""friend zone"" seemed to go against me as I was there for the customers."
good,"I heard with some stores the management is better but in my case, although he said he would be forgiving in the fact I had 4 jobs he disregarded my availability constantly and I would be double booked for jobs. In the 3 month period I was with FL I had 1 shift. The hours were terrible. Quite honestly I wish I stayed for the discounts but even then it wasn't worth it."
good,"Its a good place to work if you are still an student and don't have many finacial responsabilities, the job is not secure and not many oportunities to advance in the company."
good,A typical day at work could sometimes be very slow were we don't have any traffic we just refill the store with merchandising but we have our times where it gets really busy. I've learned a whole lot about sneakers I never new about and also working with customers. I feel that there could be a better management team. The reason I say that is beacause I feel there could be favoritism with in the company. I have a pretty good staff team .
good,Very fast past work environment with little to no breaks if its too busy. Management was horrible as far as taking care of my work related injury
good,"Customers come into the store to find shoes for daily life. I learned there is more than meets the eye when working for a shoe company. Women who lead an active life, e.g. running, sports. My co-workers were not good role models of what to do when wanting to advance or becoming someone that is a good associate. Hardest part of the job is having only two associates working and the store is full of customers. Most enjoyable part of the job is being able to see new shoes and also learning what shoes fit each person's lifestyle."
good,"n/a management is very rude and not understanding,"
good,There wasn't any team work. Everyone was for themselves. Management wouldnt have been that bad if she wasnt trying to make friends with everybody.
good,I never felt like I belonged at this company. I was never recognized for the above and beyond I did. This was an interesting job experience but it was not something I enjoyed most of the time.
good,This company is designed to pay the management to run stores but the associates are paid low wages. Not bad for a student or someone seeking part-time work
good,Dont work at footlocker its a boring job and management sucks. Literally walk around and do nothing dont even help the customers with the service. Terrible job.
good,depending on the day it could be slow or busy i learned a whole lot about shoes and fake and the market for it. I learned a lot about meeting and paperwork and shipment. It was great until they got a jerk manager that was not willing to work with my school schedule.
good,they make you wash your one shirt and buy specic clothes and shoes to wear while working but it also helps you work around with different jobs and still be working for them
good,"The job is great meet new people and make connections. The discount is ok not bad, but the pay is trash for AMs and store managers and  associates. Footlooker works you like a dog and don’t want to pay you good."
good,I left footlocker because a manager gave all my hours for the week away to another cashier because he was liked more. Management was poor and did not coach the employees the right way because i was the only one that ever cleaned and stayed business during down time or even when there was a line i would be the only ringing up
good,Roligt att jobba men ingen chans till egen utveckling
good,"Very fun and exciting, but hours could have been better , over all , this job was fun while it lasted , I just wish I could have been paid more hourly and for the work we had to put in and do , I feel as if I were being robbed of my energy and time , to much effort has to be put in and I feel we should all be paid a little more for the all the hard work we try to accomplish and the work that we do accomplish, I’m more of a hands on person and I’ll tell you , I could have worked somewhere else and got paid twice or even as triple as much as I did working for kids footlocker, I wouldn’t recommend working here but if your in a need of a job then this might be the place for you."
good,good place to start getting job experience always hiring but low supervising and to many people and the hours go low almost every week and if you think they care for you're health they don't.
good,"Sold shoes, greet customers, count inventory, daily reports, Hired and trained staff, make weekly schedule, supervised staff. Te best part of the job was interacting with the customers."
good,"Longer hours & stressful. "
good,If you like repetition you will love this place. Work on the same things month in month out with no change you will love this. If you like a challenge and want to learn something you will not.
good,Stress work environment with the reasoning of keeping sales up to expectations which resulted I. More or less work hours to get. I did not enjoy that.
good,"Diverse customers. Have to be willing to work with many different people, of course people with strong attitudes as well. Have to be willing to learn new things."
good,Typical work days were quite calm. The stress level was low during the week. There was little room for advancement and the hours were non-negotiable. The work overall was easy.  I enjoyed learning about the new inventory and seeing the trends.
good,"Good job for highschoolers whom looking for a parttime job. Parttimers get no mertinity leave, gets only one percent commision , no vacation paid, no over time."
good,Job is basically for high school kids or someone with no kids and living at home.  Not for someone who has real bills unless they just want the shoe discount. You will work harder than you are paid. Very slow on growth in company.
good,"People are really nice, and you learn a lot from the job. I gained a lot of sales knowledge and experience as well as learned a great deal about shoes and the sneaker culture."
good,"While working at Foot Locker, the challenges of resolving new problems was always a lot of fun.  There were a lot of people that I could rely upon to help solve an issue."
good,It's one of the worse places to work at. They literally let people steal from you everyday whether its on the sales floor or at the register. What I learned is to hustle hard and to basically not to trust anyone. Its very diverse don't get me wrong but everyone's work ethic is trash. Some people have no type of ambition. The hardest part of the job is not to yell at someone for suspecting of them taking your hard earnedd sale. The only thing enjoyable was the discount.
good,"The workplace is great. The employees are also great. It's just the manger and the district manager. The general manager shows major favoritism to certain people. The ones she doesn't show favoritism to, she disrespects. The district manager is just as bad."
good,"worked as if i were a manager while my manager did the minimal. i trained incoming members of the team even though it was not in my job description. team is not supportive, nor productive."
good,"overrated, managers threaten to reduce hours if performance drops, you are made to stay later than you are supposed to, spoken to in an unprofessional manner."
good,I loved being around people and meeting new people on a daily basic but i hated not growing seem like i was just stuck in my position
good,I would have the worst shifts. I wouldn't get paid anything on my paychecks. And they fired me because I was in the hospital for about 3 months. I had a brain injury that required me to stay in bed until I got better. While I was working there people could always come and steal stuff from our store because we didn't have a security system.
good,"A typical day at work would be selling the merchandise , learning about the shoes, but the management isn't that great. they yell at us for someone else mistake , have HUGE trouble giving the employees their break its horrible. Hardest part is organizing the stock room, and the most enjoyable part is the employee discount."
good,"This is definitely an opportunity company. If you have other plans of excelling in the future outside the sneaker world, only be part time. The commitment required to be full time will drain you of fully experiencing that."
good,"The opportunities for advancement are pretty small, and upper level management are pretty indifferent, they only care about numbers. the customers are the only enjoyable part of the job"
good,"Footlocker was a great place to work, I loved working with the public and always having new and returning customers to serve. Everything was great until new management came in, the new manager favored french employees and stopped giving the bilingual (more english) employees shifts, which is why I eventually left. The hardest but also the most enjoyable part of the job was managing multiple clients and multiple products at the same time."
good,"Job was a little difficult to lived off of. Pay was horrible, and part time employees were not able to exceed more than 15 hours a week, which made it impossible to have a decent looking check to bring home to pay for any bills."
good,"Sales Representative "
good,Footlocker is a place for gym shoe lovers I enjoyed working there because of the customers and the friendly co-workers..
good,"everyday i go into work 9:30am turn off my alarm,clock in check all my e-mails and operations to see if there are any price adjustments that need to be taken care of. Do any other paper work to make sure it is all done before opening my store. set up all goals for part timers to reach as well as goals for me to reach do any visuals that come in and also answere to any e-mails throughout the day. And abouve all make sure my customers are taken care of by helping them find whatever it is that they need to insure that they are happy and want to return as well as tell there freinds about the experiance they had."
good,"While the job is not strenuous,and most coworkers are pleasant, the company has an incredibly high turnover ration, due to their low standards for hiring, and their lack of respect for their employees. I have never worked for a company that cared so little. On a typical day as a warehouse generalist, I would be assigned any job in the warehouse, from picking to shipping to international mail or forklift driver. I learned a little bit about every job i did, and excelled at them all. Management was less than satisfactory, doing very little to contribute anything to the company. The department leads and generalists were the lifeblood of the company, and were poorly rewaded for it. The low wages and complete lack of recognition of any worker was a prime example of the lack of caring this company had for their human capital. Promotion opportunities were often listed, but for no reason, as the candidate was already selected prior to the postings. There were rarely hard jobs, other than constantly fearing for being fired on a whim by HR, despite supervisor approval. The most enjoyable part was the coworkers, how we tried to help each other in an effort to avoid termination. A very sad way to approach a job."
good,"Lavoro molto stimolante in cui si impara sempre qualcosa, sia da parte dei colleghi e sia da parte dei clienti. "
good,"- Typical day at work consisted of dealing with a vast variety of customers and finding a way to suit each of their needs"
good,"would never go back was too stressful. dint want to give me a raise and i was working to hard. hours were very inconvenient, was barely able to see my family. i felt like i worked to hard and it wasn't appreciated"
good,It was hard to keep busy when the store is slow; which was a lot at our location. I mainly learned from my co-workers and the assistant store manager. The Store Manager isn't the best. SM had poor managerial skills and was very aggressive to employees and customers. All the associates got along well and worked as a team. Nothing about the job was hard. You do get DISCOUNTS which is a plus. Not the best location for advancement.
good,"I learned to work under pressure at a fast demanding speed, how to clean and keep displays neatly presentable, how to advertise and convince they buyer the product was a great match for them."
good,"Had a good career. I got too old and was forced out. Manager pay rates higher than most retailers. Fun place to work. Quality of life is tough. Long hours and no matter what is said, the actions form executives showes they have very little concern for your life at home."
good,"The person they had to train me was moved to another store before the training was complete, and the other manager was rude and acted as if I was there to compete with her."
good,The environment didn’t bring a lot of customers . I wasn’t very social with the people I worked with so it left me quiet when customers would come in and I’d have to break out of my shell
good,Aucune vie personnel aucun arrangement clientèle très agressif et collègue de travail vicieux
good,Footlocker at Lakeline mall had really bad pay and no benefits to help a kid like myself make decent money for me to pay for things in my daily life. However it did teach me the value of how to respect people and how to treat everyone how you would ant to be treated
good,If you’re looking for a job to pay all of your bills this isn’t it. This job is mainly for high school children looking to have some extra spending money for the weekends. This isn't a job you can take care of your family with unless you’re in upper management.
good,"It was fun working at Foot Locker, you build a lot of good relationships with your customers. You are required to sell insoles and shoe cleaner. The pay is really low for managers and associates. The good part is the employee discount and having a good product. I trained myself and NO help from upper management."
good,"Always approach a customer and ask if he/she needs assistance."
good,Crabs in a barrel mentality. Favoritism and personal feelings get in the way of a lot of business versus best man/woman for the job. Recognition only given out to those in bigger volume stores and opportunities for advancement is going is slim to none not unless you can out play them at their own game!
good,"Fun place to work when you have fun with the customers."
good,"while working in sales, my experience at Foot Locker was sub-par at best. The company lacked a hierarchy capable of properly leading the team and we never had meetings. I feel the job could have been a lot better had they had a more stable management team as well as providing more opportunities for growth within the company."
good,The job is very laid back but the compensation is subpar and not very enticing.  Due to this the realistic idea of being able to keep this job as a main means of pay is not realistic.
good,"Working at footlocker was okay, they showed a lot of favoritism and the mangers was very rude except one, and racist. They played with my hours and since they payed every week and barely gave me hours I barely made money. I really liked footlocker but I couldn't do the hours they were giving me and overtime I asked for a shift it was always a issue. My availability was open so I was understanding why I was barely getting hours. Plus I was very hard working, friendly with all my customers and outgoing."
good,if youre into sneakers and brand clothing this is for you. all the latest gear and retro hip to work around is good for the younger crowd. can meet new people
good,"Fun job, meet great people. Job could be great once around the right environment. get to understand more about the shoes your selling and brings you up to date on the newest shoes that released each weekend. Just sucks that there isnt anymore commission!"
good,Working here at Foot Locker was an ok experience. Not to mention this was my first real job. I expected it to be a fun experience but it was so competitive and sometimes it got ugly..
good,"- Very little hours."
good,overall its a cool place depending on the store and employees they don't pay much but want you to do all the work you do not get raises but the sneaker discount comes in handy
good,"This was actually my first job and on days when I get great sales, I felt great, but there were also days when the business would be slow and you wouldn't really get any sales. You have to treat every customer the same and have patience."
good,"For the amount of work you do, you don't get paid enough. Minimum wage for part timers and you no longer make commission. Nice job for high school students looking to earn little extra money."
good,"Management needs to improve great company lack of good management,  the pay for me is not great for me im an assistant manager and i am so underpaid i put in a lot of hours sometimes 10-11 hours a day"
good,"This company have poor communication and not a safe place to work. The company doesn't have regulation of OASH safety rule."
good,"A lot of tourists passed by to shop, so I got a chance to meet a lot of different people. I learned about different kind of sneakers and how they were made for different kind of feet."
good,"travail quotidien sous pression "
good,Good learning experience when dealing with sales and people. Cut throat when you go into management. Can feel like a hostile environment. Your not backed by management in difficult situations and it is best you keep to yourself and not concern yourself with others to would seem.
good,"There was some challenges with scheduling, which was a big issue. I learned a great deal regarding custom services and training opportunities and monthly audits. The work environment was employee friendly most of the time."
good,"At Footlocker I learned how to manage more than one task at a time. This job also delivered the ability to work under pressure, in certain situations."
good,"Management was very poor. Schedules made last minute, poor hours, rules were not followed, and an overall negative attitude. Gets really busy around holiday times."
good,Footlocker was a nice job but I just wanna experience another job. I've been there since I was 16 I just wanna move on from retail n start a new chapter.
good,Making the customer happy and make sure that they leave with everything they need. If they need help I'm here for them and if my co workers need help I'm not afraid to land a hand
good,"working here, i felt like the didnt treat me as an employee, they didnt listen to what i wanted more working there. they barely gave me hours to work depending on how much i would sell, i didnt like it at all."
good,Store doesn't make enough volume to move very slow days dont make a lot off of commesion pro get 30% discount con you never get  raises unless you switch job position
good,While in school it is a very good part-time job. However with promises of advancement and no follow through it was hard to stay employed with a job based mainly off comission.
good,good for a first time job experience and a part time job. Co workers are okay the pay isn't really specified but eh... and management only cares about numbers.
good,"Hoe ik de dag begon daar was vrij strikt iedereen kreeg te horen wat die moest doen en ik heb geleerd om vrij snel te werken en meerdere dingen tegelijk te doen kennis opgebouwd over de materialen die er bestaan in het bedrijf "
good,"The work-day was very unpredictable, you never know if you're coming in to make sales or clean the back room for hours on end. You either thrive or don't"
good,my first actual retail job cool place to work is defientley a high school job I wouldn't consider it a career unless your higher up in management.
good,Typically it can get boring. The pay is really dependent on the store you work at and how busy it is or isn't. The best part is the discount and the c0-workers.
good,"Could have been more professional, making commission wasn't as well as they made it sound- Making the most sales in one week and only getting paid $78. No Thanks."
good,"The typical day consisted of greeting and welcoming customers in a friendly, providing the customers with the help and advice they are seeking. "
good,"Overall the job was a fun experience, I became more social and comfortable speaking to people.I also worked on my customer service skills here as well. But not the kind of place you would want to work if you really needed hours and a good pay."
good,Lady Footlocker was a very busy on your toes all the time type of job.During my time working there i gained experience in customer service and also gained product knowledge on the apparel as well as footwear that they carry in the store.As for the my co-workers and management they we're not so pleasent to always be around they were very petty individuals and unprofessional talking about other employees.The hardest part of the job was trying to understand foreign customers.
good,Working at Lady foot locker is lots of fun. I learned how to be a great salesperson. The management is excellent but is over worked.
good,"Learn how to build rapport with customers. However, I believe compensation based on experience could have been a lot better."
good,Eastbay is a place to work and that is about it. The pay is not that great. Some management does not work well with staff. Not everyone is treated the same. Its a good job to start off but would not recommended making it a life choice. If you want a 6-4 job 5 days a week then this is the job for you. You not only work in the department you are hired for but you are farmed out to other departments where your body is not use to it making you not to enjoy family time.
good,footlocker is workplace if you are barely starting to be employed career wise i recommend finding something better to keep good financial standards and for better opportunities
good,"A typical day of work consists of providing customer service. At my job, I learned how to deal with customers and become more social."
good,I enjoyed working with the customers and handeling their needs. I tried to get the coworkers to work as a team rather than a race for customer. I had to deal with very irate customers at times and that helped me with patience and confrontation. 
good,Like to meet and greet new people and serviceing customers. Didn't like the hours or management.
good,This wasn't the best job but it taught me alot about sexism in the work place.
good,"A typical day was to open the store, register, and make sure the store was prepared for the day to be presented to customers. Also, continue to make sure the store was prepared for closing and/or the closing manager."
good,A typical day at work helping out the kids in picking out the coolest shoes in the store.Also playing with them. I loved working with my part-timers we got along great we enjoyed being around each other. The management wasent that good. Mangers did what they want and worked when they wanted too. The hardest part of the job was the stock room when the shoes would be all the way to the top and you would have to climb over boxes of shoes to get to the shoes u needed. The most enjoyable part of my job was when the kids would leave with there parents with a smile on there face because they left with the shoes they wanted.
good,Working for the company Was a good experience for me for the 4 1/2 years I was working for the company. footlocker have help me with working with people building up my customer service skills and techniques and footlocker also have showed me how to work on a register so to me footlocker was a great experience for me.
good,"Trainings are usually given progressively after passing tests that demonstrate knowledge of becoming a manager. Management was always open to new ideas.  The hardest part of the job was working during weekdays. While traffic was steady or slowy, you had to be more fun and inviting versus high paced days.  Communication is key as well as knowledge of how to spark fun and spontaneous conversation with a variety of guests."
good,"The particular store I worked at was not what I expected. It was beyond stressful to say the least. The management I was under at the time was not good and did not honor or care about my time along with my employees. The air conditioner was broken the whole time I worked there, due to the fact it was summer in California, it was super hot always in there. I enjoyed the people I worked with and also the customers who came in, however the management was horrible."
good,L'expérience est correct mais certains point à revoir comme les ventes additionnelles où l'on nous pousse parfois à forcer le client à acheter. Et l'évolution qui dépend du chiffre du magasin
good,The company is ok but they will keep people who are terrible and get rid of people who actually care. The pay is terrible even in a high volume store the assistant manager was only making $.25 more than the stock guy
good,Footlocker offering 50% off for employees 2-3 times out the year. They strive for excellent customer service. There's room for advance if you apply yourself 100%
good,"Typical day at work: new release, back to school, black friday, and sales will be your busy day at this company "
good,District Manager didn’t want to transfer me to a closer location. Was traveling over an hour just to get to work and back home. Did inform my store manager. Nobody helped with my situation.
good,Foot Locker is trying to play catch up with their 40+ yr old infrastructure and pushing all of their employees to the brink of having breakdowns. Every day is a challenge with their systems and software. Culture is outdated and decor is SUPER mundane. Buildings are becoming over crowded and feel almost like call centers.
good,"Very stressful, the mangers are not truthful. When its slow your home in a couple of hours .Not a job you can survive on ,have a back up plan,thats it"
good,"Foot Locker advertises a diversity culture, but lack growth fpotential in the entry level positions."
good,"As a ""first job"" it wasn't too bad. I was never actually given the chance to finish my training and introduction program. Kind of like ""You get the jist of everything? No? You'll figure it out."" I mean truly, there isn't a lot needed to know, still though it's New Job 101. Management I was told by other employees would be problematic were actually quite nice, just didn't deal with incompetence very well. Management hired/transferred after I'd arrived however I would say weren't the best representation of management types for this company. It wasn't long after the new managers that I and the company parted ways."
good,"Set up displays, design marketing strategies for storefront, review and stock inventory, market counts, rearrangements of shoe/cloth racks, open and close store gate, drop deposits."
good,in the time being their i got promoted to full time pretty fast because of my hard work and consistency i always wanted to get promoted to assistant manager because i deserved more pay for the amount of work i was putting in as far as sales number and leadership skills but the management team found a way to not make that happen after new managers came to my store so i decided to leave
good,If your life revolves aound sneakers and only sneakers youll be ok. Any other kind of life and this company is not for you. As a manager they will expect you to work all hours under the sun but only pay you for the 39 hours they require
good,It nice to work in your department but sometimes you get sent to do other department that you don’t apply for. Which they paid more than your department. We should have a raise if we plans to work in other department.
good,"This company is pleasant to work for as long as you are prepared to be in retail. The long days, early mornings, and working every weekend aren't for everyone or their family lives. The experience is nice and interacting with new faces everyday does a lot for a person's interpersonal skills."
good,Early mornings late nights. sometime 6 day work weeks. got rid of commission. discount is limited on specific items. Not much room for growth on a store level.
good,I’d recommend footlocker for a 1st job. You learn how to find items and learn a new system of inventory. And if you like people then that’s the job for you
good,"Company is great, but not very good with strategies towards the business. Very confusing.  They stretch associated very thin and do not compensate them."
good,"This job teaches you how to handle customers with care and efficiency, and your skills only develop even more after time. Things can become second nature and you can earn a decent wage there as long as you put hours in. The amount of hours at first when you get the job might not be as great, but if you show improvement fast you can work your way up the ladder. One being patient with customers is essential. Being bilingual is helpful very much. BI-weekly pay. discount on sneakers is most enjoyable part of job. can make connections with people and community."
good,"I learned a lot while working here and even though I was only there for less than a year, it helped me. I got to experience higher responsibilities. Any mistakes made were a lesson and I very much enjoyed that because it made me stronger in the work place, it made want to put in more effort, and those are things that interest me. It was a good opportunity and I'm glad i got to experience it, but i wanted more action. It was a low volume store so there wasn't really much going on and I liked keeping myself occupied but other than that it was great and it would've been nice if I was able to be in the company longer."
good,"Given a normal work week, as store managers we are to work min of 45 hrs. Typical work day consists of opening emails, reviewing numbers with team, providing customers with outstanding customer service, and protect the company merchandise. I've learned a lot in the 8 years of being with the company. Starting out as an assistant manager you try to pick up everything and learn as much as possible. I had a really good manager to start off my career with the company. Throughout my career I had a few different managers that are all still with the company in higher roles. Taking a little bit of management ways from each manager that I've had is how I look at the kind of manager that I am today. They all taught me something that I know not to use but mostly how to do the job correctly. We as a company have an upbeat energized workplace. Greeting customers with tons of energy and remaining positive all while providing outstanding customer is what we are all about. Creating a culture for customers to want to come back and continue to shop with us. One of the hardest parts of job is the work hours. It requires us to be there an hour before store opens and staying late after closing time to complete task, complete displays, or even just to clean up. Working on all holidays is another downfall. As long as the mall is opening for any reason, footlocker inc. as a whole always have their stores open as well. Lastly the most enjoyable part of the job but could also be a downfall is the interaction with people. You get to meet new people on the daily basis and also create bonds and friendships"
good,Typical day at footlocker greeting customers selling and offering new product. Learning new product and its benefits. Hardest part of the job is to male the daily sales goal. the most enjoyable part is receiving new product.
good,Cool customers and great coworkers but employees arent valued. Its a very easy place to move up in. the more time your willing to put in is the further you will be promoted
good,"Work used to be really fun, everyone got along like family but when management changed, EVERYTHING changed. Overall a good job to work at and benefits are great."
good,A nice working environment where you can be yourself as long as you make sales. Managers are a hit or miss deal. You either like them or you don't. Customers were often unfriendly but managers were willing to take over in situations like that. Full-time often unavailable.
good,Foot Locker is a job you do right out of high school. The pay is super low and everyone competes for sales. They pressure you to sell products even if the customer doesn't like them or doesn't need them.
good,a day at footlocker would be hectic a some points and slower in some u have to keep busy no matter if a customer is there or not( no standing around) management was very consistent and reliable when help is needed it was fun to be there even when we would be busy. the hardest part would be closing up the store but also one of the most enjoyable.
good,"Good part time job if you are in school, but you are not guaranteed a minimal set of hours so some weeks you can have 0hrs then other weeks you can has 3-10hrs"
good,"Mondays through Fridays are usually slow paced days. There are periods of there being no customers. Saturdays are usually busy. Sundays are somewhat busy. There are some customers that will make your job a little difficult but there are plenty of customers that are very nice, easy to talk to, and patient. Customers will remember you, learn your name, and ask for you when they return to the store. During the time period of Black Friday and Christmas Eve, there will be a significant increase of customers and you have to be able to handle multiple customers at one time. The hardest part of the job is the rude customers and people that steal. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people."
good,"Most people really just work there for the discount. for it to such a multi billion  dollar company, they pay terribly.. and from my experience, they'll hire anyone as a manger."
good,"Team Leader/Inventory manager/Salesman"
good,"Worst place I've worked, they try to rush you and force you to make hook-ups/ add ons with every shoe you sell. 10/10 don't recommend. This job should be your last resort"
good,"My time at Footlocker, my main role was dealing with customers on the shop floor and working behind the tills managing both transactions and refunds. These roles entailed customer service, carrying out stock checks and audits on a weekly basis, and occasionally assisting management in establishing the oncoming work rota for staff available in the store."
good,The management is really poor when it comes to decision making and being  responsible. Besides management its a fun place to work with a great discount and is willing to work with your availability
good,"If you love sneakers and everything there is about them this is your dream job for you. If you don't mind working a part time schedule or if your a manager or full time employee not seeing daylight unless it on your day off. "
good,typical mall retail - no advancement - 60+ hour weeks - had to relocate for any opportunities and at the discretion of the company.  have to deal with dying malls.
good,in order to really get the job done you have to learn how to multitask and move in and out the stock room be able to handle 101 questions at one time from multiple people.
good,"I wouldn't make a career of the place, but it's a good place to start out as a first job or just a part time side job.  There's no where to advance if you are looking to make a career of  the place."
good,"Great company but that all depends on management. You take 5 steps forward - but not paid or moved up the ladder, so thats 2 steps back. There's job security as long as you don't speak up on matters and cause a fuss. Don't even think about complaining to HR because like so many companies they are part of the destruction. Can be cut throat as you have individuals in corporate who will cut their own families arm to get ahead. There's a lot of nepotism and brown nosing"
good,"You have to be early to be on time. We had to present options to customers. prevent thieves from stealing. Management was sub-par"
good,Working all the holiday and weekend and long hours. Management unsupportive of employee growth. Takes a very long time for raise or promotions.
good,"Fast paced industry "
good,Very entertaining if you enjoy selling merchandise. Enjoyed meet different people everyday. Also loved giving my opinion to customers.
good,"it was an okay work enviornment, wasnt very professional . i had to ring customers up,count the money and inventory,box shoes to send out."
good,"Assistenza al cliente."
good,"footlocker is a very easy company to work for. assisting customers with sneakers, apparel, and cleaners is pretty easy as well as fun. I love interacting with people as part of my job and I love how they try to make it a stress free environment. the only thing is the pay is horrible. the amount of work we do doesn't come close to the pay we received. if you're not in a high position with the company (Full time or better) it make it very difficult to work there and maintain a stable living."
good,A typical work day consist of processing daily operational paper work in morning. Breaking down daily sales goals for team. Processing daily shipment. Merchandising store.
good,"As a Sales Associate, you will have to be a very driven and motivated person. You will be trained on upselling techniques and expected to meet goals and targets. "
good,"Fun place to work , very little advancement . Good training program fun amongst team members with a competitive nature . Good training"
good,"Good place to work with a fun environment until you get older. Part time worker have no benefits and no union so are not treated the best. The pay is good she you are just trying to make pocket change but not when you are trying to become more independent while in college. Hours are decent throughout the year, however the holiday hours are better. You have to fight for hours and better pay. Moving up in the ranks takes more times than necessary."
good,"Great mostly easy customers"
good,Management is having a hard time trying to figure out why they can't retain people and it is because it is the way they treat their employees.
good,"Selling shoes and accessories, stocking shoes in order by size, cashier, and taking out the trash before we closed the store"
good,"management didn't really know how to operate store or train employees. sell sneakers and add on sneaker cleaning products or socks or apparel to every sale. keep sneaker wall and clothing tables neat and presentable. check backroom for customer shoe size. keep backroom clean. ring on registers, order online for customers. verify end of day totals in registers."
good,"while working at footlocker, inc for three years, changes was never a topic of discussion. Due to the company's need to keep pushing forward with what is working now."
good,"My overall experience at foot locker so far has not been the worse the customers are friendly , Its just slow on certain days , I've learned a lot about shoes since working there and all the other accessories that comes with them. Management is cool, and i get along with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is being part-time and not being able to ring up my own customers so a lot of my sales have gotten stolen, also only getting paid minimum wage is hard to when you have a lot of bills to pay. The most enjoyable part of the job is when everyone is having a good day and it's slow and we just talk, laugh, and work."
good,"Different walks of life, No steady paced days. Fun if you have a nice team."
good,"Fun enviroment, retail hours, and discounts for employees,"
good,"A typical day at work can depend, since it is a sneaker store it can either move at a fast pace or be very slow. I've learned how to manage a team and have great customer service. Co- workers varies. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers."
good,Helping associates and helping customers out with the right sneakers
good,went to work usually had a joy full shift loved my co workers managers were a lil miserable but i refuse to let those things effect my day so i just keep smiling and continued on working. best part of my day would be walking into a busy store so i would know off the bat were would be having a successful day. and the most joyful part would being me seeing the schedule adn noticing me getting more shifts and last but not less me going home to family.
good,"Gain enough knowledge about the shoes and apparel and any other contest, point membership the company was dong for the month. Greet costumers, help the customer find the shoe they need. Always making sure there is a smile on our face."
good,The job requirements were good but I didn't like the fact that they barely gave me hours to work.
good,"Not very diverse, they didnt like when you asked for days off."
good,not to many complaints This job didn't ask for much but it also didn't give much. the best part was the customer interaction.
good,Foot locker was my first job as a sales associate. I applied psychological skills learned in college to make sales. 
good,"I found that working at Foot Locker was a bit easier than Champs. There is less inventory to deal with, yet all of the selling is about the same. I stuck with Champs because of better product, better corporate initiative, and was a bigger challenge."
good,"Slow during the week but weekends are a fast paced! See different people every day meet nice people who returns back, i learned a lot through the company with people. hardest part of the job is co workers who want to do it their way, most enjoyable part is holidays when its fast paced and non stop work"
good,"Accountable for managing all day-to-day operations of assigned store as well as achieve target productivity, sales, and profitability goals."
good,A typical day at work was having a huge workload and being under shceduled.
good,I worked sales and stock room at kids footlocker.The pay wasnt really that good and the hours either.
good,Foot Locker has a very laid back office environment. Cons were that there wasn't much of an office culture or opportunities for career growth. Leadership was not very involved with lower level colleagues.
good,Wouldn’t recommend trying to live off of footlocker because the salary isn’t the best. Management wasn’t that great either. But it is a good job for the youth
good,"Un lavoro frenetico, poca attenzione al cliente. I dipendenti sono forniti di auricolare per lo scambio di informazioni tra colleghi che distolgono l'attenzione dalla vendita del cliente. Vendere è l'unico obiettivo, senza dare importanza alle richieste, alle esigenze ed ai gusti dei clienti. L'importante è che lascino i soldi in cassa, nulla di più. Pessima esperienza, personalmente parlando."
good,This job was horrible from start to finish all due to management. I've always wanted to work here and initially i was excited. the job was fun when the right manager was around.
good,"Foot Locker is an interesting company, it is not the best, when I left, about 30-50 people also left complaining about the same ideas. Management does not take employees serious, all ideas are stamped out."
good,I’ve greeted customers to see what shoe they desire. I’ve stocked shoes and organized the shoe slots so to be sold easily. Being asked if we have a shoe in size then I’m on it.
good,"You'll find some interesting and genuine co-workers which makes the shifts go by easier, and they'll help you learn things in relation to the company as there's a friendly environment offered. "
good,"I love my job and the different people I encounter daily, however I left the company and came back and left again  and I must say they give a store to anyone! The manager I worked under needs more people skills and time under his belt to have even been considered a store manager. His emotions tend to get in the way of his business attitude and the way he talks to his staff is unprofessional at all stakes  I miss my old store and old crew ( including management)"
good,"Tout dépend de quel foot Locker "
good,"Management would steal your sales even when they are on salary essentially to just keep their job. I brought in the most sales in the state and they would say they needed to run the register and would type in their identification. My job was primary sales, I was the sales manager and the head manager would have me in the back taking deliveries my entire 8 hour shift so I wouldn't get my sales which was also a huge part of my income."
good,I worked here as my first job after my sister had worked there for a while. It was slow unless it was a release day and it wasn’t my crowd of people so I didn’t look forward to work as I would’ve liked. They are cool people and a chill work environment. But throughout the week it is very slow and hard to hit your daily quota especially part time or those in school.
good,"A typical mall retail experience, bouncy schedule, a lot of demanding customers. Incompetent managers at times. The actual work you do is fine though. Not overly demanding and if you love sneakers it's a great place to work"
good,if you enjoy working with customers its a great job to have. long hours and associates are not compensated well but store mangers are. assistant managers are on the low end of pay.
good,"Foot Locker bietet die Möglichkeit sich schnell durch gute Leistungen eine höhere Stundenbasis aufzubauen/ zu erarbeiten. Jedoch werden diese Stunden (oftmals) ohne Absprache mit den Mitarbeitern variiert. D.h , dass ein Mitarbeiter mit einem Acht Stunden Vertrag , oftmals für ca. 1-2 Wochen auf 22-25 Stunden hochgestuft wird. Dies passiert nicht jedem aber allgemein sehr regelmässig."
good,A typical day of work consist of your usual tasks and duties. However upon completion of that the supervisors have a choice to release you or not and eight times out of ten they will keep you there to clean.
good,Exciting place to work some good people who care about the business. Very intelligent groups and most people work well together. Brand new office space
good,Idéal pour les jeunes en recherche d'une première expérience. Les perspectives d'évolutions sont minces si il n'y a pas de magasin qui ouvre.
good,We didn’t have a lot of workers which affected our days off . Over all the environment was nice and the associates where friendly. Management needed a little training.
good,I already moved on from all my experiences from Foot Locker. I do not wan t to elaborate on it. i'm not sure if everybody had or has a bad time like me but i am not a person who like to gossip about it.
good,nothing too crazy. it was a good entry level job for myself and I gained some skills on the floor but nothing to make a genuine career out of. Then again I was only part time and my manager at the time really didn't seem so interested in building his team...oh well.
good,I would say the most fun thing was being able to sale shoes to people and seeing positive reactions on their faces and that's what I liked about working their.
good,"Footlocker is an okay job, especially if you love shoes! The only issue is that management sells the shoes before the actual release date and they pocket some of the money. They only hire friends or family members and the discount is misused."
good,Good place to work if you are in high school and have no responsibilities. Pros being able to sell the latest sneakers and apparel at a commission rate.
good,"If you love that merchandise and genre of shopping its fun, but its a hard place to advance your career. Great discounts on occasion, but you usually work late after closing."
good,"Very good company to work for but if looking for advancement and good compensation, this is NOT the place for it. Workers get minimum wage, hours are cut almost often."
good,"Have to be passionate about what your selling , knowledge of products always a plus , fast paced , can multitask. Be friendly outgoing and happy even if they aren’t the best associates don’t stop being you because of anyone."
good,"Il lavoro in sé è stimolante, la timidezza la perdi per forza. Il lavoro di squadra è bello e aiuta molto a crescere e migliorare in generale. Il salario come tirocinante è misero e non ripaga delle 40 ore settimanali a 500 euro e soprattutto non è gratificante passare anche l'aspirapolvere e lo straccio quando si è sottopagato! Anzi, vorrei sapere proprio se è legale una cosa del genere."
good,"As per usual with retail you serve customers all day while some of them are friendly and happy others are unpleasant and entitled. You just have to take the good days with the bad. You're expected to consistently push sales to customers. ""Don't stop selling until the customer stops buying"" which comes with its own challenges. It's not for the faint hearted."
good,"Fast paced work environment that gives you the ability to connect with customers and assist with finding great shoes as well as other merchandise. Aside from the usual customer attitudes it was a fun place to work. Be ready to do a little bit of everything as you find yourself being a cashier, while assisting customers in need, and maintaining overall store appearance."
good,"Very fun, and refreshing environment to work in. The workplace can be very busy at times during holidays and special local events, but nothing a little extra push can't solve. There wasn't many opportunities for advancement in the company which made it kind of stagnant with very little pay."
good,"Proficiencies in telephone and front-desk reception within a high-volume environment while servicing excellent customer care​.​Pr​ocessed all incoming and outgoing mail; notified staff of packages and faxes, wrap and send packages requiring special handling; act as central pick-up and delivery agent for incoming and outgoing mail, faxes and courier services​.​Maintained inventory and an adequate level of general office supplies; assists with supply orders, distribution of administrative items, and invoices.​Kept the front desk and the kitchen areas neat and fully stocked​.​Performed tasks as requested by supervisors​."
good,"Its Retail, so hours were long and tiring. Scheduling was hard in small market store, as the staffing was small. No real security for shoplifters. No real advancement after reaching Store manager level."
good,"not to the bad, its a decent place to work at i cannot be arsed to fill out these reviews for every single working place i worked at, stop this cheese now"
good,"Footlocker is a good entry level job for young adults who are ending high school and starting college. It is a very competitive environment and can at times be fun. They are flexible and go around your school schedule and the shoe discounts do come in handy. However, the management isn't very well trained and doesn't know how to handle certain situations correctly. Additionally, their pay is extremely low and it is very hard to get a raise."
good,Foot Locker isn't a bad place to work if you're single and aren't trying to raise a family.  I am a guy who will sacrifice to see his kids and wife on a consistent basis.  Foot Locker doesn't allow that due to the nature of retail.
good,travaille de 10h a 18h ou 11h/19h bon coaching on apprend beacoup mais c'est assez fatiguant
good,"Was a great experience in learning how to be in sales and engage with all types of different people, including coworkers and customers, and helping find their styles left me a smile on my face"
good,Footlocker is a good good place to work at if you like shoes and if you like retail. But the pay is a little less than you’d expect. Footlocker isn’t a bad place to work overall tho.
good,"While footlocker might be fun to work at, and the people you work with are fun. The company does not pay anyone enough to live off of. You are unable to receive raises at the company, unless you decided to go into upper level management. A part time associate makes minimum wage, and an Assistant manager makes about 10 cents more."
good,"You must be fast and ready to work (when it's busy). Greet and help every customer. Sales is commission based which is good and bad, because when the mall is slow your check won't be as great compared to the holidays. You must know a little about shoes, the more you know the better."
good,"word slecht planning gedaan "
good,The previous assistant manager had difficulties when being around women and treated female employees very different including calling them when drunk.
good,Footlocker was a fun place to work at. However the pay was not enough and you work more then you should for the pay you receive. I don't plan on returning to another Footlocker to work at.
good,"In working 5+ years for the company, I have been able to improve my people skills and communication skills. I recommend Foot Locker for those looking for a first job, but there is little chance of career advancement within the company."
good,"Retail isn't for everybody"
good,"The job was acceptable, however the pay was very low. I was a part time manager and had the responsibility of opening and closing the store. I also had responsibility of depositing the money at the end of the shift. However my pay was only $.25 above minimum wage."
good,As a General Manager for the company it's every demanding and stressful. On average you will put in 50 hours a week just to get the job done (No paid Overtime as a store manager).  The workplae culture is ok and there trying evole with the times. Overall if you have a family this position with this company is not for you.  The long hours will take a toll on you. The pay has to change as well with the demands and stress corp put on your head on a daily basis is more greater than what they pay you.
good,"If you love sneakers and meeting people , it’s gonna be a fun place to work. Fast paced job every minute could be busy so had to be hustle. Trust me when you see customers find what they want and leave with a great shopping exprience you are gonna feel good."
good,"fast environment very diverse group of people depending on location"
good,Footlocker is a fun and great place to work. People are very helpful and willing to help . Management is easily approachable and friendly. The discounts employees recieve are geeat.
good,"nice place to work for a part time temporary job. if the min wage pay was higher than this would be one of the best jobs, far as getting your hourly pay and commission."
good,Great discount on shoes. Employees are really cool. Management changed is a little bossy. The job is easy to do bringing out shoes fixing racks. There will be no more commission going forward.
good,"May be a great place for high school/college aged, first job or sports enthusiast. Full-time benefits not bad but pay isn't conducive to cost of living."
good,Overall working at footlocker is fun and you gain some great skills but the job does not give you a good quality of life. They ask too much of their managers and definitely do not compensate enough. They ask you to go above and beyond and it really makes you question if you are valued for what you do.
good,nice place to work.  not a place to make a career.  nice semi annual discounts and cool atmosphere to be in.  Management is unprofessional and little chance of advancement
good,"As manager, the job requires long hours, ever changing duties and responsibilities/workload, with low pay. Praise is given when job is well done, but quickly taken away when issues arise."
good,"A typical day at work would be connecting and interacting with customers. Having a smile on your face and figuring not just what shoes they want but to insure they leave satisfied. That made the culture of the store exciting and joyful for customers of all ages. The hardest part of the job was accepting the pay, which wasnt enough. The best part of the job is meeting new people and connecting with others. People can impact you in a postive way, and that can one day affect them in a positive influence."
good,Position advancement isn't really there. Honestly doesn't pay enough for the amount of work that is expected of you. Depending on your position the work load is ridiculous.
good,"if this is your first job, its not bad just to get a paycheck. definitely don't recommend if youre looking for something long term. no grey area when it comes to in store traffic; either very slow or very busy"
good,"Laid back job with plenty of down time, the expectations on moving product was very high and were demanded. The work itself was very easy as long as you were comfortable with interacting with customers and pushing sales."
good,A typical work day would be dealing with different types of customers who you would have to treat fairly although you knew they werent interested in making a purchase. Also depending on what time of year it was determined how constant the traffic was and how much harder you would have to work. I learned how to multitask and talk to people to be able to best fit their needs. Management varied on the store location because of the different area and the expectations involved. The hardest part would be not knowing the new products because of not having any hours for an extensive period of time and the lack of knowledge I was able to provide customers without having to continuously ask for assistance. The most enjoyable part would be having customers leave the store satisfied.
good,You open the store and get the registers counted and ready to go. The most enjoyable thing about the job was the customers.  I learned how to do shipment inventory and the difference between men and women sizes and also unisex sizes.  The hardest part of the job was doing the wizard because you have to go back a week or two later to find paper work with numerous order numbers on one page and you would only have to find one number.  Sometimes the paperwork would be missing so you would have to print that week or day you're looking for entire sales log in order to find it.  Management wasn't fair at all if you wasn't a person that they may have liked from the start they would pick with you about any
good,"The job is fun but the pay is not worth the stress. The company is to big for its employees to be making minimum wage to be honest, and if you cant handle competing for your pay, then its not the job for an average person."
good,"Footlocker is a fun and urban environment to work in. Very suitable for late teens and young adults. It provides a friendly, social, and fast pace atmosphere making it easy to go to work everyday."
good,"Normal work environment, interesting staff. Store wasn't very clean and staff wasn't very welcoming or helpful. Poor management, I also was poorly trained and left to figure out everything on my own."
good,"El puesto de trabajo era más bien físico y no había facilidad de promoción, por lo que otras personas nuevas entraban en un mejor puesto."
good,"some days may be real slow, other times really busy. Fun place to work at, good discount. Horrible pay for amount of work to do. Back to school and Christmas is worse time to work."
good,Footlocker est un bon emploi pour des étudiants. Je m'occupais de beaucoup des tâches qui devrait être fait par les gestionnaires
good,it is a great place to work can always talk to management . loss prevention is really strict so it does not make sense if to lose a great job and benefits over sneakers
good,My experience was great with this company. This business is not that professional as far as keeping gossip checked at the door.
good,"Daily work load for Footlocker manager was a heavy load, I learned a lot in my 5 years working up the ranks in the company and my passion for the job was high."
good,"At first you get slot of"
good,I felt that I never had opportunity for advancement.  The upper management was selected from outside the company before the inside of the company.
good,Really fun job until you realize your paychecks will never be more than $300. Management was terrible and none of the same people i worked with earlier this year are still there except the manager.
good,"Not a job you will enjoy as a older individual, many pros and many cons its a job you will enjoy while your in high school or college. More like a first job type of thing."
good,"great place to work, really enjoyed staff, manager."
good,The days at work were always different. I would start off with paper work which could take me longer depending on how busy it got inside the store. I learned the most at this job though. I was able to work closely with the hiring so I have come to understand qualities and techniques to figure out who should be hired. The hardest part of this job was the down time between the slow and busy parts of the day. The easiest is selling shoes is actually enjoyable.
good,"I would usually start the day as a stock associate and depending on what management want me to do i will switch to a sales for the day.Depending on the shift I have rather it be a morning or night it would usually run different work day, if im on the morning or evening shift I'll help unload the truck twice. A night shift will have me clean up the stock and make sure everything is neat for the morning guys. The co-workers makes the store feel like a family kinda place, everyone always make sure everyone is being treated fairly. I felt management was a bit neglectful to certain workers being that its a big store and its constantly hiring new people so its kinda hard to really be notice. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with your co-workers they make the job easier and really help you get through the day stress free."
good,"Job wasn't fun, and the benefits were terrible. Pay was not worth the amount of time worked as a sales associate. Commission was only one percent so selling 10,000 worth of products only gave you an extra 100 bucks."
good,Everyday would be a different task for us cashiers we would not focus on one thing for a whole week we would arrange the store everyday and always move stuff around as needed but as a typical day we would also provide our customers with great outcomes and also provide them with great customer service
good,"A typical day at Lady Footlocker depends if the day is fast or slow. If it's slow that means the store didn't reach the goal of the day, and also you were low in commission. I learned patience, and great customer skills at this job. Management didn't give workers enough hours. Co-workers always was willing to help one another. The hardest part of this job was lack of hours. The most enjoyable part of this job were meeting customer needs because I know I did my job correctly."
good,good people and management but not enough hrs the peope where kind and the management was great. it was my 1st job and it was a great experience .
good,"During peak season its great but after it ends pay sucks,hours suck not worth the labor. I enjoy working with the many different customers and love shoes that's whats keeping me there ."
good,"All about numbers. Its not what you know that will advance you, its who. Great benefits, liked the employees i worked with."
good,"Footlocker is a cool environment, very competitive which can lead to disputes amongst sales associates but its a nice environment. I just wish they'd pay a whole lot better. By the way it's an environment where managers show favoritism. How much hours you get sometimes is determine by how hard you work."
good,Good place to start but not a great place for advancement. If you re ambitious this is not the place for you. You will not be compensated accordingly. I've met a lot of people and keep i contact with some.
good,Good company to work for but personal life is non existent if you desire advancement. In order to maintain a position you must work tirelessly and you must be cognizant of all facets of the business.
good,this job has helped me through the year but i m now looking for something new as there aren't enough hours.
good,"Great and fun work environment, staff is extremely helpful. only negative were the hours."
good,Fun but not enough structure the people were fun too work with but everything was scattered all the time.
good,"I loved it here because of the discount. I kinda miss it. They were great. But the pay is here is bogus. They are based off of commission so if making $5 an hour is ok with you, then go for it."
good,"Sell, sell, and sell. Know great customer service. A typical work day can be unpredictable. Hardest part dealing with rude customers"
good,"I worked for the company for a few years n the beginning it was great. I really enjoyed coming to work, but that quickly changed. When new management took over at the store i was employed at the sales decreased and my co-workers all began to be mean snakes. if you are not management this is not a career for you it is hard to advance from part-time to full time."
good,"fair managment , but favoritism. Easy day at work. Hardest part of the job would be attending to multiple customers at the same time."
good,"This job is not what its made out to be."
good,not worth the pay that they want to give you or hours work hard for very little and get nowhere within the company
good,A typical day for me at Footlocker; would be very active. Constantly moving and stocking shoes. i learned how to be a team player and not just focus on myself. The hardest part about this job is knowing who to talk to and who not to talk too. I enjoy it when we are busy and dot have time to just stand around.
good,The people (associates) are great. Directors and Senior leaders are lacking real leadership qualities.
good,Working behind the counter as a cashier. Also helping with apparel and shoe sales.
good,"Working 5 days a week w/9 hr shifts including 1/hr lunch buitl into it,  taking inbound calls from customer's seeking concern with thier accounts. Resolving customer's main intent to cancel services, but driving them to stay as a valued customer, assisting them with billing issues and satisfactory promotional deals, learned how to transfer accounts, retain/gain revenue, sales cable, internet, digital voice, and home security. Work with calm diverse co-workers. Don't have a hard part or enjoyable part of the job."
good,Don't wish to review this job. It was a job I was grateful to have at the time.
good,"Only a great job if you work your way up to a management position. Otherwise, you deal with constant politics and pointless accessory meetings that have no lasting effect on store performance. District managers are for most part greedy and schedule so many pointless meetings its ridiculous so that they get their annual bonuses but take no consideration to the fact that people have families and lives outside of selling sneakers, apparel, etc. As a former assistant manager at one of the top stores I would only recommend this job for a high school student maybe in need of some part-time work to get them through school. Managers and district managers are some of the most corrupt in the company. On a positive note, was great to work as a team and meet and/or exceed sales goals. Hardest part of job was working through dealing with politics and lazy managers and at times having to work through breaks due to being under-staffed."
good,"As store manager I was in control of full operations of store, meeting sales goals, visuals, supervising staff, receiving and shipping merchandise, payroll, schedules, POS operations, shrink and inventory control, hiring, training staff. Fun environment "
good,"It's a great place to work if yo like to busy all day. Your never doing the same thing all day long. I got certified to be a man up driver, The management is good they are fair, People that I worked with were good workers and fun to work with. The hardest paet of the job for me is all the bending and getting down on the floor and back up."
good,The employees are great to work with and the management is ok good if you're in the right location. Some management think you should be robots and have no life. Had fun while I was there and loved some managers but it was time to move on
good,Compensation = $5 and some change + 1% Commission ($2000 in the hole daily before you can generate positive profits over min wage.)
good,Worked in office setting processing credit card orders. Helped get me back into work force in office setting and helped refresh my abilities to work over the phone when necessary.
good,Definitely helped me grow as a young person and gave me the tools needed to succeed in my desired and preferred field.
good,"A day consist of starting out with a written plan on what needs to be done for the day. This is communicated to the staff as soon as they come in to work. I've learned how to work with a wide range of diversity, also how to delegate assignments to indiviuals and enforce it. My co-workers were a joy to work with, due to the fact that I had an open door policy as a manager. The hardest part of the day was when it was a lack of customer coming in to shop. the most enjoyable part of this job was the interaction with the customers that would come in to shop."
good,"A typical day of work consist of, clocking in, printing off paper work, making sure that the paper work is correctly put away, checking in inventory correctly, displaying the merchandise as it comes in. I have learned that the customer are always right and first, as a manger i also have learned that, you have to lead by example. the hardest part of working for lady foot locker is that it is a slow pace store and not very many customer shop with the store. the most enjoyable part of the job is, when a customer leaves with a happy smile and a satisfied customer."
good,its an ok company to work for the pay sucks though and they make new rules almost every other month to find more and more ways to let associates go.
good,"helping customers find the right shoe that fits their comfort level,style and personallity"
good,My co-workers are the best!
good,"Good entry-level position to hone benefits administrator activities. I learned how to process HRMS tasks. No room for advancement or for job growth. However, if you can stay in the position for one year, you should be able to use the skills learned to go to another company."
good,Vente complémentaire hook up être rapide rivalités commissions
good,"A normal day at footlocker is having a connecting conversation with guest/customers. You honestly learn something everyday working in a socialize place like the mall. You have to manage to take care of 3-4 people at the same time giving your customers the help they need is important shows how much you can handle and how your work ethic is managed. Also making great relationship with your team is important, able to have fun with your fellow team members ."
good,so I was working at the El Cajon location as a cashier with a manager named Guy who was pretty cool. It's when I got a promotion as sales lead at the chula vista store that all things went down hill. About the job... you have to be knowledgeable on the shoes that you are selling knowledge is key because if you don't know what you are talking about then you can't suggest products to customers. This job is based off commission so you have to reach your goal to sell both shoes and accessories otherwise the DM will find out who is under performing. The job isn't hard most of the time you will make a sale just be friendly and knowledgeable and suggest the customer to try on the shoe.  Once they do you will be set :) I had a lot of shady associates who were jealous of me and I had a manager that was super mean to me so that's why I left but if it wasn't for her I would have stayed longer. The pay was not great but I was a child at the time and I didn't have bills so it was okay. Just come to work with a positive attitude and you will be fine. You always leave by 9pm when the mall closes.
good,"Good job for people with no kids. It’s retail so working holidays are mandatory and family weekends are out of the question, you get one weekend off a month."
good,Footlocker is a good place to work to get experience in customer service face to face interactions also sales experience convincing customers to buy merchandise
good,"Il y a une très bonne ambiance, mais il y a un manque de cohésion et de considération par la direction de France."
good,"Would recommend this job to high school kids and ppl with full time jobs that wouldn’t mind working part time. Great discounts, and you DONT get first dibs on shoes."
good,vendita al dettaglio di calzature e abbigliamento.
good,"Working at foot Locker has its ups and downs. Overall a good company if you’re doing everything in the right way and to foot lockers standards. If you love people and sneakers, this is the job for you."
good,"I had fun doing the actual work. The company mission could be misconstrued from time to time varying upon the location I was at. Like I said, I loved the work. Being social, meeting people and helping people is all I'm about. Different managers had different missions though so it all varies."
good,To work at footlocker you have to be a people person and have some energy. Footlocker is a fast paste environment where you will come across a lot of different personalities.
good,"At the time when I was working at footlocker I felt as though the management was handled poorly because of lack of communication. They would also train you for a job and have you practice it for a week then stop 6 months. Only to ask you ""do you know how to do this"" I would be truthful and say that I forgot and would like a little review to get me going, then they look me in the eye and say ""we'll find someone else"" and walk away."
good,Worked here in high school. Management is ok depending on who you get. Can be a lil bit of work drama. You get paid trash but you get commission. The discount is 30%. Its a cool job to have
good,I didn't learn much at footlocker other than the fact that no one cares about anyone but themselves no matter how hard you work. I liked my first two supervisors but the last one...not so much.
good,"Foot locker was a great place for me to work. During my close to 10 year career at Foot Locker, I've learned different methods of managing and coaching different backgrounds, races and ages in customer care and sales."
good,"This job was my first sales job i learned a lot from it, it showed me how to take care of customers in a fast and professional way and how to manage my time"
good,We would have to be on it if you wanted to beat your work mates. Every sale you got it would lead to a better paycheck! And it always looked good on you when you makes sales.
good,working at footlocker was challenging however it enabled me to develop key life skills in how to manage customers when working in an busy establishment such as footlocker.
good,they lack consideration to those with multiple jobs. they are very rude. favoritism does exist within each location. very inconsiderate and very inconsistent.
good,Footlocker is a fun job. You meet new people that come into the store daily. You can sell the newest sneakers and clothes that comes out. You always stay on top of what's hot.
good,"Working there was satisfying due to the vibe of the store.Management was very good, they communicated with the team very well and made tasks simple. It really felt like a safe and fun environment to work at"
good,Regret getting a job here ever since day 1 I have been shorted hours and days.. management is okay and customers are the worst. They’re always stealing and causing problems
good,Overall foot locker is a trash company to work for unless you have completely no life or family. even if you get promoted to store management they pay you less than the manager at your local wendys and add extra stuff for you to do that was not spoke upon before promotions went into place. Finishline is a more professional workplace if your looking for a job in shoes.
good,"Not the best place to work, unless you are a shoe fanatic and want a discount on Eastbay, Foot Locker, and Champs merchandise. First shift shipping supervisor tends to micro manage and also favors certain employees over others."
good,Trust me when i say that corporate does not care about you. The discount isn’t even good anymore since they changed it and you’re getting paid minimum OR commission. Not minimum wage AND commission. If it’s 7.25 you’re always going to make 7.25 and assistant managers only make 7.80. A joke. And HR is the absolute worst.
good,Working at Foot Locker with fun and interesting met new people on a daily interacting with different types of people and hasn't understand how to relate to different situations
good,"leuke collega's management was minder."
good,the footlocker flagship is a very cool store located in one of the biggest shopping destinations for tourist in New York city the store has a wonderful lay out they will make it easy to strike a conversation with a consumer.
good,"Long working hours, management do not get payed enough, the company is not paying for overtime.  HR is not giving enough support to managers. You only get the rota a few days in advance."
good,"In Philadelphia, Pa the avarage pay for an part time associate is 7.25/hr with a commission percentage that range from 2-4% based on the store volume. Going to a Sales Lead (Part Time Assistant Manger) pay increase to 8.08/hr with commission a percentage based on the store volume. However going to an Full Time Assistant Manager your pay goes to salary no more hourly pay. However the salary changes based on the store volume your at."
good,"The staff was like family and understood very well when i need a sick day off, restocking the shelves, greeting costumers, getting to know different people and new shoes that came out"
good,The team is great to work with. Very collaborative and helpful. The Tools and processes are average and need upgraded. There is alot of new management and cohesiveness needs to improve.
good,steady pace. fun environment to work in. great team work. everyone is willing to work with each other to make the sell / transactions. hardest part of the job is maintaining a positive attitude when getting frustrated.
good,"Working for footlocker was an okay experience, personally I quit due to lack of respect from managers, but that also could’ve just been my location. I thought that maybe because my location was the flag ship footlocker on 42nd st that the managers would’ve been professional but I was way wrong. Although I did enjoy working with my co workers and meeting new people everyday."
good,I could be better if a lot changed but i can't speak on the company. the work culture is fine but the pay is low. i don't for as high paced foot locker is nothing will change unless the DM says so.
good,Good job for someone who just looking for a job but has another source of income. You do get an employye discount and most of the time they would try to work with you with your time.
good,Footlocker Vaughan Mills location is actually not the best place to work for part-timers.. It forces us to search for a second job because part-timers get no hours. This cause stress especially being students who have bills to pay and exams to worry about. I would not recommend anyone to work at this location for that specific reason
good,"You train a lot to be a sales lead at foot locker, but the pay is horrible. You do get commission, which is good on a busy day, if not you only make minimum wage."
good,Working at footlocker was an “ok” experience. I loved how everyday I met new people from around the world but the management and employees relationship was not good. I feel the  manager would often act unprofessional and steer up drama between other employees.
good,long stressful days. this site is ridiculous for requiring me to review this company and also requiring a certain length for this review to be. I would not be typing if I did not have to
good,"Started the job to fix the store up due to previous work associates. It was a small but great store. One of the only locations to get women’s Nike, adidas, puma, and other athletic wear in Medford."
good,"sold shoes to costumers who came in the  store, i asked them what i could help them with and go from there to adress there needs to making them happy ."
good,"Working with customers and new shoes/apparel is definitely the fun part of the job! It is also fun working in a team environment. I LOVED my co workers! They are what made the company great and they are the reason why Footlocker makes millions! Only down side to the company is that they don't invest in their employees, which is sad because if they did I bet that sales would increase significantly, but also it would make more people want to work for Footlocker and stay at Footlocker."
good,"Mangers do literally everything, Which is a good and bad thing."
good,Restocking or cleaning most of the time. Enhances your time-management and helps you engage with customers. Slow business but great for slow-paced workers.
good,"it was a chill place to work at. at times it was difficult cause boss had favorites and i was new. the hours werent so great, loved the discounts and store since im athelitic guy"
good,"Its a good place to work & meet new people, but overall management & terms of progression in company is bad. competitive work & also fun at the same time."
good,Came on board at a time when there was tremendous uncertainty and change so that has impacted my overall view of the company. They just went through a major restructure which hasleft people confused about their own professional direction/security.
good,"Job is fun except for the fact of working in the mall. ideal for a student though just trying to get by and enjoy the fun shoes they come out with. Good place to network,"
good,$7.50 an hour plus commission is all I get paid. I have broke sales records for my store and worked 51 hours in the same week and still don't get a big paycheck.
good,"I love sneakers so I loved informing people about sneakers. But the job was not fun for me. I worked in a smaller store so the hours were scarce. I asked to transfer around many times but I was never granted that luxury. My sales numbers were not good enough to qualify for a full time job, but the store wasn't making enough money for my numbers to be much better."
good,As a former employee of Footlocker Inc. I can say it was a fun place to work for. The only negative thing I have to say is the compensation for the type of work that was ask did not balance out. It was an unfair wage.
good,fun place to work had to keep up with all the customers that can be annoying at times all the touristbut it was fun enjoyed the people around me learned alot from them
good,"Always a competition getting customers with other employees. Some employees are not loyal "
good,Its a nice company to work for. There's just no movements and the management staff is not up to par. The Pay is also another distraction 7.25 cannot pay my bills
good,I was getting paid well below minimum wage after being told I would be making much more via the interview. During training I was treated like a child who was incompetent.
good,"Apparently easy to move up and you earn commission from every sale you make. However, the store management was so belligerent that I could not properly learn under the environment foster so I had to prematurely leave."
good,"It isn't a particularly difficult job, and at times it can even be pretty fun. But in order for you to get the most out of it, you'd need to be into sneakers. And if you're not a full-timer or management, you're not really going to be getting too many hours, so it's not a job if you're in high school."
good,"Everyday just really helped customers "
good,une entreprise qui fait beaucoup apprendre le salaire est très correct. ticket restaurant et chèques cadeaux. Evolution 0
good,Its a nice place despite strong demand and relatively low pay.you will be required to do a lot during the day but I did not think the reward matched fairly the work
good,Not the best management team I've ever worked under.  The hours were very long and physically hard work.  A good starting job for someone who likes retail.
good,"Footlocker is fun if you are just working there as a second job. I love the sales competitions. Sales Associates pay is really determined by your location. If you put in the required hours to complete your training material, advancement is not as hard."
good,Foot locker is a great place for employment and its very intresting for those into sports. This is a place where you can help others find specifically what they need for almost any sporting ocassion!
good,"Eastbay/Footlocker.com is a great place to work for experience or getting into a field. They will not promote you though or it will take years. Too much politics are involved.Everything has to be approved, EVERYTHING by Footlocker corporate in New York."
good,"Footlocker is a good job for teenagers or if you want to be a manager besides that is not really stable and does not have many benefits for someone trying to build a career. a typical work day consists of selling items, maintaining the store and its appearance, and satisfying customers. I learned how to interact with customers and accommodate all conditions. I learned how to deal with constant change and how to help maintain a store. There is two managers and two assistant managers for each store therefore the management varies across stores but at my particular store the management was good.The work place is very upbeat, you are always on the move, never sitting down or standing still it is constant movement. The hardest part about the job is trying to influence customers to get more than just sneakers especially when their mind is set and the most enjoyable part is the environment. there is always something to do you do not get bored."
good,Great company to work for. Great way to meet and network with new people everyday. Great way to enhance your people skills as well. Great work environment.
good,Managers had to work 6 day weeks 12 hour shifts with only 30 minutes of a break. Management was treat unfairly and barely recognized. No room for growth or development.
good,The job is not hard but can be stressful at times. Keep in mind that this job is retail. So dealing with customers is the biggest challenge. Outgoing personalities are recommended.
good,I have been working for locker for about a year and it's ok.is an easy part time job. I work in the stockroom. My coworkers are pretty cool rarely have any issues. My mangers are decent but very unorganized.
good,"I am an assistant manager at a kids foot locker. My job responsibilities consist of assisting customers if they have complaints, opening/closing the store, and being responsible with cash."
good,Nice as a first job and getting work experience. good for teens still in high school or in college that only wanna work part time and have time to study.
good,"It's a good place to work when you're starting off, but it quickly becomes draining. One will realize that there's not a lot of movement in the company."
good,Long hard shifts. Strict attendance policy. Decent pay. Great food cooked in cafeteria. Great benefits. Training and up training when needed.
good,"Lavoro in foot Locker da dodici anni, avendo sposato sin da subito la move mentality, non ho mai lavorato nella mia città d'origine ma sempre in store differenti avendo avuto l'opportunità di conoscere metodi di lavoro diverso e tipi di clientela differenti."
good,"- high pressure"
good,Only looking to work about 2-3 days a week? Management isnt the best but the plus is your discount. It is very generous. I learned how to interact with customers on a more personal level. The things that suck are sometimes the management is less focused on the customers and more on the sales. I've met co workers there who I became really good friends with. The most enjoyable part about the ob is having those repeat customers that you have the most in depth conversations with that help time go by faster on a slow day.
good,"This was my first job so I was somewhat shy and reluctant, but over time I got the hang of things. I gained confidence and used different tactics to sell products. "
good,its okay. I would prefer a job that pays a lot better. I did have the opportunity to move up to full time ans become assistant manager
good,As a manager I don't approve of some other managers who don't train certain staff properly. There is always something to do but pay for managers is poor.
good,self explanatory if your an adult this is not the job for you. nothing more i can really explain. just do not do it if your patience is low..
good,Was here for almost 8 years and the last 2yrs was a supervisor but there was no room for advancement because of management and people in the company.
good,Everyday was a 10 hour shift. Shipping and receiving shipments. Processing all the days inventory. Proper filing of Paperwork and invoices on the daily. The hardest part of my job was the strenuous work. Lifting heavy boxes and climbing up and down ladders all day. It was enjoyable because i got to work by myself too. I was self sufficient.
good,"Typical work day consists of a 9am to 7pm day. Printing paperwork, and filing paperwork. Checking the days sales projections and figuring out how to hit our sales goals. My co-workers are great. Young, energetic and they have a willingness to learn. I learned how to manage 16 to 20 associates at a time and make proper schedules to meet their individual availabilitiess. The hardest part of my job is having to work 12 to 14 hour shifts, and also having to fix customers issues and/or complaints. The most enjoyable part of my job is dealing with those open minded customers who come in and appreciate all we do at the store front. I enjoy meeting new people everyday and being able to turn them into Personal customers."
good,i do not have anything to say i am just writing this because i have to because of indeed and their requirements i did not want to do this
good,"slow days are Monday-Friday "
good,I interacted/helped customers with their preferred choices using great floor awareness and teamwork.I learned how to become more aggressive and to interact with multiple customers at once. Management could have make a lot of mistakes at times but got things straighten out if possible. The co-workers i worked with helped with a lot and respected my hard work and dedication for the company. Hardest part about the job was dealing with rude customers but the most enjoyable part about the job was great customers and energy at work.
good,"how to run a store , weekly reports . maintain stock keep associates up to date with training . and to be a leader.keep friendly relationship with daily customers"
good,"I enjoyed employment here it was a very fun experience, of course being a shoe enthusiast made the job more enjoyable since you have an employee discount and get all the shoes before anyone gets to them. Generally,this company is all about competition and almost all managers will push you to exceed in customer service to reach the store's goal for the day. Unfortunately, if you're one of the weak employees they will lower your hours if they find you're not helping the store get sales vs if you're consistent on your sales you're ""awarded"" with more hours. Lots of favoritism cause of that. Poor pay for sales associates. Too much moving and change of location."
good,Foot Locker was a great job for me at the time. It was flexible around my school hours and allowed me to focus on school and my income.
good,I open up the store  to make sure all register drawers were ready for cashiers when they arrive. Check inventory and put out all sale items out. Check online orders for our store start to fulfill them.  I have learned a lot of good  management skills.  I knew because each supervisor truly trusted me.  I loved making sure the customers' were happy. The hardest part of my job is working hard and bosses having favoritism. They hire people that are their friends and who are not qualified to do the job  or who really don't want to work and then I  or other employees would have to do their work and ours to make sure our store made the quota.  Its one thing you know you are responsible to do all the work but a company is suppose to work as a team. And hire people who are team players and will learn on the job how to also work independently. I love customer service and I love to work so that I can provide for my family.
good,Foot Locker allowed me to step up and be an assistant manager where I took on a lot of responsibility. I did all shipments and made sure my employees were doing there part among keeping the store clean and organized.
good,Arriving to work is always decent seeing as though I have to mainly work around kids. Management is terrible and always changing throughout the year. Hardest part of the job is having to deal with the pay.
good,I typical day working at Foot Locker would consist of all day interaction with customers and dealing with various personalities all day. I learned how to relate to people from all different walks of life and nationalities. For the most part I enjoyed working with all my co-workers. I've built friendships with many of them outside of work.The hardest part of working at Foot Locker was dealing with certain unreasonable customers and having days where work would be slow and we wouldn't make a lot of commission. The most enjoyable part of the job would be having a consistent flow of customers and enjoying the company of my co-workers.
good,"I loved seeing my friends walk in the store, only because my co-workers were not always kind to me. The hardest part was probably figuring out where the shoes go in the backroom."
good,"A typical at footlocker involves arriving on time to clock into work, communicating with customers about what meets their needs in the store whether it's shoes, clothes, hats, socks or ordering these things for the person if we don't have it in the store. My co-workers are very easy to get a long with, it's a very friendly environment. The hardest part of the job I would have to say is assisting more than one customer at a time while other co-workers are doing the same, the reason that being is because someone is always required to be on the floor to make sure no theft is going on. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting the sale requirement for the day."
good,"Great company to work for and develop customer service skills, inventory management, and staff training. There is no work life balance in management and must be available every day."
good,i grew so fast in this company but i felt like it was a set up because i move to one of the worst stores in the company and i had a bad audit and i was to blame the district manager is the worst ever
good,footlocker is a decent place to gain management experience but there is no long term career track. A typical day at work is managing employees and trying to make sales goals.
good,working at footlocker you learned how to treat people and speak to customers without them having to do so. engaging and selling was the main focus. reminder that it is a job so you have to be professional with your employees. hardest goal was selling insoles but the most enjoying part about the job is selling
good,"you would think that a major corpooration like footlocker would have decent managing skill nope they didnt poor managing and coruptive managing staff. as an assisant manager i store operations/visual"
good,Customer service in the retail business ws important also keeping the store in the way managers would want.  Restocking merchandise to it appropriate place by alpha-numeric
good,"une bonne expérience, travail en équipe"
good,Its a great fun environment to work in with the latest sneaker and athletic apparel. Its a team oriented job therefore you easily make friends with coworkers and managers always make it fun. hardest part is meeting sale quotas.
good,"At kids foot locker there were bittersweet times. The co-workers were all wonderful, but the manager was very rude but i actually enjoyed myself at the job when the assistant manager was there."
good,"Compensation is fair but limited opportunity"
good,"Worked with staff in efforts to complete daily, weekly, and monthly task while maintaining a customer service standard.  It detailed long hours, about 50-55, as store manager with the biggest challenge of keeping your staff/team motivated to buy into the mindset of follow up and follow through.  The hardest part about the job was the hours, being that this is a retail industry, and off days were dictated by the work load which left gaps in family life being that I have two kids.  But what I enjoyed most about the job was the fact that we had product that was always in demand which in turn made an immediate impact on the customers outlook whether they had a problem or just impulse shopping."
good,The only thing I didn't like was I had a check to bounce. The employees was great to work with everyone communications well. We helped each other learn to b creative with sales and customer service.
good,A typical day at work would be smooth depending on the customers that enters the store. I have learned how to be a leader and a strong manager throughout the years. From moving from store to store progressing on my skills i've realized all managers manage different.We keep a friendly relationship with the coworkers.
good,"Standing around waiting for customers"
good,it a big different when u change state with a job. You meet so many good people. footlocker DM need a wake up call/ not all
good,Our win goal at footlocker is to ensure our customers are given outstanding customer service for an enjoyable shopping experience. I a have been an Assistant Manager for over a year and i have grown a lot in that time. Taking on many responsibilities and duties associated with the position has taught me how to be a very effective worker and leader.
good,"It was a great experience, i enjoyed my first job and earning money, and customer service and the work enviroment"
good,Great way to start a retail job if your going to school and your young and if you want a career to start.
good,"Le travail à footlocker est un travail passionnant, qui demande beaucoup de dynamisme, et le sens du travail en équipes."
good,I enjoy working at Footlocker because I get to communicate with people to help them make important decisions on their appearance.
good,"i like working at foot locker it's a part time position for me that i only work weekends. the pay isn't that great but what i really enjoy about it most is the customers that comes in the store because i work in a tourist area and the joys of the diversity that i see and the things that i learn from some tourist i enjoy my job working the weekends but i dont make enough to actually have a living meaning housing, car ,and etc."
good,"Expérience très enrichissante dans l’ensemble."
good,"Providing outstanding customer service"
good,"The typical part-time job an individual has with a some what repetitive work place. However with the right sales members, it enables to push sales goals and focus on creating a better work environment and customer appreciation."
good,"On ly thing great is the employee discount. There is no set schedule the hours would reflect on the volume of the previous year. So sometimes I would get a good 25 hours a week then only to be dropped to less than 10 for the rest of the month. I did enjoy time working there, co workers and managers were great and helpful."
good,"Typical Day, Reviewing and discussing daily sales.Work closely with Buyer, DMM Planner and Merchandiser to maximize sales,deliver margin and profit plan."
good,I was a sales associate. Helping customers with their shoes.
good,"Mangement team not good"
good,I enjoyed all of the staff but it just was not paying enough for the amount of time I had to be there.
good,"Work at sometimes is tough but work is not always meant to be easy. It have it's fun times especially when you have nice customers coming in. Hardest part of the job is dealing with shoe releases, crazy customers willing to fight over a pair of sneakers. The easiest part of the job is pleasing the customers. With the right attitude pleasing customers come very easy."
good,"The position I worked was great, since I am a outgoing person."
good,A typical day at work is just doing my job to the best of my ability and getting along with my co-workers.
good,I enjoy helping people and working with the public. I had a great staff to oversee also. We all worked well together.
good,"I feel the internet associate were friendly and cared about their customers. But once I got to the corporate office all they seemed to care about was backbiting each other. The advancement opportunities were slim to none unless you had an ""in"" with someone higher up on the corporate ladder. Felt like I was working in a ""good ole boy"" atmosphere. I did enjoy processing the new samples that came through and working with the assistants to the buyers. I learned quite a lot from them. Too bad some of them got passed over as buyers because they were female."
good,0800 TO 1500 OR 0800 to 2100
good,A typical day at work consist of marking new sales and preparing new advertisement. Being able to give the customer great service providing for them the product wanting to be purchased any means possible. Being part of management it was difficult to encourage others to have the same motivation to do the best they can to make quota for the day. It was a very competitive atmosphere due to everyone also working off of commission.
good,work as a sales associate helped customers on a dasily basis also did stock room
good,I was mostly satisfied with KFL I like the people I worked with and for the pay could have been better.
good,Interesting setting. Learned to be apart of an awesome team. I loved helping customers and meeting their needs.
good,"fun job, and flexible schedule helping with inventory and replenishing is enjoyable and learning experience."
good,I enjoyed working for this company. This was my first experience in retail and customer service. It was a fast paced environment and I've learned a lot from this company.
good,it was a pretty good place to work. my co-workers are wonderful people to work with.
good,"management varies from store to store, but they get moved around a lot which sucks. as soon as you get close with anyone you find out they're getting moved then you have to get to know another set of management"
good,"I thought it was a great job to help me build call center experience. My days consisted of taking inbound calls and helping customers find a resolution! What I liked about the job was the employee discount, Customers for the most part were friendly at least to me, friendly co workers, and a easy job for the most part. What I disliked about the Job is they never let me change my hours as they told me hours were perminat from your start date, they only have two really busy seasons and most of the time I didn't get many calls and was bored from staring at a computer there, the pay could definitely be better too most call center jobs are usually paying between 13-17 an hour for entry level positions, if you like your weekend off this is not the job for you as they will work you on weekends. Overall I enjoyed my experience but I'm on to bigger and better things"
good,I was only at footlocker for 10 months before they had major layoffs.  The department I was in was extremely high stress and the turnover was high in that department.
good,This was my first job. The store in my area really didn't get a ton of foot traffic. A lot of the times it was very slow and the manager at that time was on his phone a lot.
good,"Footlocker didn't pay good enough for me, at first I was only working weekends but then a new manager came and I got less hours and I was only getting paid $30 to $50 every two weeks and it wasn't enough."
good,"too much favoritism !"
good,"They base advancement off of seniority rather than people with better qualifications and skills. As a result to this, people abuse their power of authority."
good,If your manager is really good then you will do really good. But my district manager didnt do her job & passed it off to my store manager. Which made the job stressful for me as an assistant manager which led me to quit.
good,"I would definitely go back. the atmosphere was okay , some of the managers weren’t fully trained which caused our team to lack a little, and no one was held accountable"
good,great drop but its low pay for long hours was paid 7.25 + commission  but didnt make commission unless you sold $3000 worth or inventory.  and if you have short shifts thats not possible
good,"Was just out of high school and it help pay for my car and little things at the time. The only thing was the schedule, worked funky hours and if we didn't find a replacement we could have the day off."
good,I learned how to socialize a lot more with people. It really brought me out of my shell. At footlocker is all about location when it comes to a busy day.
good,"The company has its perks, but it also has its downsides. It does depends on the store to determine the experience when working here. For the most part it’s a cool place to work. The hours aren’t very good and neither is the pay. I have been there over 8 years and never get a raise."
good,"Loved the people I worked with but left due to poor management of the department and lack of leadership. Felt as a whole the department was a dumping ground for other departments to push off their work responsibilities. On the flip side there were a lot of continued education courses offered to employees. Additionally fringe benefits like on site yoga classes, on site blood pressure testing and other health focused incentives."
good,"A lot of ups a downs, to make any real money you need to move up, part time work with this company is terrible, managers are over worked, they forget that workers have family’s to and would like to see them as"
good,"As a store Manager you have many reponsiilities and opportunities. This job is very demanding in terms of scheduling and hours. It not ideal for individuals who want to raise a family, due to the schedule structure (weekends, week nights, overnights, holiday etc.) there are opportunities to advance in the company whether store levels or corporate. Every single associate has a different experience, it all depends on your career goals and how your boss values your career and your development. . Store managers basically operate the store, from scheduling, payroll, cash transactions,  overseeing inventory and stock, handling all store issues and dealing with major customer complaints and inquiries."
good,With Foot Locker being my first real job it provided work experience in the customer service area. It was a commission based company so you needed to stay on your toes to assist the customers.
good,If you enjoy always looking over your shoulder than this is a great job for you. The pay is absolutely horrendous and everyone that works their is cliqued up.
good,"Great first job to learn about customer service. They always promote internally, especially if you put in the work. Say goodbye to your life outside the store though. Will tell you to move location without warning. Lots of pressure to reach sales goals. Little to no reward for reaching sales goals."
good,"Possibilité d’évolution, culture de l'argent, l'humain passe au second plan, pas droit a l'erreur et surtout on sait l'heure a la quelle on commence mais jamais l'heure a la quelle ont sort du magasin."
good,"The job is great for a first job, especially for a part-timer. However, the pay sucks and you really don’t see your hard work commission. The hours go up and down and if you’re looking for a job that’s consistent, then this job isn’t for you unless you’re applying for a manager position."
good,"Working at Foot Locker is like most retail places. Long hours, dealing with nice and rude customers."
good,"A typical day would consist of a early morning Stretch & Flex, Followed by a brief Explanation of the days workload, and beginning your day.The management could have been more hands-on, with employee's. The workplace had its moments, but for the most part energetic and friendly. The hardest part was never knowing when you were getting off, a UNTIL work is completed type job. The most enjoyable was the team work embedded, and the job amenities and benefits."
good,Lady Foot Locker was a great retail company with lots of benefits. There was always something to do without lulls. I did enjoy working with the public and creating relationships with my customers.
good,Not a bad job. Pay could be much better especially for managerial level. The responsibilities at the managerial level are not worth $12/hr. Schedule’s flexibility depends heavily on manager
good,Première expérience de vendeur qui a pu être enrichissante.
good,its a easy job to do just the pay changes per year is not good at all. check growth is no good you will receive a check based on numbers that sometimesd are not attainable
good,"Not an easy environment but easy to be promoted to an extent great expierence to learn about customer service, fast paced work environment, stocking on high shelves can be tidious"
good,"It has it ups and downs like any job! However, at a kids footlocker there are too many slow days, so it is like you're""re basically wasting your time baby-sitting a store."
good,"The managers are a bit trash. The environment though is fun and exciting.It's not what you think it is, like your co-workers make it enjoyable but the actual work is more demanding."
good,"Usually very busy during the weekend when everyone's off from school or work. It can get really hectic during certain times of the day, for example when its holiday season or when there is a sale going on."
good,"Responsible for scanning merchandise and keeping track of inventory, Performed general clerical duties, Responsible for making sure the shelves were completely stocked throughout my shift, Utilizing creativity to set up displays around the store"
good,Great first job for someone looking for flexible hours. Must be motivated to sale in order to make good commission. You're able to work at several locations for more hours.
good,"I was with Footlocker for over 13 years.  If you work hard, are reliable, and have a desire to climb the corporate ladder, you can make a decent living.  I seen many people climb that ladder to create a solid career in retail.  it just wasn't for me, at that time in my life!"
good,"Great place for part-timer workers, did this after school when I was in Highschool minimum wage but worked off commission as well. Co-workers were nice and we were always busy."
good,"Support from co-workers. "
good,Overall I didnt mind the job for a while however after taking on a full time position I started hating being here. Currently looking for a new job that pays better ASAP.
good,Must be willing to work very fast and it gets extremely hot inside the warehouse. Many of the things you need to do involve ladders and you must be able to lift quite a bit.
good,"during a typical day at work, there was potential to make an extra 3-4 dollars per hour through personal effort, which served as motivation to remain at task. Constant interaction with customers coming through the store is necessary as a salesperson on the floor, increasing my communication skills."
good,Working for foot locker was fun at times. I enjoyed every single co worker and almost every manager I've had. its very relaxed but can get boring if business is slow. The pay is terrible and so are the paid vacation hrs but it's a good job for someone who is in school since their flexible.  the annoying part about the job is how they want you to try and sell extra products to customers who sometimes got annoyed and they don't offer raises but want you to do so much for little pay.
good,A job you should apply for to get by. The management at my store could be better and the systems they use should be updates to something other than windows vista but other than that its fine.
good,Good job but retail isn't the way to go right now.  Position was dissolved after 12 months.  Company has great benefits and encourages advancement if you can move.
good,lavoro che puoi svolgere in giovane eta ma che non ti garantisce di una stabilita futura causa continui spostamenti
good,"I enjoyed working for this company and the perks it came with, but at the time management was not stable. Since then, management has changed so I believe it is a great place to work for now."
good,"I would open and/ or close store daily. If opening, I would prepare store for business. There were usually several tasks before opening, and many more tasks after opening in addition to assisting customers. I learned much about athletic shoes and what is best for customer's needs. I also learned the do's and dont's for being a great manager. The upper management wasn't very good. It was clear that their focus was totally on customer, and not on the employee. I did have a great discount and a few nice perks-- even some regular customers were cool, but I worked long hours and was expected to be on call even on day's off or vacation. The knowledge I gained at Foot Locker was very valuable, but there was no work-life balance which became stressful. The most enjoyable part of job was some of the people I worked with and vacation."
good,"Love my job, love sports sales, need a bit more permanency and consistent hours. Fun co workers, great customers, like selling thing about which I have a huge passion"
good,"very competitive because you will be working on commission unless you're a Manager. Assistant managers run just as much as a full timer or part timer. The pay is not so great if you are in a small volume store. "
good,"Management was very unprofessional, work environment is very hostile and high school-ish. There is no one to coach or develope you as an employee so no one to advance you forward"
good,at my store the upper management is not good at all. me and my fellow Assistant managers do all the work. my store manger is lazy and abuses the stores time. she steals time and tries to get out of a lot.
good,"Working for Foot Locker was an overall learning experience. I was able to learn more about being an effective leader, effective communicator, and a mentor."
good,Great job for highschool kid. Good for a first job wouldn't recommend to a grown person. Discount comes in handy. No raises hours are a bit annoying around the holidays.
good,the managers were horrible and rude. Also the customers were a handful because they wouldn't buy a sneaker just came to try it on or stand around. Also it caused muscle pulling
good,Very fun environment to work in if you like sneakers. Have the perks to buy the newest released shoe and can try on the different brands of sneakers . Very fast-paced and have to work with more than one customer at a time.
good,"Hard to move up, not many people leave. Environment is good, everyone is friendly. Relaxed dress code. Have a decent sneaker discount. The management to me would need more training on how to be a leader."
good,"Hours weren't stable, during rushes manager always needs you but when you need hours, they are never provided. "
good,this is a good job if you like shoes. pay isn't very good. you do get a discount on certain shoes which is a very nice perk. also you get to see when all the shoes come out.
good,Any body wants to work there can work there. It's mostly for teenagers who just need a job. Not a permanent job unless you are full time or a manager.
good,I worked at Footlocker Inc/Eastbay while going to college. It was the perfect job for my busy schedule with much flexibility for choosing both days and hours that work best for you during the week. Recommend to anyone needing a flexible job.
good,"Depending on the Store you are located determines job experience.  Salary can be based on commission rate or hourly depending how much a person can sell.  Benefits are okay, but short term disabilities are not necessarily provided by the company itself.  Fun environment for young adults."
good,Foot locker doesn't pay well for all the work you do.  You work all day and deal with customer attitude with a weak pay rate. The benefits are okay but foot locker has favoritism among employees
good,"Foot Locker is a good place to work if you're a high spirit and loves to help people but only problem was the management, it was lacking and it wasn't professional sometimes had to do work that was mainly for the higher up. The work culture was fun and good, this jobs gives good people skills."
good,"I enjoy working at Footlocker, it is a positive environment and coworkers are always encouraging eachother to be the best at our job as we can possibly be."
good,"As a young adult this is the perfect job to start off with, you can also grow in this company if you are looking for more stability within the company itself. With hard determination and work ethic, and great leaders you can not only learn a lot from within the company but it will also teach you great social skills and sales skills."
good,Foot locker was a great experience I did a lot of learning there I was taught a lot about handling cash but there was never a time where I could make a lot of money even fighting for sales on the floor it was never enough
good,a typical day at the job includes dealing with customers and providing top customer service. I've learned a lot of selling skills and communication abilities.
good,Great job for a student good management friendly environment it does help a skill in communicating as your always talking to customers. There is also usually always something to do
good,"Foot Locker is a very relaxed work place, its very fast paced because you want to give people there product as quick as possible so they can be in and out but you can work at your own speed. Its a competitive place to work at since its based off commission but you can make it a fun competition as to who can sell the most."
good,Working at footlocker was fun while I was young it was a great job to have with the benefits that came with the job but it couldn't have been a long term thing for me wasn't fulfilling enough.
good,"Foot Locker is a fun place to work at and aside getting great discounts, you build your knowledge on shoes and athletic fashion. However, being the youngest and most inexperienced employee on the floor, I was very vulnerable to being taken advantage of. There was an instant where I had all my shifts taken away from me without my knowledge and around September-October they had me with no shifts for over a month before they ""let me go"". Their excuse was that ""the head office called and said that they had too many people in the system not working, so they had to remove people,"" which was absolute bs. I was not given a fair chance so I will never work there ever again."
good,Need to give better pay. job is fun. had lots of fun. it was a great time. we sold sneakers. we sold clothes. need better commission. not enough for the amount of work.
good,"At Six02 Sawgrass, many days are alike. The location is incognito and not many know of the new culture-based athletic women's store."
good,"good place, can be fun but sometimes unfair especially as a manager, favouritism can sometimes seem to happen. But all in all I have enjoyed working here and I have a huge passion for the job."
good,"Foot Locker Inc is rutted in archaic development practices and doesn't seem to want change. Developer management is very difficult to contact and don't even work out of the Wausau office which is where almost all the developers are. "
good,Footlocker is a fun place to work. It has great diversity and I love its core values. There's always helpful associates to assist u and it's a great place to shop.
good,Moderate workplace depending upon staff/management. Pay should be higher. Good part time job to have. You have to work hard to get hours at this store. They are not just typically given out just like other retailers.
good,the pay isn't the best but it isn't a hard job to get and you'll learn quick and the more you learn the more you'll sell . take commission seriously because your gonna need it in order to have a steady pay check .
good,"Duties include ensure stock is in place for customers to view. "
good,Worked here on and off for 14 years from being a part time associate to a manger in training. There is room for advancement if you choose to.
good,"I learned to be patient, understanding, and good at multi-tasking with customers and their children when it is very busy in the store."
good,Creating a great in-store experience for the customer. Being able to help multiple customer in high traffic environment.
good,providing outstanding customer service to the general public and other sister stores. Also Working the register and making the ends meet at the end of the day statistical reports
good,"A Typical day is making sure all customers are attended to and keeping the store clean. Learned many skills when it comes to talking to customers, handling the store, and handling stock.Management is fine.Co-workers range from hard workers to just trying to get through the day. The hardest part is when it's slow since you sometimes have nothing to do. The most enjoyable would be when it gets busy and when the pressure is on to make day."
good,"A lot of schedule flexibility.  In the corporate setting there are a lot of fringe benefits in the right positions.  Hard work, dedication, and results get noticed but not compensated."
good,"It was a new experience in my life, first job so all i cared about was the money until time went by and I saw that I wasnt getting anywhere."
good,Working here was alright. Not ideal. It was a newer store so sales were slow. I was looking for any job that I could get.  Management was to young and didn't know how to run a store properly.
good,a typical day at footlocker consist of a 8-13 hour shift. as a manager your required to close 3 nights of the week not including sunday and most close on the weekends. The job allows you to meet a lot of different people and cultures and allows room for growth. What I have learned from the company is the importance of family. The workload is not overwhelming but does not allow much time for family nor does the job offer any holidays off.
good,"great people, amazing discounts, great work environment, hardest part of the job is being on your feet for a whole shift..."
good,Good job for high school/college students entering workforce. The time for family is limited with the requirements desired from company.
good,"la parte più piacevole di questo lavoro per me è stato stare a contatto con il pubblico."
good,It is a great place to work for students in college and high school. This job is not a career and you should not get comfortable here.
good,very family oriented company. Great management who are understanding and will to work with you but the pay isn't great whatsoever.
good,"Clocked in focused and ready to sell, aware of quota's that needed to be met and priorities. The most enjoyable part of my job would be knowing i attacked all my tasks at hand as best as i could to give excellent customer service."
good,Working at Lady footlocker has taught me the value of true customer service. The staff at Lady footlocker is amazing. My co-workers and the management makes work an enjoyable experience. For the years I have worked at Lady Footlocker I have enjoyed there. The hardest part of the job is sometimes the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is bringing a smile the consumers face. At my job I have plenty tasks to do at my job so I am never standing around at Lady footlocker.
good,"It was a fun job, but the pay not so great. Co-Workers where fun to work with. The customers were always awesome to me. if the pay was good i would of stayed."
good,"Good place to start a career in an IT field."
good,"Pretty laid back job, they were very informative and constantly teaching employees new things. I had an amazing management team who made the environment and culture even better."
good,At footlocker warehouse Ive learn to move skits around.my Co-worker are all the same age group we work hard to make things flow but the hardest part of the job is when I have to lift boxes.enjoyable part is when am working hard an assisting the customers to my full ability.
good,"Foot Locker, has a great company culture with a strong presence in the Foot wear industry. As the Employee Relations specialist, i counseled store managers, District Managers and employees on existing cases."
good,Good first job to have. You learn about a workplace and pretty good discount on shoes. Thats about it though. They push you to make sales while the managers cheat to meet their numbers while they dont help you at all.
good,Not enough hours. The enjoyable part of the job are the customers. Management can be a little more friendly. My co-workers are fun and easy to get along with.
good,A typical day of work consisted of opening and closing the store. Making sure that every customer that crosses our lease line is taken care of and serviced. While also maintaining inventory processing shipment and doing visuals.
good,"My job responsibilities include making sure customers athletic footwear, apparel, and accessory needs are fulfilled while practicing good customer service.

good,Fun workplace with great supporters. I enjoyed working with the staff. Everyone was great team players. It was an overall good experience
good,"Footlocker is a nice place to work at. My job there was as a cashier i would clock in and start greeting customers, i completed the point of the sale, and then after it was time to close we all had to make the store look nice again."
good,"always somwthing to do. learning the different fashion trends, always smiling with my co workers and the hardest pert would be handling the crazy season changes but it was definitely always worth the end results."
good,Footlocker is a good starting retail job for beginners in sales it would get you started in gaining experience so you will be successful in the future
good,The Most enjoyable part of my job is keeping my customers Satisfied and Happy by giving them what they need and The Good Customer Service they deserve.
good,"You wont be rewarded by the higher ups for any good performance. Commission is small, pressure to sell insoles ruins job morale."
good,"I would come in, clock in, and hit the floor with my colleagues. It was  pretty straight forward. I was a sales rep, so I never dealt with cash. I learned a lot about the different foot attire and how to be a lot more interpersonal. Management was pretty good with making sure everyone was on top. Co workers were funny and personable. The hardest part of the job was suggesting something for someone and them not being satisfied enough, but I soon realized not everyone will take your suggestions and that is quite normal. The most enjoyable part was being able to meet new people."
good,Ten eerste ga ik controleren of de bedragen van de reserves van deze maand correct zijn en moet ik daarvoor contact opnemen met verschillende afdelingen en collega's. Dat vind ik erg leuk. Helaas heeft niet iedereen genoeg tijd gehad om de informatie voor te bereiden. Dat vind ik niet leuk omdat ik mijn werk niet kan afronden. Ik heb dan niet genoeg tijd meer en als oplossing stuur ik per e-mail de bedragen van de vorige maand naar de verantwoordelijke mensen. Ze moeten bevestigen dat de bedragen die ik doorgeef nog steeds correct zijn.
good,"A typical day on the job is pretty fun, dealing with customers from all different backgrounds; some athletes and some casual ball players, others just individuals who love to work out. I've learned that even some customers over the age of 60 still work out and are in really good shape! my coworkers are very energetic and strive to make the customers experience the best. The hardest part of my job would be the yearly ""Black Friday"" its pretty hectic around those times; but its also the most enjoyable part as well. A lot of people are excited and seeing other people's happiness is something that makes me happy."
good,"Never a dull minute which I love. There is always customers, shipment, floor set ups and cleaning to do. It is a great group of people to work with and I learn something new every time I work."

good,"A place i would avoid working at."
good,"bonjour "
good,A typical day working at footlocker was just a daily routine.. I would get there 30 minutes before the store opens. I would count the registers cash and make sure it was the right amount for the day. I would make sure my team would know there sales goals and monitor the sales floor. When things seem to be in control I would check the inventory and make the schedule for my team. My co-workers were great because they always made there sales goal and kept the floor tidy and clean. The hardest part of my job was actually nothing. I'm a very patient person so nothing really bothers me. I love customer service because I feel like I'm a great people person.
good,I learned how to interact on a one on one basis with my customers. A typical work day was fun and energetic and always keep me on my feet and busy making sure every customer was helped.

good,A typical day it is usually busy. I Learned a lot about how to sell. My co workers are friendly we all look out for each other. The hardest part is the location. The enjoyable part is helping the people be satisfied with their purchase.
good,I would say I was learning on the job. I also found that there was a all out fight for sales and that is a good thing and bad thing. I say it was not my thing cause I liked hourly pay not conp.
good,exciting and fun tough me  about retail and more...and it was kinda boring
good,"You can learn a lot from working at Footlocker. Their training program clearly breaks down how to manage a store, and you can use that in many other jobs."

good,"A typical day usually involved cleaning the store, folding the clothes, and conducting sales to customers."
good,The reason I was intrigued with the opening of the job was the love of sneakers that I have had for the longest. Once I was hired i immediately started to pay attention to the compensation and how it was not worth the work that I put in day in and day out. 
good,This is a job where you can meet great co-workers and learn some important info on shoe wear.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of a lot of organizing, folding, stocking inventory, greeting customers, satisfying all of the customers needs, labeling new price tags, and cleaning our areas.

good,Lady footlocker learned me a little about sales and gave me the chance to help customers pick out the type of shoes that would be more suited for her or for a gift.
good,I made several life long friends at this job. Retail is not enjoyable unless you have a passion for the product and I certainly did.
good,"helping customers find the right sneaker, along with stocking"
good,"Footlocker is an excellent place to work. It is a great place to gain customer service and management experience. While employed at Footlocker one has the opportunity to interact with different people on an everyday basis. No two days are ever alike. It can be a fun and fast paced environment or a slower day paying attention to particulars. Regardless of the type of day, it is an enjoyable experience and one that will help you to gain much needed experience in the work field."
good,"A typical day at footlocker would be, clock-in, review the goals for the day & start assisting customers. While working at footlocker i learned how to better understand customer service and how to work with a team to meet a certain standard. Managers at footlocker are great, they're helpful and fun to be around, like friends, they dont seem like managers at all. My co-workers are fun and friendly to other co-workers and customers. The hardest part of the job for me, is selling in-soles. i havent mastered that yet but im working on it. The most enjoyable part would be just being there, feeling at home and having fun."
good,As an assistant manger my duties were to train new employees on the cash register. They were also trained on how to put up shipment and how to assist customers with their purchases. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers.
good,"At FootLocker I was a Sales Associate selling multiple products, keeping the store pristine and setting up new marketing displays. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fact that I love shoes and could share my passion with others."
good,Day at work : selling sports goods
good,"The job is very fun. They have secret santas every year. They have great discounts for employees. However, there is always someone that you're working with that is hard to get along with. You have to be strong-minded."
good,"In Relation zum Erfogn des Unternehmens sind bessere Gehälter wünschenswert, sowie flacherer Hirachien."
good,"good place to work if you like sales, fun environment, unprofessional, good if you're a student, like in high school, but if you have an education, don't work here."
good,A good workplace and can be very rewarding as earnings are commision based so during the busier periods good money can be made. Also constantly being in cotanct with customers especiaaly a variety as the shop is based in the city centre which is surrounded by many universities enables you to develop a diverse aaproach to cater to all.
good,"I would greet customers and provide assistance with shoe selections and other merchandise. I also attended to multiple customers by grabbing shoe sizes from the stockroom. In addition, I operated the cash register and handled money when checking out customers. It was my duty to maintain a clean store by folding clothes, restocking merchandise, sweeping the floors, and returning unwanted shoes back to the stockroom. My manager stressed the importance of informing customers of new products and answering questions related to shoes and clothing sold at Foot Locker."
good,"ambiente flessibile e stimolante, molto accoglienti"
good,"Fast paced working environment "
good,Footlocker was a fun place to work as I was going through college my work place was fun. I learned many new things working in a retail space that I had not previously working other jobs
good,"It was great working for the company, working part-time was a great and getting discounts on sneakers was also pretty great. Overall it was a great job if you are into sneakers."
good,Have to be Mentally plugged in at all times. No work to life balance. Fast paced company that is forever changinf. Dedication is key. Company has good benefits
good,"Must have a flexible work schedule and possess excellent customer service skills; Productive Place to Work, sales driven.  Should exceed expectations in management."
good,The job was very good you just have to make sure that you stay focused. Make sure that you come to work when you are suppose to and try not to abuse the system.
good,"i no longer work here for a reason why is it that i have to write a review about a company that i no longer work for, you want feedback its called personal experience, this is not high school there should be no  minimums"
good,It was important to managers that employees were always on task of some sort. Time is almost never wasted and there is always a reason to be busy during work on the clock
good,Good place to work room for growth advancement with company if your interested in moving up  good experience to connect with customers and build long lasting relationships
good,"Was very good company starting out in first 5 years, kept things with tradition , American tradition until too many changes took place and no longer was about hard work but who you knew in business in order to progress. "
good,Buena experiencia por el tiempo que estuve contento con la l equipo
good,nothing much just get shoes for people and manage stock which made it really simple and easy to deal with when problems came up . the stock was the most important job because at xmas time there was alot of online orders into our store .
good,"Bon environnement."
good,"Overall, i feel as footlocker was a decent job. The only complaint i could have was the pay biweekly. I would stay if the pay was more an hour but sadly it is not enough for me to live of of and pay for things i need."
good,cool cool cool . if you like cool shoes work here . you get a discount on shoes. thats a plus . cool environment . you develop a family working at this place
good,"The job was in the mall, so it consisted of interacting with customers and doing a lot of 1 on 1 sales. Full time positions were based on salary plus commission off sales made by each individual"
good,"Recommend appropriate items for customers, to achieve ultimate customer satisfaction."
good,Decent first job to get experience. The pay was minimum wage. District manager was really good. Very a typical first part time job. But who knows what's changed since.
good,I still work here just looking for something new and where I can work more. I recommend this job for anyone interested in working retail cause it can boost your character
good,"Footlocker was a great space with great people, despite the competitive nature employees were always friendly. since I left they have made a lot of changes that would have swayed my response but in my time there all was well"
good,Great Job but for me it was just to time consuming i lived in the mall it seem like and you really dont have alot of free/me time cause you work almost every weekend and holidays
good,Working in footlocker is not that difficult in all honesty the experience is amazing but after a while it’s tiring. Management and District Managers are to political. Its more about who you know rather than what you do.
good,"colleghi super gentili e professionali "
good,Standing around trying to get customers when most window shop. paid by commission so people will try to get customers before you. most enjoyable part is going home.
good,It’s an ok company for part timers but as far as management you don’t get paid enough for the amount of work you have to do at all and the DMs act like everything is the store managers fault when they do nothing to help.the healthcare is terrible for a ridiculous price as well
good,Most days are fast paced and stressful. Upper management is inconsiderate of employee lives thoughts and opinions. The pay makes it hard to work there.
good,its  great job for a high schooler that's just beginning to earn money besides that  nothing really special about it. they overwork you for no reason.
good,"Typical day as ASM consisted of sales, training employees, stocking merchandise, auditing, interviewing, making sure all policies are in place, deterring theft etc."
good,I enjoyed the environment a d the employees. The job was repeative however the pay and overall requirements for the job iare relatively easy. I enjoyed working for this employer
good,Working at lady’s foot locker was not a good experience for me. I would only get 1 day outta the whole week or wouldn’t even get a spot. Also my checks every other week would be the most is $50-$60
good,Some of the managers didnt know what they were doing nor knew what they were talking about. The managers were rude and also very impatient and didnt hide their disgust very well
good,"This job is only really for a teen unless you try to apply for a management position.Pay checks go down every week.Managment changes hours sometimes,with not enough head notice.I would only suggest this job if you want the discount and don’t really care about pay."
good,When I First Started Footlocker I Felt As If I Wasn't Getting Enough Hours As The Rest Of The Employees And I Was Constantly Sent Home For Small Reasons. I Didnt Recieve The Experience I Would Have Liked To Get From Footlocker Neither Did I Work There For To Long So My Experience With Footlocker Was Okay But It Could've Been Better.
good,A typical day at footlocker is running up and down the stairs more than 40 times a day to get people sneakers. there are few employees and the place is usually packed.
good,"typical sales associate job, noting out of the ordinary. nice environment , all you have to do is help customers and try to make a sales and that about it."
good,Fun place to work however the management was awful.
good,Good company with a lot of benefits. Casual environment with a lot of flexibility and freedoms. Lots of good people to work with. Fast-paced and ever changing place to work.
good,"My experience at Foot Locker was average. The workplace culture was very relaxed and laid back, however it could get competitive with attending to customers. Similar to most stores, weekdays were not as busy, however weekends could get very busy."
good,The Finance center has great people.  Found Managements goals hard to understand.  Gained much need audit experience with Fixed Assets.  At the time I was employed CFO could be very demeaning of its managers in a public forum.
good,Better than dominos. Meet new people everyday and was able to have fun doing so. I love sneakers so being around them and being able to sell them was an opportunity.
good,"I expected to have fun and make money while doing it. I barely received hours and when i did, it was during non-peak hours so my commission was very low."
good,"When I applied to Footlocker, I was not aware that it's like 90% sales. I did't reach my sales goals much because most of the time, I was scheduled during the day and no one came in for sneakers during that time."
good,"Foot Locker can be a great place to work but location and store volume is key. If you work in a low volume store as a manager, part time associates in high volume stores will make more money."
good,I had made great friendships while working at footlocker. But the most upsetting thing about the store I worked at was that they hired everyone as part time employees so they stayed away from having to pay commission.
good,"I'm still working in this place, it's a completely funny workplace if you love talking with customers. You can learn a lot about sneakers and any product they have also you can improve your sales skills every day. I have a lot of fun going to work in this place also if i'm tired from the previous day but the salary is not so rewarding"
good,My review of Foot Locker is a very good first job because you are quick to develop simple skills you will use throughout your whole life. Knowing how to work with and communicate with people is one of the bigger ones you are faced with and have to learn fast.
good,"Really short hours, 2,3 days a week with only about 3-5 hours per shift. Manager was not the best. The goals and objectives always had you on your tip toes which was good."
good,its cool but only for an entry job. they tried to overwork you more than the manager. honestly anyone can be a manager how is a cellphone employee who knows nothing about shoes all of a sudden my store manager the next day? who knows but it happened.
good,"I would come in to greet everyone or they’d greet me. I’d clock in and then start my day. I enjoy speaking to my customers and building relationships and bonds. I learned how to accommodate the work place for all different types of people by showing them sneakers and apparel that suits them. The culture was moderate I felt like we could have been more of a team and family, but we were more just like a team. The hardest part of the job was since we closed at 7:00 breaks usually weren’t something people wanted to take so we would sometimes be hungry all day. Also, the compensation I never was happy about, but I stayed for a year and a half because I just lived the job."
good,"Press the ""Next Customer"" button to fetch a customer from the queue. Use the ""Conference Agent"" button to invite an agent into an existing session or start a new session. To toggle between sessions, click on the corresponding row in the ""Current Sessions"" panel."
good,Everyday you are interacting with all kinds of people. It is a laid back environment. You sometimes make peoples days by just doing your job which is so rewarding.
good,"day to day sales business as usual. other than learning of different foot types & analytics. helping kids find the shoes they like, and making sure they get a good fit for their foot was the best part of the job for me."
good,Amazing and fun time working in the Sport Industry. I love sports so for me was an incredible opportunity to start my work experience. I learned how impact the life of others in a positive manner helping them in their lives to be better.
good,"Good environment, bad management. Sales goals are only for the lower level employees, while only management gets the perks of meeting the goals. No bonuses and very strict on discount use."
good,j'ai travaillé dans un cadre de travaille agréable
good,Had a fun time. Besides being a 2IC theres know where up from there. Very pushing on customers which is something i don't agree on. But still a very fun environment
good,"I enjoyed my time at Foot Locker but they kind of just throw you in the mix and expect you to be as good and as fast as them when you are still learning where everything is in the back. I understand that yes you need to be fast when it comes to getting shoes or at least in a timely manor so the customer is not waiting all day to try on a shoe. I just felt some days were very disorganized, and I did not truly feel like I was a part of the team. They definitely pick favorites."
good,Great job for someone who loves shoes and loves talking about shoes. It helps to be knowledgeable in the basketball realm and understanding all different types of shoes.
good,A typical day at work is extremely fast paced. The job's culture is very diverse. There are hundreds of people you get to see everyday. The company just wants the customers to know they are welcomed.
good,Foot Locker is well tuned in what the consumer is looking for. It just never allowed management to have much quality of life at the time i was employed there.
good,Travailler en temps que vendeuse à Foot Locker est assez fatiguant mais très stimulant.
good,"environnement stressant, toujours plus de chiffre."
good,"Easy job, can get boring when foot traffic is light.  Hardest part of the job as a manager is keeping staff.  Must be able to upsell.  Pay is low, but understandable due to low sales volume in many locations."
good,"Footlocker is a good place to work at competitive work culture as a member of management I learned how to drive sales at a high level as well as recruit hire / train / develop & promote , control inventory & maintain shrink . The hardest part of the job is pretty much the hours you have to work ."
good,"a solid company, good diversity of retail options, on line integration is solid, growth opportunity for those that desire it, relocation assistance is strong."
good,"Working here was definitely an interesting job due to the location I was at. There was also an opportunity to make good money, the issue was that due to the competitiveness to sell shoes to customers it started a lot of unnecessary drama between employees."
good,"Reception de la livraison 8h"
good,Only worked in this postion for a short amount of time until I left for boot camp. it was an easy job and great if you enjoy the art of sales and commication
good,"If the store is busy the day goes by really fast and the environment is fun and all about the customers; however, on a slow day the day is just what it is slow and you have to find things to do to keep busy. The hardest part about working for this company is working for selfish individuals in management who do not put their employees first. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing those people that I have gained relationships with over the time span of working and helping them with their needs. Another enjoyable part of the job is being able to assist people and talk with people to see what they are shopping for."
good,Typical commission retail job. You ring up your own sales unless the cashier is there. Just be sure to watch out for your customers in case anybody tries to hustle you.
good,"Working at foot locker wasn’t bad you get to learn something new everyday, meet new people from different countries, different languages and also learn about different kinds of sneakers"
good,the reason i left was the mall hours. The holidays at the mall were the worst. There were times where i worked 12 hour shifts. its a cutthroat envirinment when employes survive on commisions
good,bel posto di lavoro ma entrando nel periodo di natale molto molto incasinato
good,"Great place to work, they kept you busy which I love! I was a contract worker for the company. They wanted to offer me a full time position however I ended up accepting something full time else where."
good,A typical day at work was checking if there was any new stock in. Checking out our inventory seeing if we were running out of anything. Talking to customers helping them find their sizes and shoes.
good,I worked at Footlocker through an agency. I was treated like a contract employee and as a regular fulltime employee. I was given a lot of work for little amount of hours to get it all done.
good,This would be a job for someone who loves tennis shoes and would just have this as a side job not their main. You are basically paid off of commission and that is hard when the city it's in is not a big tennis shoe fanatic.
good,"Its a chill company to work for, but its shouldn't be more than a side job. It's really only a job where the discount is nice. It's 30% but there's times when your discount jumps to 50% which is great."
good,working for footlocker Inc is really stressful in the manager position.  No work life balance anf you have to be on call even on your days off. But the discount is great.
good,I was working there for about 3 months then the manager got fired an after that I wasn't on the schedule any more. And I barely worked over 2 days a week my checks never broke $100
good,"Great experience with the ability to equip speaking skills, social skills, and develop manager skills. Its good for those who are in college and a decent secondary job."
good,"Provvigione sulle vendite."
good,"It is a great place to gain customer experience, but the commission is low for part time employees. So you will have to get to as many people and sell as much as possible to get paid a nice check."
good,Working at foot locker was  a great experience. Just wish they valued  promoting from with-in. Discounts were pretty decent for newer sneakers and everyday wear.
good,"Scan, organize then loaded merchandise onto delivery trucks. Scanning done with an arm telzon. Worked the Scan Tunnel where all merchandise must pass through before being sent to its department. Shoes and Apparel Tilt Trays. Duties performed for tilt tray department include picking merchandise, packing and bulk packing.Performed duties in the PFR department for both Shipping and Receiving."
good,"Footlocker was a good experience in teaching you how to address people and talk to them ,convince people into buying things and allows some freedom in the work space"
good,"Fun environment, discount on shoes"
good,The company at the time I worked there were ok and needed to upgrade in many areas. By now i hope they have. Other than that they were ok. I enjoyed my years there
good,I was only 16 when I was working here. I only worked like 20 hrs per week. Which it wasn't a lot of hours but it did distract me from school. I had to quit to focus on school.
good,Foot Locker used to be my go to place for the latest sneakers.  Now that I have the pleasure of working here as a manager I value it even more.  They take pride in their company and value their employees.
good,Company has a decent reputation for employees. Compensation comparable to other shoe retailers.  Work environment is fair and team management is usually qualified to do the job.
good,l'attenione dedicata al cliente e' troppo incentrata sulla vendita
good,The hours are what made this job unbearable. For 2-3 weeks you would be working 12 hour shifts 6-7 days a week to barely making 25 hours the rest of the month. That compared with some supervisors not even knowing the position in which they are in charge of made working there that much more frustrating. Various schedule times to be able to work around your specific times needed.
good,Footlocker is a phenomenal company to have as a high school student but is unable to to supply enough shifts for post secondary. I wish i was able to work there more but they are unable to give that to me.
good,The job is constantly changing and you need to adapt to the each and every challenge that is thrown at you. Interesting day to day roles including management and sales roles are desirable.
good,everybody seemed to have there own agenda not much training. for me the i had to learn by experience that was often challenging for me but I'm a quick learner and got the hang of things quicker than most
good,You honestly get played when you work there. Management tries to pull one over on you all the time. You can’t let them run over you. If they offer you a higher position you better hound them until they fully give it to you
good,"This was a fun place to work at that time in my life. I certainly wouldn't consider it now that I'm married and have children. Hours were very long, open - close, holidays, weekends and I was transferred several times throughout my career. This was not an option."
good,"Company afforded me many opportunities to grow and advance my career. In the end, the long hours and countless holidays spent working caught up to me."
good,"•	Facilitate scrum ceremonies (grooming, sprint planning, retrospectives, daily stand-ups, etc.)"
good,I loved my coworkers and the environment at work. The only thing was that management was always changing and was not stable and consistent. This created an unsettling atmosphere from time to time.
good,"this was a job that I had when I came home from college, I needed a summer job and I was in love with shoes so it was a perfect fit for a college summer job."
good,"Bon esprit d’équipe "
good,"Overall good company to work for. But as you grow you need new challenges. Good work study balance, good hours. The discounts you get as employee is also a plus."
good,Not too many hours are given to work. Notices when employees are on task and when not on task. Not hard to get promoted. Friendly work environment and not too busy depending on location.
good,"I loved working at Footlocker, I had great co workers. They showed kindness when I first arrived, they did teach me skills that I can use in any other work place. Unfortunately they pay by commission."
good,"My footlocker experience has been nothing like what it's been out to be. I barely work. I get 1 day a week, sometimes 2. People steal my sales. People are disrespectful (the staff)."
good,Good environment. we had lots of fun before the recession. after the recession lots of things change. work hours were 50% longer and had to lay off good employees
good,Overall Footlocker is a great place to work for students. It teaches you how to balance school and work effectively. My store was very flexible with schedules and that was a plus for me.
good,Working at footlocker was very interesting for me personally. It is a very quick pasted job ( depending on your stores location ). Get paid on commission so it can be competitive at times.
good,"Job requires a lot of patience to deal with customers, we are often times understaffed because of the small budget for hours. If you love sneakers you would love the job."
good,It was cool to work at Footlocker because you get discounted prices on shoes for you and your family. However I hated working all of the major holidays. And the district manager was not a nice guy.
good,"the job overall was very easy to handle however beware of managers who love to gossip. Aside from that, the coworkers are pretty easy to get along with and the shoe selling is a blast"
good,If you like shoes you will like the job other than that it depends on your location. Some locations offer more sales opportunites hence more money than others.
good,Good first job that taught me a lot of responsibility and got me prepared for bigger jobs in the future. All in all I recommend working there for a first job but nothing more than that. You get paid minimum wage.
good,"great place to work , great and friendly staff, was there for a short period of time but it was worth it. i highly recommend it was a good opportunity"
good,Es una buena empresa para iniciarte en el mundo de la venta. Es exigente pero gratificante.
good,"Worked like a dog and poor management. Only time people cared about you is if your store was not meeting their sales goals. Expected to do the most as a manager, but wasn't willing to pay more than minimum wage"
good,mi sono trovato molto bene con tutti i team menager
good,"You barely receive hours. In a span of 2 weeks, you'll probably only work 1 day. That sucks because fewer hours means less money. Barely anything to pay your bills."
good,Nice place to work and nice people. It is fast paced but i is pretty east to catch on. Its a good first job for young people just starting out. Nice place
good,It was nothing special but wouldnt work there again. happy with the people who i had met over the time but the salary and benefits werent the greatest compare to other companies i have worked with.
good,"The work place was easy going with my employees while maintaining a high level of accuracy and shipments timely distribution.  My only issue was with upper management was with them setting impossible goals with no regard or reward to my employees.  They never took the time to let me explain where we were with shipments and what was obtainable to still keep in step with company policies.  "
good,"Footlocker is a great starting job, especially as a part-time employee. The culture you're exposed to is very interesting and allows you to meet a variety of people as you work, but over time it tends to become repetitive and not as interesting as it used to be, over the course of a couple of years. The most enjoyable part of the job is making a customer's day, or setting them on the right path for the shoe they're looking for. There is also no real hard part of this job, as it is just a group of somewhat simple tasks."
good,"this is a good job if you are entry level and never had a job before, but unless you are trying to advance in the job i suggest not staying there too long."
good,Able to work at your own pace and move around the store freely. When it got busy my co works were able to help me as much as they could when the could.
good,my old manage was okay the manager now its good I think I'm good at my job so theres no need for me to like my manager I do my job well I don't get in any trouble so if you like that you should work at foot locker
good,"I enjoyed working here in highschool, but once I started living on my own it did not pay enough and also you never knew how much money you could really make since it was based off commission."
good,Managing retail is not the ideal job.  I like we weekends off to be with family and friends. it was a great place to work for a while.  everyone was nice and got along.  you know what your sales goal for the day was with help from upper management.
good,het sorteren van schoenen of schoenen zoeken voor de klant
good,"A typical day consisted of helping customers find a shoe style that they liked. You would have to size their foot, find a shoe, try to sell any shoe cleaners with the purchase and possibly any clothing"
good,I do not this this should be a requirement and would rather not participate. My time at Foot Locker was fine. There were pros and cons to the job. I liked the employees and didnt like the hours.
good,"Compensation is lacking with this company, but it is easy to work for the most part and always fun. If you enjoy people and hustling for your money you will enjoy working for this company. Good college/high school job"
good,"Many associates."
good,"Compensation is lacking with this company, but it is easy work for the most part and always fun. If you enjoy people and hustling for your money you will enjoy working for this company. Good college/high school job"
good,This job was very fast paced and extremely competitive. You were competing with the other associates to get the sales to increase your commission. I would recommend this job to anyone who can handle stress and not have a problem with talking to customers.
good,"requires more than you think. Floor changes, stocking back rooms, audits, long hours, working holidays, discount limit, cashier, traveling, competitive"
good,"Foot Locker was good to me for many years, however, your salary depends on the location you're  managing. You could be a store manager for 10+ years and make less money than a first time manager based on location and sales."
good,This job really helped me build my skills for my future job. I honestly would not recommend this company if you’re just looking to switch jobs. Hours were ridiculously high and the pay was unfair for the amount of work that i did.
good,Travaille d'équipe ! tout en gardant l'esprit compétitif !
good,travail plus tôt agréable dans l'ensemble c'est parfois difficile de rester debout toute la journée
good,this a good job for sneaker-heads or high schoolers but i wouldn't recommend it to people who tryna support a family unless you higher management. easily one f my favorite places
good,I loved sneakers growing up so working in a shoe store was like a kid that had recently graduated high school dream. Basic stocking and tagging with majority customer interaction
good,"Growth opportunity, great leadership, great management, workplace culture is amazing. the most enjoyable party of the job is identifing needs. you learned things on a daily basis"
good,Easy job. Good pay as a manager. Good first job. Working here showed me another part of customer service. Sometimes you have to learn your customer or ask the right kind of questions in this retail field.
good,"Everything is perfect, but the pay. The job is very quick we must connect with every customer and suggest additional merchandise.  On the holidays it gets really busy and if you are a part timer you get a lot in hours and commission."
good,A day in work is making sure everything its put where its at and dealing with attitudes. Making sure situations dont blow up and customers are happy. Also customers get what they want and get satisfied.
good,"Undercompensated for years of long hours. Once I reached my ultimate goal of district manager, the regional manager was arrogant and not helpful with my development."
good,"As a part time associate, you get up to 20 hours a week if you get any hours at all. Every week they cut hours and your pay checks are never consistent, because everything is based off of commission. Therefore, if you work on a slow night you won't make any money."
good,"good company to work for but ive outgrown my skills to be their,the atmosphere has switch since they have decide to  join champs sports and footaction district managers has one. its just not working well."
good,Love hate relationship I like the environment sometimes the. It eats me alive to just stand there in the store all day . I do enjoy working with and making new friends
good,Must be comfortable standing on your feet all day .Must be able to be personable with all types of customers. You want make a lot of money but it's good for first time workers.
good,Putting up stock is probably the hardest part of the job but if you get good at it the rest of the job comes easy. Its good that you get to meet different people every day
good,"My peers were outstanding.  Very collaborative, supportive and understanding.  We were always there for each other even if we drove each other up the wall from time to time. I would bend over backwards for my peers, my teams and at one time, the company."
good,A regular day just consists of engaging with customers and making sure that the store is well presented. The job is not hard at all.  A person will enjoy working there because it is relaxing but engaging
good,I really enjoyed working for Foot Locker but the commute and hours interfered with my college schedule. But I would refer someone else to work for the company
good,Fun filled busy days.  A lot of day by learning as well as structured training sessions.  The hardest part is adapting to the environment if you weren't brought up within the culture.  The staff make the place enjoyable and worth every minute of the stress.
good,It was a nice environment. Work days just depended on how many people would come into the store and we were paid 1% commission on every sale and also paid $9.50 an hour.
good,it was a fun place worked with younger people even though i worked more in the stock room. other than that everything else was fine with me so i just kept myself busy in the back
good,"They only used me for a sessonal worker , after the all-star weekend it was like they had no use for me anymore. So my hours was cut short therefore my checks wasnt enough"
good,"This was my first job ever so I wasn't expecting much but I did have issues agreeing with how things were ran, how the manager talked to staff, how people were looking to get other people fired. Other then all that the job was fine."
good,Have a great attitude. Great company to work for. You can advance quickly in the company. As long as you do your job and be on time. Great discount policy.
good,It was okay for the small time that I was apart of that team. Very interactive with the customers and the environment and the people were very friendly.
good,Footlocker is a cool job to have while in school or like a first job but if you're not a manager the pay sucks unless you work a ton of hours and sell a boat load of shoes. There are a lot of long unnecessary night when closing but the discount is cool and the job is not hard at all.
good,"Not a decent job to have. "
good,"Footlocker at times can be a very fun place to work at, but the hourly pay is unacceptable for the amount of work required to do.  Also the lack of career advancement is horrible."
good,Footlocker was my first job and I feel like it was a great place to start off at and gain experience from. It introduced me to customer service which helped a lot when transferring to visible changes.
good,"This was my job during high school, were my hours were just volunteer hours. I found it to be a nice environment to be in and found the staff to be friendly"
good,"The pay sucks if you don't get good hours or aren't paid commission based. You must be really fast and learn quickly, management can be pretty shady towards you if you're new"
good,Fast paced. You worked of commission if you were a sales person. You had to be on your toes at all given times if you wanted to make your goals. I was in a management role which still meant selling while managing the store and it's worker
good,"Footlocker is a retail store that is faced paced, and provided opportunities for improving customer relation skills.  The workplace was friendly and encouraged the employees to succeed."
good,I learned customer service skills and how to handle a register. The culture was diverse and the environment was inviting. Management was flexible with employees.
good,I enjoyed the discounts and the team members. We all did work together and look after one another. I was a fun environment and close to home so I didn't travel far.
good,Its ok depending on which location you work at. If your store is busy you get good commission.I personally think its a good place to start off as a sells associate.
good,"its fast paste footlocker focused on just gaining money like any other company, I learned a lot from the company, from being organized to opening the store by myself  and doing a lot of paper work, the hardest part of the job is the managers giving putting a lot of stress on you, and working long hour shifts to not get paid enough. I enjoyed working because everyone they hire is friendly and nice and easy to get along with."
good,"Working @ kids footlocker isn't fun , it's slow paced depending which store you work @ . The pay is 7.25 an hour and barely even 20 hours a week so that sucks especially after they take out taxes !!"
good,"great worth ethic, enjoyed my time at the company, as it was a great start to my career and learnt a lot of things along the way."
good,"A typical day at work requires me to constantly engage with customers. Part of working in the retail industry that i really like is the constant engagement with consumers. However, i do think that work can be quite tiring and that more breaks should be given to employees especially on a busy day as rejuvenated employees would be able to better serve customers."
good,Nice place to start out and get work experience.  Opportunity to grow and progress into a manager and beyond.  Fun team based environment with a focus on customer service.
good,Working at footlocker consists mainly of conversing with customers and running to and from the stockroom with shoes. It can be very fast paced and requires long periods of standing. The hardest part is learning where everything is in the stock room and selling additional products.
good,what else can i say. its the same answer as what i wrote for bob's store. same environment and same low paid. no growth opportunity until you are there for years. great job for beginners.
good,I worked there a long time ago and the company doesn't exist anymore so nothing I said matters. It used to be a very fun place to work when I started out.
good,"This is a great place to start off for your first job. They work with your school schedule, they give you fair amount of hours depending on how hard you work."
good,"I would not recommend working here to anyone the managers and assistant managers are lousy at what they do. They push you to the limit that they miss treat you as a person, they are very mean to employees."
good,great guest at door. ask if they need help finding shoes they need. show them whats on sale or clearance. stock shoes and clothes. have knowledge on shoes
good,Good customer service experience learned a lot working there handled all types of customer angry happy and confused my reason of leaving is I felt like I should have been making more for the work that I put in over 4 years of being with the company
good,The overall experience was good and i learned a lot through the time i worked for them. The location was nice and accessible and the team was very supportive.
good,I feel like footlocker is making a lot of money for them to be not paying their part-time and full-time employees a good hourly pay. especially with everything that comes to working retail especially if its a shoe store.
good,i learned sales. depending on the day the days can go slow or quick. most of the times its fun. The hardest part of the job is standing for long periods of time but after a while you get use to it depending on fotwear.
good,"Fairley easy job, if you like a competitive work place then you would love footlocker. pay definitely could be better but the commission can make up for the pay flaws."
good,fast paced environment where you are required to educate customers about their choices based on the shoes they want to buy and also upselling things to compliment their purchase.
good,i choose to keep my comments to myself. i do my job and go home to my kids. footlocker is a place of business for high school students. they do not pay enough for a single parent house
good,"A typical day at work would be getting to work and starting immediately , talking to customers and helping them with what they need. Including being a cashier where i would have to handle money."
good,The manager and employees are family oriented and fun to work with. You will need to get another part time job to make more money. Always make sure you sale at least two merchandise in the store per customer.
good,"Very busy work environment, can keep up to date with latest trainer  trends and fashion.  Many perks of discounts and working in other stores as well as your own store."
good,Une expérience plus que décevante l'organisation n'était pas trés bon puis la méthode de vente ne me convenait pas elle revenait à quasiment forcé le client à acheter.
good,"i loved working at footlocker it was great! love helping people pick out shoes, im a shoe person myself, which is a plus working there. i would work afternoon shift which was also just laid back to."
good,Footlocker was a fun company to work for also and exciting one. working at footlocker you no when all the shoes is going to come out weeks sometimes even months before they come out in stores.
good,It's was real fun and helpful and people was willing to help me with my job work and the manager was caring and understanding. And they was very welcoming
good,Working at footlocker I learned about. You have to be nice to all the customers and you have to show them a extra merchandise. What i did not like was the hours.
good,Worked here for multiple years. Never got offered a raise of promotion. Was in the top 5 for shoe care in the region which for this company is a big deal. Made my thoughts known in a professional manner to receive extreme decline in hours
good,Footlocker is a result driven industry. District is only concerned with the bottom dollar. Shrinkage is a problem and you're held personally responsible
good,I Meet a lot of people while having fun at the job and the discounts are cool also it's like they give me the tools and I go bring it to life to people.
good,On a typical workday we would come into work set a goal of how much product each person on schedule needs to sell and go out and try to not only meet that goal but surpass it.
good,There are no rewards or benefits for sales associates for meeting sales goals. Only managers are rewarded when the associates are the ones making sales. The scheduling was made terribly. We typically did not take breaks because there would not be enough coverage on the floor.
good,"This job is great if you love shoes, if you are looking for advancement there is no further compensations or incinitives to come along with it. I became assistant manager after my first month of employment and have never had a pay raise since. The company can be friendly but also plays favorites."
good,Working in the mall has its pros and cons. holidays are the best to work due to getting paid via commission. Hardest part of the job is dealing with unpleasant customers.
good,Not a good company to work for. I work a full 7 days of doubles with no breaks or coverage.and when I complained about it I was told that that was I signed up for
good,"Lots of moving parts in IT. FTL is a global company. Lots of opportunity to interface with associates around the world. Multi platform environment MVS, AS400, Intel, and UNIX."
good,"The environment at footlocker is vey nice. The employees there are very passionate about work. There's really no hard part of the job. The ,most fun is selling sneakers and getting ""hookups"" with it."
good,"The job was quite interesting the first couple of weeks, but after working there for about a month it started to become a little boring. Being that the store was on a public highway you would think it would be a main attraction. The store did have some customers, but a lot of the items that the customers were looking for were specifics, and our store did not have most specifics. The store did make a lot of sales, and we did reach the goal, but there was a lot of time that was free."
good,"If you love sneaker this is the job for you, discount is very good and u can meet a lot of knew people. also u can move up in the company very fast.  if you a sneaker head this is your job."
good,"I was a sales associate so customer service and social skills are a must. I would make sure that the customer would be able to find what they were looking for or else find something similar to it. You must make sure that the customers are greeted and has a great experience while shopping at footlocker! I have learned and improved my patience while working here. The workplace culture is like a home to me. The hardest part of the job was working with co-workers who are younger because they are immature sometimes. As well as trying to work with co-workers with very bold personalities. Overall, footlocker was an amazing experience for me and I have met certain people that I can call family."
good,"Footlocker is a fun and exciting work environment. You get access to all of the hottest trends in footwear as well as a pretty sweet employee discount. Plus, most of the time you are located in a mall which means you have a lot of sweet food options come lunch time."
good,Required to work 45 hrs a week and no overtime.  During busy seasons required to work 6day work weeks without overtime.  Had a lot of staff turnover. Wasn't allowed vacations when requested
good,I would recommend people to work there. It's a great place and staff is very friendly and helpful. They very professional and teach staff everything they need to know.
good,Footlocker is a good job for someone that is in school and short on time. it helps the employer sharpen their sense of entrepreneurship by selling merchandise .
good,"it was an alright job. i was only with this job for a short period of time. i wasn't able to fully get the experience considering it was only temporary, but also i wasn't told it was temporary."
good,I enjoyed working with this company and all the employees. This company was a good company for a young person at the time. I learned a lot working with them from customer service to training emplotyees.
good,"Though the atmosphere is fun and competitive, there a very few opportunities to progress in the company. Employee benefits are also sorely lacking, with the company putting big emphasis on the employee discounts offered."
good,"Footlocker was a fun job until I decided to go back to school. Once I made that decision my manager cut all my hours and refused to answer any of my calls or messages. He basically avoided me until the system took my name off of the rotation. They don't pay well and expect you to break your back to make ungrateful, rude and disrespectful people happy."
good,"Greet customers, and achieve sales goals. In order to achieve your sales goals, we follow the strategy given to us by footlocker, which is get to every customer, have them try it on, suggest additional merchandise. The culture was fun, many people have the same things in common as you, hardest part of the job might be dealing with an overwhelming amount of customers.  I enjoyed have conversations with a variety of customers and being able to help them with whatever it is they needed."
good,the most enjoyable part of the job is being around something I love sneakers. Giving customers exceptional customer service getting them the hottest gear in the market
good,Ik heb bij de foot locker geleerd wat het is om zwaar werk te doen
good,Touch and go company. Some weeks you'll work 40-50 hours. Other weeks you'll work 20 hours. Dirty work environment as well. Not the most stable job as an associate.
good,I enjoyed my job. It was the first job I ever got. Staff was great. Hours were great. Pay was ok. I had no issues. Upset the store flopped and went out of business and turned into a family dollar.
good,J'ai eu une bonne expérience entant qu'étudiant. Mais le travail chez footlocker ne te permet pas de voir plus loin et les perspectives d'emploi sont quasi-nulles.
good,loved the management and the co-workers was really fun to socialize with customers and help find the right product for them! the job overall was a healthy work atmosphere.
good,Company is in a technology / architectural transition/transformation. Basic technology for collaboration and to connect teams across the globe is lacking.
good,"I would definitely say that everything I learned here, I learned on my own! the turn over rate is ridiculous so when it was time for me to train, there was no trainer. I picked up skills quickly and enjoyed running my own store. Things just get hectic when you don't have help from other managers."
good,bemole contrat temps plein chouette ambiance challenge competition
good,"This job is a good job for people just graduating high school or people still in high school, especially people who are into sneakers. It's a good environment"
good,"FootLocker has a fun environment and is a family oriented company. I am very appreciative of the kind people within the company that have grown to become my friends. "
good,"Workplace culture is commission based."
good,This company is very productive and always growing in customers and merchandise. Seeing all the merchandise going in and out of the building was amazing to see. It made you feel like you were actually part of something good.
good,"Worked in the mall so there were barely any hours, the pay was horrible and sometimes it was dry but that's cool because you get paid to kinda sit around plus you get 30% discount"
good,"Sales of designer footwear, frontline customer service as well as cashier responsibilities. Only a part time role whilst I was at college and studying."
good,"I I worked there for 3 years, with only one raise, worked at 8 different stores over a 3 year period, without being asked if I wanted to go with no raise in pay or forward movement in the company"
good,E' stata un' esperienza nella quale ho capito quale sarebbe stato o meno il mio modo di vendita e verso chi sarebbe stato rivolto.
good,"it was a cool environment long days,the sneaker culture is fun"
good,"Footlocker was a very interactive job but they have a lot of loop holes in their policies. There is some unfairness that took place in my time there. Footlockers decisions are based on what benefits the company only and not really the associates. Their customer service training is very essential in their success and I have taken that with me to other places. As a manager, there are lots of tasks that are to be completed on a weekly basis but are very time consuming. The pay that managers receive does not compensate for the time they spend in their stores and all the tasks they are held accountable for."
good,Enjoyed my time working at Footlocker. Enjoyed helping customers with there choice in apparel. Very content on the idea of driving sales for the company.
good,"it's not busy most of the time. there's certain times it's busy, christmas, income tax. right before summer then back to school. each of those last no more than a month. then other than those times it is very slow. there's not much to do in the store so it can be very boring especially if you have a bad person working with you."
good,"wasn't bad, wasn't great. I was always bored. Many non-english speaking customers, so it's hard to communicate. So yeah."
good,"My experience at footlocker , I cant really complain cause I did okay. I just didn't get along with one of my managers but there's one of those everywhere. I didn't really learn anything other than tryin to get people to buy more things to bring up the stores percentage lol"
good,It is a fast paced job mostly. It is a good job for students and teenagers. You make your money by getting commission of selling shoes and you get to compete with yours peers. It was fun.
good,"Working for the company as a whole has driven me to succeed and really strive for greatness within the company. I have been able to excel in my highest skill sets that I believe to carry with me such as management, respectful delegation, time management, proactive thinking and reacting, controlling a staff of 18-20 employees including assistant manager, full time, and part time associates. Also, I have been able to excel in helping others strive and advancing to further positions with intense training and teaching others the daily and weekly duties there are as a store manager helping them get to the next level within their future and/or career."
good,Most of the time someone first real job. Its not a bad a bad job just when you dont get the hours you want so it gets kind of stressful but its always good to work where it can be slow and fast paced.
good,You can move up in the company pretty quickly if you work hard and show effort and interest. Work for the company for about 8 years
good,What one would expect from a shoe retail store. Staff were friendly and approachable. Work hours were flexible. Complicated communication with co-workers to manager.
good,"Great atmosphere as far as co-workers and most customers, allowing you to be you as long as you are selling; which depends on what store you are in. Cooperate has the high end mentality where if you are a low end store dont expect very much help and if you are a high end store just keep the money flowing. I was going to move up the ladder but the upper coorperate management mentality was so boochie, want to overwork you, and seems as if they dont want you to have a life, but them. Always trying to impress the stock owners."
good,Footlocker is an open opportunity for all employees. Careers are able to achieved through quick promotion and sales lead opportunity. Very updated and fast pace... Everyday is a new experience.
good,Its a decent company as long as you are at a high volume store and make a lot of sales. If you work hard and show potential it is very easy to get promoted.
good,Most employees come prepared to work hard and work as a team which makes getting things done more efficient. Formal training is minimal and many employees do not have external experience so are constantly learning as they go.
good,"I enjoyed working with my customers and collegues.  I gained a lot of experience and was able to help clients with all their request, providing excellent customer service."
good,You have to be built for this kind of job. Always on you feet a lot of toes get step on but the competition creates bigger rewards. I had the most fun here.
good,"bonnes conditions"
good,"Great company, just has very low pay. Typical retail environment... hours are based on the store's sales so sometimes the hours are cut. Management is great."
good,"good environment to work in. Uniform so you don't need to worry about what to wear, great discounts, no lost prevention or dealing with people stealing."
good,"•	Greeted customers and inquired if assistance needed when entering the store"
good,It's for people who are in college or high school and just want to earn a easy little penny. Doesn't pay much and they don't give raises. Greta management staff
good,I held this job during my high school years. definitely a part time kind of job . easy to move up with all the right resources.
good,its okay. but need a better paying job. great environment. Co workers are fun to be around . great discounts. love giving customers a great experience
good,"I learn how to deal with different types of customers. I also learn how to do the register in the store. Another thing I learned was different type of brands, shoe size, and sale discounts.The hardest part about this job is doing so much for so little. The most enjoyable part of the job is making the customers satisfied with the service."
good,"The amount of work that has to be done on the job doesn't justify the low pay out that is given. 8-9 hour days with only a thirty minute break period when by law you are required at least an hour break. Standing on your feet all day to help customers for long hours a day for minimum wage pay. The pay is supposed to be ""commission"" based but after receiving a few checks, the proposed ""commission"" base pay doesn't add up. I get paid a lot  less than what i'm supposed to be getting paid based off of the commission rates."
good,"Retail/ sales associate "
good,"It's very boring, you barely get any hours, commission sucks, only perk is the employee discount. A typical day is standing around waiting for someone to come by and when they do try really hard to get a sale. Boring but easy."
good,"Le travail en Boucherie est bénéfique car le contact avec les clients est très présent, l'hygiène de vie des vendeurs et la propreté de la nourriture doivent être indispensable"
good,assist   customer   in   selling    shoe .we    worked  together  as  a team.  enjoyable  place  to work   for .  meeting   different people. we  help one another.  The  hardest  part  about  my  job    is  not  having  the  size   the  customer  is  looking  for.
good,fun environment and diverse. benefits are not that great for part-time employees. discounts are the best part of this job.
good,"I worked here as a retail sales person, so the job was pretty typical. I sold shoes and clothing to customers and provided them with what they needed or to help make decisions that are best for them."
good,Working for foot locker inc. I encountered many hardworking passionate people who in turn made me passionate about my job.
good,Management of a shoe retail store mostly good public speaking and great commotions skills. suggestive selling to ever customer
good,A typical day at work is very hectic. There is more to working at a shoe store than people think. There is a lot of paper work that has to be done prior to opening and after closing. Management could be better they are not very personable at times. My co-workers are great people. The hardest part of the job is dealing with different personalities all through out the day. The most enjoyable part is making my customers happy.
good,"No me sentí valorado, había buen ambiente de trabajo, pero siempre se hacía todo mal y eso no motiva para nada a sus trabajadores."
good,"Foot Locker was a great job for me to be at while I was in school, flexible with hours, pretty great work environment. I don't enjoy the late nights and the long hours anymore. Feeling like I don't get paid enough for my hard work and management experience."
good,"Foot Locker was a typical retail store. I learned how to manage the store when my manager was and was not there, because I was considered the 'Sales Lead/Assistant Manager'. Management was probably the best that it could possibly be, but there was need for improvement. My co-workers were all cool, and they all abide by the rules. The hardest part of my job was having to run the store as if I was a store manager. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting all of the different people that came into the store. They kept my days interesting!"
good,"Opening and closing, store audits, inventory, loss prevention , payroll, scheduling and training of associates, skill building and associate hiring and termination"
good,i would say working in footlocker was the hardest part time job because of the selling. the co-workers and mangers are friendly.
good,"A typical day at work, generally is fast paced and a lot of engaging with customers. Management isn't the best all the time, however the culture and the co workers are usually enjoyable. The best part of the job is finally getting that satisfication feeling of helping a customer and sending them on their way with a smile in the face and the hardest are the audits."
good,Your day starts with setting goals and tasks to be achieved for each associates. Training and development is a daily process allowing you to have the desired product knowledge to set yourself apart from the competitors. You work with a team with diverse cultural background and work ethic which helps you to grow and attain various interpersonal skills. Every job comes with its cons which motivates you to get better. Physical fitness and ability to be on your feet for long hours going back and forth will be the hardest part of the job which ultimately helps your health in terms of fitness. The ability to help a client determine the right purchase and make their experience satisfying is next to none.
good,Probably the only benefit about working here was that you get a pretty good discount on the shoe products and apparel. Job promotions was pretty biased and involved favoritism in my opinion. And last and not least working on 1% commission was terrible if you are a part time employee.
good,Nice environment . Great employees and management . Pay wasn't so good . Great selection in shoes and meeting people from all over the world was enjoyable
good,"Meet fun people, laugh a lot. "
good,"Its always fun helping and meeting new people, It feels even better when you can help them with exactly what they need and they leave with a lasting impression. I've learned that patience and an upbeat attitude goes a long way when coming across new people and new challenges. The hardest part of the job is not being able to satisfy a customer with anything (which is rare when its NOTHING) but there has been a couple occasions where someone couldn't find what they needed. But, the most enjoyable part is working with people you can consider family and working together to reach your goal."
good,All my co-workers welcomed me with open arms willing to help me learn my job. It betted me with talking to costumers and getting use to talking to people I don't really know.
good,Face paced but fun interacting with ordinary people. Great learning experience for me being as  though I'm still young so I enjoyed it. The hardest part would be dealing with people who has no manners.
good,"Since I started working there, everything was new to me. I didnt know what to do. I ask my lead to see what I can do to get thing done without worrying anything that fall behind. If the order fall behind, then we should work hard to get most order done and what not done."
good,Learning new sneaker products every week and displaying shoes and clothing neatly and properly in the store. Lots of cash handling daily
good,"Answer customers' questions about merchandise and advise customers on merchandise selection. Itemize and total customer merchandise selection at checkout counter, using cash register, and accept cash or charge card for purchases. Pack customer purchases in bags or cartons. Stock shelves, racks, cases, bins, and tables with new or transferred merchandise. Receive, open, unpack and issue sales floor merchandise. Stamp, attach, or change price tags on merchandise, referring to price list."
good,"great place to work ,but really need to  work on how to train staff properly and how to interact with customers better.Other than that i really enjoyed my time working there."
good,"A typical day at Footlocker is full of different type of people you can help get into the right healthy lifestyle with the most comfortable shoes to fit their fitness plans. I loved working at footlocker and my co workers were all so amazing, defiantly a decent job to get you started in the work field, the hardest part of the job to keep track of inventory with so much stuff in stock, the most enjoyable part of working at footlocker is the job itself, I love shoes and I enjoy selling them to other people and I am pretty good at it."
good,Not a realistic place to have a long term job unless you plan to move up in the company. a day at work is usually fairly fast paced and you learn lots about different shoes and clothing. management is pretty nice and easy to get along with and coworkers are pretty nice most of the time too. the hardest part of the job would probably only be merchandising and learning management tasks if required. the most enjoyable part is probably having a fairly laid back day on a slow retail day haha
good,associates work together to meet sales goals and leave great long lasting impressions. offer great customer service. the employee discount comes in handy
good,"bon magasin, mais il faut être fort physiquement et mentalement."
good,Fun work place with supportive management. Its all about number and is a challenging atmosphere but they push you to be your best.
good,I this job is good. it teaches you how to deal with the public. This is a perfect job for young adults.This job teaches you teamwork how to deal with the public
good,Gave me the skills needed to be confident and outgoing in my future work.  It was flexible hours and the managers at the time were more like mentors then my boss
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. It's not all about selling sneakers, they want you to sell accessories, especially insoles. It starts getting busy around halloween up until the second week of January. It can be a very fast paced environment at times."
good,We've had to work mandatory 10 hour days for the last year because of demand but management is slow to ease the stress of work by hiring more artists. The benefits are great and the Wausau area is beautiful. There is no advancement as a production artist. The overtime helps compensate for the overall low hourly wage but you sacrifice any kind of social life.
good,The job wasn't hard but a lot of sales was involved because that's where most of your money came in from. If you enjoy working in a team the job is great. You get to learn from others just like they get to learn a lot from you. Working there for three years helped me a lot in figuring out what I wanted to do as a career.
good,"Worked around sneakers which I enjoyed, would do it again. Managers were very friendly and helped whenever needed. Most employees were the same age as me so it was easy to get along with them."
good,Moving as quickly as you can to make sure the customer is being taken care of by having knowledge of all the product we offer. I learned everything you need to know about customer service in the 9 years I worked for the company. it all depends on who is your manager at the time different experience every time. so good some not so well. Taking 7 customers at time while delegated on the sales floor. Meeting all new people and learning new things everyday.
good,"This company can provide experience in face-to-face customer service and sales. Great for high school kids, but after a couple years you want to move up the management chain or find another job. Although the people you work with can make things worth while.(Retail Store)"
good,"Fun work place wit supportive management. Enjoyed the day to day interaction and engagement with the public. Enjoyed helping to build the next generation of management. Gained firsthand knowledge on marketing strategies, advertisement, and game planning."
good,"I begin the day my work schedule with assisting the Customers with any question and concerns they may have concerning shoes sales, prices, shoe sizes. I learned how to be patient with coworkers and customers, how to follow directions, and how to be a team player in order to get the job done. I learned management has a significant role in keeping the store operating proficiently by completing schedules timely for staff ordering shoes and other products to keep the store operating for customer satisfaction. I also learned each person has different personalities and no matter if one is having a bad day it's important for me to maintain my professionalism at all time and I learn how to communicate to resolve any issues that my arise. I really enjoyed assisting Customers and working with my Coworkers but if I had to pinpoint what part of the job I didn't like it would be the end of the night when we had to retrieve all the shoes at the end of the night. What I enjoyed most about my job was being in the environment and providing Customers Service."
good,"trop de rivalité instaurée entre collegue"
good,"Always something to do. Running the register. Assisting customers. Running stock. Changing window displays, Management and co-workers are alright. I feel that the managers could care a little more about their employees."
good,the company was good until a new manager took over and then many people started quitting and the hours were bad and I started to loose a lot of shifts so it became awful.
good,"Footlocker was a fun job. The sales atmosphere was highly competitive but, I can say it will make you a better person meaning well versed. The daily sales goal was $2,000 per employee. The worst part of the job was dealing with people who wanted you to remove their shoes. Management was fair (mostly) there was one really obnoxious jerk... But, he was fair and, too honest at time."
good,"A typical day will be meeting all my sales goals, daily."
good,"Typical day open shop, Print reports, put up sales."
good,"I assisted anyone who comes into our store looking for a product that we carry. I approach the customer in terms of signals, timing and style. I determine customer needs, solutions, and information to satisfy these I also identify and initiate opportunities for add-on sales, selling up/down, and potential repeat sales. I give my knowledge about the product to the customer resulting into closing the sale. I assist the store manager in recruiting and training reliable personal, improve work environment to increase efficiency, and handle customer queries. I also help with the hiring process for potential employees. I helped receive the store shipment as well as the store documents, organized those documents into certain sections of our filing system for auditing purposes."
good,"drive sales and monitor KPI's."
good,"Nel mio attuale posto di lavoro soprattutto ho imparato a lavorare in gruppo, con tante persone e poter gestire tutti al raggiungimento degli obbiettivi aziendali, quindi la leadership é la caratteristica piú importante."
good,job was stressful at times but it was ok. nothing bad to say about this company besides pay was lacking for work load. not much room to move up.
good,"My typical day at Footlocker was fun. I have dealt with a lot of customers from different countries and celebrities. I learned a lot about great customer service , I also learned about how to deal with inventory and gained visual skills. The management was okay I got along with a lot  many of them , It was just difficult to get a promotion in the company. The hardest part of the job was the late hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was the teamwork and meeting great customers ."
good,"Fun Laid Back Job, Doesnt pay enough only good for shoe discount. Fun people to work around, customers are even better, Mangement pretty cool"
good,This job was an awesome place to learn interpersonal skills for how how to interact with nationalities and cultures. Unfortunately the company is just learning to value the employee as much as the customer. Pay rates are low and there were a lot of personalities to deal with but I met a lot of great people. The most enjoyable part was definitely interacting with so many cultures and learning from the customer base daily. You will definitely learn life tools as well as languages and culture in this type of job.
good,"A typical day at work would be cashing out customers. "
good,"Ouverture de magasin( clé et code)"
good,productive fast paced environment when the zoo gets very busy for example on saturdays and sundays and on holidays when it gets really busy customer friendly operations and very likeable environment

good,"A typical day at work is logging into the system, then looking around the store and the back room to see if anything needs to be restocked or reorganized. I learned how to multitask and gently push customers to the right shoe they need for they activities they are partaking in. The hardest part of the job is when you're the only one on the floor and there is a nonstop flow of customers for hours without any breaks."
good,Great place to work.  The company has grown tremendously over the past 7-10 years.  They gave me the opportunity to develop and grow within the company.  Great benefits.  I truly enjoy working for this company.  Implemented a new warehouse operating system (WMoS).  Modern sorting technology for Receiving and packing apparel and footwear.
good,"Kids Foot Locker was a fun job i held when i was 16 years old, I have a profound love for children and loved interacting with them on a daily basis. I built great relationships with customers assuring their return. My manager was a good person but unorganized which i did not favor i like to know what and how things need to be done so i can do them in a fast and proper manner. I had great co-workers who made the day go by fast. The hardest part about my job was sharing it with 2 other stores our stock rooms were combined and others were stealing and since they was connected and we had no cameras nor metal detecters it effected our inventory. The best part about my job was that it was my first and it really created a platform for me to grown from teaching me responsibility, how to work successfully with a team and combine ideas to reach a common goal."
good,A typical day at work is talking with customers and trying to see why they came into the store and make sure they don't leave without them being satisfied. I learn how to interact with people better. Management is driven off of our communication with one another. We communicate well. The managers never abuse their powers and treat you equally fair. My co-workers are very friendly and down to earth. And the hardest part of the job would probably be dealing with ignorant customers.The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to talk about sports with my co workers when things get slow.

good,"A typical day at work for me would be coming in every morning counting out my cash draw and ringing up customers. A lot of times in the morning its just myself and the manager. The manager spends most of his time in the back handling shipment and paperwork while I would take care of the incoming customers. I offer sizing, adding additional merchandise such as apparel and accessories, offer gift cards, followed by ring them out. Working in a mall I often get slammed with people of all sorts using fraudulent money, gift cards and credit cards, however as cashier it is my job to be able to differentiate what's real from what's fake. The most enjoyable part of my job would be my amazing co-workers, and the amount of fun we make out of just simply getting shoes for customers. Working for footlocker we are trained to engage in conversation with our customers and with that comes lots of funny conversations, life stories, fancy events going on in which they would be shopping for, the list goes on. Apart from ringing up I also moved up to a visual position. Where my job was not only to ring up and sell sneakers but to take care of all of the visual clothing displays in my store. Becoming a visual was the hardest position for me. In the beginning of my visual work I was coached by a manager I loved however when she moved on I was left to complete everything by myself with no guidance. At fist it took hours for me to perfect my visual displays and things didn't always make sense however in a short period of time my visual work was impeccable. So impeccable now that my district manager"

good,A typical work day at Footlocker included making sure the store remained clean and in order while greeting customers and making sales to meet monthly quotas. While being employed with Footlocker I learned how to be more approachable for customers. I was also afforded the opportunity to create my own work hours when they were available. I did however come across some issues with management showing favoritism towards employees who had tenor. Some co-workers showed enthusiasm while others would do whatever it took to make sales and receive the commission. The hardest part of this job was trying to convince management that I had the drive and time to take on more hours. The most enjoyable part was being able to create customer relationships and enhance my customer service skills.

good,"Typical day consist of daily paper work along with restocking merchandise. Being with this company teaches you about being consistent and over achieving your goals. As being part of the management team we show and teach our part timers great values. My co workers are outstanding and we treat each other like family. The hardest part of the job isn't the job it self,its maintaining a life outside of work. Due to working many open to close shifts it doesn't have much balance. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help people find their footwear and apparel needs. It makes my day to see a customer happy from the customer service they received from me and they enjoyed their product."

A typiocal day at Footlocker begins with one approaching and making conversation with customers to find out what the customer needs.

The hardest part of the job was dealing with multiple customers during the holidays, but it al;so made it a fun experience."
good,I give it a 3 because I don't get many hours...other than that I would rate it a 5. I love the crew that I work with we all get along so well. My manager is one of the best people I've ever worked for.

good,"Each day was a new sales goal to meet, and it helped me to continue my skills in trainig,labor, inventory and developing of employees,"
good,"While working for Foot locker i learned how to deal with different personalities. I also learned how to deal with a fast environment, which i loved. Most of the management worked with you as a team player and then you had some who didn't want to do anything at all. Being an Assistant Manager was very the best part of my job. I loved what i did until working with certain managers and all the changes that was taking place within the company."
good,no hours to do shipping
good,"At Lady Footlocker I was responsible for opening and closing the store. During the day if any problems occur, I would try my best to solve them.

The hardest part bout Footlocker is really making everyone happy, but we all do our best to do so."
good,working one on one with customers some sales involed. Being incharge of the Cashier drawer
good,"A typical day at work at Foot Locker would begin with me and another coworker setting up the store for the day ahead. This would consist of opening up registers 1 and 2 and making sure the store would look presentable for all customers. As the day would progress I would accomplish the goals and tasks required of me such as assisting customers, maintaining a neat stockroom and guiding and training part-time employees. I have learned several skills while working with the company. Perhaps the greatest skill learned during my time there would be how to provide excellent customer service. I have also learned some sales techniques that I will use in the future. Since my promotion to Assistant Manager 2 years ago, I learned how to be a leader and guide a team to meet daily/weekly goals. Management has never been a problem during my time at Foot Locker. With a store consisting of no more than 7 employees at a time, my coworkers have always been similar to a small family. We got to know each other not only on a professional level, but also a personal level as well. Since I have been with the company going on 5 years, I can't say there really is a hard part to this job. Customers could be a bit difficult to deal with at times, but I have learned it is just a part of the job. After all, customers are the main factor in what keeps a business running. There are many enjoyable parts of the job but my favorite would be the fact that I'm dealing with so many different people with different personalities. Somehow that always keeps the job interesting."
good,"While working for this company for the past three years I've learned how to manage cashier duties, delt with different transactions such as cash, debit, credit and travel checks.

good,this was my first job i ever had it was nice i love helping people and i love the fact that we got a discounnt
good,"My typical day consisted of reports, receiving shipment, and helping customers. My favorite part of working here was the children. They made my job much more fun!"
good,"A typical day at work was greeting customers and using outstanding customer service. I learned how to shift around my selling habits to close a sale and how to deal with people from different walks of life. The management could have been worked on but overall they were productive. my co- workers were very driven to succeed and taught me new things on the job to increase sales training skills. The hardest part was to deal with those customers who seem to be a little more on the agressive/negative side that day, so they're harder to approach. The most enjoyable part was learning about different products and meeting new people."
good,"I was the store manager, collector, sales, marketer and more. I feel like I was doing to many jobs for the amount of money that I was being paid. But other than that I feel no regrets"
good,"It was consistently busy. It was a trio...Footlocker, Kids Footlocker, & lady's footlocker."

good,Worked for only a couple years while in college. Good benefits because I got shoes for cheaper than what I paid
good,"Number one goal is to satisfy the customer. Engage in the customer, and ask questions on what they are looking for. Suggest products for the customer. Use other resources if the product isnt avaliable. Complete the look by suggestion other items that may compliment the product. and always leave a good last impression so that the customer is welcomed back."
good,I started working as a seasonal employee. My attributes showed i had potential to grow . and when notice thst was it ..
good,I thought working at foot locker would be something I’d enjoy because my love for shoes but the location I was at had internal issues between management and employees. So it was kind of distracting employees are competitive and there was favoritism. Not the best retail experience
good,I have worked at footlocker for a few months and love my job. The pay is horrible and I feel like we all deserve a pay raise. Assistant managers pay is also super low while us as retail associates re paid a dollar a hour less.
good,"This company provides opportunities for growth along with a flexible work schedule.This company is very enjoyable, uptempo, and structured work environment."
good,"Footlocker  is a great company  to work  for.. they just need to pay the parttimers more than what they pay them. Overall it is great discounts, loyal people who works for them."
good,"The Footlocker IT team overall was supportive and pretty fun to work with. Sadly directors and above management doesn't care for low end employees. Was promised on being hired that there were plenty of opportunity for professional growth but found out from other employees that was an empty promise. Compensation doesn't change much at all, even with promotions and upper management, directors and above, seem to change frequently and thus changes the goal of the department every 6ish months. I had 3 different directors of my department in the 1 year I was there."
good,"Si l'on  a une bonne équipe, tout le monde s'entend bien:"
good,"I loved working at Foot Locker at first. It was a competitive work floor, which I loved, and selling shoes and apparel was right up my alley at 18 years old. Only thing that turned me from Foot Locker is that we busted our butts for nowhere near enough pay."
good,"Although the pay at Foot Locker isn't the greatest, you experience a lot if you work there. There's a lot of opportunity within the company to grow and if you give the job your all, you could move up fairly fast within the company at a store level."
good,Fun and young environment to work in especially on release dates get to learn a lot about shoes and the diversity of people. great management and good team work.
good,It’s a great company they really worked with my schedule while I was a full time student I’m college and they try their best to work with you and promote you
good,It's an ideal place for younger people and for students who need a part-time job to have a little spending money.
good,"Attention la je ne parle pas seulement pour moi! "
good,Good working environment. The management in the store is very friendly and helpful. I believe it is a lot of work and is not worth it for the low pay.
good,"If your looking to become manager, and are qualified then footlocker could be a good company for you. Always looking for new motivated people to move up in the managers rank."
good,"ein typischer Tag dort ging um das Verkaufen von Sneakern und dem Beraten von Kunden bei Sportschuhen wie zb. Laufschuhen und Basketballschuhen."
good,A typical day in the life of Footlocker Assistant Manager was pretty good for an 18-23 year old.  I learned to strengthen my ability to market and sell.  I also started to be able to get my first taste of management and the responsibility of managing others to deliver a common goal.  The hardest part of the job came to work/life balance where there was clearly no balance.
good,Pay is minimal.  Management is great.  Not enough hours available.  Employees are fun to work with.  Discounts are very good.  Like working at the MOA.
good,"It was nice and a comfy place of work. I learned how to talk to kids and parents at the same time, also i learned how to help people find what they need even if it isnt what they want. It gets either really busy or really slow there wasnt really a between. It was pretty easy working with the kids."
good,"Perfect job for who loves have a direct face to face contact with yhe clients , this job suits perfectly for who was born to become a seller, main aim is MAKING MONEY"

good,"Expérience très intéressante, travaille qui demande beaucoup d'énergie est de tolérance."
good,"For the time being, Kid’s Foot Locker gave me the opportunity to mature and transition into adult life while going to school in South Carolina. The hours were great and the staff was easy to work with."
good,Fun first job. As a young kid that loved sneakers this was an ideal job for me. I would receive discounts for certain sneakers. Working hard and making sales will boost up your paycheck as well because almost everything you sell has some sort of commission on your next pay period.
good,"Kids footlocker is a very friendly fun work place. You get to interact and meet new people, helping customers get what they need and want, while maintaining and setting a goal for yourself."
good,Great work environment and developmental coaches to help you advance your career with in the company.very versatile due to the many banners you can work under that the company owns each banner is unique in its own way
good,I have enhanced my people and customer service skill. I enjoy working at Champs mainly because of the people I work with. Each day is a different day with new expectations and happenings.
good,The job was ok but hours weren't steady. Most months you will not get a full check. I don't know how anyone could feed their family off of this job. Management was good and fair.
good,Working at Foot Locker is fun. All of my coworkers were nice. Work was usually completed as a team instead of individually. Goals were reached at the end of the day with the help of everyone.
good,"L'ambiente di lavoro dipende molto da chi fa turno quando ci sei. Ci sono settimane buone dove impari, ti metti alla prova e vieni ricompensato e settimane che non vedi l'ora che finisca."
good,"Footlocker taught me alot about customer service"
good,"Its alot to memorize with footlocker, you have to be on task 24/7 and you HAVE to know color codes on shoes and get use to the storage room, must also have alot of free time if u want to earn more than $60-$90 a week"
good,"Footlocker creates a big impact, they need to channel that for their customers and for the overall experience. The management is solid they have good strategies and intent"
good,"Great opportunity to learn about customer service and retail in general. Working in retail gives you a perspective of the customer's behaviors if you are a marketing student, an advertising student or a future business owner Footlocker will show you the ropes."
good,I was a temp and it wasn’t a guarantee job and didn’t work with my schedule for school and than I got laid off only worked maybe a month and I was laid off and after that I had to constantly search for jobs good job but as of going to temp service it was not worth it
good,a typical day was very slow during the week but very busy on the weekends. The employees were nice people although there was drama within employees. The hours were not that flexibale
good,Fun job for a young part timer or a sneaker head. Management is underpaid and appreciated. Hours and expectations as well as higher management are unrealistic and non helpful.
good,"Culture is great. Customers who came in the store were really into the shoe culture and it was fun interacting with them. Most people were polite, some occasional rudeness but to be expected in a sales job. The location I worked at was very slow because it was not near a large metropolitan area but it could be fun if you were in a larger city. Good, easy non stressful part time job. Promote internally if you decide to stay with the company. training was inconsistent."
good,for the most part is fun working at footlocker. You get to be you self with the customers. You learn all type of things with the company about shoes and appearl
good,When I first started loved footlocker Inc. great benefits great employee benefits. Loved the work hours. If you like sailing this is a good job to have.
good,this was a fast paced retail store it was very busy and i gained alot of experince in leadership and customer service.typical day was based around chasing sales and merchandising .
good,Prepare to be on your feet all day walking back and forth. Working in footlocker was very tiresome. Also you are required to sell a number of combination of shoes and clothing.
good,good ob for young people but when you get older more changeling to stay relevant . benefits are good and its a good company to start out your management career
good,"It has been over 10 years since I worked there so a lot has changed.  Retail job mostly focused on customer service. Long hours, but fun environment. Worked with a lot of good people."
good,Assisted customers with their purchases of sneakers and sports wear. Was paid by commision. Very fast paced and competitive wirk environment. I enjoyed the experience of working with this company.
good,"It's not a challenging job at all. More frequent than not, the customers make it challenging. KFL has had some of the worst customers ever that have little to no regard about  our policies and want things done their way. They don't understand that we have rules to follow and always think that ""we're trying to make their life harder"". Overall the job is rewarding if you like to help people. However, I think that the company doesn't reward the part timers as  much as they should. The majority of the staff is made up of part timers but the only thing we get is a discount. If you are full time and up you get everything health . insurance, paid time off, sick days, time and a half, etc.  Mind you per store on average it's 2-3 assistant managers 2-3 store managers, and 1 full timer, the rest of the staff is made up of part timers. And this company also operates on a ""WHO"" you know basis unfortunately. If you know the right people you'll get promoted in no time, I have seen it happen way too many times."
good,"The movement up the ladder within the stores was good, but if someone in upper management or auditing does not like you or wants to get rid of you, they will find a way to make it happen. Movement from the store level to District Manager and above is very political and dependent on if you FIT the image more than if you are QUALIFIED!!!"
good,"Footlocker for the most part is a pretty good place to work, part-time, if you're looking for a career than you'll have to outsell every other associate week in and out. The only real issue with Footlocker is their commision policy is for the most part not explained properly and is almost seamingly impossible to get your commision everyday you work."
good,"I enjoyed working for the company,but i felt they were not understanding if you were off sick,which was not often.There was not much support.Sometimes it was a struggle"
good,"Working for Lady Footlocker was a excellent experience, but when going to a Footlocker. That's when things went downhill for me. The management was poor causing me to quit."
good,"My responsibilities as the head cashier were to monitor the other cashiers to ensure their transactions were processed correctly. I would count the drawer tills at the start and finish of every cashier’s shift and drop the cash deposits at closing time. In addition to the cash handling, I assigned store employees cleaning/closing tasks to ensure the store was prepared for the next day of business."
good,"Footlocker has a lot of room for advancement, and as long as you can show that you're a hard worker you'll move up quickly. However I do notice a lot of favoritism, both at store level and at district level. If you're not in with the right people, it's very hard to feel included."
good,"Inventory, sales, Paperwork, daily. had numbers to meet everyday. commission pay way to low. fun job me ne people everyday but for your duties pay is really not enough"
good,"An overall good job, however, you may be responsible for many taks. Although these task are never too much to handle, the pay is very low. For example, I have worked here nearly 3 years and never received a raise of any kind."
good,"In my opinion, Foot locker is a store where i can practise my responsibilities as attention todo customers, respecto, morder, kindness... because is a friendly and serious business. I felt very well work it and always had the help to the my coworkers."
good,"Typical work day would be, working on the cash register handling large amounts of cash as well as assisting in any other tasks they had whether it was your job or not."
good,Working a foot locker was an experience. The most difficult thing about this job was working off commission. Although it can be beneficial when you make a big sale it can also be stressful. Management kept a close eye on everything you did to make sure you met the numbers they wanted. There was also some enjoyable parts like meeting basketball players and having the opportunity to go to other stores based on you performance.
good,"i started off as a cashier when i was hired."
good,"Foot locker was my first real job gained customer relations skills and overall enjoyed the expieriece "
good,Spent three years with the company. Very fast paced and sales are important. The environment is extremely competitive. Store manager can make OR break your experience. Not a job for somebody looking to live off of. I would say this is a side job or something to do with your extra time. Definitely wouldn't recommend to anyone looking to pay any rent or major bills will this pay. As assistant manger working 40+ hours a week my checks were only around 650 average every two weeks. With commission. The work is draining and I feel it isn't for pay for what comes with the job.
good,"A typical days involved packing new shipments away in the stockroom before the customers would come in.  I'd greet customers and ask how I could help them, then figure out why they needed what they needed, then try to relate to their experience with an experience we've had in our personal lives.  The workplace was filled with camaraderie.  The hardest part of the job was memorizing multiple orders from multiple customers, but that got better with time. The most enjoyable part was actually satisfying the customers with everything they needed."
good,"Extreme customer service, on queue training from management. Fast paced, competitive environment. Assisting customers decision. Customer satisfaction."
good,It was a great experience at the time it wasn't really flexable when i started school. But overall as a high schooler at the time the sneaker discount was great.
good,The job here was simple yet complex at the same time. You had to be on the floor majority of your time there. Must always engage with the customer as part of your paycheck depended on commission.
good,I did not enjoy working here. I spent my work days doing what I had to do but the co workers were not that welcoming at all. I learned how to deal with customers.
good,Unless you're in management you aren't gonna get paid. Fun place to work and flexible hours. Pretty easy to work your way up I was an assistant manager by 18.
good,It's a cool and easy job. the co-workers are nice. it builds communication skills. it gives you an opportunity to work with children of all ages. as well as working with their parents
good,good money during the holiday hours. You can't stand around and expect to get many hours. You have to hustle and management will reward you. Opportunities to advance are there.
good,"- Gute Arbeitszeiten"
good,"Good entry level job to work at while going to school and learn a few sales skills and get discounts on shoes and clothing sold there. As long as you have a good manager, it's pretty stress free."
good,"A typical day would be recieving shipment for new merchandise, oragnizing the store, and dealing with customers. Managers are awesome, co-workers stick toghether."
good,"Footlocker is the perfect place to work at if you love shoes it's a great company to work for to advance position quickly, although it pays minimum wage if you want to move up in the company there are great opportunities."
good,Très à l'aise dans le milieu du sport j'ai peu enrichir mon expérience professionnelle au sein d'une équipe dynamique et jeune
good,Definitely convenient to work at Foot Locker while in school. I love having the creative freedom to merchandise certain products as I feel. The environment is welcoming and not too demanding.
good,"A fun place to work at. Great co-workers and pretty laid back management. Not a great paying job at all. Depending on location, that will determine your paycheck."
good,A normal day in work as a sales associate would consist of friendly customer service environment that is based by a typical daily purchase with customers.
good,"I enjoyed the job, it was easy and fun, I learned all about Sales here and it helped me when i began at T-mobile. it was close to home and inside the mall, mall hours during the holidays wasnt so fun"
good,Working with people made me happy as well as working in fashion. It was productive i was able to do something different every day. If i wasn't pushing sales out i was working the register or cleaning the work place.
good,"A great deal of travel required for this district. Love seeing associates get excited for new products. The customer is very diverse so you meet and talk with all types of,people."
good,"This job is best for people looking for management and assistant management jobs. Compared to most shoe stores Footlocker is usually outdated when it comes to technology (computers). They would often shut down preventing sales. Part-timers got cut from commission and managers did not. This is a good job if you enjoy helping people and have a passion for shoes but Cannot live off of part time salaries here and don't take very good care of their employees if they are not management. Go for the management job otherwise, apply for champs."
good,I really enjoy working for footlocker. I love the shoes and being able to help customers. It is close to my home which is a plus.
good,It's simple and very easy. The benefits are okay. Customers are nice. Same routine everyday; that can always change so be prepared.
good,"Fast paced, many balls in the air and keep merchandise moving was the order of the day. I learned to multi-task and resolve issues quickly.  Management style was to be present and analyzing data to see what merchandise was selling well and what was not.  Communication with co-workers was a critical part of the job in order to ensure excellent customer service. The hardest part of the job was the inability to disconnect.  The most enjoyable part of the job was merchandising and marketing events to create positive energy in the store."
good,"This department store was a great starter job. The staff was friendly, and inviting. This job taught me basic fundamentals for customer service."
good,"Overall a good job but with 0 life outside of work, when your paid on salary they might expect you to stop everything your doing on your day off and drive a couple hours away for something as simple as going to a audit. This job is ok if your fine with putting your family last and this job first but if thats not your style of job you would like to pursue this may not be the job for you if your looking for store management."
good,Enjoyable job with its benefits. Management inside the store is good. Some hire up management could be better but its not awful.
good,"Fun environment, great coworkers and very flexible. The store I am working for is really slow and security is bad,no help at all, and pay is not so good."
good,il mio lavoro consisteva nel distribuire alcuni gadget inerenti a prodotti sportivi ai passanti e invitare il cliente ad approfittare di alcune promozioni presenti all'interno del punto vendita.
good,"This is a good company if you want to gain managerial experience They give you the tool necessary to learn how to manage a store. The down side is the compensation for the amount of work that you have to do, it almost makes it not worth it. This would be a good job for a college or high school student looking to gain knowledge on management."
good,This was my first real job. IT was okay. i didnt really get that many hours and it was a very small store.  Working at footlocker was exciting at times. It was a good first job to start at.
good,"Customers would inquire about renting storage units and I would help assess their needs and make recommendations.  Many callers would be experiencing life changing events (death in family, divorce, military relocation, or relocation due to hurricane) and most would need a kind word and a listening ear.  That was my favorite part of the job.  Helping people by patiently hearing what they needed to say and then helping them with their storage requirements. My responsibilities also included collecting rents and past due accounts, monthly reports, banking and inventory.  The most difficult part of the job was running auctions when customers became excessively delinquent.  I tried to work out payment arrangements whenever possible but was not always successful due to situations the customers could not control."
good,"Being employed as a manager for the Foot Locker, and my first job in Australia, was both exciting and daunting."
good,The pay was not to bad but I would often work very long shifts.  Footlocker overall was a very good company to work for.  There was always overtime available and there was roo for growth within the company.
good,"A typical day at footlocker is usually pretty straightforward. we get shipment in around noon, we open the boxes to new merchandise and inventory. we also provide great customer service for the customers in the store. As far as management goes, i feel like we all played a part in that category. We all worked together and assisted one another to achieve goals and more opportunities. "
good,"over all fun/good job but theres always room for improvement"
good,"Assist customer by helping them find the appropriate shoes for certain activities. Management is pretty fair and understanding, store like all retail can have its busy season."
good,"I have learned to identify and prioritize business needs to strategically schedule tasks in order to accomplish business objectives. Every day daily task is basically taking care of my customers and helping the team to accomplish the company quotas."
good,"A typical day at work is minimal and simple, address the customers needs and concerns along with stock and general labour duties. I learned the basics of working in a store as a sales associate as well as how to properly do stock and inventory in a regular job. Management was particularly average and ranged between enjoyable to unsettling. Coworkers were very enjoyable and fun to have around. There was not a hard part to the job, however communication was to be kept to a low due to high volumes of theft. The most enjoyable part of the job would be between helping customers specifically and speaking with coworkers on a regular basis."
good,work was very upbeat and always moving around. hard days would be when we were maybe short staffed otherwise every ran smoothly. Cash handling on the regular or returns. co workers were great always  helpful.
good,This was my first job and I had no idea what to expect. I was able to tap into my customer service capabilities and sales abilities. I was promoted early on to the position of Assistant Manager because of my hard work and leadership qualities.
good,Management was awful. Not professional at all. Treated us like a friend and not like co-workers. But the other girls that worked there were awesome and very pleasant to work with.
good,"Single or just married, Foot Locker is pretty good for accomodating those life styles.  Meet new people, make connections and even friends through customers.  I do believe a choice should be given to those who want to have commission or not as a form of earnings included with their wages.  Commission is only an opportunity that is present when outside circumstances aren't hindering to those possibilities.  Meaning, it was hard to consider making a career out of Foot Locker since commission was a big role in whether or not the income would be stable.  Other than that I loved working in all the divisions I was in.  Amazing people were met and relationships made were meaningful."
good,"Great place for new college graduates, growth is limited as you become more senior in the company."
good,"A typical day could be stressful"
good,"High turn over rate for employees and good for a first job when in high school. The managers can be great, it just depends on the store and environment."
good,"I currently work at footlocker as an assistant manager, overall this is a pretty descent job and it has its ups and downs. I've been with the company for about a year and a half now , the overall employees are really talkative and down to earth and pretty easy to relate to. The work pace is mostly fast (especially on weekends), it usually slows down Monday-Thursday. The discount is what keeps me still working here honestly, the basic discount is 30% off anytime and 3 times a year is 50% off. The most difficult thing about the job would have to be dealing with some hard to please, indecisive customers. Mostly people dealing with retro Jordan's or any exclusive sneaker."
good,Fortune 500 company that is stil growing and gives opportunities to individuals who show drive and effort.
good,"The work environment was amazing. The learning experience has been useful up to this day since it was a sales job. I am a marketing major and I am able to apply what I learned about the consumers in the classroom and at my current internship. The management at the time was very helpful in teaching their employees on how to sell the products and the co-workers were very supportive as well. The management created a friendly competitive environment, so that the employees were motivated to sell and make their commission."
good,"- Providing customers with knowledge about the product and getting them to leave happily with the product."
good,"Go to work, do your job, and no one bothers you. If there are any questions about the job someone was always there to help."
good,learning about sports and shoe apparel! overall job was great except for the lack of security and no benefits for part-time workers
good,"This job is a great place for those without job experience to get their feet wet in the work force,"
good,Cool management. Learned administrative duties. hardest part was dealing with angry or irate customers.
good,Great company to work for.HR always there to assist great team work 
good,The store itself is located in times square the heart of the shopping world for people all over the world in NYC. The team members while i  endured while working in this position were very immature and so was management but what helped me look forward to coming to work everyday wasn't just getting a paycheck but definitely meeting knew people that travel from all over.
good,Interacting with people on a daily basis. trying to help each customer find what he/she is looking for and have them leave satisfied with their purchase.
good,While with footlocker one thing was made very apparent- when you are asked your opinion you need to say one- two words. Anything over and you are useless. Even when you try you very best and are getting everything done in record time if a manager see's you stop for a moment then you are getting yelled at. A co-worker of mine also had his own personal gain agenda's which in turn hurt me because he wanted me gone. Overall this experience was not a good one and I could never recommend footlocker to anyone as a job in my life. 
good,this job was fine everything i liked but the supervisor i had was kinda had her grudges. it was a regular day for the workers i enjoyed it. the only hard part was when i closed the store at 2am had to have everything fixed then come in in the morning or the afternoon shift other then that everything was ok.
good,Footlocker was my first job. I loved it. Management is not good in recruiting the best people for advancement. It is like you have to beg for a promotion.
good,"Typical day at work, straight to work no slacking, learned how to work the risk rf scanners, and unload truck merchandise. Great people to work with, great team work."
good,Greet patrons while providing excellent customer service.
good,the typical day at work was to drive sales
good,"It's a fun place to work when working with the right people. Have to be flexible with hours, have good communication and a multitasker in order to make the day go smooth."
good,overall i had a great time working there the customers was nice and some of the co workers nice
good,"I am very patient and professional in my work place, I take good care of my customer and work mates also. Always give back, I am also very calm if any situation comes on long the way. Also don’t let nothing bring me down."
good,Retail is a challenging industry. This industry is always changing due to the trends. This is a very fast paced culture. The customers are always right.
good,More like family than employees. Motivate each other to reach our goal. Provide positive customer service. Most definitely enjoy fashion and helping customers match up their shoes with outfits.
good,"Foot Locker regularly emplyed both experienced and non-experienced individuals in their stores as sales associates. In this position, I worked directly with customers to help them find merchandise and ring up their purchases."
good,"Not the best place to work if you don’t like getting yelled at over the phone for things you can’t control. It’s an easy job, but for me personally, the money wasn’t worth it. It was emotionally taxing."
good,Working at footlocker was a great experience for me. I got to interact with a lot of customers and was able to provide a lot of great information to them about our ccompany.
good,Foot locker was a fairly easy job I like working there a lot being around all of the ppl and the shoes just made my day and the employees there where great
good,"My experience at footlocker has been a learning one. I learned how to work in a team and work with customers. The only downside to it is that when I do work, it’s only for three or four hours. Doesn’t give me enough time to get my commission up. Those are the normal ours for a part timer but they don’t give me that many days throughout the week"
good,"Time to learn new things, gain new opportunities. Everyone has to leave new things you know when it's time to move on and advance yourself as another company."
good,This company really prides itself on providing the ultimate customer service experience to ensure repeat business.  They ensure their associates have the knowledge and tools on how to effectively engage with customers and build relationships to enhance the customer experience.
good,ITS GREAT just wished they took care of  employees better like better benefits better pay. We should get a discount on anything in the store not limited this
good,"A typical day at work consists of interacting with customers, building a bond with them, and making your sales goals. I learned how to interact with people of many different personalities. The management is good and it is easy to move up in the company; however, it is hard to keep a good position. The hardest part of the job can be multitasking when we are short of staff."
good,"•	Assist customers by providing and resolving their complaints"
good,"t is a good place to have your first work experience. It teaches you sales strategies, to have confidence in yourself, and take advantage of opportunities. You can also develop a career if you like sales."
good,"I love the culture and the people I work around. However, the management in which I report directly to is disorganized, inconsistent, and very disconnected to the area he manages over."
good,"It seems the people who are there currently don't take it as seriously as we did back in the day.  The loyalty isn't what it used to be.  There are a few of the core people still around, but the culture in the store and on the sales floor has changed.  Doesn't seem as customer service driven as it used to be"
good,"Loved working there but the pay is bad, you really only have to work off of commission, no hourly wage. depending on how many people work at your store, hours are competative"
good,"environnement agreable, belle ambiance, culture du sport bien integré"
good,"Family over work is your thing? Then footlocker isn't for you. "
good,Working at footlocker you learn customer service an to have patience because you are dealing with all different ages from all walks of life. Fun thing about the job to me was meeting new people an building relationships.
good,"Ambiente giovane fresco e dinamico, forisce un ottima formazione per questo tipo di lavoro e su come rapportarsi con il cliente. Rapporto con i colleghi come in una famiglia."
good,A very busy work environment with many types of cultures. Happy and well put together job with different brands of shoes and brands. Great sales associate experience.
good,Lady's Footlocker is a fast paced environment where you must learn to handle more than one customer at a time. It can get a bit difficult if you're not used to the environment but with good coworkers you learn quicker.
good,normal interview process the best place i felt in store was working in the stock room as i enjoy organising stock and looking for the right coding to be able to locate the trainer for the customer. enjoyable part of the job was being able to meet and work with new people.
good,"it was absolutely the best until they went all haywire trying to please the ""majority"" meaning white people with families. The team was amazing that I worked with. The discount was good but I heard it got stush. Head office comes in to step all over you-again dont expect decent pay unless youre at a recognized location."
good,"I loved working here because I truly enjoy helping others with whatever needs they may present me with. I loved interacting with customers & providing the best service I could. The hardest part of my job was sometimes locating the exact size & style of shoes in the back room which was stocked to the brim. The most enjoyable part of my job was assisting customers, competing for sales and of course the amazing discount on merchandise at the end of the year."
good,"It's foot locker what else is there to explain. "
good,Atypical day at work is slow traffic except during holiday or back to school. I have learned to manage a team and a store. The most enjoyable part of the job is when it gets busy.
good,"I truly enjoyed helping customer find the product they were looking for and more, as a consumer myself I understand what people want from certaint products and it was a pleasure providing my expertise"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is that you get to interact hands on with guest and make sure they're satisfied by all means.  I personally loved shoes and sneakers so working here overall was pretty enjoyable.
good,"Ho lavorato molto tempo fa per questa azienda."
good,I wouldn’t recommend it for anyone else but to each is its own. You truly have to have a love for people and shoes and clothes to work in a Foot Locker .
good,Een Amerikaans bedrijf  die zicht richt op uitermate goede customer service.
good,i enjoy working where i work because i have a awesome manager and set of assistant managers that allow me to take control of the stock room which is less stressful then a manager thats constantly complaining and wanting stuff done there way or no other way
good,"Open store, then open registers, next complete paper work from the night before. Once store is publicly opened , clothes and store must remain nice and organized throughout the day. Twice a week at noon, shipment must be received and checked in. Last, the store is closed, then registered must counted and closed, and paper work must be submitted by end of day."
good,"Train and operate forklifts, pull orders and drop them where they need to be, be able to lift  40lbs, be able to count and match numbers, read, write and work without supervision"
good,"The employees were pretty cool but the manager was just hard to be around sometimes which made things awkward and difficult at times. Also, you really made next to nothing so it was really just a productive way to occupy yourself."
good,"I enjoyed being at footlocker and had an okay experience with their team. I had to be on my top game to make sales and reach my sale goal and at times it was very stressful, But it isn't a bad place to be."
good,Its all fun and game until it comes down to that sale with your name on the box. but overall cool environment to work make and meet a lot of new friends.
good,"Not a bad place to work for. Attire is jeans, sneakers and T-Shirt. One issue is since they have over 3000 stores all over the globe they have shifts all over the spectrum."
good,Footlocker was a great environment for the employees and customers. My job was to make sure the customer had the best in store experience as possible and that they were to leave my store with nothing but something good to tell others.
good,It was fun but stressful because most customers were very rude and a lot of theft would occur. Management was very laid back as long as you did your job
good,"I worked for this company as Financial Analyst. The company invented a silly ""executive"" title to pay employees only once a month that put a lot of people in debt. Pay is horrible as well as benefits. I paid more than 25% of my salaries in health insurance that is not even near to be good. Company is profitable but gritty."
good,Ambitious retailer with continued room to grow. Systems and thought process has not caught up with stated goals. Needs to better invest in the future to compete in new and difference competitive landscape.
good,"Foot locker was a great place to work, teaches a lot especially if its your first retail job. Meet new people, A definite job for outgoing energetic people."
good,Its hard to get full time here as a 19 year old kid. But all in all its a great work environment and love to buy and sell shoes. This isn't for someone that doesn't like being on their feet all day
good,work is simple and easy. had the coolest manager one could imagine. if you like shoes its a great place to enjoy working. hardest part rude customers. best part was discounts
good,"If you like sneakers, work here. Part timers don't get any benefits and checks are frequently messed up. The pay is only 11 an hour and the ""commission"" sale is a hoax."
good,"Footlocker Was the most fast Pace Job i Had , Once you clock in we stretch and its straight to work , we get scanning guns , we worked with shoes for the whole US , So our job was to find the matches put them in the right shoe box and get a bigger box and stack at the least 10 boxes of shoes in the box and send it to receiving . i Left because manage was poor The Managers used to smoke marijuana In the Parking lot during work hours so we had no help ,The Part I enjoyed Is The people That Worked actually Worked fast ."
good,it really is not for adult more. The good thing is you get discounts on numerous products . They have employee aprrection days to where ya discount might get you have off on a lot of products
good,Working for the Foot Locker company was a very fulfilling and eye-opening experience. It allowed me a unique look into the world of retail and competitive workplaces.
good,"It can be very interesting talking to customers from all over the world."
good,Working for foot locker had its pros and cons. Being a manger is very stressful and overbearing. Most enjoyable part is working with the other associates. Work environment is fun but day to day work is stressful. Work hours are troublesome. Either too many or too little of hours. Management is good. Customers can be difficult.
good,La politique de l'entreprise est à l'américaine ce qui peut être en décalage par rapport à la façon de travailler en France.
good,Good place to work but I had bad management so I quite the managers don't want you to move forward in the company try to bring you down and tell you you're not good enough
good,"The job at Lady Footlocker was very fun and competitive. Very good chance to move up in the company if you are there long enough and do a great job, Commission chances is what makes the job competitive."
good,"Throughout my 3 years of working, we didn't get any raises. The only way you could get more money is if you went from part time to full time. Turnover rate is very high with this company due to pay more than likely. You meet great friends through foot locker and the discount is great but other than that many feel undervalued and unappreciated. I'd recommend for part time if you're in school and enjoy shoes. If you work there for as long as I have or part timers even, you should get quarterly raises or every 6 months heck even yearly. If you have a family to provide for you better find a rich spouse or this wouldn't be the place"
good,"Footlocker.com is a pretty good company to work for in the Wausau Metro area.  The benefits are competitive and the work/life balance is above average.  After 10 years of employment, I wasn't able to find any advancement opportunities to compliment my strengths and education level. Overall, it is a good company to work for though."
good,"Possibilité d'évolution de carrière, "
good,"Employees and management are diligent, friendly and well trained. The environment is amazing and the perks are amazing. The discount on merchandise is exeptional and they give incentives for exceptional work. A normal day is a slow day. Busy days are still kind of slow."
good,"Sometimes you don't always look forward to working because many customers don't always buy things, and you constantly have to climb ladders for people who continuously who don't want anything. Don't get many hours."
good,I was only here for a seasonal position. The job was okay but at the end of the night you had to put away all the shoes. Some employees were not as friendly as others.
good,Working here was fun but I didn't always get as many hours as I would have liked. It was good for me at the time because I was younger and didn't have any kids to provide for.
good,"The work is not strenuous or difficult. There is a lot of miscommunication at times between staff when it comes to the stockroom. It also is difficult to maintain an orderly stockroom especially while dealing with shipments at night. Management works to take charge on the situation and make it better, however, many times their efforts falls upon deaf ears and sometimes creates a more difficult and stressful work environment."
good,a typical day at work would consist of me assisting customers with shoes they might like. I would also tell them about other merchandise in the store. as well as the sales on other items. i would greet my customers. The enjoying part of the job was when i made the customers day by helping them find the right shoes and matching clothes before leaving the store
good,"it can be very slow sometimes but its better fast paced since your pay is based off what you sell, managment can be pretty cool if you have a good relationship with the manager, the hardest part of the job is having new layout that you have to put together, the most enjoyable part is the discount and we get quaterly get 50% off on select shoes"
good,"great working environment with great people. job is easy, basic retail job. pay is okay if you are  starting off. good chance of getting promoted to sales lead."
good,"Great brand,  but their Digital arm is spread far from their Bricks and Mortar management.  This makes true Omni-channel initiatives difficult."
good,I was not happy with the pay felt like we should deserve more for what we where titled to do. The reason i stood for a while was because i was very good at what i do and i enjoy making customers smile .
good,There was always something to do while working at footlocker. meeting celebrities that would come to Portland to perform. Since I worked at footlocker our location was near trimet so we got many different people to come in an check out our store. The main goal was make a lasting impression and get the customers what they need. The work place was diverse the manager that hired me was great we still have a friendship even after they had left our store an moved. The most hardest thing about working at footlocker would be meeting quota or exceeding. There were days when no one came in and there were day's when everyone came in however; I did what I was hired to do an did my job well.
good,It was a good place to work. Start the day off with opening up the store gettting people in position for the consumers that where coming in to purchase items.
good,"Great job if you're young and looking for something flexible. Management needs retraining, very unprofessional. The pay is NOT worth the labor but overall decent job"
good,"There's a lot of folding, and straightening of shoes, other than that just be your self and have fun. Always remember to offer, offer and offer again additional products with shoes, because that's the type of job you're in."
good,"Hardworking employees who care a lot about their staff. They have tons of options to better suit their employees. Such as a free work out gym, vending machines with not just soda but also food plus much more."
good,Not a terrible environment. Gets extremely slow during non holiday seasons. The job can be extremely great if youre set up with a good manager and a good staff.
good,"I truly enjoyed working with Foot Locker/Eastbay in their creative services department, but it was clear that I was working in a corporate in-house environment. Former co-workers and supervisors were great, but leadership at the top was often times difficult to work with. Creativity was often stifled by the suit that wanted to put his signature on your work. Grew tiring fast. It's been a long time since I worked there, so I'm guessing it may have changed since I worked there."
good,"Depending on your location, it's a lot of work for little pay. You have to wear the type of shoes they sell, but they aren't easy to purchase with the pay they give. The atmospher of the place is really fun and great for young people."
good,"Enjoyed working here, friendly colleagues and management, reasonable hours. Developed customer service skills. Late shifts and working on weekends was difficult"
good,Its a good company to work for. I feel for the work we do we should be better compensated for its not enough to live off if you on your own.
good,"I was pretty happy getting the job at Foot Locker especially as my first one. But management and some of the employees did not make it as warming or as a team as you think. Yes they are nice people but when it comes to being friends and creating a bond, you could tell you were an outsider as people who worked there seemed to have their own clique."
good,Enjoyed learning the about the distribution process of footwear and apparel. Production line and warehouse teams where impressive to watch in action. During peak seasons had the opportunity to leave the office environment and assist in the production line.
good,"fast paced, a bit limited, awesome coworkers, management was cut and clear, best part of the job was the number of people you meet."
good,Footlocker is about working the floor and learning how to sell. They pushed us in the right way and I learned much while there. Only downfall was the security breaches.
good,Footlocker is very diverse store located in Manhattan. I enjoy meeting new people of different culture and ethnicity which in footlocker you are able to do. My co workers are very fun to work with. I enjoy interacting with customers from different locations of the world. I learn different languages as well. The hardest part of my job is dealing with different attitudes and personalities of the customers but I still manage to remain with a positive attitude throughout it all. Also different managers have different rules. With different rules and regulation its kind of hard to know what's the right or wrong way. the most enjoyable is seeing the friends I made at footlocker and being able to work with them. I learned so much. I've learned how to maintain my attitude with rude and disrespectful people around me. ive learned different words in different languages. my vocabulary have increased with the help of my co workers and customers who explore different parts of the world.
good,I liked working there at first until they started putting so much pressure on us as far as doing sales and upsales.  For me it wasnt an issue on selling it was just that there was no recognition what so ever.
good,Fun work place with cool co workers and poor management. Footlocker doesn't have any hours for part timers unless its the winter christmas holiday. The discount for shoes and clothing is the best part about working at footlocker. Other than that if your not full time you can't make good money with working this job as part timer.
good,"It was a fun place to work, the co-workers were amazing but i must say the salary was a bit low. I loved the clothes and help people with decisions about what they should buy. The worst part working weekends and holidays."
good,"If your looking slow paced job with little pay this is the job for you"
good,A true company that has your back if you have the company's back as well. Very productive with their focus on the primary goal at the same time. A big audience of diversity within the company which can help you view wider of your job duties.
good,I've been working for foot locker for five years part time i love it. i think my co workers are the reason I've stayed this long.
good,Was being able to be in a free environment and get to know all the people you work with closely and personally. Everyone got along so well and it was joyful to come into work everyday with such a good group of workers and management
good,"selling trainers all day wasnt very fun."
good,"On a regular day it was busy off and on, the customer know what they want about 40% of the time. when i can show people things that they want without them knowing they wanted it, that was the best part of the job.the hardest part would be the customer that just does not know, so they try want to try everything on."
good,"I personally enjoy working at Foor Locker, I enjoy being a part-time assistant manager, I love the fact that I am able to make more money by selling more and I LOVE to sell. I just do not make enough money."
good,"arrivé 9h55 ouverture accueil des clients vente sans pression car la plus part savent ce qu'ils veulent et il n'en manque pas 21h fermeture "
good,"Put away stock and organize the back room along with the floor sets. Persuade and recommend customers to buy a pair of shoes or clothing to match while informing them about the benefits of their future purchase. If a customer decides to buy something, I would ring up their purchase at the till. When I was not with  a customer I would be folding and organizing clothes and shoes on the floor. At the end of the day, I would sweep and mop the floor, get the store ready to be re-opened the next morning. Once a week I was responsible in counting the tills and depositing the weekly income."
good,"You can meet a lot of people working here, standard mall hours, there is cool product to try out"
good,foot locker is a great work environment with many opportunities for growth...i work at the busiest locations so i get to meet and conversate with alot of people from different parts of the work
good,"In this position the goal was to prevent customer fraud.  We used a set of guidelines to review orders and customer information, as well as bank verifications, and customer contact to review and release suspect orders.  Part of the day was spent answering return customer phone call and the other part was investigating orders.  I also did instore reconciliation, processing instore orders which did not go thru the automated process for one reason or another.  I was also trained to work with our credit card processor to process the chargebacks we received - when a credit card holder disputed a charge on their account.  This was a call center environment, very busy and all about customer service to both internal and external customers."
good,"low hours, very tight schedule and hard when you complete the day you probable wouldn't do anything else in the day,the supervisor want you do 150% because 110 isn't enough"
good,Help customer's critical think about what shoe best fits their wants and needs while adding on other merchandise. Fun people to work with and must be able to manage your time and have great short term memory.
good,"As a Customer Service Rep. at Walmart I was responsible for handling guest complaints and compliments, returning merchandise to shelves, accepting returns and exchanges, refunding money and maintaining a balanced cash drawer. I would also activate gift cards, phone cards and handle requests for money orders."
good,"This company in my district, has good and bad managers, and your experience is based off, which type of manager you get. They pay is awful for anyone over 17. Although promotion options are accessible to everyone, even assistant managers dont get paid very well."
good,"a good first job but not something I would consider to be career beneficial, Great workplace and people just very repetitive work, and you will be sitting down for long hours and be inside the entire time you are working"
good,"A typical day at work is selling shoes and appareal to customers. I would recieve shipment and store it. I have learned how to deal with many types of customers, how effectively stock goods, and how to keep a peaceful work environment.  The hardest part of my job is the labor in storing the shipment, I would have frequently bend down and climb ladders. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my collegues."
good,"*An average day, includes checking in stock, making sure my fulfilment is correct, stocking the stock in a neat and retainable order. hard sales drive to get the day started, speaking up product, and great sales that we sometimes offer. "
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was when new shoe or clothing shipments came in.
good,Kids Foot Locker and the Foot Locker Inc. is a good job to start of as in as teen in high school but as grow older and have more responsibilities it's close to impossible to survive off of this job. My work environment was fun and friendly and almost stress free but after working there for over two years I became frustrated with my inconsistent hours and low pay.
good,"A typical work day for me would consist of paperwork, meeting sales goals, conversion rate goals, multiple sales goals, and customer service goals. I have learned how to open anybody up to get into the root of why people shop within the foot locker brand. I also learned how to keep up competition within my staff and still keep a positive work environment. My management team was pretty good, we were able to hash out all differences peacefully and work effectively with each other to focus on said goals. The hardest part of  working as a manager for foot locker is the face that i was away from my family a lot due to the fact that all tasks within my store had to be done by me because i was on salary and we did not have enough hours for extra help. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my staff. The fact that i taught my staff so much and what i taught them will actually most them into becoming productive adults in any work environment satisfies my soul."
good,slower speed so lots of down time to learn more about your employes 
good,The job was fun besides the low pay. I liked the discount on the products and that I could get a discount on my phone bill.
good,Footlocker is a good company to work for. It was a enjoyable job to have.
good,Main focus was having every customer recognize their options
good,good place to work if you are a sales driven person
good,openning/closing procedures
good,I loved helping children find the right shoe for the right sport or activity. Educating parents on how to choose the right shoe for their children was informative for both the parents as well as myself. Co-workers were ok except when there's a commission to be made and they sometimes take other sales associates' sales.
good,"A typical day at work included selling different items, suck as shoes, socks, shoe spray, to different customers. I learned how to adapt to different people and different environments. I learned patience. The managers were approachable and, for the most part, easy to work with. My co-workers were easygoing and approachable, as well. The hardest part of the job was handling the different needs of the customers at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting various types of people."
good,Footlocker is an amazing company. I've worked for the company for more than 3 years as an Assistant Manager and I love it. I love meeting new people every day..The only part that really sucks is the pay. I've met kids at a steak a shake drive-thru that makes as much as I do serving burgers and fries when I manage an entire store. It doesn't balance out.
good,really fun and competitive( if you make it that way ) atmosphere.  30% off we get new releases first 50% off every 4 months. we can use our discount at footaction lady footlocker champs and kids footlocker
good,"It’s a great starter job."
good,"Foot Locker is a face paced type of work. Working in the shoe-retail industry consists basic brand name knowledge, excellent customer care practice and inventory familiarity."
good,"I approach the customer when they walk into the store, getting them the  items they tried to buy, and try to sell them some addons. For example, when the customer bought sneakers, I will try to advertise the socks, shirt, appreal, shoe pill /  cleaner etc."
good,"I learned how to deal with unhappy customers, and how to talk to people to please them.  The hardest part of the job was when there was only 2 people working at a time and it would get very busy."
good,I interned here one summer and had a great experience. Foot Locker's program is very well organized and put together to ensure all interns are placed in positions they are interested in. You also get to learn more about other departments and roles if you request to shadow for a few days. They set up several events for us to meet some of the higher level execs in the company and also fun events for us to socialize and get to know one another.
good,"Competitive, store can be busy or slow. Depending on time of day, year and location. customers can be nasty but be sure to always smile and remember do not argue back and fourth. If any issues call a manager because customers love to call corporate or at least threaten to."
good,"Overall I like working for footlocker, it is a fast pace job, you have to be able to multi task if you want your commision and that is what makes it hard. Pretty cool work place though customers are mad chill and the best part is the work crew starts to become more like family. It starts with the manager. Great manager makes a great work environment."
good,"Very relaxing ,had to work fast and be able to communicate with the costumers. Also had to ring up your own sales ,was a very free flowing but hard working job  ."
good,Eine Firma die früher mal gut und soziales Denken hatte !
good,ho lavorato poco in footlocker l ambiente e dinamico e giovanile
good,I’ve been working here for 2 years now. Not ONE raise. Hours are sometimes good but sometimes suck because of slow days. Don’t work here unless your in high school or are trying to grow within the company (become a DM or etc.) it’s a fun job the people are great environment great but people has bills to pay.
good,"I've come to realize that there was always a job to be done. I enjoyed the employees that I've have worked with. I always tried to keep a level workplace while getting jobs done with my staff. They respected me and enjoyed working with me while doing the tasks I had given them. The pay varied from store to store. A higher volume store would pay its employees less commission and a lower volume store would pay higher commission so although it seem to vary, it leveled the playing field for commission. I wasn't always happy with the pay because it seemed like for more work you did not get paid more because it was based on commission of product."
good,"Check the sales floor for any mess, assist customers, organize stock room, manage register, learned how to manage different customers, and how to approach a conflict situation, the culture in the workplace was like a family environment"
good,Working at Kid's Footlocker was a good experience and taught me a lot about customer service. They offered great employee discounts and everyone had to work as a team in order to meet the daily goals.
good,"check inventory for item, pull stock out front for sales associates. move stock to designated areas. The hardest part was unloading the stock by myself."
good,"This company has been good and bad."
good,"very competitive managers will drive you to sell sell sell, but  if you're good at sales you will make money and get more hours. the store is fun to work at and getting a discount and first dibs on shoes"
good,"Being a manger at Foot Locker is a good way to get experience at managing people.  The compensation and benefits are not great, and cannot sustain an actual career."
good,If you're into sneakers and want a decent discount this is the place to work. I wouldn't suggest this job if you do not like dealing with rude people because around back to school and holidays customers can get very rude.
good,Travail dans de bonnes conditions l'équipe est toujours prête a aider et une bonne ambiance y règne
good,"There isn't very much room for advancement in the company unless you can work 40+ hours, and to get that many hours at any given time in the year is extremely difficult. The environment is extremely good."
good,It’s not a bad place to work in but for some it depends on the location and the people.. Always make sure you’re always coming in with a positive mind
good,"the job wasnt the greatest because i never got shifts until i confronted the manager who hardly works, and was slacking during their time of working. was organized at all. the job itself was fine, but getting shifts and management wasnt the greatest"
good,It can be a fun place depending on who your manager is but unfortunately fun doesn't pay the bills. There's no real benefits and the pay especially if you're manager of some sorts does not match the work load.
good,"the store needs some changes, some employees need to accept that they aren't manager. The schedule never are completed on time. The  they change the schedule on the same day"
good,"Working here had it's pro's and con's, you are part of a team, there are slow days and there are great days. Always be ready to SELL, SELL, SELL. Over a fun place to work at if you love sneakers."
good,"Had a good experience here, former manager (no longer there) had no idea how to manage and it was very hard to come to agreements. SM always showed up late to work with no excuse."
good,"This job was never the same everyday, always dealing with different people from different countries depending on where you're located at. I did learn a lot of managerial skills such as, scheduling, counting inventory, supervising and making sure the customer gets what they want when they come inside the store and leaves with a smile."
good,"Great company and was always learning new things. My manager was great when and was always there when i needed him. His approach can be difficult to handle , but he would get his direction across every time. I succeeded and did well with the company."
good,"Bonne entreprise, relativement bien payé par rapport à d'autre enseigne, on peut évoluer mais il faut s'en donner les moyens et être prêt à bouger ça aide"
good,Being called back to back for shoes is tough and can be stressful at times. It can help to build a retention of memory skills and learn about different sneakers and their uses.
good,The environment was fast paced and i learned about many different shoes for foot performance. Management was good depending on the location. Hardest part of the job was working very hard many hours for low compensation. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a team that was as dedicated as i am to help others.
good,"Recommend this place for those looking for something PT. If you are into shoes and also have a main job, this would be perfect."
good,"A typical work day at Footlocker coming in the opening the store. Every morning, I had to read the emails, make sure the cash registered was correct, and keeping up with the daily audits. The management was very understanding, a lot of growth within the company. Hardest part was selling and being managing others at the same time, and during a busy work day. The best part was meeting new people that shopped with us."
good,"Personalmente ritengo che questa esperienza in Foot Locker come part time domenicale, lavorando quindi solo 1 giorno a settimana, mi sia servita a conciliare lavoro e studio nella maniera più favorevole nonostante per me non rappresentasse una prospettiva di crescita in quel campo."
good,"A great first job to have, but the pay is not fair. They also do not give raises unless you are promoted, not matter how long you have been working for them."
good,It's a good place to work if you are young. Hours are limited but the discount is nice. The management at footlocker are easy going and easy to get along with.
good,"Nice company good place to work if you're into this kind of thing , good perks for employees for retail such as employee appreciation I enjoyed my time there for sure"
good,"Footlocker is a great place to work if you are young and trying to get your feet wet in the retail industry. The compensation should be higher starting out my hourly was only 6.25 plus commission. The work environment is fun, if your a sneaker enthusiast then you would love it here."
good,I won't to work because I like to take my family out to eat  and I love to work with police so that why I won't to work as a surcurty office that been my dream
good,it is a relaxed environment. A lot of new people you meet and helps you develop communicating skills.the management is always friendly and helpful. Great first job.
good,"I didn't like working at foot locker because of the low pay and slow business, but overall foot locker is a nice place to buy shoes."
good,Really enjoyed foot locker yet again it was a very easy job not so much to do once you get it down and I didn't work in such a busy hectic shop so it was easy for em
good,Footlocker is a great place to work if you like fast paced. Every day is something new and you learn something everyday. At the part time level it is really fun. As a Full-time or management position you get mistreated and not acknowledged for a lot of the good that you do. That is the hardest part of the job.
good,"Au sein de l'entreprise, il existe des évolutions de poste rapide, a condition d'être mobile géographiquement."
good,Honestly Footlocker is perfect if you're in school but if that's your only job the pay is terrible. I feel like if you do so much for the company but there's no way they repay you.
good,Awesome job for anyone who is a sneaker head. you get to learn a lot about the latest trends in shoes and you get an AMAZING discount. Management is usually super cool and understanding.
good,I like working there a lot and being a part of the community but the pay wasn't up to par with Miami living. Working consisted of checking SKU numbers and taking singles back to their original box and dealing with customers on a daily basis also keeping the store nice and tidy
good,it was okay. could've paid more. more training and information could've been given. workers were nice. managers were somewhat helpful
good,"Les journées ne sont pas routinières mais dépendent de l'affluence en magasin, comme dans toute enseigne spécialisée dans la vente."
good,"A very fun place to work but not to make a career of. Dailey task of stocking the warehouse, customer care, and lots of hustling so your commission ends up nicely."
good,very copetetive since pay is commission based but you do develop strong communication skills from this job. depending on your store you can have fun managers or strict.
good,"I learned how to deal with multiple customers at once. The manager I had was always playing games on his phone, co-workers acted like they didn't want to be there. Hardest part was remembering what everyone wanted, best part was commission."
good,"A typical day at work consists of making sales"
good,"Ambiente di lavoro giovanile e disponbile, si possono imparare molte cose nuove nell ambito della vendita al dettaglio, e soprattutto gestire clienti di ogni tipo."
good,Nice staff and friendly. Good wage and effective time management. i liked working and had fun but also very professional.
good,"My typical day would consist of working on tills and talking and serving customers and I have learnt to be much more confident within myself, multi-task and relate to my team needs."
good,"I started working as part time and i enjoyed it very much (it depends on your city). since this is a commission based job, stores that generate more traffic will obviously have a better payout. there is PLENTY of room for advancement which is always good in the company. no matter what the policy states, the customer usually ends up getting what they want HOWEVER the company does not treat the employees as good as they do their customer and i dont think thats fair at all. this isnt the job to make full time. but the company isnt bad at all as far as the discount, your ability to get release date shoes, and going into affiliated stores to get the discount."
good,"Ambiente stimolante. Si lavora continuamente con ritmi molto elevati. "
good,helping one customer at a time. help drive sales and help to have great customer service. always putting the customer first.
good,Footlocker is a fun place to work. I enjoyed the atmosphere. The management team is great and I enjoy being able to work next to my peers. I am looking for something more stable and advancement.
good,"This is a great first job, they don't pay much, but the team was great. The District managers were a little rude for my taste, but you don't deal with them daily. They stress insole and cleaner sales, and you must hit your hourly goals."
good,"chaque vendeur aide les stagiaires ,et leur montre comment vendre avec des produits complementaire"
good,"this is a good job if you're in school and need a place to work, hours are not to long, and the management can vary. but you get a great discount"
good,"tres bonne ecole de vente"
good,Working at footlocker you have good days and bad days. Somedays you may come to working and have to run all day because the store is really busy and then there is days when you come to work and your standing around waiting a hoping customers come in the store. I've learned a lot of responsibility working at footlocker. I've learned that you have to work for your money and that you determine your check. i also learned a big responsibility with the discount card and it balance. that one thing in particular teaches you how to be responsible. you have to watch you discount balance on your own theres no one watching you telling you home much you have left on your discount for the month and if you don't watch it and you go over you have to deal with the consequences. my coworker are team players if we need help finishing sales or adding additional merchandise to the sales i can always depend on them to help me. sometimes the  hardest part is trying to convince a customer to purchase something but one you convince them its nothing else to worry about. footlocker is actually a fun job.
good,fun co-workers to be around on a day to day basis. Fun environment because you were able to interact with the best customers.
good,"great people, nothing to hard as long as you had a system you will be fine"
good,On a busy day help customers a lot by either getting them a shoe or selling the accessories The manager i have are pretty cool and they work with me great making sure i know what i am doing at all times. The most enjoyable part of my job is making a kids day by helping them find the perfect shoe. .
good,"Manage a wide range of employees, with a mindset of driving sales and reaching a common goal. A difficult task is actually managing different employees whose full time job may be elsewhere but being able to keep them motivated to treat their part time like it was their only place of employment.The enjoyment comes when I can get every coworker on board to have the same vision and deliver quality care to all customers with appreciation."
good,enjoyed working there. staff was great- was happy to come into work
good,"Typical Day, Jointly accountable with Buyer in delivering sales, margin and profit plan."
good,I learned alot working at Footlocker rather it was good or bad.. The management i worked under worked together and against each other.. As a company I believe the goal is to develop as a unit. The district I worked for worked the opposite way.. Of course it wasn't all bad i really enjoyed working for the company
good,"As an Assistant manager at footlocker, i am required to run the store from its operational as well as marketing perspective. I am required to manage the hours worked in the store with the hours given, make sales goals & help associates reach their daily goals."
good,"Lady's Footlocker was a awesome retail job experience. I described merchandise and explain use, operation, and care of merchandise to customers. Help customers try on or fit merchandise. Inventory stock room and requisition new stock. Answer questions regarding the store and merchandise. Compute sales prices, total purchases and process cash or debit/credit payments. Clean bathroom, ran cash register, organized and set up floor models, and other duties when assigned by upper management. I enjoyed every part of this job."
good,Overall a good company training program is a good tool repeat customers
good,"The time spent here was incredible, my coworkers were very helpful, supportive and helpful. The work environment was a bit stressful at times, but altogether manageable. The only area which was lacking was a slight unease about job security and the compensation for the amount of work done."
good,Getting along with employees and customers with make your day good and not having any problems so you won’t have to stress on your job by making any wrong mistakes
good,I'm truly happy to be part of this company. I have learned a lot through out the years and the skills obtained have been vital in my professional career.
good,Footlocker is a fun place to work and very interactive. Co-workers have provided me with the proper training to do my job efficiently. I enjoy speaking to the customers and finding out what their needs are..
good,C'est une très bonne enseigne pour apprendre la vente
good,It was a fun and good work place. Sometimes it was very slow so it was kind of boring but other days it was very busy. The job isn't hard at all very easy
good,It was very much fun. I enjoy helping people find things that they were looking for and their Style I enjoyed styling people in general it was just all fun because you got to meet new people and conversate. I also enjoy dress in the mannequins when we got new stuff to display. I very much enjoyed my job at Footlocker because. again I love shopping and I enjoy helping people and making them happy
good,"I have a passion for shoes, so this was the perfect place for me. The work is very easy and the environment is very comfortable. Things can get very busy, quickly, but overall it is a great job."
good,"Work any of 3 shifts."
good,Working On Commission W/ Not Enough Hours Good Music Good Environment  Don’t Give Raises Good Staff Members Learned How To Run The Backroom & Run Shipment
good,"Ok place for work for a someone who needs a Part time job or in high school. If not in management, Job is very laid back. Need a better way of pay incentive."
good,EVery location is different but I enjoy my job and the people I come in counter with very well spoken and respectful workers you would enjoy working at this company just a very fun experience job to learn more things and get to know more well nice people !!!
good,"Working at Footlocker was a good part time job. The associates were very friendly and welcoming and management trained in a very helpful, hands-on matter to help me be successful in my position."
good,Foot Locker is a good place of employment but in a bad neighborhood. We got robbed a lot so I had to leave. I really liked my manger until he went to a different location.
good,"Working for this company was everything I ever imagined. It was a job I've wanted since I was in high school but unfortunately as I'm growing older, the pay doesn't compensate."
good,I was able to learn how to communicate more with each individual customers and understand what each person want and their personalities. There are some days where it is slow.
good,"Veel beweging, rennen, schoenen halen. sales maken. Targets halen."
good,It is indeed a great enviorment to be and work in; However the hard work that you may put in is not always reflected on your paycheck. Thats the thing I struggle with this most. I could work 80 hours for two weeks and only make $400 . When it's slow season there isn't really any money to be made! Commission along with making below minimum wage just isn't enough!
good,"Very busy every work shift"
good,"I'm trying to understand why are we doing this review . I believe the computer is malfunctioned because we just did this review earlier. It's the same as the 1st one,"
good,Love my co-workers and managers. The hours is not the best but overall a fun workplace. It gets competitive at times but it's not a hard job. Just have to stay focused and continue to be the best
good,Great for college students who are into the sneaker culture . But the fact that it's a retail store sucks especially working holidays and weekends. They need to value their employees a little better but it's hard because everyone is replaceable
good,"I started off working as a sales associate for LFL (Lady Foot Locker) and quickly became assistant manager at Foot Locker, my hiring manager was great, the hours were great, it was a fun environment. Once my manager got promoted we received a new manager who was poorly trained, lazy and unprofessional and ruined my Foot Locker experience, I have complained to my DM and still nothing has been done. Other than that, I enjoyed my job and had regulars come in every week to buy shoes, shoe cleaner, etc. or simply they come in the chat and my associates make my job worth while."
good,My time working at foot locker has helped me with my people skills tremendously. I have nothing bad to say except for the minimum wage compensation. Its a great job for someone in high school.
good,Good place to work if you like shoes and like communicating wit people on the daily I learn some things about shoes I didn't know just didn't really want that job for so long I needed more money
good,"This job was fun, but over head attitude wasn't fun to deal with at times. I would work here again.  The work place culture was diverse."
good,"co workers a very friendly, environment is fun sometimes. a lot of new faces scheduling is bad due to the fact that a lot of high school people work"
good,"A typical day at work would sometimes be slow depending on the day. We were located in Kenwood mall, and our store wasn't that big. I learned about how to easily locate the shoes In the back for customers, and how to keep safe in the work environment. My managers were always really nice, and had a great sense of humor. They made sure that they could assist me whenever I needed help. The hardest part of this job was sometimes trying to locate the shoe in the back. Climbing the ladders sometimes made it even harder. The most enjoyable part of this job was all the people that I got to meet, and ofcourse the 40% off discount."
good,"A good work environment with employees and some managers. However, upper management can show more appreciation towards employees."
good,"Assisted customers with purchases and provided them with information about products"

good,"My time with Foot Locker was fun, I enjoyed my time working, but the pay with my position was extremely low. Minimum wage checks every week. Did always have 40 hours aside for the position."
good,"I actually enjoyed my time at Foot Locker. Although, it can be stressful and busy. My managers were very pleasing and enjoyable to have. Very understanding but people I worked with were very pushy, mildly comfortable to be around most of the time."
good,I enjoyed working there but it did not pay enough for me.  When it was time for me to get my own store it was going to be a pay cut for me.  I did not take it because less pay and more responsibility did not make good business sense.
good,Working at footlocker is an uplifting fun atmosphere. I never went to work and knew what my day was going to be like. New customers everyday. Which made me learn to treat every customer with respect but adjust to them as well.
good,"I started as a worker who processed orders, which included but not limited to scanning in the merchandise, to packing and shipping out the product. I then became my zone coordinators Trainer/Helper and trained new hires on how to do the job effectively."
good,"J'ai aimer mon poste de vendeuse, le seul inconvénient c'est qu'il n'y avais pas beaucoup de clientèle, je suis très dynamique et j'ai vraiment besoin d'avoir un contact avec la clientèle."
good,"A typical work day at Foot Locker consist of, assisting customers with, shoes, and clothing."
good,"Pre-opening "
good,Had fun working at footlocker. Learned a lot about sales and shoes. Learned a lot about customer service and how to persuade customers into buying items. Overall it was an okay job.
good,Working for the flagship retail part of Kids Footlocker makes my job experience much more fun.  it goes hand in hand with my infatuation with the sneaker culture.
good,"A typical day at work was get in in the morning and clean the crystals the customers come first increase every sale keep the back organized, make sure I was up to date in my training, the coworkers were very friendly and helpful the most enjoyable part of the job was the customer satisfaction."
good,"Good work place, but management was terrible.  There is room to move up and make decent money but like I said management ruined the experience for me."
good,"Enjoyed working with customers as well as employees. Easy sales, made easy money,"
good,"A typical day consists of making sure the store appearance is ready for customers, provide customer service, maintaining a clean stock room, up-selling, closing sales, working as a team, and doing it all over again. I learned how to talk to customers and find out what they need. The management was pretty helpful. There is a lot of opportunity to advance. The co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was trying on the new products."
good,Open up store clock in make sure the store is clean for when customers would walk in. Greet each and every customer and ask do they need assistants with finding anything. I learned at this job how you have to keep your personal emotions away from the job atmosphere because that can interfere with the cohesiveness within the staff. The most enjoyable part about this job would be working with a small group of people and knowing everyone to where you become a small family
good,A typical day at work requires great customer service and knowlege of shoes. I learned what SKU numbers were and how to use a cash register. My co-workers were well mannered hard working sales people. The most difficult part of the job was pricing merchandise. The part of the job that was most enjoyed was selling shoes.
good,"Most of the time, excluding the summer months(very slow, few calls per hour), the average shift is filled with calls. One 15 minute beak for every 3 hours. No cell phone use allowed. Management was very nice. Scheduling is extremely flexible as long as you meet 15 hrs per week"
good,The one thing that was hard about the job is that you had to climb ladders to get a pair of shoes. Overall it’s a good job for teenagers for a first job
good,"With the customer service pushed here, you get to know the customers and end up feeling good about helping them out, and just talking to them. A lot of times you'll get sneaker heads who come in and just talk about the product with you and go back and forth on what shoes you like and are in to. Individual goals are set so you feel very accomplished when you hit them. Great Team overall as well."
good,"Footlocker would've been the best place to work but the pay and commission cap was very little. But, the hours are flexible and management was good and helps are employees."
good,Fun environment they love associates who want to move up in the company. Training can be better. Your work hours vary based on your selling skills if you have what it takes to be motivated and sell sell sell this is the job for you!

good,Kids foot locker was an exciting atmosphere to work in the quick fast pace team work you had to some time on those busy days really made it a fun the supervisors are nice and very energetic I would recommend this job to a lot of young people
good,"commissions for employees working the floor is valued at 1% which, what i believe,  is way too low to be worth anything especially when business is slow ."
good,"This company has great benefits, great sales associates, and an overall fun experience if led by the correct person. I find that there needs to be lots of communication between the managers. At least where I and several other part-timers don't know how to do things that are important for the store to thrive."
good,good place to work with amazing colleagues. Very diverse and accepts everyone. Fast paced and exciting environment to work in. Its a fun place to work
good,"It was a good environment to work don't get me wrong. However the hours and the pay were really really awful, I would only be getting one to two days a week just to stock. I was making no money busting my tail for the company."
good,Footlocker is a fun place to work depending on the management and location. The location determines the kind of customers  will encounter and sometimes they can be very rude and demanding. The management determines how relaxed and fun the environment can be as well as the associates. They make and break your day including the tuff days. Most associates are fun and welcoming as well as managers
good,"Footlocker is a wonderful yo job if your not anti social and you love to meet new people let them know how close looks and fit on them, the benefits on shoes and close are amazing with the discount they give you as an employee"

good,Foot locker is a nice place to work. You learn many new things and you get to meet a lot of different types of people. You assist with finding the product that they need and want.
good,"I would open the store. Opening the store consist of putting my combo in to open the store. I would also print out paperwork for the day and week daily. I would make sure product is out and properly set up for customers. I would check inventory some days, shipment, work on stock, or even work on paperwork. I watch the floor and help customers to the best of my abilities. I would manage a staff and make sure goals are reached and everything was in place."
good,"Its a great company to work for , it was just unorganized and stressful on me while im going to school...my job was on the line everyday"
good,"Must work forty five hour in a five day work week , you have a busy day with paperwork customer service making sure store is set to standard and handle all shippment ."
good,working days are hard but its an active job where its sports shop. learnt a lot with stock taking and counting and etc. worked in a bigger team than excpeted. management was good kept everything on top. beat our christmas sales from the other shops
good,"Great workers, everyone was happy to come in to work. best part of the day was seeing all the happy faces and being able to see the kids smile"
good,Great job to have if your in high school or college. If your into shoes this job will take your paychecks right back if your careful how you spend
good,"A typical day at work for me is signing in and getting straight to work, it takes my boss at least three seconds until she gives an order. I usually speak to everyone in the store and quickly tend to the customer, go retrieve whatever they need so we can get them in and out. Fixing the walls in the store, assorting our apparel and updating the wall of shoes."
good,"Sales and customer service driven company. Management team was allowed to manage specific metrics to achieve sales results. Co workers were often younger and lacked long term goals."
good,"A typical day at footlocker required working and communicating with a team as well as communicating with customers, keeping the stock room neat and clean, taking out trash, cleaning the store. The job taught me a lot about new sneakers and sneaker products, what cleaners are best suitable for certain types of shoes. Management changed multiple times in the year that i was there but two of three managers were the best that you could ask for. The hardest part of the job was probably cleaning before closing. The job was more fun and easy than probably anything i could've asked for but as a part-time employee the pay wasn't too good."
good,"handle nightly deposits, cashier, shipments, assist training for co workers,"
good,Greeting customers and helping them with sneakers and apparel and also doing foot measuring. I learned great customer service here and how to sell and reach store goals. My managers are great and i enjoy working with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job would be trying to reach your store goal when it is a slow day. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the discounts and when new sneakers come out.
good,"Excellente ambiance de travail, personnel dynamique et sérieux dans les objectifs à faire quotidiennement."
good,"Foot Locker is a good company to work for in the multi-brand retail category. You are exposed to brands that cater to a different consumer, and you get to work with leading global brands."
good,Very hands-on. Fast-paced. Fun work environment. Easy learning. Great benefits and staff members. Good communication and listening skills. Hardest part of the job is working and balancing life.
good,It is a great starter job. if it your first job it is good to make friends and interact with people. But when it comes done to pay its not really that good. You get a low hourly pay rate and then the commission is not that good. Plus on top of that you cant really have a lot of hours if you are just starting to work. But other then that it is a great job if it is your first taste in the work field.
good,Each day that I went to work was exciting because I enjoyed my co workers and the management at the store. It was good practice for talking to new people because there was always someone in the store who discussed their likes and dislikes for which shoes they wanted.
good,I would like to work at Footlocker because I think it's a good business and I think i can fit in the business. I also like footlocker because I like to help other's when they need it so they can feel a little appreciative.
good,"Very easy, providing customers with the items they were searching for. "
good,It was pretty nice. Very competitive but after you get on a roll and have a friendly personality you will be selling a lot of shoes!
good,"its a nice job and great i thought more would come. they ended up over hiring and now i haven't worked in over 2 months i still have the job but ""theres no hours"" the supervisor says."
good,You get to communicate with kids and their parents about their needs and the feeling of satisfaction when you help them out with the right pair of shoes is extravagant!
good,"Received and processed cash and credit payments for in-store purchases. Opened and closed the store- including counting cash, opening and closing cash registers, and creating staff assignments. Placed special merchandise orders for customers. Created strategies to develop and expand existing customer sales, which resulted in a 20% increase in monthly sales. Shared product knowledge with customers while making personal recommendations. Demonstrated that customers come first by serving them with a sense of urgency. Maintained friendly and professional customer interactions."
good,"I learned a lot with footlocker. They gave me the basic skills of customer service. I also learned a lot about all the shoes we sold. To this day, I still know shoes like no other. Managers are usually awesome and will work with any schedule you give them. The employees are usually great too. The only hardest thing that footlocker has to offer is doing a lot of work but getting paid so little. You literally are everything. You're the janitor, the sales associate, the cashier, you're just about everything in that job. The cool part is that you meet many amazing people, the bad part, they know your life. Everyone gossips."
good,"Get to meet people and the company always looks to promote from within. Flexibility in hours as well. There is a lot of teamwork involved especially around the holidays and back to school, which are the busiest and most stressful times of the year."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of assisting customers with items they are searching for, handling transactions with currency and credit and effectively doing returns and exchanges."
good,"I love my job the pay just isn't good. I'm a college student with a illness, so I do have medical bills and it's hard to manage all of those thing with my pay"
good,personally footlocker is a wonderful job learning new techniques. Everyday learning how to reach out to customers a help them find what they are looking for. The management team is very helpful in tough situation they always look forward to help. All of our employees are from different areas so the environment and atmospheres is very positive.
good,Stay focus on me and do what I need to do do what I need to do different things customers for them and make sure it's okay making sure I get the customer's icon track and say thank you for shopping at this store have a wonderful coming in
good,"The atmosphere was great, I felt as if it was designed for me to thrive. I was able to excel and advance rather quickly."
good,"My overall experience at foot locker was amazing the customers were friendly however it was slow on certain days , I learned a lot more about shoes since working there and all the other accessories that comes with them. Management was great and I got along with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was being part-time and not being able to ring up my own customers so a lot of my sales were sold by a co-worker, the wages were great for the time I worked there. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we would have slow days and we just talk, laugh, and work. Also interacting with customers and sharing my insight on shoes and clothing."
good,"Es una empresa que se caracteriza por el companerismo de sus empleados y su excelente calidad hacia el cliente. Es una tienda ubicada en caguas la cual hay distintas tiendas de la empresa a nivel Isla. Sus gerentes son excelentes, dedicados y en ocaciones bastante  flexibles, ya sea con empleados que estudian o tienen alguna situacion personal. Lo que mas me gusta de ese trabajo es interactuar con los clientes, cubrirles sus necesidades de acuerdo a lo que buscan y necesitan, la mejor parte es como se van satisfechos y vuelven en busca de ti para que le des tu mejor servicio. Para mi no ha sido nada dificil si tengo lo que el cliente necesecita buscamos otras opciones para que asi se pueda ir satisfecho."
good,"Good job, great management just the pay isn't good at all but is good if your in school. Great discount for you and your family only downfall you can't use it on everything only certain things."
good,A typical day here is just sitting around waiting for someone to walk due to no high volume of customers it makes the place very boring and yo get little hours but the people there are great the time will pace on its on as you guys find things to do around the store and the benefits are also great.
good,"Un trabajo en equipo estupendo, con los mejores compañeros posibles, ofreciendo al cliente todo lo que necesita y creando un espacio en el que el consumidor se siente cómodo."
good,"It was a good job, I would have liked to learn more but management did not teach us."
good,"Performed all cashier functions, including"
good,"selling shoes and helping the customers. helping with insoles and shoe care, making sure i get the right for the customer."
good,"Ensured that each customer received exceptional service by providing a  friendly environment, which included the acknowledgement of each  customer and  solid product knowledge. The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to assist customers in choosing the best products for themselves. Being able to look at a individuals foot and tell the size of their shoe and the pleasing them by leaving them with a great impression."
good,This job got me on my feet after high school.  If you sell a lot then your check will be reasonable. Pay sucks. They don’t do raises. Overall great job.  Need more. Perks.
good,Store managers and team members really make the job what it is...fun competitive and culture based. But all district managers do is break you down give no credit and get upset if you don't help them bonus
good,"The compensation  for this job is poor.  Paid hourly rate is  "
good,The store is not kept up unless associates clean and straighten up the store. We recently hired new management and it is not the best and is the reason why I do not desire to work there any longer.
good,Foot locker is an easy job especially if you love being around people ..
good,"A day at work consist of assisting customers, organizing the stock room, and making sure the store is clean. I learned to work as a team and interact with various people. The management is very encouraging and they motivate their workers to do better. The hardest part about my job is trying to satisfy a customer that is unimpressed by the products we have to offer. The most enjoyable aspect of my job is being around people and having access to the latest sneakers."
good,I met some nice people there who became friends. It was really relaxed. I saw our district manager get let go because she was really close to retirement and I'm assuming she was let go because Foot Locker did not want to pay her.
good,"They dont know how to hire effective managers, and they support favoritism among managers and employees. They will not schedule you if they dont like you."
good,Foot locker is a nice work place where u can sale and have conversations with customers and learn from your co workers about different things good place working at but pay not good
good,"Accurately processing monetary transactions for the store, assisting customers, monitor and record shipments, and solve problems in a professional tone."
good,"the management was not the best, but the people who worked there as well made it fun."
good,"If you are planning to work at footlocker as a part time employee then be prepared to get 6-8 hours a week. You are making little to nothing working at footlocker and no you don't get commission. Everyone is stuck up and thinks there cool because they sell $300 dollar shoes which is basically everyones pay check anyway. Management does not train you properly, your only benefit is the amazing friendly customers and 30% all merchandise with a limit of $500 a month."
good,"Depending on the store type or type of year, it can be very busy place to work"
good,"A job that helped me get through nursing school. Fun work environment, able to compete for sales and become very knowledgeable with the merchandise and perfecting customer service."
good,I enjoy being able to work at Foot Locker while I was in college. I got a chance to meet lots of people while being able to learn in the process. I worked with a freat team that was able to teach me new thing and open to answering any question I had. The hardest part of the job was making sure that I learned all the new products that was coming out. I enjoy most about my position at Foot Locker would be  getting experiance in a area that I want to work in.
good,Footlocker is a great company however the can certainly afford to pay the employees a little more than they do. I did enjoy working for this company.
good,Great place to work. Job advancement. Goal driven. Integrity. Honesty. Team building. Visual Managers. Fast pace and high volume stores. Commission based and hourly pay.
good,A typical day in footlocker you would provide the best customer service. I learned how to communicate with people in a professional setting. Management was decent for the most part. The co-workers I worked with took their job very serious and provided excellent team work. The hardest part about the job is getting the customers exactly what they want. The thing I enjoyed the most was interacting with different people everyday.
good,"i did stocking which was really cool i got to learn how to use the computer programs and a scan gun. Also being a sales associate taught me people skill like how to talk to people, approach people, and greet people that were coming into the store during my shifts."
good,love this company. The dm is very helpful. i will recommend this job to a friend
good,nice kicks show you how to hunt for sales on a day to  day basis pay isnt all that great but nice discounts on shoes
good,I was a sales representative/ cashier for this corporation. Working with wonderful sales people and tending to all of the customers needs.
good,"It was difficult to get a full time position. I was a cashier, but was still expected to make sales that I did NOT get paid commission for. Impossible to get a weekend off."
good,"Good experience, increases people skills and helps build confidence. This job also taught me responsibility, make it to work on time, finish what you started, etc."
good,"prima personale esperienza lavorativa, contratto da stagista con salario non congruo ad ore effettive di lavoro.Gestione del personale discreta,colleghi simpatici e con i quali era piacevole lavorare.Peccato non aver avuto il rinnovo contrattuale a causa della politica aziendale di perenne rinnovamento del personale."
good,Great and chill place to work. It's best if you have some knowledge about the products if you're wanting to work here. You get paid weekly. The salary isn't so great.
good,FootLocker was a good plaxe to work as a high schooler and i get older and look for better opportunities they don’t help much. loved the discount benefit but as i said getting older need a better job choice to support myself.
good,Great place to work although I worked part-time to make extra money. Cutting sausage in temperatures as low as 30 degrees was very challenging but I love my job and my coworkers.
good,Here I found it straightforward getting used to the nature of the job. Management was poor and there wasnt enough workers to keep the shop running at the standard that a footlocker should be run at.
good,"As a sales associate for two years working in a mall location can have its ups and downs. You get paid hourly or commission depending on your location. The more shoes you sell the higher the pay check, it is also very competitive when working you have to check other associates because they might try to steal your sales."
good,"•	Managed multiple customers"
good,"sell sneakers and apparel to customers. I learned that working here makes you competative to gain sales. Its fun to work here, the workplace is enjoyable."
good,"fast paced, chill workplace. very competitive, fun and outgoing. but would recommend to young students in high school if you are looking for a fun job."
good,Mi experiencia en Foot Locker fue grata ya que aprendí a trabajar en equipo y bajo presión y personalmente el rápido ritmo de trabajo me gusta ya que soy una persona activa.
good,The management team makes all the difference. I loved my job the first 5 years but the last year there was a management change and people began quitting like flies. As a manger there is no work life balance.
good,"Footlocker over all was a great work environment, fast pace. I learned alot more about shoes, how to inventory. My coworkers were easy to get along with, we all helped each other better ourselves as well as our store. most difficult part was probably when it was slow and we needed to hit a certain number of sales on socks or such shoes items."
good,"Most of my day consisted of working sales floor, helping customers giving them exceptional customer service. I really enjoyed the visual merchandising here. I have learned how to manage my time to get all task done in a timely manner."
good,"I started off as an Assistant Manger in 2001, and the next year was promoted to my own store (Moreno Valley) then a few years took an offer to take over Temecula, CA. We took that store over 1 million dollars the first time in its history.  For the amount that you work and the hours and the holidays etc, 17 bucks an hour was really not enough.  Great experience, learned a lot, met some great people-who I am still friends with!  But the hours, work-load, and demand is slightly underpaid.  LFL will always have a place in my heart... After all I was the Grand Prize Car Winner in 2004 ;-)"
good,"This company has truly allowed me to focus on my strengths and to see the opportunity in anything. The hardest part was getting recognized everywhere you go, everyone would ask me if I was a referee."
good,multinazionale dove considera solo i numeri e tratta i dipendenti come dei numeri non esistono sabati e domeniche libere si lavora con turni assurdi
good,"I've had two previous jobs working as a cashier, the thing about being used to it is helpful at my job."
good,I enjoy working with my co workers we got the job done but had productive days at work.
good,"Each day consisted of reviewing emails and reports, separating and filing. I would watch over and lead sales. Inventory control in shipping and receiving and theft prevention. Occasionally business would allow for me to train other associates. The hardest part of the job was finding time to effectively train associates per company standard on a VERY limited hours alottment. The most enjoyable was working with the merchandise."
good,"Greeting customers, sizing their feet, build up sales, learned how receive shipment, checking and scanning inventory, hardest job was meeting certain goals, the most enjoyable was being around sneakers that people use for different reasons and learning from the customers"
good,"It was very competative, but intersting. I learned a management that you got to make sure you are not bring home life into work life. My co-workers they were mostly honest working people. The hardest part of the job was that I couldn't get the manager to teach the code numbers of the shoes so that I could sell shoes and get more money. The part I enjoyed about this job is that I met new people each day."
good,"My typical day at work consists of maintaning the stores appearance, ringing up customers providing excellent customer service, keeping the stock room clean and organized to ensure items will be sold and not misplaced."
good,I really enjoyed my seasonal position at Foot Locker.It was a great experience.
good,This is a nice place to work. The people are friendly and management schedules you for the position that you apply for. The discounts also comes in handy.
good,"They start you off with a pay rate of $10.10 you have to make money based of commission, which sucks if you’re new and barley getting hours, however it’s an easy laid back job."
good,Great place to work. Starting to not value employees or recognize employment dedication. I have been there for 12 years since I was 16 and grew up there. Will always be special to me
good,At Foot Locker you encounter all different types of people. You get a chance all age groups and genders. You represent the current and latest fashions. It’s fun to be able to see the product before it hits the shelf.
good,"This job is great and ideal for kids in high school. The management positions take away from your pets life, especially during the holidays. If you’re a family first person footlocker would not be my first choice"
good,This was a good job for students like myself at the time that needed work and flexibility. Was able to balance school and working sometimes despite the late nights.
good,"ottima azienda, grande palestra di apprendimento, lavoro stimolante"
good,should pay a little bit more and part timers should be able to get more hours to work in order to accomplish a certain goal also the commission is not much even thou our sales are a big amount still we are just benefiting the company
good,hardest part of the job is when they hire from the outside instead of within. the employees make working here fun. management needs to be looked into they show favoritism to certain employees.
good,"I have to approach the customer in order to make a sale, I was taught how to use the till for the beginning and end of the day as well as cashing up.  "
good,"Although footlocker was a fun place to work during the first year, I came to realize that management definitely needs some work because they were inconsiderate regarding how long the employees stayed at work after closing hours. Also, we very rarely received breaks during our shifts."
good,"great  place to work and build character. Management was reasonable, the hardest part of the job was working short on holidays not having that extra hand will be a lot of work.  The fun part is your get to meet new people everyday"
good,"En esta empresa aprendi a poder solicializar y atender las necesidades de los clientes y darle el servicio segun su necesidad, siempre dandole lo mejor de mi para que el cliente se sienta comodo."
good,It's a nice job to have while in school or for the summer the chance to network with people from all over the world is pretty unique within its self..
good,I found Footlocker to be aesthetically pleasing to work at but that was at first. After a while of training with them (which isn’t so hard)  members of staff would complain for the slightest of reasons & then start back biting ESPECIALLY towards the manager which lead to poor vibes amongst the team also having to stay back for house keeping was awful this only led to trains being missed tempers flaring etc BUT over all you do meet some really nice people whilst working there which builds networking & communication skills & that’s what you need in life to continue your journey regardless with or without footlocker. Overall 4/10
good,"They’re are some perks & benefits to the job, honestly. But I just feel like the pay is not adequate. The hours could be better as well as the hourly pay rate."
good,"I use to open the store with my manager and an other colleague , in the early morning which is the most quieter part of the day we use to tidy the store and double check if everything was ok ."
good,"very demanding, especially around the holidays. fast paced environment, lots of standing and walking and sometimes running, lots of people to pay attention to."
good,I would come into work and clock in and go on the sales floor and engage with the customer and answering questions and i would stock and organizing shelves.
good,"sa se passer bien les collègues étaient agréable et  sympa avec tout le monde, le patron était super gentille avec les employé."
good,"going to work never felt like work the manager was always throwing things around yelling and making jokes, he sometimes could come off as inappropriate, however the work load itself was not hard, if you can remember 100+ 7-digit number codes"
good,I loved working in the footwear industry but mall retail isn't for everyone.  Long hours and long weeks with little to no time for family eventually wears you down. Work/life balance is non existent with this companies demanding work schedule.
good,"Not a bad place to work for someone starting out. Decent evening hours, friendly people. I wished there was full time. Sometimes you get sketchy customers that pull stunts that they shouldnt"
good,"A typical day included organizing the merchandise, dealing with the customers in a professional manner, and trying to increase sales as much as possible. The culture was relaxed but firm about prioritizing sales.  The friendly management created a great environment."
good,"Great company, fun environment. The upper level management is making strides to be even more competitive than they already are. They are making all the right steps to utilize technology to it's fullest potential. I would definitely recommend a position with this company, if you are an IT professional."
good,"As a manager of a retail store, the hours don't match the compensation! Truly enjoy interacting with the customers but there is little room to move up in the Indy market."
good,"can be very stressful at times "
good,Store manager level and up are only the true breadwinners in this field. Work demand and load is too much for very little pay that is commision based.
good,"Working at footlocker kept me busy. It is very busy although it has its pros and cons. They give very few hours per week, concerning the fact that we get paid biweekly."
good,"Good part time job to have on the side or while you're in school. Management is awesome and understanding. You may not get too many hours, but during holidays you get more than enough hours. The people are friendly and welcoming. It's really just a great atmosphere."
good,"Very busy retail setting . As a store manager, there was a strong requirement to meet goals set daily. Customer service was of most importance. Keeping a good reliable staff was key to running a great store. Maintaining product knowledge and keeping a clean friendly store helped to make it a memorable experience for everyone. The hardest part was during the holidays and the extended hours. The most enjoyable part was having return customers due to the experience they had with my team."
good,The employees were more of a family. Learned a lot about customer service and how to manage inventory. Increased the ability to work under pressure.
good,"This job was interesting. I think it is the ideal job for a high school student or a college kid looking for part time work, but the lack of advancement opportunities makes the job hard to stay on for a lengthy amount of time."
good,"Footlocker is a truly great place to work! Its fun and the management is good! Everyday you acquire skills needed to make sales and transactions which will help you with the job and any future jobs requiring sales. Unfortunately the low pay and low commission means you don't feel rewarded for giving the job your all. 1% commission isn't enough to conduct a monthly life out of as you can make footlocker a grand total of $3,000 but only get $30 back while only being paid $5.15 commission based wage. Lastly the only real pros is a 30% off footlocker card on merchandise but you find yourself purchasing to many things with your low pay as i didn't."
good,hours werent that great and neither was the pay.discounts were great
good,"It is an extremely interesting place to work, no day is the same."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with the customers and going out of my way to exceed their expectations. Also seeing the employees learn and grow. I have learned of to lead a team effectively. The hardest part of the job is the hours.
good,Footlocker is a place where you can continue to grow and learn more things
good,Some managers need to learn how to manage their personal emotions and work.
good,"This was my first job, and I was 16 at the time so any money was enough for me. I was a cashier there for a year and a half, made minimum wage, and was never given a raise. The only thing that made the job worthwhile was my coworkers, and the discounts on sneakers. Everyone got along and had fun all while working. A great first-job experience."
good,The hours are bad unless you are in a mall store or are an excellent seller despite the economic times. Upward movement in the company is possible but you have to work for it. The pay is not all that great either. You couldn't live off of it if you needed to. You'd need a roommate.
good,stocking
good,"Once I updated my staff with their sales goals from the day, along with the new promotions of the day, I would prepare the sales floor with the proper replenishment that was needed and encourage them to have fun and make sure each customer left with a unforgettable experience."
good,Pretty good job don't get very many hours though . Slow pace just kind of want a more manly job that requires more  Work and better pay definitely more hours
good,"Great place to work, a little hectic during busy periods. Commission scheme is good, maybe a little low for the workload and amount of sales needed to be made for a good rate of monthly commission. Progression can be quite slow if you're looking to work your way up in the company. An ideal first job or part time job whilst studying as it's a fun environment to work with when you have a good team instore."
good,"This place is competitive, you have to have good sales and know what to do to ensure you get a fair amount of hours. Overall I love the job because I am passionate about clothes and shoes."

good,Work atmosphere is great. Pay is based on performance which isn’t always a bad thing but also isn’t good. Those slow days do happen. Other then the slow days Foot Locker is a fantastic place. Would recommend to anyone who is looking for a part time job
good,Footlocker is a perfect place to work if you have an interest in street wear and culture. It's an excellent opportunity to learn about current trends and there is good opportunity for career progression
good,The manager at the time was not very good in my opinion. I was not given very good training in terms of how the store was operated. I was expected to make huge sales when the store was the slowest
good,"Horaire mal faite"

good,"If you like working in Retail, then Foot Locker would be a pretty good place for you to work at."
good,"Footlocker is definetly more of a fast paced job, you need to be able to juggle doing more than one thing at a time. Depending on your coworkers it could also be a very fun job, and the discounts are great but be ready for major holidays like Christmas and Back to School ."
good,"Ive enjoyed the two years i’ve worked for the company our environment is friendly, fun and ambitious. We love what we do customer service comes easily to us."
good,In my experience the management team was lazy. They would make the sales representatives do most of the work regardless of current load. Worked well with students.
good,Was a laid back environment.  Easy going manager.  Paided bi weekly. Had a good crew. Drama free.  Wasn’t to high of volume.  Inventory was well kept up
good,a typlical day at footlocker is nothing more then sales. if you could have 60 to sells someone a shoe or items could you do it. the hardest part way not getting paid enough when i know i could be paid more. what i learned at footlocker is everyone that walks through the door is someone different and to be on a person good side is better then not.
good,"I worked for Foot Locker for over 30 years.  They advertise holiday pay, however, come to find out, they never pay managers for holidays.  So, I asked FEP and was basically ignored or handed off to another department that has no idea how managers get paid."
good,A typical day at work would just be helping customers out and trying to reach your goals. I learned a lot at foot locker mainly how many different cultures share a common like.  Management at my store is excellent.  The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with so many people in such a fast paste at times.  The Most enjoyable would be how many good people you meet.
good,"Very Passion driven culture. The work environment was very fast paced, but at the same time very welcoming. A lot of the employees there were very friendly."
good,"fue un verano que necesitaba pagarme unas clases particulares, fue agradable aunque pagaban muy poco para tantas horas."

good,At this job you get to see different sides of people .. you get to know what they are really into & you can tell what kind of person they are just by the stuff that they like. Sometimes this job is very competitive but also fun at the same time.
good,"Acted as the product line manager in a team of three to design two limited edition ASICS lifestyle sneakers exclusively distributed through Foot Locker in partnership with PENSOLE Academy."
good,"Not much to say. The management was iffy and the pay isn’t great there. The discount is kinda enticing to stay. Smooth, intuitive environment with good co workers"
good,"it was always different, fast paced and always meeting new customers. meeting sales goals was always a challenge but also very fun. Being able to meet enthusiast that share the same passion as you was also nice."
good,"Drive a machine, move pallets, throw boxes on a line, make labels for boxes to ship, stack boxes in a trailer or unload a trailer. Help out other departments when needed."
good,This job is perfect for someone who is young and wants to get some work experience. This company is filed with young people who enjoy working and learning how to do sales. Not much room for growth to the corporate level.
good,I had fun when I first started working there. then it just went down hill and I didn't get good hours for the job title I had. I really liked the part time girls but not so much the manager. He definitely had his favorites.
good,fun workplace if you a sneaker fan then this is your dream job very fast pace rude customers not much security dangerous release day sales great selections globally known brand good customer service great workers horrible managers great discounts for employees  uniform is like gym clothing so it comfortable (sneakers and yoga pants or stretchy slacks)
good,"Selling shoes,clothing and footwear related merchandise. Inventory management, and stocking.  Finding the right product to fit customer need and satisfaction."
good,Cool job. Did it on the side during the holiday season for some extra cash. Easily the best retail job I have ever had due to the fact that you earn commision on sales you  make. That motivated to me provide the best customer services possible because I wanted to make that sale and I wanted the customer to purchase as much stuff as possible. Sweet place to work.
good,There is always a productive day a footlocker. The environment is always a good place to be and also also gives the customer the atmosphere they deserve.
good,"Working at Foot Locker as long as I have it has taught that an opportunity is yours the taking,it has no one persons name written on it. Patient and active listening; I am definitely glad I had the opportunity to work for this company and be able to work with a few great people who pushed be to want to go and do and be great if not here then where every life takes me. Yes there were a few things I believe are not ethical in that environment but business does not function on ethics."
good,"It was fine at first but then after getting over the ""I got a job"" phase you start to realize that it's not all that great. The co workers were impatient and the managers just talked all day. The schedules were last minute and slim and pay wasn't the best. The overall atmosphere was great though it just wasn't for me."
good,you need to be able to multitask and stay calm when its very busy. I learned a lot of patience and how to accurately count money quickly and make sure every customer is satisfied.
good,"Typical day for me was come in set up the store, drive sales, run stock, paperwork, make schedules, recruit and train employees, close the store at night. "
good,Your experience will solely be based on your direct store managers. I transferred stores and the atmosphere was completely different from store to store due to leadership.

Although we work with customer by helping them it is our job to also keep the store clean and tight for our safety and the customer. in order to run a successful we need a team of responsible and respectful motivated indivisuals  so we can reach and surpass out quota for the day, week, year and month."
good,"Fun environment if you like to sell. Very laid back, though you have to meet your daily goals, and push additional merchandise. Pay is commissioned based, so you really have to work for your money."
good,"Acquisizione competenze in ambito delle vendite e gestionale, scarsa professionalità dello store manager nella gestione dei nuovi assunti."

I push to make the work environment a place where my employees want to work as a team and all get along. I teach my employees that customers are always right and always make yourself memorable.

I learned how to be a well rounded leader at footlocker."

good,"Start the day writing goals for the store and associates. Selling merchandise per company guidelines. I learned how to write a schedule, train, interview, merchandise, and do inventory. The management depending on where you work is cool, other places are horrible. The hardest part f the job was dealing with some of the store mangers attitudes and the district manager that believes in the ""old boys"" way of networking. The best part of my job was helping the customers and just the overall customer interactions."
good,"Responsible for training footlocker's best and brightest into future executives, through career guidance and coaching."

good,"The manager of the foot locker Inc in the USF Tampa area was great. He preached team work, hard work, and customer service. This was a great learning experience and a great way for me to get in the work force after college."
good,"I worked for Foot Locker for over 2 years as a part time sales associate. When I began there, it was one of the best experiences I could ask for. I obtained great knowledge in footwear, along with dealing with customers in many different ways. I learned the importance of independent working and much more. Management was phenomenal when I first began there, when that manager got a promotion, we obtained another manager. He was also a good manager but not comparable to the recent one due to completely different work ethics, and goals. Nonetheless, a great manager just in a different way. The hardest part of the job would be working to please every customer when not having the product to do so. The most enjoyable aspect, on the other hand were the people I worked with along with the reasonable hours."
good,Here at Footlocker I learned how to organize and stock shelves. Its was a very tedious process but I was able to handle it. The management was excellent. They worked right along side of us. The hardest part was maintaining an organized and clean stock room. The most enjoyable part was looking at my hard work when finished.
good,Awesome place to teach and develop up and coming talent. Future leaders in the retail industry that will always work hard to achieve personal and corporate goals.
good,"On a typical week day, your mornings can be slow, but give you ample opportunity to make sure the customer is being shown everything from shoes to clothing. I've personally learned that it is necessary tone able to work in a fast paced environment and be able to hold multiple customers at once. Always keep the customer happy. My co-workers and I have always gotten along but there can always be some tension in a sales based of employment, especially when you make almost minimum wage and receive commission. Hardest part would probably be the holidays due to the hours being strung out everywhere and not being able to truly spend time with family during the holidays. I love Foot Locker and what the company stands for, and I love being able to truly help the customer make sure that they are extremely happy with each decision they make. Overall, the company is an AMAZING company to work for. I do, however, believe that their are somethings that could change to make it a little bit more enjoyable."
good,"A typical day at footlocker would be me helping people figure out what shoe they would like to buy. Management is okay at my workplace. All of my co-workers are great to get along with, there always fun to work with."

good,"Lavoravo con un contratto ad oraio full time compresi weekand con un giorno settimanale di pausa ed ogni giorno ero presente o in apertura negozio oppure in chiusura. Nell' uno o nell'altro caso mi preoccupavo che le vetrine e il negozio fossero in ordine e ben pulite, sucessessivamente mi dedicavo alla clientela formata da un elevato flusso di persone, nei momenti più tranquilli mi accostavo per occuparmi della merce in arrivo piuttosto che del riordinamento del magazzino oppure di chiamare i clienti che avevano ordinato prodotti esauriti o non presenti in sede. Durante la giornata mi veniva concessa un ora di pausa dove mi svagavo e pranzavo con i colleghi di lavoro aggiornandoci anche sulle vendite effettuate. I colleghi erano molto disponibili e socevoli ma sapevano essere degli ottimi rivali nell vendita. L'ambiente era molto socievole e gratificante, anche se molto frenetico alle volte per il fatto che avevamo due magazzini fra cui uno nei sotterranei auchan che ti portava a fare delle continue corse per non far attendere troppo il cliente che avrebbe potuto stancarsi. In conclusione posso dire di aver svolto un lavoro che richiedeva molte energie a al contempo che mi ha insegnato a comportarmi in modi diversi difronte a diverse personalità delle persone."
good,"A typical day at work include checking emails, filing reports, driving sales, training associates, visual merchandising, cus"
good,"Some days at Kids Footlocker it could be extremely slow to the point you wouldn't make any sales. The customers weren't always rude but somedays are better than others. The co workers were very competitive to the point they would try to get others fired. I stayed away from gossip if your not round or don't intervene in the conversations they can't say much. i felt the manager was sexes, but besides all that it was a very fun place to work. It's always something to laugh about. Stocking, cashier, apparel, and registering customers for VIP cards was a everyday thing. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the kids finds shoes."
good,"great environment/too little pay/great work pace, the management was unprofessional."
good,Foot Locker in Times Square was a fun experience. It was a fast paced environment. The managers were friendly. The best part of each day was helping the tourist customers. I learned the importance of store maintenance and stocking goods. I had fun getting to know other employees from other Foot Locker locations such as the soho store & 34st Street store. I had the opportunity to help in the warehouse as well.
good,"Relaxed and stress free work place"
good,"A typical day at Foot Locker would start with a random uniform check done by me and one of my Store Detectives. I would then begin my daily check of the entire store, watching for any safety/fire hazards. After, depending on the day, I would begin making the schedule for the coming week, if not I would get out on the sales floor and try to catch a shoplifter or 2 with my security of 12. I am a strong believer of leading by example, so if I, the Loss Prevention Manager, am on the sales floor catching shoplifters then there is no reason that my guard or store detective can't do the same. My manager was one of the best managers I've ever had. He knew everything and wasn't afraid to share his knowledge about the job. My co-workers were more like family. I was in Foot Locker so much, it was almost like my home. I learned a lot of business politics in Foot Locker. The hardest part of the job was all the brawls we would have to be involved in due to the high theft activity. The most enjoyable part of my job, around that time, was looking for shoplifters, apprehending them, and processing them."
good,ok good way to network but the job can be very time consuming good enviornment
good,"A typical day here could be extremely busy or slow. But when it is slow there is always something to do. Whether it's shipping out merchandise, receiving shipment, and/or restocking, etc. I've learned a lot working with this company over the last 12 years. The most enjoyable part of my current job is getting to help new people. The hardest part is keeping good workers."
good,"I've learned from my store manager at Footlocker what it means to be persistent at work. Which includes selling, customer service, greeting and meeting customers and friends."
good,Arrive on time. How to respect customers. I was apart of management so I treated everyone fairly. Co-workers were very helpful. Not getting the right shoe. networking.
good,"-very fun but very stressful"
good,"Everyday I went in trying to increase my sales production. I learned how to engage with customers more often. Management was very motivated in getting their associates to better themselves on the sales floor. The co-workers all got along with each other, always tried to uplift each other. There wasn't really a hard part of the job. Most enjoyable was being able to help customers to pick out the right products."
good,"Coworkers help to make work enjoyable. Manager was involved in embesselment suit shortly after I started working,"
good,"Foot Locker was a great place to work at during my 5 1/2 years while working there i obtained several salesmanship awards labeled as ""Hero Coins"" awards as well an in depth approach to customer service.Some of the managers are extremely smart and dedicated to there jobs and to their respective stores.It is very possible that you can meet a celebrity at any day and time and the enviorment is fun filled but focused.The only concern of mines while with the company was moving up the chain of command.Alot of times not just I but several other associates more qualified than I never rose up the ladder due to favortism or flat out lack of efficient training."
good,"Not a bad place to work if its your first job, or still in school."
good,one of the most enjoyable part of working at footlocker was my co workers we had some fun times

good,working for lady footlocker taught me alot like working with people and communication which is very important.
good,Dealing with different customers 8 hours throughout one day. I’ve learned on how to ex’s land my vocabulary with different cultures. Management was very strict on positivity. They care more personally about your background. Hardest part was upset customers. It’s hard to give someone something that’s out your way of pay and profession. But lastly the enjoyable part was having all employees working and we were having lots a laughs and fun.
good,"Foot locker, conpany conosciuta in tutto il mondo e famosissima per la vendita di articoli sportivi ho iniziato qui la mia prima avventura lavorativa, è un azienda che ti forma tanto, sia lavorativamente parlando ma anche come persona si lavora tanto con il people e non si finisce mai di imparare.

Had experience with a few managers who were unprofessional and discussed employee issues with other employees.
good,If you are still in high school this is the perfect job for you. It’s somewhat of a kickstarter for other jobs in the future. But for others the job may be a little lacking on hours especially for part timers.
good,"learned a lot about customer service, day to day is quite similar. love the culture, made lots of new friends. store managers need working on and better decisions need to be made."
good,It was a good experience especially as a first part time job. Way too competitive with people with store but fine. It was a good vibe and everything but too much sometimes.

Solid sneaker selection, I worked at flagship location I believe we could've got more limited releases.

Not just people who want a cool job with a decent discount."

good,"The day consists of just calling shoes out to a runner through walkie talkie. Helping costumers select shoes and showing them where they are. Answering questions etc, typical retail just sneaker orientated"

good,Foot Locker helped me step into a management role within 30 days of receiving my bachelors in Management. The career advancement is tangible if you are willing to buy into the Foot Locker vision.
good,"I worked part-time and personally my store was good. It had its moments when it was actually enjoyable, other times it was just regular retail work and it was boring and redundant. I was only there for a year and half and that was enough personally. They pay the minimum wage and that doesn't go up, even if you're full-time or an AM I'm pretty sure. It's a good job for high school students or if it's your first job."
good,"I would say I enjoy the place but they did not have much of an open schedule which had caused some conflict for me because I am  very busy person between sports, school, and family."
good,Cool place to work. I enjoyed my years working there especially because of the discount but it simply did not pay enough and did not provide me with enough advancement.
good,ero addetto alla vendita con un contratto part-time
good,It was very fun we all got along and tried out best to greet everyone who came into our store we would most likely switch roles with each other but it was good experience
good,It was an good working environment gave me a new experiments in life to just interact with people & just help them with their needs in my presents of working.
good,"slow and busy "
good,"Very routine workplace, busier stores offer more opportunity."
good,"If you aren't a good salesperson , this isn't the job for you .The job is commission based. I don't recommend this job to people who aren't self motivated."
good,"this company is very flexible when it comes to their staff and keeping them updated on new changes in policy or new merchandise information, this is a very fun uplifting atmosphere"
good,I was in the company for about six months and there was opportunities to move up in the company. I would recommend someone to work at footlocker as a part time job.
good,"Great Company to work for. As I get older I feel that I am outgrowing the company. Benefits are good but they could work on the 401k program. They do not match. Takes a lot of your time. Depending on the DM your vacation may get approved or denied. Fair Employment really isn't that fair in some cases also depending on who your agent is. Discount Program is nice. Working with the people is excellent! You meet so many different people who have so many struggles and over came so many triumphs. Training program is phenomenal and will direct you in a positive way in any career path you decide to take, its a training program that can advance you not only mentally but professionally. Human resources are very knowledgable and get back to you asap."
good,"The employees are really great to each other, everyone comes together to try to achieve one common goal. I always thought that executive leadership was extremely lacking and often very negative when addressing their managers. I believe some of the new executives are doing a great job to change the culture, other executives are what I would call a ""locker room cancer"""
good,very easy and great way to get your first cashier/customer service job. got the change to meet a lot of nice employees that share a love of shoes. learned how to work under pressure and fast pace
good,"Working at foot locker was amazing. I love sneakers and I also love talking to others about sneakers. Fortunately, my love of both things allowed me to sell a lot of sneakers."
good,"Took catalog orders for customers for Eastbay/Footlocker. Handled complaint line for Footlocker customers. Very busy position. Mandatory overtime for Jordan shoe specials.Supervisors were inexperienced, opinionated."
good,"Work is great, I enjoy the pressure when numerous customers ask you for help.  It gives me a sense of responsibility, and encouragement to make them happy.  I like to improve my communication skills and this job definitely helps you with that.  Management was great, our store manager and assistant managers were helpful and laid out a great foundation for us sales associates to follow.  The culture was great because I have a passion for sales and of course sneakers with a lengthy background on the.  Hardest part of the job was not being able to have free time on the weekends, and that wasn't hard for me just time consuming.  The best thing about the job was being able to improve my communication skills, and learn to be more vocal when it came down to it"
good,"A typical day here you help customers with the merchandise and give them options. You learn how to do shipment, whether its shipping out or stocking things in as well as transactions . Nothing about this job is too hard."
good,I had fun working there everyone got along really well. There was never any drama with the co workers or anything else. I would recommend work at footlocker for anyone else.
good,"Great place to work, positive atmosphere. The staff are very welcoming and the day runs smoothly (most times). Good discount for staff and the hours are flexible."
good,"great place to work at as a teen, high paced and always stay on alert .. learned merchandise. fun job, meeting people was great, inventory as well.. took care of good people.. managers are great"
good,"bonne ambiance de travail, horaire flexible, chef d'équipe paternaliste"
good,Footlocker is a great place to work. It is a fun fast environment where you are given the opportunity to advance through a management program. In addition to this you are able to build skills to improve your personal management skills.
good,Ambiente lavorativo molto stimolante e molto dinamico.
good,"Environnement de travail passionnant, avec une ambiance particulière."
good,"foot locker is a good place to work if youre into sneakers, and shoes. If you have no idea what shoes are or what anything sneaker like is then i suggest you dont work there."
good,"Footlocker is great for college students in school looking to also make some extra cash."
good,I started as a part-time associate and was given the opportunity to advance my career internally through the Training and Developing Programs they had in place.
good,"I worked at foot locker to gain experience in sales and that it was good for. I have been working here for going on three years and although it is hard to advance in the company, it is possible."
good,It was a contract position I was hoping to become a full time emplyee but the company was on a hiring freeze. The management team was good to work with.
good,"I enjoyed working with this company as they helped me with my customer service training,  and I will say this good company to start customer service ."
good,i really loved working at Footlocker. the people there were great and i am a absolute fan of basketball and athletic shoes so working there was awesome.
good,"I personally preferred working here on busy days, the environment became toxic for me when I fell ill and was hospitalized for weeks. I came back needing hours to make up on my bills and the management team would not give me the hours i needed. Instead, my hours were dropped."
good,"it's a calm job, but in order to grow you have to kiss a lot butt and wear two faces because some people that work there will scold and belittle you over the most ridiculous things."
good,Fast pace happy work jus doesn’t work for a family need Monday thru Friday because u school day car the weekend are ruff but the environmental part is good
good,Average day is opening the store and getting the register started. Then making sure the store display is right and putting shipments away and in the right spot. And while doing those making sure you greet customers and help them with any questions.
good,"working at foot locker i had to engage with customers and fit the accommodate the needs of them. A typical day at Foot Locker is slow paced and relaxed, but during holidays and back to school seasons, the pace picks up and you have to work with your team members to reach store goals."
good,"Had a job here while in High School in 1999. Fun work environment. Did stock but was forced to work cashier/sales associate when understaffed. Other than employee discounts, no additional incentives."
good,Ok place to work.  There was not alot of room for advancement with salary.  It was okay to work for a limited amount of time.  Once I reached the maximum salary it was time to move on.
good,"Foot Locker isn't for you if you're not a go getter. It's part pay part commission, so you have to go get yo check. It's a great place to work if you're a sneaker head. But you have to want to work. As far as management.... good luck. It's only room for advancement if you want it. The management team and distract managers could care less. If you're not a favorite of theirs, then you go down to the bottom of the barrel. So just be careful, and work at your own risk."
good,"At Footlocker an employee would come into work and immediately work with customers, trying to help them buy products out of the store. Footlocker is a great part time job for a high school student."
good,"Our division was top-heavy which lead to a down-sizing.  Management spent a lot of money in a year which showed little earnings.  "
good,Footlocker is a great company they sell great shoes.They make sure they have the shoes stocked.However they could've done better with the treatment of their employees.
good,like i said it’s a good place to work but i don’t know much about shoes & i won’t learn more about them & advance myself because they only work me maybe 1 or 2 days a week 2 if i’m lucky but only for 3 hours. that is annoying especially since i’m a student in college so i need some money but i guess that’s retail for you
good,Very relaxed and easy going environment. Great place to work for first job or people with no real responsibility. Managers are paid well but assistant managers are over worked and underpaid. The most enjoyable part of the job is the discount which is great.
good,"Great job to start off with and advance in if the right field interested in. Overall a great environment, great staff and of course great discounts on footwear."
good,Giornata lavorativa stimolante e formativa soprattutto per quanto riguarda il rapporto diretto con il cliente e le tecniche di vendita
good,"It's a nice starting out job,  but not recommend if you are looking for something long-term, and paying wise. Depending on the day you can make some decent money from commission, but sometimes the schedule shift isn't worth your gas money going in."
good,open the store and make the most out of each customer. manage each shift and prepare for shoe releases and peak hours and days. constantly hiring and training new associates
good,Has its upsides and downsides like any job but a great company to work for. They are involved in everything and are very huge. As many companies continue to fall Foot Locker is still on the rise.
good,As a full time stocker I managed the stock room; informing and directing part time stock employees on their daily tasks. I also collected and fully processed shipment twice a week.
good,Good place to work. Coworkers were friendly and attentive. Decent salary and benefits. The best place I've ever worked. I was challenged and motivated daily.
good,"had a blast working here, but the company does not pay as much as they should. they expect a lot from its workers but give nothing back in return. you have to suck up to move up in this company"
good,"It's a very fast-paced place to work at for most of the time. Some of the sales associates are amazing people, others are a bother. But it's still a great place."
good,"I would run the floor, assisting customers with sales choices. I would also assist running a register occasionally. I learned how to interact with customers to ensure they had a good experience."
good,Great place to work during high school and maybe early college days. Very easy job and enjoyable. Would not be great for long term though. But still enjoyed my time here
good,"Overall, Foot Locker was a pretty good place to work. The commission was good, no customers were too hostile. The only problem I truly had was that none of my coworkers made me feel like I was truly a member of the team."
good,"The environment was fast, upbeat and lively. Special training was required for specialty product that we sold. Additional training was required from all team members."
good,I actually learned allot while working at footlocker. The pace of the job depends on where you live. I worked in both slower stores and busier ones. both are fun.
good,This is a fun job for shoe enthusiasts and people that have great customer service skills all kind of pics of shoes all kind of pics of apparel meeting new people everyday this is a good job
good,Environnement agréable dynamique et adaptée à sa clientèle
good,this was my first job I got my first experience on costumer service at this job. I got too work with nice and cool people. it was a good experience and enjoyable.
good,I loved working at Footlocker. I loved working with my co-workers and my manager. It was a nice experience. I caught on to everything very easily and I worked there for almost a year.
good,"The atmosphere is super relaxed, but you still know that you're there to work. My coworkers were all really nice and I still keep in contact today. The best part is definitely the discount. You receive 30% on all your purchases, including new releases and sale items. Also, occasionally we would 50%, but there would be limitations on what you can use it on. Employees are also able to do layaways using their discount, so thats always a plus if you're in a financial bind but still want to keep getting fly sneakers."
good,"I started out as a part timer within a year I was promoted to a Sales lead position which is a part time assistant manager. Learned a lot of custimer service skills, sales, and operations to run a store. After I was alomst finished getting ym college degree I accepted a full time Assistant manager job. Long hours were required and I wen to school full time and they were accomadting of that. I decided to leave for another full time job but I did not like it and so I came back part time until another full time postion opens up. The hardest part of the job is the long hours and demanding labor in smaller stores where you have less help. The enjoyable part is gaining customer relationships in your store, having a store gain in sales, moving around consantly."
good,"A typical day at work would always be different. That's the one thing I absolutely loved when I worked at Footlocker. Considering the fact that I am an extremely social person, I had the luxury of being capable of interacting with my customers throughout my entire shift. I learnt that customer service is very important and that the customer is always right even when they are not. The management was good, they were always there to help if ever one needed and for that I was thankful. On to the workplace, it was a very fun and independent job. Being a sales rep, we were all on our own in regards to making sales and commission. This being said, was both the hard part of the job but if done well, was the best part. It was important that the workers hustled to make sales and were being as helpful to the customers as possible"
good,"Overall, Footlocker has great management... they provided you with good process on how to sell shoes and additional products that can help you succeed."
good,"I really enjoyed my time with Footlocker. The pay was not bad, the hours were decent. the discount was nice for sure. I would recommend this job to any young adult looking to learn the retail management game."
good,If you like selling shoes you'll like this job. Managers were nice and fun to work with. Coworkers were really nice and fun to work with. Good employee benefits with this job.
good,"Great job, fun to work at, hours were not the best, the pay was alright, assistant management was not very good. I enjoyed my time there, but wish some things were different."
good,"management was terrible, "
good,"it was good to a certain extent i guess, the managers care too much about their bonuses than they do of the sales associates having to pay bills etc so they freely cut shifts when ""over hours"" - that was annoying."
good,"Its a fast pace, always changing environment. Meet a lot of different people and get the opportunity to build return cliental. Growth opportunities in your willing to put in the time and hours"
good,They hired way too many employees which causes loss of hours for some. The environment wasn't as intimate which makes workers feel unappreciated and less of a fun workplace.
good,bij footlocker heb ik veel geleerd hoe ik de klanten moest aanspreken en hoe ik het beste ze service kon bieden. Zelf werkte ik in een goed samenwerkend team en was er heel gelukkig mee. het moeilijkste aan de baan was rustig blijven als het druk was en niet in paniek komen.
good,le manager m'appelait meme pendants mes jours de congés pour aller travailler quand lui n'en avait oas l'envie
good,"Long and frustrated, because with the  other shifts not pulling there own weight it gets hard  helping the others  out. I learned alot and i want to thank them for all they have done for me."
good,Great place to work. Friendly staff. Friendly customers. Lots to learn. If you love shoes you will love working at lady footlocker. Able to move up in the company
good,Typical day includes keeping the store organized and tidy along with helping any and all customer service related duties. learned how to deal with difficult people and use sales pitches. great management and flexibility with scheduling.
good,"I enjoyed working at Footlocker as a cashier."
good,If you hire me I would do the very best I can and I will always be on time to work and I am very respectful to everyone and I am a good person to trust
good,Its fun to work here if you're looking for a temporary job to get you by through high school or college. I was a part time sales and as soon as i turned 18 i became an assistant manager. As a manager it became overwhelming sometimes but overall it was a great experience for the most part.
good,"Learned a lot about shoes and tasks around the store ."
good,working as a part time employee after school I would go straight to work and use my customer service skills to make the best out of the day and make my sale goal for the day. Became top sale lead.
good,Good pay with a lot of opportunities for growth but could not negotiate a transfer for me to be closer to my grandfather and keep same job title
good,"A typical day of work is unpredictable and fun.  You'll never know what to expect, new challenges come in and out constantly."
good,"The job was very fun helping out with customers and helping with my maneger in the back and had an overall good experience with the workers, I even picked up a few skills in the customer service area and learnt a lot during the time of my work experience."
good,"Footlocker was my first job an taught me a lot about having a job and even more just bout the retail industry. Having a job like this teaches you traits like responsibility, punctuality, and the energy everyone gives out while working teaches you great teamwork."
good,"ottima esperienza in un ambiente lavorativo stimolante e flessibile seppur troppo breve a causa di un contratto da stagista della durata di 3 mesi che come mi era stato già preannunciato al colloquio, sarebbe stato fine a se stesso."
good,Fast Pace. As Store Manager I had the opportunity to train all my staff and many of them are in management positions today! You get to meet people from different Backgrounds and learn to pick up on the strengths and weaknesses of each individual along the way.
good,"Working in footlocker on a day to day was very high paced. Because of commission, sales could sometimes be stolen by other associates. High pressure environment at times as you have to push to make your daily quotas."
good,Good job if you need a flexible work schedule while studying in school. great sneaker discount. Management is always enjoyable. The job is typically commission based so it can be competitive at times.
good,"Great place to work, low promotional rate and pay makes the job bad. The people are great. No late hours make the job even better."
good,Foot locker was a good place with a lot of good people and it was fun working there for the time being. I learned how to deal with customers efficiently. The hardest part of the job was balancing work and school. Most enjoyable part were the people.
good,Helping customers and making sales. I also had to make sure the shop was clean and tidy ready for opening. This helped me to gain vital experience working as part of a team and building my confidence in communicating with a wide range of different people.
good,Foot Locker is an amazing place to work. Everyone becomes family. Always opportunities for promotion. Caring work environment.
good,Really good company overall. I would work hard and deal with a lot of customers and also handle money but they would treat me right and do good overall with everything
good,"It was great, usually you'd expect a lot of customers, I learned how to cope with customers. Management was great, co-workers were awesome. Hardest part of job was not getting tired and the most enjoyable was selling."
good,It was okay to work for a sneaker store that I shopped at as a kid. It is a good job for teens and adults that has a love for sneakers.
good,Seeing different faces and meeting new people everyday is a plus. The hours are crazy. Hourly and commissions is nice to make.
good,It was very fast paced work place.  You had to keep up with their 100% quota each day. Sometimes the days were very long and tiring. There was room for growth.
good,The daily routine of working at a Foot Locker store is enjoyable if you are truly interested in athletic wear or footwear. Certainly helps to be knowledgeable.
good,My opinion for working at Kids Footlocker would be that it can get a little out of hand at times when your short of employee's and the store is busy with lots of customers but besides that its a fun environment to work around. Everyone is nice and good conversations are always being held. I would recommend Kids Footlocker to anyone looking for a job that comforts them.
good,I never thought I would learn so much about sneakers and the benefits of wearing the correct pair for the activities you will be doing.  I learned about shoe care and the correct socks to wear.  My co-workers were great and I so enjoyed my job.
good,"This was a part-time job.  This was a very good place to work, the other employees were fantastic and the experience was perfect."
good,When I first started working at Foot Locker it was exactly as you'd expect it to be like working in a shoe store. The experience is different depending on how tight a ship the management is running.
good,The main factor behind working at Foot Locker was to support my funds whilst I was still at University. My time working for the company was thoroughly enjoyable and I still keep in touch with some of my old colleagues.
good,working here you have to be on your toes because it the right store it can be slow and quiet one minute then groups of customers just start to pile in. the interaction itself though can be very enjoyable.
good,The expectations for this job were clear. Training should be extended to get a better understanding of how to preform certain tasks relating to this job.
good,Working at Footlocker is a great experience because you get to help the customers in finding the perfect shoe for their particular style. You have the benefits of a 20 percent discount and knowing when all the new shoes will be released.
good,Foot Locker was a good stepping stone for me in my career.  Long hours at time and minimal training are some of the shortcomings.
good,la giornata di lavoro è sempre molto schematica ci sono ruoli e cariche da rispettare e ci si dividono i compiti per l'obiettivo comune dall'organizzazione del magazzino alla gestione dei visual alla vendita ai clienti...
good,Constantly organizing the store's visuals. Meet requirements for daily sale goals. Organizing shipments and new arrivals. Constant interaction with customers.
good,Working in active work space was fun because everyone kept things running smooth and the staff all worked as a team to accomplish store goals which made us compete with other stores.
good,Getting to every customer with a goal to have the customer feel great about their purchase. We strive to get to everyone as well as to maintain our sales floor ready and filled. As a manager I lead the team and train them on bettering themselves for the next level.
good,"One of the most know uniform world wide. Once you have on the stripes you know its game time. Lovely environment, positive employee is a mandatory for the company another thing I love about us. Its a honor to work with Footlocker"
good,"I enjoyed working for Foot Locker. There was opportunity to grow and I was always up to date on upcoming show releases. I would work for Foot Locker again,"
good,overall a good experience the managers and the co workers were all nice and friendly and it was always a fun experience. the pay was also good as well as the hours they were giving all of the people working there
good,une expérience en tant que vendeur ou assistant mérite d'être vécu au sein de cette entreprise
good,"being with the public is fun and every day is something new"
good,"its really nice to be able to deal with all types of customers, and still be able to give them utmost satisfaction. i find it easy to socialize so my job becomes a whole lot easier. the hardest part is obviously the customers and being able to maintain the same impression to the all. this also includes foreign customers."
good,"Manager and Co-Workers are always upbeat.  Fast-paced, yet comfortable.  Located in the mall so lunch is easy."
good,"Limited Hours"
good,"Great job experience, co-workers are friendly. "
good,"My main responsabilities is serving and advising customers, stacking shelves and displaying goods in an attractive way as well as ordering ítems."
good,Great part-time job to work in while being a full time university student. Always nice to work around people who share the same interests in shoes and basketball as you do.
good,It was a fun but slow paced workplace. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the customers and being able to help them find a product that would work best for them.
good,"something to do if you love shoes,great atmosphere, discount on shoes is always a plus. you have the opportunity to grow in this company if you put in the hard work."
good,"First, all money is made off of commission. So if you can't hustle, you won't have a good paycheck. Second, they didn't appreciate school and didn't help me work around school hours."
good,"Misma valoración que el apartado 1. Exigente, competitivo pero con buen ambiente por parte de los compañeros y buen trato por parte de la dirección"
good,a typical day at work consisted of meeting new people and providing customer service to all that entered the store for new items.  most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying the customer.
good,"A typical day at work was checking the goals for the day to see what is needed of the employees and going over it with the employees so they understand the days quota. Managing the employees by observing their interaction with customers helped identify where progress was needed. My co-workers were very eager to learn and customer friendly. The hardest part about my job was lifting heavy shipment boxes of shoes to the backroom, but overall it got done. The most enjoyable part of my job was changing the stores appearance with weekly floor plan change outs."
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. My manager and coworkers were great. I was promoted to Assistant Manager a few months after getting hired and I loved doing that. I learned a lot of customer service skills by working there as well.
good,J'ai bien était accueilli dans l'équipe il m'on former mon fait évoluer
good,On weekdays many people don't come to the mall as if it was the weekend. I had to learn to be on my P's and Q's no matter if the store was busy or not. I not only had to work with parents but I also had to learn to work with the children. Its a good job and teaches great skills for future careers.
good,"Kids Footlocker was a good environment to work in, got commotion, the employs were nice, helpful and easy to work in, but the bad part no raise with in the two years."
good,"It is a very easy job to do. Nothing about working here is difficult anyone can do it all you have to do is talk to people so if you are shy then you are just not going to last because anyone is easily replaceable. The only way you get decent hours is is you are part of the management other than that you will probably get like 8 hours a week if you are lucky 15 at most when there are busy weeks. It all depends who your manager is some are really cool and others just take this way too serious when it really is not. Anyway if you have a chance at a better part time job where you are guaranteed at least 20-25 hours per week then go and do that you will suffer here trying to get hours, Working weekends and holidays is not worth working here."
good,"As long as you know how to sell, you will do great on the job. The customers 9 times out of 10 know what they want. You just have to sell it. An upsale is always the best sell."
good,Its a very busy store where its constant pressure to make sale that's where I learned to juggle making sales and managing a store at the same time
good,"at day at foot locker is pretty simple, easy or hectic. the learning process is easy to grasp. although management could communicate more, managers and co workers are very professional and helpful. like every job you have to learn everything but the learning process is enjoyable."
good,The perfect job for someone with no life. Easy to move further in company but when you do you give away your personal time.
good,The days are always productive and filled with positive energy. you continue to learn new things and build relationships.
good,"this particular footlocker that i work at is always busy, and i love a busy work environment. most the managers there for the most part are always supportive of us and always told us things we needed to improve on if there were any. The coworkers there are hilarious and kind if you don't have your wallet and they know they just might buy you lunch. The hardest part i would have to say is the cleaning up at the end since it was such a big store. Meeting new people and learning more and more about shoes was my most enjoyable thing about working at this footlocker,"
good,Some days were busy but most were slow. Management and coworkers were great. Interecting with the customers and seeing all the shoes before they released was the most enjoyable part for me.
good,Everyone was friendly to one another. Everyone did they're job on time. There were no altercations in the workplace. The managers were hard working.
good,footlocker was a fun place to work at first but after my fifth year the management above me changed. it was no longer a home feeling in the job place
good,"help customers, opperate the cash register, maintain a clean working enviornment, everyone was nice and friendly and made coming to work fun."
good,"My typical day of work consist mostly of driving sales. I try to accommodate all customers to the best of my abilities and provide them with an environment that they want to keep returning to. I have learned a lot about managing and maintaining a good work environment while driving sales for the store. My co-workers all share a positive attitude and we all come to work with the same goal in mind, that is to work as a team and be as productive as possible. The hardest part of the job may be handling different types of people at times where they may have complaints about certain prices/products. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to have conversations with customers throughout the day and helping them leave the store with something that will make them happy."
good,"The hours were not steady. They were based off of sales and made through a computer and then management went in and made changed. Management was alright, new people coming in changed the  enviroment."
good,"Foot Locker is a great place to work, the product is fun, the sports focus is fun, and most of the people are great. The company is financially successful and dominates the athletic footwear retail business."
good,You are pretty much on your feet all day getting people the shoes they want.
good,"I enjoy working at foot locker. Everyone is nice and close knit. Our products are awesome, the music is motivating, and there's a Cinnabon down the hall!"
good,Helping some one get what they want and good communication skills and being a wonder sales Associate have u feeling like u acomplished alot.
good,Loved it first job potential to move up. great sales team keep you on your feet
good,This was a great environment. I learn everything about customer service and technology. We had a great team everyone helped everyone.
good,Bon environnement est bonne esprit d'équipe. Dans cette entreprise j'aime beaucoup l'esprit d'équipe est le travail en groupe
good,"A typical day consisted of helping customers find shoes to fit their needs, also giving them my own personal opinions from the knowledge of the merchandise we were selling. After a sale was made I cashed out the customer. Also I was expected to sell extra accessories and to meet a certain sales quota. I learned product knowledge, knowing what kind of shoes perform for what reasons. Management was encouraging and very knowledgeable, I learned so much from working here. My co-worker were very helpful as well, we always helped each-other and learned new things. The hardest part about the job was getting a customer to see your side of things. But that was also the most enjoyable part for me."
good,"This was a good long-term first job to have. I learned about working with people, and selling, as well as marketing and professionalism. Can't see how I could have made a career out of it though, the opportunities to advance were never readily available in the stores I worked in, so I could not set a career path once I finished high school."
good,"Working at a Foot Locker store was fun, but sometimes working in the storage room was overwhelming given the amount of merchandise that they recieve. Otherwise, a normal day was pretty fun and the co-workers were really friendly. Not much job security and of you are not a full time worker you will find yourself not working very often."
good,"The store needed to be organized at all times, greet customers and offer excellent service, know all the promotions and offer variety of products, manager was friendly and responsible, co-workers were kind and hard workers. We all helped each other and the hardest part was to do the store's inventory."
good,"It was a typical day at work"
good,"Managing people is a tough task, but working 60 plus hours every week makes it even more difficult. I enjoyed my time at Foot Locker, but the hours wore me out. The discounts were awesome and the benefits were standard."
good,"Most of the time during work, I would do facing and inventory details due to the lack of clientele but in overall, I enjoyed my stay there."
good,working with new and in style sports gear was  very fun for me.
good,"A typical day of work as a cashier would start with a brief discussion with my manager about the work I was expected to do for the day. Sometimes this would consist of the manager telling me what register I was working at and nothing more. Other times I would learn about another are of the department that I was going to help for part of the day, or a project at the front that I was going to be in charge of. My co-workers are energetic and hard working. they take their jobs extremely serious. the hardest part of the day is counting the cash at the end because it takes a lot of time and concentration. the most enjoyable part of my day is when i complete a customer's order giving them that satisfaction of receiving what they desire."
good,"Work hard organize things in the back make sure i setup displays and sale's,  greet custome as i walk in and let them know what sells and promotions that  we as a company are offering,.

good,"•	Open and close store"
good,"Provided service to customers, and was responsible for monies and receipts."
good,I did a lot of things at work in one day. Everyday I had to come in and count my register down to make sure all the money was in there. Me and my manager would look over the deposit and make sure that they were correct. Then I would talk to my employees an told them there goals for the day. But I would say the hardest part of the day would be selling the shoe care such as insoles and shoe cleaner because most people didn't want to buy those type of items. An the most enjoyable part of my job was being a sales person. I was very good at selling items in the store.
good,"I will greet the customers as they come in and ask if I can help them with anything. I will get everything they need, ring them out and invite them back again."
good,Great company with great benefits. Hours can sometime be unbearable but it is retail.
good,From my experience at Footlocker i have gained great tools and customer service skills to be an excellent leader in my future.

good,Footlocker was a great place wonderful people my staff was great management wasn't so great. A typical work day for me was to run stock talk to customers ring them up manage staff and customers talking to customers over the phone making sure when I finish talking to the customer that they are satisfied. I've learned how to be more of a leader to make the work environment is good. Making key decisions in pressured situations. My co-workers was wonderful and well taking of they loved coming to work and work because I treated them fair and with respect being a manager and making sure they got what they needed a manager is judged by his job and the people he manages. The hardest part of my job was to get a phone call on my days off asking me to come in leaving my daughter and wife to come sell shoes. The most enjoyable part was the customers and my co-workers.
good,"The work environment was fun and friendly, I learned a lot from my VP."
good,"High customer volume, must be a people person, must be very customer service.  Fun atmosphere."
good,"Management and training is very good."

Responsible for controlling the entire Eastbay shipping route guide system and searching for cost improvements within our process. I was also tasked with planning and executing the holiday shipping upgrades to ensure all domestic packages were delivered in time for Christmas. I developed a much more efficient process than previous years, vastly improving the performance."
good,The management team is positive at all times and considerate of those who are trying to go to school as well. So the work schedules are very flexible and reasonable. The co-workers at this establishment have a family bond which makes the day more enjoyable and smooth as well. Hardest part about the job is going home and leaving behind the customers we work so hard to please. 
good,"Helping customers with sales of shoes, clothing and cleaners. Also was cashier."
good,Footlocker is a good place to get your first job and some sales experience. 
good,I enjoyed helping customers find the perfect shoe that would match their fitness wear. 
good,This was a good part time job to have. Something I would recommend to a college student.
good,"Typical day here at work can range from being very busy with customers to slow day with shipment or visual changes. I have learned most of my customer service skills and mangement skills. Management and co-workers have always been great here, more like family. Hardest part of job is trying to meet reqirements when given limited resources. Most enjoyable part are the benefits"
good,"Come to work, clock in. After clocking in, rearrange store if necessary and clean up. Shoes on wall are critical. Be sure to meet and greet customers as soon as they enter the store. Be friendly and see if they need any assistance. Take lunch whenever it would be and then go back to work until its time to punch the clock again."
good,This job is very fun yet it is a huge learning experience to meet people show your customer skills and a very uplifting environment. I also learned how become alot better with customers and greeting customers and having alot of retail experience. My management and co-workers were all great and helpful and full of energy and they all took responsibility for there actions. The hardest part of the job is to control yourself when meeting angry or wicked customers but the best part of the job is when you have good greetings with people or customers and being able to help satisfy them.
good,"A typical day at my job includes me coming into work, clocking in, and putting on my headset. I then come out onto the sales floor and greet the customers and also asking if there is anything in particular I can help them find today. I assist any customers in grabbbing shoes, apparel while suggesting items that would complete their look. I also answer telephones and direct customers to fitting rooms if needed. My job is to make sure the customer is happy, receives top of the line service, and make them feel like they have made a great selection."
good,Started out part time and worked my way up to assistant manager while attending college.
good,"A typical day of work was very busy, customers kept flowing in and out of the store and I felt that ive learnt alot about the different mannerisms that each customer can bring and how they can help me to develop, grow and further suceed within my job title. My co-workers were friendly and very welcoming, they knew exactly when to be serious and at what times we could have abit of fun. They taught me the ropes and what steps I can take to be the best at my job which I liked the most. The hardest part of my job was the end when it cam eto cleaning up but I know not all aspects of work will be fun but I took it on the chin and worked towards making the shop more popular. The most enjoyable part was learning my strengths and weaknesses and meeting different/new types of people."
good,Though my time was limited I really enjoyed it. Good atmosphere and pretty good leadership. Love the cusutomer interaction.
good,"easy and relaxing job, however there always seemed to be drama at the work place. Always had FEP cases. Management became horrible after we got a new manager and assistant manager, they were selfish people and made others do their work."
good,Extremely fun job with a great management team and a fully engaged corporate team.
good,first of all i am a sneaker fanatic so to be able to work in Footlocker and share my knowledge was evrything to me
good,Great place and outstanding discounts. Loved working there!!!
good,"I learned how to find things quickly based on keywords and/or (sku) numbers. A normal day at work consist of helping people make a decision on the right shoe for them and the occasion. My co-workers were very helpful and friendly. The hardest part of the job for me was getting customers to buy things they were simply not interested in buying, for example, insoles. The most enjoyable part of the job was everything thing else about it. I loved working there."
good,"it was a good experience, i learned how to sell better , and dealt with a lot of situations that better myself as a whole."
good,"It was a great experience, the other team members were great to work with."
good,I loved my job and my team at this place. It was a job that i learned alot of customer service.
good,great place to work very energetic people.a typical day there is easy going but not boring. i learned basic sales skills and how to communicate with customers. management is fair and flexible.my co workers are great and the hardest part is knowing the products. the easiest part is selling the product they practically sell themselves.
good,Management and co-workers were very fun to be around and made the work environment enjoyable.
good,"A typical day at work began with a check of the personal sales targets and other tasks set out for the day. Each employee had a target specific to them for $ amount; multiple sales %; apparel %; accessories %; insoles (1 for every $500); and, socks and shoe care amounts, as well as tasks including stock replenishment for when there were no customers to be served. I learned many things in this position; given that I was a senior member of staff, I was responsible for ensuring these targets were reached in the absence of Store or Assistant Managers and therefore learned how to lead a team of associates and deal with all types of personalities and work ethics. Management were involved in all aspects of the job, though their extra duties were what gave me the chance to lead the team when they were required elsewhere for conference calls etc. Co-workers were all of a similar age to me and we got on very well; once the work was being done and the targets were being met, everything went smoothly. The hardest part of the job for me was that when trade slowed, hours were inevitably cut. This was not helped by the state of the economy in Ireland and it was for this reason that I left the company to travel and work in Australia. The most enjoyable part of the job was that, as you would expect when dealing with the public, no two customers were the same; the job afforded you the opportunity to deal with basic questions from the most suitable shoe for a 2 year old toddler to the more complicated question of which shoe in the varied range carried in-store would most suit the needs of a distance"
good,Footlocker is a fine company to work for. Pay isn't great but it's a fun job and if you love sneakers the discount helps also.
good,"Loved working here with the public and with co-workers. Advancement was not always easy, but the training and competive sales goals were easy and self oriented. Enjoyable overall."
good,"I stocked a little bit, chashier, checked in shipment, and oversee store. I learned great comuster service. Management was great!! Co workers were okay. The hardest part was the slow days. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people."
good,"Everything was well organize, the company knows what is doing."
good,It was fun working for Foot Locker and meeting people everyday with the same interest as yourself.
good,"I had a great time as a associate at footlocker. It was a great opportunity for me to learn about products, people and customer service."
good,I enjoyed being around all the sneakers. my co-workers were a good group of people. the hardest part of the job was dealing with ude customers.
good,"I know everyone wants to work at Foot Locker for the great discount, but beware the discount may be the only perk. Foot Locker does't pay there employees very well especially the great ones, and don't count on a raise unless your willing to move up in which case they have to increase your pay. Even as a manager the pay seems great at first until you realize that you have no life outside of the ""LOCKER"" and you work for every red cent they pay you, not worth it especially if you have a family. On a positive note I learned a lot and I had a great staff who worked very hard for me as I worked hard for them. Overall Foot Locker should really get a clue on how to keep there great employees happy."
good,Fun job that teaches leadership and patience. Great staff and co-workers and easy going management.
good,Everyday was an exciting day
good,"a day at footlocker would be fast pace, dealing with customers and their needs. also being able to learn more areas of the company by being in management. and i loved the employee discounts"
good,"I enjoyed working there, im good with people and enjoyed being able to put my customer service skills to use."
good,Provided employee trainings when needed. Delegated daily responsibilites to staff
good,Foot Locker taught me the value of hard work and dedication. It enabaled me to become all that I could be and advance through the company becoming a store assistant manager at the age of 18.
good,Good company to work for I have worked here for years. It can help you it ur future.
good,I have worked most of my career here and I would say it is a good company to work for.
good,"Great discount, not many hours for part time associates."
good,"During my time as a sales associate for Foot Locker, i enjoyed interacting and helping sell merchandise to the various customers I encountered each day."
good,Lady Foot Locker is a good place to work at. All associates are able to get the company discount at all stores that Foot Locker owns. You learn the importance of great customer service and always leaving a lasting impression. If you like shoes I reccommend working there.
good,"I began working for Foot Locker when I was 18 years old. Ages 16-25 is the age I would suggest to work here. By the time I was 30, I was burnt out from this job. It's a great starter job, but don't stay there as long as I did."
good,"I'm still relatively new, but I haven't been disappointed yet, I really do enjoy working there, the management team is super cool, my coworkers are also super cool.  Makes it easy to want to go to work."
good,"This job is a lot of fun but has issues with scheduling. On average a person will get 3 to 6 hours a week. The people are super nice and fun, but no hours makes this place almost not worth working at"
good,Throughout my time here I learned much about retail and customer service. I only wish I was paid more hourly because sometimes commission didn’t amount to much
good,A typical day @ work was u clock in at your schedule time get manifest see what’s coming in & start preparing for shipment that’s coming in. Some days was lighter than other so on those day u may take a few minutes to get stockroom in order really easy stuff if you liked your jo
good,"It was a cool environment and there were tons of people coming in everyday to buy sneakers and athletic apparel. However, they didn’t give me many hours because there were so many other people that worked there, so if you actually wanted to get enough sales to make commission, you have to be very tactical about getting catching people that come in and those who need help. You also have to learn how to locate shoes in the back very quickly so you can make sales. overall decent place to work"
good,"Foot Locker Inc. is a great company to work for. Lots of perks (benefits, 401K, discounts) but drawbacks are being away from family, no holidays off.."
good,"Great company for students that have a passion for sneakers. Flexible hours, competitive sales environment, decent management and fun workplace environment"
good,"My first Job, I learn to talk to customers and learned how to analyze and evaluate each customer that walks through the door. I was enable to locate items that would fit the customers needs."
good,Great to work with the right people around you. Flexible scheduling hours and the ability to move up in the company. Always fun and good place to meet new people.
good,It's an unforgiving system little room for errors.  Three strikes you're out no matter how long in between they were. Makes it stressful but the pay is great.
good,"Some days are slow, some are busy. Working in retail can get overwhelming at times but you must know how to work under pressure and with not so pleasant customers."
good,"I loved this job, the pay sucked but the bond you grow with the sales team is amazing. The hours were long so you are on your feet all day. Hours go by fast though."
good,"it was very productive to work there, but hard work. the managers was very helpful when it came to theyre associates. customers made the job even more interesting and fun"
good,Stressful invorment. Constant Change to what needs to be done on a day to day basis. Always feel like nothing is ever hoped enough for my higher management
good,Very competitive work environment that rewards productive associates; must be prepared to work extra hours based upon customer traffic; company culture is sports-oriented
good,"How you develop and grow faster within the company depends on your work ethic, drive, and location. Smaller stores offer you more training but limited to hours to employees while larger stores offer you more hours but training is stretched."
good,I only worked for a summer because I was still in school. It was part time I wasn’t getting that many hours. Wasn’t really getting paid that much. The manager I had was doing crooked stuff
good,Fun work environment. Head management can be a bit discriminatory to minorities when they visit but in-store management is the opposite. Easy to move up.
good,"It’s a good job to start off with and it does give a lot of opportunity to move forward and advance with the company. I had the pleasure of working with an Amazing manager over at footaction and together we won contests, we had a team who loved coming to work, it was a great experience I just needed more."
good,It was a great experience having worked for footlocker. Creating bond with in your team helping one another grow was great. Helping customer in all their needs helping them find all the products they need and offering what might be better or other solutions is great to.
good,Great experience with customers but it can get pretty stressful because of poor management.But overall it was a great experience. I learned how important it was to really build a relationship with your customers.
good,Das Verkaufstraining ist sehr gut und man hat gute Chancen bis zu einem gewissen Punkt aufzusteigen. Ab dann tritt man auf der Stelle.
good,this job was boring the boss would take hours away from people and then would use it to boost his own hours for his own check. it was not a great environment
good,"While I was studying in the UK for my MBA, I was working part time for Footlocker. A great place to work with friendly colleagues. I enjoyed my short stint at work."
good,"Ambiente lavorativo stimolante poichè legato molto alle vendite. Dinamicità, savoir-faire, dialettica, product knowledge ti portano al successo laorativo in questa azienda"
good,"Fun office environment, constantly on phones and answering customers calls. Lunch breaks are very short and little to no bathroom breaks. Work is done at a computer for the whole shift."
good,"Had fun with the 2 years i worked there but i dont see it as a full time thing differently go to school while working there and they are very flexible with your school schedule or events you are going to,plus the discount is very nice if you love shoes and have family."
good,Love this place sneaker fan right here .Just needed a few more hours a week .They were low and i was attending school at the time. I loved how they would give you a good discount depending on how much you sold. And also they had raffles here and there when new pair of sneakers came out . they were a very nice team to work with. I also liked how you can talk to costumers knew most of them . i worked in the mall where mostly everyone goes to shop. Very friendly environment to be in.
good,My time at footlocker has grown me as a person. I strongly believe that i found something I love to do and that is retail. I love to interact with customers and people in general because of my outgoing personality.  They also taught me how to be a better leader.
good,Foot Locker is very selective when it comes to getting the job but working there and getting to know the co worker was a fun experience. The people working there are very passionate about sneaker as I was also. The only thing was the pay isn't very good as i only been there for two months.
good,"Woking at footlocker was alright. The workers were ok some were shady but overall the pay as goo and when i say good I mean as if your not either a full time worker or manager you hardly get any shifts at all during the slow months (march, April, may). But besides that everything was alright not perfect but alright."
good,footlocker is a good company to work for. hours are good. you get vacation time and pto hours monthly just hve to use them wisely. only thing I think is pay could be more for equiptment operators.
good,"My first stock job, this store taught me what it was like to work in a flagship location. Working in such a fast-paced environment aided me in my future endeavors."
good,it was fun while being at work especially being around so many shoes because I love all shoes. employees were fun and management was alright not so bad.
good,Foot Locker is a great company to help build your customer service and teamwork skills. Foot Locker gives you guidelines to succeed but ultimately the freedom to find your own selling style and techniques.
good,Company was well organized and balanced as a whole and did a good job of distributing the work load and not let things pile up. Just had a bad experience with my coworkers.
good,"the management was not great, other than that it was a chill work environment to work in. it's a good teen job to start off as. The hours were only good for me during the holidays, as it being hectic. This was more of a temporary holiday job for me. You have to be quick paced"
good,My time with footlocker would be coming in Monday mornings and helping the Store Manager count hundreds of shoes before the store was scheduled to open. I started off as a sales associate and had daily task and sales goals. I was promoted within a couple months and that's when my responsibilities changed
good,"Fun/Friendly environment"
good,The organization provides great employee discounts. This alone was enough incentive to remain employed. The people were great but the commission structure caused issues among employees.
good,A day at Foot Locker can be busy or slow depending on the month. The job is not hard to do at all is a nice place to work in and everyone gets along with each other.
good,"Work wasn't too stressful or anything and have zero complaints. Only reason why I'm still not working there is because of my store closing down. Besides that, zero complaints."
good,Working at footlocker has been a great experience. I appreciate all the time and effort my management team take to make sure we can take on any task. For willing to help us become greater and learn many new and more things.
good,"A great work environment,hardest part might be the stock room . You can learn a lot at this job if you love shoes or if you wanna get your sales and retail skills up"
good,"This is a good job that provides you with many opportunists to grow. They usually try to give people chances and give them time to prove themselves. If you like interacting with people , this is the job for you !"
good,"able to learn product knowledge"
good,"Empresa que trabalha com objetivos de vendas."
good,"A typical day at work at Foot Locker was walking in to clock out, grab a headset, head to the floor, try your best to engage with every customer, leave a standing impression and always try your best! The hardest part was on a slow day trying to get a customer to  purchase things and offer additional merchandise."
good,"Enjoyable. Had fun with engaging with customers. It was a fun setting, the only difficult part was not having units on hand and having to do stock locators."
good,workplace culture family oriented. store had moments of business to moments of calmness. manager made sure to remind everyone this was a team effort. very strict on discounts. very popular place for people to steal from so always have to keep eye out.
good,nice clean shoe store in mall. nice place to work with excellent lighting and product. lots of customer appreciation given back to community. nice food court to get hot lunch from. diverse product on sale.
good,"fun place, good management, great coworkers, good discount, great opportunities to move up, fun connecting with customers, great place for someone with a passion for sneakers."
good,"Footlocker could be a great career for some. It takes hard work, definitely will drain you if your not on top of daily operations. Which can get backed up quickly. Overall fun place to work, great discounts and opportunity to grow."
good,I loved the Footlocker experience. I learned great skills there and met  with great people from different store locations. The discounts were also very helpful.
good,"Management needs improvement along with their training."
good,"Footlocker is a very tiring and fast paced job that required for me a lot of on the ball thinking, the hardest part for me with this job was definitely finding things in the storage compactors out the back, most customers think that we go and find the certain shoe straight away but it is very tough, and even tougher when you're customer gets furious when you cant find what they are looking for quick enough. The most enjoyable part is that it is a very chilled working place to be a part of, although it is upto you to make sure that you are working how your manager wants you too"
good,The most enjoyable part of working at Kid's Footlocker was working with the families. They were very confused on the sizing and style of shoe that they were looking for so it was fun for me to help them out.
good,"While working, I enjoyed all of my coworkers and managers. All great people, who made work enjoyable. After a year of working with no optional pay raise, and minimal to no commission, I realized the job was getting routine and lazy. I had many instances of disrespectful customers and it was not worth the minimum wage for more and more time."
good,"The manager was always rude, didnt take other employees seriously, schedules are messed up.i did enjoy working around all kinds of different shoes and clothing."
good,The best part of my time there was that I worked alongside employees who knew how to make the work day enjoyable. Cross selling and up selling were musts and customers appreciated our work ethic. Management was an issue due to the transitions that occurred within store. Working especially in retail should be enjoyable for all.
good,It is a very solid company but also political where rewards and promotions are based on performance and who you know. Overall it was a good place to work.
good,I like working at Footlocker its a good company that that has organization and builds good employees to work their way up to a higher position. I was responsible for more things than other co-workers because I was trusted more by the managers.
good,"Foot locker was one of my first jobs, I completely enjoyed working at my store. All my managers and co-workers were amazing. Pay was my main reason to leave. You get awesome 30% employee discounts and quarterly 50% discounts that you can use at other foot lockers, champs, and lady foot lockers. You learn a lot about shoes and the value of money. Sometimes the hours you get depends on your stores revenue. Less money your store earns basically means how many hours the manager/Assistant managers can give part-timers.. Overall, it's a great place to start for anyone looking for a job."
good,Everyday theres something to different to do. Open up the store and print out daily goals and individual goals for the associates working that day. talking to different type of people. always a good vibe working in a mall. I learned leadership and how to train new employees and training new upcoming management. hardest part is starting to sell if you havent sold before but its a very fun way to learn retail and to sell. Most enjoyable part is interacting with people and helping customers find what fits them best.
good,i enjoyed working for this company but sadly due to poor communication from management i am no longer with the company.i with they give more opportunities to people who have been with the compny for years then maybe they employees would stick around longer.
good,Nice job for high school and college students. the discounts are nice however the hours aren't steady if you're part time. Very rude customers but also some very nice and funny customers
good,Working in King of Prussia mall was very fun and exciting. Being in charge of the tri-plex made it that much more busy. Having a large dependable staff my work easier.
good,"A typical day at work would always be different. That's the one thing I absolutely loved when I worked at Footlocker. Considering the fact that I am an extremely social person, I had the luxury of being capable of interacting with my customers throughout my entire shift. I learnt that customer service is very important and that the customer is always right even when they are not. The management was good, they were always there to help if ever one needed and for that I was thankful. On to the workplace, it was a very fun and independent job. Being a sales rep, we were all on our own in regards to making sales and commission. This being said, was both the hard part of the job but if done well, was the best part. It was important that the workers hustled to make sales and were being as helpful to the customers as possible."
good,"ambiente veloce e stimolante,possibilita di imparare velocemente e crescere"
good,Entry Level Position - Good stepping stone to Management. Flexible with college schedule. Great working with people of various backgrounds and ethnic groups.
good,Was very fun and productive but was. It enough money for me. The managers are great . I works sales and stock manager . And it was great I got 11 dollars an hour .
good,a typical day at footlocker consists of hard work that doesn't really feel like hard work at all. the environment was always friendly and very enjoyable.
good,"Awesome environment, great work aspect daily tasks that were fun and great to achieve. two of the managers weren't right they couldn't do their work properly though the manager there now is ok."
good,"vendita , gestione , marketing , trattative , consulenza"
good,"Je suis un amateur de chaussures donc j'ai bien aimer cette expérience, mais c'était temporaire je compter pas vouloir évoluer à footlocker ."
good,"Les journées ne sont pas routinières mais dépendent de l'affluence en magasin, comme dans toute enseigne spécialisée dans la vente."
good,I usually worked weekdays so a regular day for me was always pretty slow. I learned how they organize the shoes and how to tell the difference between color ways a bunch of different stuff. I enjoyed talking and getting to know the customers who came in from all across the world. And the hardest part of the job in my opinion is being motivated to sell.
good,"So far, working there has been such a learning experice for me.  I've learned that i have to be quick on my feet and maintain a positive welcoming attittude at all times.  For the most part, my co workers and managers have made it easy for me to come to work and do my job efficiently because the amunt of support they give as a team.  The hardest part of working there would probably be the amount of time you're standing on your feet.  It can become overwhelming at times where the store is flooded with 40 people plus kids asking for shoes and help but again, the Foot Locker staff makes the load lighter then it actually is.  I appreciate everyone in my store because we are all working towards our personal goals but overall the goal to be the best Foot Locker location.  The part i enjoy most about my job is when families come in and they need their feet measured, so many different personalities but they all have their specific taste in shoes and if they don't know then by the time their to the register they have complete knowledge of it."
good,I enjoy working for Foot Locker but now that I am a single mother of 3 I believe my kids need me more than work does. I want to be there for my children to be able to put them to sleep and help them with homework and attend their games when needed or even practice. Family is very important and when there is only one adult involved I think is a bit harder.
good,"The company overall has a great training program, exceptional benefits, and good coworkers.  In my opinion the only downfall they have is the belief of investing in younger candidates too soon.  This is not necessarily the DMs fault or Store Managers faults but, If they were able to refine and focus on maturing their sales leads and assistant managers more before they promoted them I think that everybody would feel a lot more secure.  Also providing an environment for their current managers that allows them to thrive rather than struggle would provide security for the company as well as lower level District Managers as well as Market Leaders and Store Managers.  In the end I had a lot of love for the company and the people I worked with. I hope the best for my previous coworkers and wish them the best of success."
good,"A typical day consisted of emails, keeping the store neat and organized (stockroom and sales floor), training employees, studying product knowledge, practicing communication skills, interacting with all teammates, reviewing sale goals for the day and week, readjusting prices, conference calls, scheduling interviews. Management is strict on policy. Co-workers were very easy to get a long with and very responsible. The hardest part of the job was giving employees a reason to smile when coming into work. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I was the reason they would smile coming into work. I have learned that there can be awesome friendships to come about while working for a company and better opportunities can arise from giving excellent customer service (you never know who can walk in the door)."
good,"Footlocker is a fun, productive place to work. You meet new people and learn new things. While working there, I've up'd my people skills alot."
good,"Throughout my 3 years working for Footlocker, I have seen and done many things that have benefited the company. I have worked with many different management teams and have seen the difference between productive and unproductive workers. I have been able to take these observations and apply it to my work ethics when working with customers. I have made amazing friendships with most of the staff I have met at footlocker and know these friendships will last a lifetime. Footlocker is not just a part time job for me, it is my family."
good,love the environment in the place and the people are great to work with. the community it is in is very nice and the customers are great
good,The best part about MC Roofing and Remodeling is that the boss is a great guy and has became a good friend of mine. He works just as hard as the guys he hires and is always open to answer questions if needed.
good,My experience was overall great. I learned a lot from a few great managers and the camaraderie was at best what one made it. The atmosphere remained highly competitive whether it was the last day of the fiscal year or during peak season.
good,A typical work day is talking people into buying shoes and having knowledge about each shoe. I learned that dealing with the public is very hard but you have to be as nice as possible. The manager was great until I left for school. I loved working with my co-workers everyone was so sweet. The hardest part of the job was knowing which shoe comes out on which day.
good,"My manager is amazing, she will help you out with any customer if she sees your having some trouble. Will work with you and around any schedule that you might have. All co-workers get along with each other. Get to better your people skills."
good,"i learned how to deal with a big crowds of customers , gain more hands on skills with the public. working there was something i really enjoyed. i caught on to all the skills quick  and it was a breezy ."
good,Great job for ages 17-22 really. My manager was so sweet she hired me on as an assistant manager. We had fun everyday I worked. I never did not want to go to work!
good,"This was a good company to work for  in the retail world, it help you understand the importance of customer service.  They gave you a good product to sale to make you a success."
good,"This job is just like any other retail oriented job you will find. You have to deal with customers day in day out. Being able to hold your temper and handle the worst of situations is what you're being paid for. Customer service will push your limits and test your strength in being to handle every situation professional and with a smile. Customer may not always be right but you have no choice in the matter. They make your company what it is. Fast paced, and short brakes is typical."
good,"This place will hire just about anyone. Even 15-16 year olds. I worked in E-Care, so you just answered emails and responded to customer chats, and helped them with issues. Didn't learn a whole lot, other then better ways to perform customer service."
good,"Leading a team of 6 employees on a daily bases was great, i have gained many of my manager skills from here and it is always a fun time with customer and with fellow employees. the hardest part of the job was dealing with theft,  the most enjoyable part was building a team that i could rely on always and having fun at work every day."
good,"On this job since high school it really taught me alot, the management was always good,I moved around from store to store helping out when needed and was alway greeted with a smile."
good,"Depending on the day and time, the prediction of commission varies. Inconsistent with pay is definitely a down fall. However, the strive for ambition based off goals is a definite plus. both co-workers and updated media stream keeps the very vibrant field up beats and exciting to work. over all not to bad of a working station yet not satisfied with neither the service nor labor load."
good,"The job situation was great, but the wages were just not enough to sustain a family.  I would work there again if the wages were better."
good,"great work place, with flexible hours and down to earth management,, real people that care about others."
good,"I come into work and start my day by seeing what the goal for the day is,what needs to be done or changed and help anybody that comes in through our doors. My co-workers are fun good people. My managers are down to earth and have an open free flowing environment. The hardest part of the job I would say are long days when it's slow. The most enjoyable part is working with customers."
good,I enjoyed working here just wished they paid the store managers better. It was amazing to see people in line at 6 a.m. to get a shoe release.
good,"I loved working for all Lockers, Lady, Kids, World, and Foot. I learned a great deal about shipping and receiving and human resources. I also enjoyed my title of Group Leader while I worked in the Bay area."
good,"I was able to help my store reach sales goals but communicating with cutomers about products they were seeking, also building up additional merchandise to a sale. At times I was a cash handler."
good,"A fun atmosphere and a great place to work if you are looking to get into retail. The busiest times are holidays and August (back to school), but typically the work day is pretty steady and you have tasks to keep you busy. The hardest part of this job would be standing all day."
good,This is a great starter position for any High school student or young adult. The compensation DOES NOT meet or come close to the work done.
good,"Typical day would consist of helping customers find a product meeting their needs. I also helped in training new employees, store audits, product organization and stocking,"
good,love the working enviroment but the pay does not add up to the amount of work you put into the job everyday. expect to work all day friday saturday and some sunday. expect to stand for long hours in a day.
good,"Fast paced"
good,"Each day was different and exciting as a District Manager with "
good,"very friendly and great engaging with customers."
good,"At Kid's footlocker , I learned efficient and effective sales associate skills."
good,"Never a dull minute which I love. There is always customers, shipment, floor set ups and cleaning to do. It is a great group of people to work with and I learn something new every time I work."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of working towards company targets of selling items per day."
good,you are on commission so its a good place to hone your sales skills if that's something you're interested in. plenty of room to grow.
good,"Work is full of great energy, from customers to employees. Driving sales daily to meet goals. You work with a bunch of great people from coworkers to managers and all have a fair chance at gaining hours. The hardest part of this job i would say is trying to persuade people into buying something they do not want. But i love meeting and seeing new faces every day."
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company, they offered great discounts and the co-workers were very friendly."
good,"open up doors"
good,This was a good place to work. It didn't pay well but it was flexible with your class schedule. The discount on shoes will make you own more pairs than you ever wanted
good,"Typical day at work would see if it was busy when we first came in, first thing would be is to help customers asap. If not, we'd do stock, organize displays, clean shelves, counters, windows, etc. fill shoe walls, take out garbage. I learned to talk and welcome customers, work fast when it gets busy, how to color cornet everything, etc. "
good,Footlocker is a great company with a lot of opportunity to advance. The job demands a lot of your time and there is little free time for family.   Great for a young single person.
good,Its a great environment with great people that share the passion of shoes and cloths. Management all depends on the area.
good,"Excellent ""first"" job. Teaches you the basics for the real world."
good,"Working at Foot Locker was a great experience. Fast advancement, interacting with new and exciting people on a daily basis."
good,"Un buen trabajo,movido y con apenas pausas.Pero me gusta trabajar en empresas de textiles"
good,Working there was enjoyable especially if you have an interest in nike basketball products and shoes.  The negatives are what goes on behind the scenes with management and all the politics that are associated with upper management.  employees are seen as expendable and moved without any consideration of personal situations/preferences.  hours are sporadic and leave very little time for activities/life outside of work.
good,"-A typical day at work is basically always making sure clients are getting legendary customer service.Making sure that I am aware of the sales and promotions when starting shift."
good,"This particular company taught me the importance of having a solid team. A particular team member is only strong as the weakest person on the team, therefore its important to help when needed be a all around team player"
good,They are very people oriented and care how the people leave the store. Everyone there is almost like family.
good,although the job was sometimes slow I would work for my manager again in a heart beat.
good,"selling shoes to the ladies, enjoying customers, setting up displays in the store and store contests between other stores, encouragement from other stores even though we competed for prizes and sales quotas"
good,"I open or close the store sometimes both. Clean the store. Sell sneakers and cleaning products."
good,"Une véritable équipe de sport, à Foot Locker le travail d'équipe et l'esprit de compétition prime avant tous. Les objectifs sont personnel mais aussi collectif. A ce titre, j'ai développé mon goût du challenge et mon sens du relationnel."
good,"A typical Footlocker workday was about 10 hours average. It involved providing customer service to clients needing sneakers and athletic apparel. Day to day operations including shipping or receiving, stocking new product, visual changes, and sale set up would also be performed throughout the work day. I learned a lot by being able to interact with my customers. It helped me overcome being shy. I learned tactical ways to reduce the chances of theft as well. Being store manager and having to take on such a large responsibility I learned floor awareness to aid with loss prevention. The Regional Vice President is top notch, but the company went through a wave of different District Manager changes, numerous times, which provided inconsistency in operations and instability in leadership. The hardest part of the job was walking away from it. The most enjoyable and rewarding part of the job was having a customer buy a product from you because the company took the time to invest in the product knowledge material and adequate training. The Footlocker company is an overall great company to work for. They are an employer who cares for their team members and I am happy to have been a part of it.  "
good,fun place to work just closed a bunch of store around my area very easy to sell shoes 
good,I love the store but I feel with my customer service skills I am able to move up and succeed at a higher level.
good,A shift at Foot Locker consists of following the tasks the Manager has let or not completed. Push the part timers and casuals to make budget and focus on selling KVI(key volume items). Run the opening and closing of the store if the Manager was not on site. The hardest part about this job was that I new I had to leave after 2 years of my visa. Living and working in the Canadian Rockies is all i have to say cos that has and I think will always be the high light of my life.
good,"I loved working here because most of my pay was commission based and once in a good location,i was able to build a steady stream of customers. I learned that product knowledge is very important, to adapt to different customers' needs. I worked with very cool and fun people including management. The hardest part of this job was during the slow months and days, which meant that commission was low."
good,Open the store and set up merchandise in a presentable fashion. Clean and organize work space so that everything goes smoothly throughout the day. Friendly greet customers and assist them with questions or requests. Work the cash register and close sales. Clean store and lock up for the day. Management was very laid back but enforced rule at the same time.
good,"Foot Locker is a great job for those who are very passionate about shoes and sports apparel. You get to inform other customers and share your interest with them while getting paid. The pay is great, it's hourly PLUS commission which is good. The discounts are also very beneficial for those who love sneakers. The hours there vary depending on location, and sales. But other than that, it is a great aura to be in and very fast pace work place."
good,Providing sales and customer service through the procurement of athletic shoes and clothing.
good,"normally a fun place to work except for the holidays. very, very busy...the hardest part is cleaning the store at the end of the night and long hours. the best part is the management and coworkers...."
good,"Great place to work. Benefits sucked but great discount. Higly motivated to sell through orginization of sales contests with great prizes. Visits from Nike, Adidas, and other sneaker manufacturers for product training."
good,Always fun and exciting when your with working with a great crew You have great productive days and customers all ways seem to enjoy your customer service.
good,I enjoyed working with the customers. this is a very fast pace job which keeps a person busy and active.
good,"Having worked at all three of the Foot Locker branches, I would have to admit Men's Foot Locker was probably my favorite because of the amazing people I had the opportunity to work with. Definitely enjoyed this job while i was in High School, but this is no career."
good,"My day at work would start at me opening the store and making sure everything is in palce for customers to arrive. I greet all customers as they come into the store and help them with anything they need and make sure they leave satisfied. I have to give whatever associate their training if they need it. The associates that I worked with were not very well trained at all before I can so i did the best i could to make them the best employees I could, they were hard workers. one of hardest parts of my job was doing an audit because it can be stressful if everything isnt adding up right and you know its yu job on the line. But the hardest part of my job was to bring the store up in value because it was 50,000 in the negative and my job was to bring it up and that was super hard because very few people came in the store."
good,Great place to start customers are a huge deal and making them happy is priority. Fast placed envoirment where skill meets experience. A great team earns results and the days go by with the level of work to do. Best of times is when the customer gets what they are looking for and are no longer frustrated for the right purchase.
good,It is a good job but it is not a good paying job unless you are in management
good,"A typical day is coming in to work, punching in, putting up and paperwork or stock, doing any visuals on the sales floor, and servicing my customers. I have learned a lot from many different people. I have had five different district managers over five years and each one was different from the next. Management is fun. I have the chance to lead my team to greatness. My co-workers are sometimes lazy and I feel that I am literally by myself some days. I have hired some new people that are turning out to be great additions. They are motivated and I like that very much. The hardest part of the job is having to deal with the favoritism that my district manager shows to others and the negativity that he displays towards those who do not so to speak ""brown nose."" I am not one of those people and everything right that we do, we do not get any recognition for it and it feels like I am wasting my time doing it. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping my customers. They are why I have a job and that is the reason why I go to work everyday."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of open and close store, organizing paperwork and cash tenders, sales, setting up promotional visuals, training staff and inventory management."
good,"A typical day,I would arrive at 830a open computer and reveiw company directives for the day. I would review sales goals for the store and set personal goals for all scheduled associates. The store opened at 10a. The rest of the day was dedicated to delivering the highest level of cutomer service in the industry. I learned alot about how to manage people and situations to produce a desirable outcome. The hardest part of my job was not really being in charge. The most enjoyable part of my job was then immediate gratification you get when you satify a customer."
good,"Enjoyed this position for many years, seviced customers by helping them buy shoes in which fit their walk of life,"
good,"The job was cool. I like the fact that I could interact with people and make them happy. The people I worked around was very easy to work with. I just wish the pay was better but overall, it was okay."
good,"Good customer service, well organized, well clean sale's floor, employees kind with each other, always willing to help customers especially if they don't have the shoe the customer is asking for they manage to keep the customer happy."
good,I will love to have this job so I can  help my mother pay bills and take care of my lil sisters and to show my mother she raised a man and so I can learn how to take care of myself when I hit the road on my own
good,"footlocker is a good job for some one who is looking for a part time job like a student , easily moved up in the company is you show good work ethic over all easy job"
good,"A typical work day is easy & enjoyable."
good,"Tremendous training provided, with pre-established training for an advancement in customer service capabilities. Work Force Management is unfortunately rigid and uncompromising.  Surroundings are casual but professional.  Outside of WFM stringency, a good place to work!"
good,"Had tons of great people working there.  Always room for advancement.  Great place to work if you love shoes, the benefits/discounts are amazing.  Overall fantastic place."
good,Good place to work overall it’s not a hard job at all its a great place to work depending on if your a people person and if you like or is into shoes or a real sneaker person
good,"It's fairly slow on weekdays, so weekends are really where you get time to shine. You don't get that many hours at first, maybe 4-6 hours a week before it switches up. The benefits are reasonable, but in order to use your black card aka discount card, you have to pay with your own card or the person you're swiping the discount for has to pay for the shoe or apparel in cash. The ladders in the stock room where all the shoes are aren't as scary as they seem, but you definitely have to be careful when going up them. ALWAYS ask for help. Never feel discouraged to ask someone that can't find a shoe. I'm still struggling when it comes to the Men's section, so I use my mic to an advantage. Footlocker is a team oriented job, you won't struggle unless you sit around and do absolutely nothing."
good,Good job was fun working there only thing is that you really have to pay attention to where stuff is in the store or you would really have a difficult time finding shoes for customers
good,"Needs Improvement with time management and scheduling. Sometimes it was stressful due to managers being somewhat unorganized and also too friendly to other employees. Also, Favoritism was shown a lot at the Savannah location I worked at."
good,"Working for footlocker is a good job especially for those that are in high school, the perks are great, and the employees there are great people. You learn fast about how to treat and attend to customer needs and making sure they're satisfied with there purchase. Management could be a little bit better but the managers are typically good to the employees. Nothing really hard about this job. It is a good and interesting place to work in."
good,It’s a chill place to work if you like shoes. The pay could be better. Some days you hit your sale goals and some days you don’t. Can be competitive at times.
good,Liked being around the customers and the staff. Need to Imotive on team meetings had very few goal meetings or sometime of knowledge back on sales and maybe have salesman watch trading videos more regularly
good,"Fun work atmosphere lots of competition for sales lots of different people to engage with customers, managers support team in driving sales goals and creating incentives to support"
good,Loved working there many great co workers and a very calm work environment and the managers are very helpful the work environment has many task associated with it
good,"-Start off with paperwork and opening the registers. Help the customers and complete the daily tasks that are given to us each day."
good,Le management est pas très bien fait sur certains lieu
good,"I enjoyed the crew, co-managers and over all of what I was doing with this company. We were all on the same page. I had a chance to grow within the company."
good,"vendeuse caissière ré-assortisseuse, ambiance super chouette entourée que des meilleurs collègues"
good,"Foot locker is a really good place to work great hours, money, and meet some good people. Overall I’d love to have a second shot at working at footlocker."
good,I loved working here because im in to shoes and this was one of my first job during highschool so i loved working there in that environment thats where i learn work ethics
good,When working at foot locker dealing with the public has its pros and cons you have good customer service desk very polite and you have rude customers but took office to keep a smile on your face and make them happy in anyway that you can
good,"Permetto una grande crescita professionale e personale."
good,"its ok nothing unusual. if your able to handle rude, indecent customers this is a good starter job and the discount is good if your a sneaker head but its best that you don't get into arguments with your manager"
good,"Foot locker is a fast paced environment, but management does not always embrace what the employees have going on outside of work.  Managers usually work 12 hour shifts with minimal relief or coverage."
good,"Work place was pretty nice yet very slow. We weren't really visible being at the top corner of a mall, so time was dragging. That being said, the job consisted of folding new clothing. Even so, it was so slow we had to grab folded clothes, unfold them and refold them just so the cameras don't make it seems like we aren't doing anything. Job got tiring, and wasn't paying good enough to be dealing with it so I decided to leave."
good,Foot Locker was a great place for part-time work while attending school. It is a fast paced work environment that keeps you on track and everyone is always helpful.
good,"I started at footlocker when I was 18 all the way through Uni at 21. I went from P/T sales to F/T sales and then onto assistant manager. Though the wages aren't that great, and we weren't even given a water filter in the back it was a good memory. If footlocker gave more to it's employee's in terms of being able to earn raises instead of flat-out saying no, they would have a much better time maintaining quality staff instead of hiring everyone who came through there doors with a pulse. The discount was nice, 30% regularly and then periodically ""50 days"" where we would get 50% off, but Head Offie would decide an ""exclusion list"" where all the nicer stuff was not included. When you were in the right store with good management going to work is fun, and you want to learn about shoes and you care about where you work! I loved the time I had at footlocker, but it was time to grow up!"
good,"This was a job I came into very timid and introverted. After my first couple of months I got the hang of talking to customers, but the real boost I got from the job was confidence. Being able to sell and communicate with strangers helped me make connections and network once I left. I was set a low ceiling by managers due to my timid attitude, but I broke through them by showing I had what it took to become an Assistant Manager. It enables you to learn on the fly and enabled me to realize my full potential."
good,I love helping people and getting back comments from the surveys the customers would take. Being able to keep the backstock organized helped us associates be faster with our service on busy days so our customers wouldn’t be waiting so much.
good,"Overall footlocker is a comfortable place to work. It has given me valuable experience, and I have learned a lot. I am looking for something that pays more now so I can continue my career. The company is not doing great the past 2 years so there are very few promotions being made."
good,"a typical day at work is competitive & fast paced"
good,I like working here have no big problems with the company at all. Traffic makes you stay busy thru your whole shift. When you enjoy talking to customers you have no problem everyday.
good,"A typical day at Footlocker is easy, fun, productive. During the day you greet customers, and ask what they are shopping for, once the customer finds something you would then bring out the product and allow them to try it on. You make the customer feel welcomed and safe."
good,"Customers usually do not know what to buy or are just looking. I learned that the job is not just about trying to sell shoes to customers but to connect and build long term professional relationships so they are willing to return to our store. The workplace culture is great. There is always good music playing. The hardest part of the job is trying to sell to customers who are ""just looking."" The best part of the job is that you get to meet so many different people and talk to them about shoes."
good,"Opening responsibilities are to make sure merch is viable and clean"
good,I love working at footlocker it help me a lot with people and how to talk to them. They push me to be better. Footlocker is one of the best places i work so far.
good,I enjoy communicating with different customers that comes into the store and it's always a pleasure selling them what they want or need! Shoes or apparel!
good,Yes there are more positives than negatives however I think both sides are something you should take into consideration. If you're trying to raise a family I feel that this is not the greatest option.
good,"Great co-workers and environment to be a part of. There was little to no training for the position so it took a couple weeks to figure everything out, but it was a fun job overall."
good,Footlocker is a company to learn the day to day operations to learn the aspects of business. I polished my leadership skills and taught me how to be a hard worker
good,"I enjoy working there, but the retail industry isn't where I want to be. A typical workday involves working with customers and other staff of the workplace and mall"
good,as a high school student its a fun job to have. it allows you to get good discounts on clothes and shoes while preparing you with the skills to become better at sales and customer service
good,"its an easy job. I love the management staff. All of my coworkers are friendly and everyone gets along. There's no conflict and if anyone has an issue, it is addressed without a problem."
good,It was a great place to work fun and active people who always had a smile on there face. It’s upbeat and has a great energy in the work place a very clean place with an organized stock room.
good,"The Foot Locker environment is quite fun. For multiple reasons, if your shoe enthusiast it's the perfect job. As you get to work with all shoot different brands. Allowing you to talk about something you love and enjoy providing providing you with the sense of happiness."
good,This company was very flexible with my class schedule. My manager is great and is very understanding when I am unable to work. I also enjoyed working alongside my coworkers.
good,"Foot Locker is great job depending on the volume size of the store, and depending on the people that work there. Management is okay the higher ups are good, but most district managers are trying to hard to impress their bosses instead of making sure that the managers under them have everything that they need."
good,"It was a decent relaxed job but your experience largely depends on the management you have. Since commission is no longer something Foot Locker is offering, there really isn't any bonuses now, to the job other than the 30% employee discount. Besides that, it is an ordinary sales associate job."
good,Really fun and easy job! Meet new people everyday but you have to be able to move quickly and have a positive attitude at all times! Overall it’s a great company to work for
good,Very good company to work for. The advancement to management is measurable. I enjoyed working my way up to management but did not like the fact there were no advancement beyond management.
good,"This job was so much fun. The environment was very energetic. Staff would have friendly competitions to see who could sell the most seeing as commission was part of our pay. It was always fun and exciting. The hardest part of the job was un-stocking and restocking. Other than that this job was wonderful . The discount was great, the people where great and the job all around was just fun."
good,"Foot locker est une entreprise americaine ou j ai acquis une expérience professionnelle que ne n aurais put imaginé ! Que ce soit au niveau du management tant bien au niveau relationnel c est un programme complet de formation ou j ai énormément appris !"
good,Good place if u wanna learn how to sell  persuade and learn good customer service always good to smile and be attentive and ready to help/work .. I learned a lot
good,"Great customer experience, being able to engage with different people on the daily. gaining knowledge about footwear from top brands. Being able to meet players from different sports"
good,Footlocker was a good job for me to get a taste of what it was like to actually work for someone for compnesation. I must say i learned alot from my very first job.
good,"Overall, Footlocker.com/Eastbay is a good company to work for.  They try to work with staff to balance work and life events.  The 30% employee discount is nice as well as the benefits.  It would be nice if the pay was adequate for the work that is done."
good,Footlocker is a very flexible company that allows you to be able to work the hours that you want. Product knowledge is key in working here. The commission is well worth it during peak seasons.
good,great place to work for younger kids because of the salary. lack of hours but an overall great job to bring in some kind of income. ver laid back work
good,"working for footlocker has taught me time management, my manager(s) have always been understanding and knowledgeable. the job is not so much as hard, just competitive on the sales floor. if you want a bigger check you have to work for it. i worked at a smaller store and i enjoyed how close knit the company is."
good,"I’ve been with this company for over 12 years. Its been a pleasant journey going through the growth of the company throughout my tenure and working along some great, influentual people in my career."
good,"Footlocker is a fast-paced working environment that takes a lot of patience and strategy. Once you get used to the work you find it to be easy. You learn more about shoes and what they are like, but you learn even more about selling them."
good,Foot Locker is a major global player in the athletic footwear and apparel business.  Great place to learn about the retail business and you can do well if you have good management support.
good,The management is terrible. They use to steal my hours. The people in management feel as though they are above the employees and have to do minimal work. In my year of working there the only good thing about it was the discount.
good,"If you can manage your time well, multi task and be a team member, this is a good place to work. Casual work place where your personal life can still exist, flexible."
good,I really learned how to talk to customers from this job you have to engage with the customer to find out what they like so you can make suggestions for them. i really enjoyed getting to know alot about the customers.
good,"satisfying customers as well as doing what was asked of you by management, you have to deal with all kinds of people from different walks of life, being acceptable to learn new things and if you didn't know to get help ask manager"
good,"sorted items and put them where they needed to go"
good,"Fast pace, fun, a good high school work job. "
good,Very fun job if you're not a shy person and like to sell. Awesome clientele and something different everyday.  Very cool to be around the shoe culture.
good,"La relation avec la clientèle est cool , les journées passer vite car j'aime Mon travail"
good,Not a boring job. Awesome if you're a people's person. The job is easy to understand for the most part. Shoe-knowledge is not a requirement contrary to popular belief.

good,"I enjoy my time in Lady Foot Locker! Learned a lot! I can recommend this place for students to be able to earn some money and can pay"
good,I have learned much from Foot Locker inc. as well as help develop new skills and better my weaknesses. I have been with the company throughout my years in high school and college and I have always found a place within Foot Locker that i may call home.
good,if your great with communicating with people and love to talk and persuade this is definite the job for you. its very competitive because we have sales goals to meet
good,"a typical day at work is stock room customer service making sure everything is in order and neat. rude customers , clean environment, i learned how to work with certain people and how to treat them"
good,"Typical retail job, very customer service oriented,learn a lot about footwear and the body and footwear is good for that person's sport and feet. The only thing is you definitely can't get a set schedule."
good,my typical day was usually calm. I learned how to interact with different kinds of people. One of the hardest parts was distributing when a new pair of shoes hit the store and everyone rushes into the store.
good,Bon lieu de stage dans l'ensemble et très formateur dans le domaine commercial.
good,"I have a passion for fashion, music, and helping people, so this job was nearly ideal for me. At times my creativity was stunted, and guidelines were required to follow. The company encourages innovation and a family like atmosphere. I learned some very valuable lessons working with this company."
good,I learned how to scan and package boxes for shipment to shoe stores worldwide. I learned how to replace materials out of the old box and put them in a new one while keeping the labeling from the old package.
good,Bonne ambiance . Je ne suis pas rester assez longtemps pour juger .
good,If you enjoy helping people find the latest and greatest shoes and apparel and giving great customer service this is your spot.  I learned so much and owe a lot to my time at Footlocker Inc. I started here as a young man not quite sure about a whole lot and the manager that started me off was a big influence in helping me grow up and he instilled responsibility and the importance of it in me. I was taught to create a fun but take care of business way of doing things and as a store manager I always tried to create a fun and enjoyable place for my employees to come to work at. The culture on the back end was sales driven and merchandise orientated. Upper management was good they always supported us in anything we tried and were open to our ideas. The hardest part of this job was usually the holiday hours as we were required to work long hours for a certain amount of time but it was only one time a year and was not to bad. I am very fortunate to have worked with great people here and making life long friends across the state of New Mexico and Colorado.
good,"Footlocker is a great place for a ""Sneaker Freak"" or students. It has great discounts and is a really good place to start for a part time job that teaches you the fundamental skills you need in most retail and sales strategy businesses."
good,"If you are looking to get into this field of work, footlocker is the place to be. Job security is there. They are gradually getting better at taking care of their associates but more can be done and probably will be. There is a ceiling that you hit with them depending on how fast you progress."
good,They are very nice. Footlocker environment is fun and energetic. Cons and pros like any job. Overall it was fun interacting with customers. You make friends and the chance to make someone's day.
good,I enjoyed my time at Footlocker. The weekdays were usually rough because it wasn't very busy. Weekends were usually high paced and where the money was made. Everyone I worked with was into most of the stuff I was so it was easy to get along. My first manager who hired me treated us like one of his friends but was still about the company and driving sales. We had a change in management and he was a little older so us younger employees were not that close with him.
good,"Trabajo dinámico, buen ambiente y con mucha compenetración entre compañeros."
good,"I enjoyed working there for the amount that I was there for. I made some good friends and met some amazing customers. My manager wasn't as friendly as he made himself out to be but its life. Besides that, I enjoyed the experience."
good,Sales/performance driven company. Focus on people and their ability to engage with both internal and external customer. Drive for personal success will lead to opportunities within the company
good,I enjoy my time at Foot Locker because of the constant customer interaction. The management team is excellent. There is little room for growth in the company and wages/compensation are poor.
good,"Fast pace, busy work environment. Management is friendly and resourceful. Great teamwork from co-workers. Hardest part of job is dealing with impatient customers. Overall good company"
good,"basically what I did and learned at footlockers was organize the merchandise by style, size and color in the stock room and then secure garments with the corresponding alarms, remove security tags from merchandise and scanned merchandise for Inventory check. management made sure we did our jobs but they did a good job of what they did."
good,Working at footlocker can be very fun with the right management team like any other job. I really did enjoy my time there. The hardest part of my job was trying to buy every shoe that was released.
good,"Servicio al cliente"
good,I learned that giving your all has to be balanced between you and your management team. Everyone has to be on the same page and motivated with a winning attitude.
good,A typical work day was very slow but their was always something that needed done. I enjoyed working with my coworkers that I had. I enjoyed helping customers that came in.
good,"i have been with this company for 3 years now and meeting new people everyday is a bliss. It's challenging as you have to meet the customers needs without hesitation.However, I enjoy working for this company."
good,"great place to work however not a lot of money being made and not enough hours given. No benefits unless you are a manager. it is a very fast paced job you are always moving. co-workers are good and bad but you don't come to make friends. the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and customers. management is okay however, they do tend to have their bias towards people."
good,I learned how to help people out and work out of my area. my co works were nice and helpful. its a shoe store im just tierd working in a shoe company.
good,Went from being so shy to now being confident. You Learn and grow. Easy job to do. Fast pace. They teach you everything from folding to operations. Great job if it's your first job.
good,Footlocker is a great place for young people to start their careers. I helped manage and reduce shrinkage in the company during my time with the company.
good,"The job in its entirety was ok. It was a good place to work, if in the right area. It was upbeat and energetic for most of the day, but usually nothing too exciting. Footlocker is a good job in the Suburbs, and areas where there is high volume and money to be made. At the same time, it is a good way to get in the door if your looking at other business venues. It's not a company that I says does their best to promote from the inside. It's all about favoritism. Foot locker reminded me of high school."
good,It is a great job for a teenager a good job experience to start with for a kid trying to learn how to manage money. You have a few perks like 30% discount and shoes your being able to qualify for.
good,"A typical day at work consists in always keeping clean the store, fold the clothes and pair socks. The managment was always clean and the co-workers were good workers. The most enjoyable part of the day was when the store gets crowded thats when I feel the joy of finding shoes in less than a minute and having it ready for the costumer."
good,Lady Foot Locker was my first starter job when I was in high school. It was enjoyable but boring at times. I enjoyed my coworkers. The customers are what made it worse. I had to find other employment due to lack of hours.
good,"I've gained a lot of experience with Footlocker INC. The training program is excellent! Although the work hours can be tough, stick with it and you'll move up."

good,Being able to help customers in need with material from my store. Everyday you gain knowledge of the new sneakers that coming out and meeting new people
good,fun job in  a nice working environment and you gain a lot of skills that will allow you to move up in the company. it is a bit competitive you make your money on commission

good,"working at footlocker is challenging, the management are helpful and encouraging. Learnt how to treat different genres of people."
good,"You start by putting your uniform. After that you clock yourself in. Then your work start. My task was to bring the shoes to the salesman, who sell it to the customer to avoid theft i'm also in charge to bring the shoebox at the register"
good,great company to gain experience and learn how to become a great sells person. You make most of your money from commission so if you do not sell you will not make money.
good,"J'ai passé d'excellentes années a évoluer au sein de cette enseigne."
good,"A typical day at work consists of providing the knowledge of shoes to customers. Its been almost 2 years since I've started working there and I've learned so much more about shoes that I didn't already know. I love working there, my co-workers are great I get along with everyone very well. The hardest part of the job would have to be trying to please the customer if there's something we don't know or cant do for them. But the most enjoyable part would be meeting new people and encountering with different people everyday. Also being around something you love everyday."
good,Great work environment to learn and grow. Lots of exciting new and releases of new products and fitness events weekly provide a great change of pace and newness to each week.
good,Positive working environment with good training.  Good for someone starting out in retail management as it provides a good atmosphere for learning the industry.  Pay is on the low end.
good,"While working here, you'll learn how to complete many different tasks and grow as an employee. Experience will be gained with the amount of different conflicts encountered but will be beneficial when having to problem solve on your own. Gaining customer service experience is also a factor that will be obtained."
good,Footlocker taught me how to be my self and brought me out of my shell. The hardest part of the job was standing for the entire shifts.
good,"This was my first and longest job. Foot Locker is a great place to start off a job career. The training program is by far the best. Its not an easy company to move up quickly in, but hard work pays off."
good,"Start off with team meeting, discus what team and individual target are. Greet customers and approach and find out what they are looking for."
good,My time at Footlocker was always unexpected because we worked with different customers everyday. As a cashier I enjoyed talking with the customers and confirming their experience was enjoyable. I learned to work with different people including some of my colleagues to reach a common goal. Although some customers can be difficult my managers taught me how serve them and fulfill their request to my best of my abilities.  My favorite part about working at Footlocker is learning how to make good customer relationships and improving my work ethic.
good,A typical work day is to sale food and work the cash register and clean. I learned how to multi task and commumnication skills.
good,"La valoración personal es muy buena, la única  pega es que me ocupa muy poco tiempo, pero estoy muy contento."
good,"Kids Foot Locker was a high school job. My day at Kids Foot Locker consisted of customer service and helping my customers get the items they wanted. I would keep up the store maintenance so that it made the customers experience desirable to shop. My manager taught me how to gain sales and also how to get them to add more items to the initial purchase. Kids Foot Locker was a fairly small store, including management we had about 6 employees. We were a young team, and everyone was easy going and got along. There was nothing hard about this job. The most enjoyable part of my job was that while working and giving great customer service, we made work fun."
good,"A typical day at work for me was greeting customers and helping them to find the best shoe for them. the things that i learned while at footlocker was how to interact with people while trying to sell them a shoe that they didnt know much about. The footlocker team and management are a good group of people with positive energy all the time so it was fun to be around them. The hardest part of my job was dealing with rude customers and having to keep a positive attitude, and the most enjoyable was being around the staff."
good,"I come into work and start my day by seeing what the goal for the day is,what needs to be done or changed and help anybody that comes in through our doors. My co-workers are fun good people. My managers are down to earth and have an open free flowing environment. The hardest part of the job I would say are long days when it's slow. The most enjoyable part is working with customers."
good,"Typically dealt with customers."
good,"I loved interacting with people all day, it is a great FIRST job. But that's it. Not enough to build a comfortable life off of this pay, even if you move up."
good,The Management is great there and I like helping people find what they need. The only things I don't like is that I only get scheduled 2 days per week and not for a full 8 hours and the pay is not too good. I need a full-time position and more pay.
good,"A typical day was opening and closing store, prepping for opening and doing daily huddles to provide store and individual goals.  Inventory was processed daily and training.  Our objective was to service each customer with enthusiasm and a smile.  Our goal was to create Lifers or repeat customers that they would enjoy their shopping experience with us and share it with someone else.  I had a great relationship with Management and most co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was processing the daily inventory and trying to be creative in finding space to put it.  The extremely long hours with limited personnel for proper floor coverage made it difficult to take breaks at all.  One of the  most enjoyable part of the job was being recognized as Rookie Manager of the Year, Manager of the Year (2), Manager-Trainer of the Year, Silver Circle of Excellence, among many other Sales Leadership Awards.  However, the greatest part of the job was making an impact to someone else, seeing their growth and development for promotional opportunities."
good,Un lavoro dove bisognava dare aiuto ai clienti e supportarli nelle loro scelte
good,All jobs performed were typically easy to learn but yet fun to come into work and complete. The management were friendly and capable of handling all situations. The hardest part of the job was making your production values for the week.
good,très agréables super ambiance très bonne apprentissage. expertise de certains produit. pas le temps de prendre des pause
good,ho lavorato da foot loocker ed ho imparato molto la vendita assistita una parte molto difficile del lavoro era quella di riuscire a fare vendita complementare e a vendere molti piu prodotti vicino ad un articolo
good,"Pretty simple job, just selling shoes and other sports apparel. The hard part is reaching the sales goals that are set, especially on days when it is basically empty"
good,"A typical at Footlocker, sale shoes and other things in the store. It gets kind of busy"
good,"a lot of multitasking with customers , look for the right sneakers that suits them well for whatever they need it for , team work"
good,"Ran retail shoe store with 5 plus employees. In control of loss prevention, sales, payroll, marketing and P&L."
good,"A fast pace business at the height of the athletic shoes and apparel business. Company's values, culture and mission was a head of it's time. Manager were encouraged to run their stores as entrepreneur."
good,On a day to day basis I would interact with a variety of customers. I would help train part timers as well as fulfill my management duties. In the mornings for example there is a lot of paper work that needs to get done as well as make sure the store is clean and presentable to customers. At night we would clean the store from top to bottom to make sure the morning manager came into a clean store. There is also night paper work that must be completed before the end of the night. As part if the management staff I would ensure that all associates were following his/her sales goals to overall reach our stores sales goals and full potential.
good,A typical day at work would be us greeting customers and giving them the best customer service possible. I've learned at this job how to put the customer first and to satisfy their need whether its sizing their foot or suggesting specific products for their needs. All of my co-workers for the most part work as a team in order to reach store goals. By me being a member of management i can help by being a leader and setting examples for others to follow. There isnt anything hard about retail and the most enjoyable part of the job is having a customer return and shop again because of your great service provided.
good,Wish I would have applied early in high school. I would recommended this job to my children when they are looking for job while in high school. Employee incentives are awesome. Management very understand of availability during high school.
good,"Very fast paced, great employees and generally nice customers."
good,"	Handle cash transactions, including checks and credit card payments"
good,"Great Place to work for a starter job but seeing as they will not hire full time, I can only work 3 days a week at most. This does not pay the bills though and I struggle with it. The actual job is enjoyable, air condition store environment with great friendly co-workers and what you do is make sure that each customer gets the right product that they need."
good,"Sales driven, customer satisfaction and inventory . Helping Manager close and manage work area"
good,A typical day at work is clocking in and approaching every customer that walks in with a greeting and taking care of their wants and needs. Customer service plays the biggest role for footlocker.
good,"a day at work was meeting new people the smell of new leather, sports, and competitive selling. my favorite part of the job was learning about every shoe we had in the store personally so I would be able to make the customer happy with their choice of shoe. the hardest part of the job was receiving shipment."
good,"A typical day started with cleaning the store, making sure the floors and mirrors were cleaning, dusting all shelves wiping over all surfaces."
good,Learning about the newest shoes and sneakers and applying your knowledge towards your sales skills.
good,"During the course of the day we deal with a lot of different people.  Although they generally have a common goal in purchasing shoes and or athletic apparel, there are a ton of different people.  I would supervise the floor at times by myself or with team of two.  The best part of the job is being able to put a smile on ones face when they leave my store.  However the worst would probably have to be the times that it gets slow in our store."
good,"This company is a great place to start for your first job. I learned a lot about responsibility and corporate business policies that many kids my age still have no idea about. My co-workers were entertaining and hard working and made the environment a friendly place to work. My manager overall was approachable, understandable, flexible yet strict when necessary, funny, easy to get along with. He taught me valuable life lessons."
good,"I loved being the assistant manager for FootLocker because I love sneakers. I would help out customers as well as be the cashier, managed sale goals, open and close the store, change prices, and manage the inventory. I loved the discount and I got to wrk with some pretty cool people."
good,"Les salarié s'entende aussi bien qu'une équipe de sport et cela se ressent."
good,"A typical day would start at 8am and would end anywhere from 5pm - 9pm depending on the work day. I would have a plan of reference before arriving to a particular store location. Meet and greet with the team working that day to break the ice before getting into the business at hand. This was a way of relaxing the team for a full day of coaching and developing the areas of opportunity. There has never been a day where I did not take something away from a store visit. It could be anything from personnel needs, product needs, visual merchandising opportunity, operational, etc. My co-workers, for the most part understood that I have a vested interest in their success and worked hard to perform at a high level. Because we are not in our stores 24-7, As a district manager you have to understand that you are not in control of your stores performance, you can only influence and inspire your teams to give their best through visits, phone calls, emails, etc. I have a passion for coaching and developing associates to reach and exceed their personal goals."
good,"typical day at eastbay is alot of walking and lifting heavy boxes. I learned how to use a scan gun. The management was great they seemed to have most thing under control. The hardest part was working 10 hour days monday-friday."
good,hours are based off of performance and supervision by managers if you always show integrity you will be just fine.
good,"It was a great place to work. The manager was laid back, very motivating."
good,I was the assistant manager at Lady Footlocker and had a great group of employees and manager. I enjoyed the opportunity I was given and learned a lot about running a business from my experience. Due to the location it was slow on occasion which just allowed for team building. It was a great job to have during college years because it worked around my schedule.
good,While I worked at Lady Foot Locker I learned a lot. I was given a lot of responsibility which helped me to learn a lot about working in retail. I assisted customers on a daily basis and kept track of inventory. I was also able to train new employees and assist in making the schedules.
good,"Days are very slow on the job, not many customers come in due to the area. I have learned the ins and outs of management whether it is handling paperwork and money at the end of the night, to being apart of conference calls with the other stores in the district and the District Manager. My co-workers are mostly high school kids whom are eager to learn which is great to see. The hardest part of the job is having to push sales to make the day but with very little customers it makes it tough and us as a store looks bad at the end of the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is the joy of helping consumers with purchasing shoes or apparel that suit their needs"
good,It was easy to work at the foot locker employees were good to work with and management was flexible.
good,A typical day was a little slow and a little differentcal to sale products. Good co-workers to be around.
good,I learned a lot from the people I worked with. Co workers are very helpful. 
good,"Over all I loved working for the company, I just need full time. Typical day at work was helping customers, selling product and making sure the customer left satisfied."
good,"The job at foot locker was one of the best job that I had in my times. There was so much to learn at foot locker and the people there were  an excellent group to work with. Foot Locker also taught me how to manage a store and take charge when needed be. Its taught me good customer service skills and communication skills, while being able to show some authority. The hardest part about the job was standing up all the time, but with the personal coming in and out of the store it was no problem. The most enjoyable part about working at Foot Locker is that you get to experience a different part of customer service side that you do not get to see as a customers."
good,easy job if your a team player some offer commission some dont hours are ok
good,"Had fun meet new people , my co-workers all great , fun always had a smile always wanted to come to work"
good,"Communication is key at Foot Locker, whether it's with a customer or a co-worker. Hands on with customers. I enjoyed helping customers and clientele with their needs. However it was unfair how I didn't receive commission even though I sold more than the manager and assistant manager on the job."
good,"I would leave class ready to get to work just so i could look at shoes. I am what I like to name a ""sneaker head"" meaning one's love for sneakers. At footlocker I would check in read my assigments and go out on the floor and socialize with the customers until they were ready to buy. I learned while socializing I was strengthing my report building skills along with my ability to help customers find what they want so that they leave happy and return with the mind set that they will be helped efficiently. The hardest part of this job at first was selling footlocker made products like the shoe cleaners, or the insoles. We had to make qouta by selling these items along with the purchase the customer has already made. It was difficult at first to get customers to buy but as my time there grew I was able to find ways to get customers to buy and I did this buy suggesting reasonable reasons tailored to every customers liking so that would make them want to 'need' the shoe cleaner or insole and not just 'want' it. The most enjoyable part of this job was receiving discounts on the shoes I wanted and always knowing the dates and updates on different shoes coming out."
good,"As a store manager back in the 90's you would never work less than 50 hours a week times may have changed but retail hours expect that from managers across the board. The hardest part of the being a FootLocker Store Manager is creating sales when you rely on distant marketing campaigns, however I really enjoyed meeting people from all different cultures."
good,fast paced sales environment. helping individuals as well as groups or teams purchase sporting and exercise products.
good,I worked for Footlocker early on in my working life and learned many things I still utilize to this day.
good,"sales and customer service, we direct the customer about the items related to sports outfits"
good,My days consisted mainly of helping customers find the right merchandise for their activities and finding the right fit. Discovering new ways to drive seasonal sales by cross merchandising various products. Training associates on products and services including ways to demo some of the products and techniques used to close the sale.
good,I growth with this company and earn to many great expirience.
good,"A typical day at footlocker consists of test checks, reviewing company emails on various upcoming policies and assisting customers in purchasing merchandise. The hardest part of the day was dealing with disrespectful customers, trying to get over on the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was joy many kids expressed after getting a shoe they were looking to find. My co-workers and staff was one of the best, and made work an enjoyable environment. They also made us one of the best stores in the region. I learned to multi-task much more efficiently working for Footlocker. As a manager I learned to handle a variety of personalities and assist my staff in growing a people as well as salesmen"
good,"*a typical day at work would be to fold, hang, and put out clothing with occasionally selling shoes"
good,"my typical day at Lady Footlocker was greeting customers, and assisting them with sneakers or with apparel."
good,Foot Locker is a fortune 500 company and is an excellent place to work; whether its part-time or if you are a member of management. The company allows you to challenge your self and blossom if sales are for you.
good,I would deal with customer service and sell shoes to customers. There was no hard part to this job. The most enjoyable part of my job was putting a smile on a customer face after helping the customer find the perfect shoe for them
good,I learned a great deal about the industry and worked with good people
good,Lady Foot Locker is a good place to work if you're looking to grow in the company. Gives great training and knowledge to the associates. Very low on hours and pay but other then that good place.
good,"J'ai eu la chance de travailler avec une bonne équipe, je recommande fortement ce job pour un étudiant"
good,È un'azienda che ti sprona a dare il meglio di te e a formarti nel minor tempo possibile. Ti invoglia ad essere competitivo con i colleghi e a riservare massimo rispetto e disponibilità con i primi e con il cliente. Superare le aspettative di quest'ultimo è senza dubbio il dogma della compagnia. La possibilità di intraprendere una carriera in poco tempo è stimolante.
good,"it pays very very minimal but the atmosphere is amazing to work in and there is amazing people that you are surrounded by, everyone loves shoes. but if you need a job that pays good go somewhere else"
good,Meeting new people is always a plus side of the job as it keeps you fresh on your feet. Footlocker is a good company to work for depending on your needs.
good,typical day at work fixing clothes making the store look nice. engaging with incoming customers having a positive attitude and maintaining under any circumstance. I definitely learned how to keep a conversation going as well as be the conversation starter. the most enjoyable part of this job was being friendly and receiving the same energy in return.
good,I absolutely loved this job. It could have alot to do with my infatuation over shoes in general as to why i stayed but overall I dont' have anything negative to say about the company.
good,"This was my first job when i had turned 16 and i loved it! The disocunt was probably my favorite part about it, i created some life long friends while working here. Typcial day at work was pretty slow but Fri-Sun or holidays were crazy busy, had to be quick on your feet. Must be honest to customers about products as well as reccomend better options or know what shoe would be a better fit"
good,I've been working at Foot Locker for over 2 years now and throughout those years I really enjoyed it. I enjoyed meeting new people and of course the employee discount. They do not offer raises but I am assistant manager now which is a nice pay increase from the sales associate position.
good,"Ambiente lavorativo sereno, stimolante ma salario basso a causa della tipologia di contratto (tirocinio)"
good,"Footlocker is a cool place to work, where all sneakers people come in to shop. Got to meet new people and interact everyday. Cool team members that give the positive vibes at work. We work hard play hard!"
good,fast pased. see multiple customers and multitasking is always in action. patience and customer service skills are used on a daily basis. multicultural.
good,Fun to work at when you have a good and supportive team. Lots of shoes to learn about. Has innovative ways of spreading the company's core values. Good discount as well.
good,"Azienda leader nel settore , ma che non garantisce sempre contratti"
good,Working at Footlocker is an athletes dream job. You are able to connect with shoppers because you share the love of a sport. Footlocker has a great working environment.
good,"Foot locker is a good job for someone in high school , the pay is low & it’s just hard to balance education and that foot locker job for younger kids."
good,The discount is lovely. Good vibes. Fun interactions with co workers and customers. Don't try to side hustle and take payment for holding shoes because it's your word vs their word.
good,A typical day at work consisted of brainstorming through pending projects and then working through millions of rows of data. Coming to a conclusion. Delivering the finalised product and then realising that there is so much more that can be done to help this project. Re-working the entire thing.
good,"The most difficult part of the job is thin but i would say you would definitely have to be self motivated and mentally secure to want to work in such a confined space. The workplace culture is amazing and it was like i learned something new about customers everyday. The most enjoyable part about the job was getting to know a customer,athlete,or weekend warrior that really take their orthopedics serious and giving them suggestions while they give instant feedback."
good,"Typical day at work would consist of setting up the store to look it’s part, also making customers at ease when shopping for what they are looking for. I’ve learned how to be come more engaging than I already am and also to stay confident as I know I could be. Management was okay sorta speak, seeing as though only one of the management members wanted nothing but success from me and would help me be the best I can be. The culture was very different from no other. Selling sneakers is in a league of its own considering that A high percentage of sales come from the youth so there is a big connection between customers and employees. I would say the hardest part of the day is when a customer leave unsatisfied because one feels as though they failed and your day is ruined. However the most enjoyable part of the day is be able to engage with every single customer that walk into those doors a getting to know what they like and helping them search for what it is they’re looking for."
good,My experience was good. I never really had conversation with my peers because it was an competitive work environment but overall we all enjoyed our positions.
good,"I didn’t get paid much At foot locker, but the work environment and the people made up for it. We always had fun but we got work done when it was time to. Management was helpful and always pushed us to do better. I would definitely recommend this job to someone looking for their first job or simply just wants to get more into shoes"
good,"Typical IT environment with wide variety of responsibilities and high expectations. Work day includes multiple meetings, as would be expected based on role."
good,"The manager at Six02 wasn't a very good manager, due to the fact she was always stressed and would let it out on all the employees and it was a very stressful environment. The environment was also very negative."
good,footlocker was and is a great place to work but as a mother to a toddler i dont get enough flexibilty to be with my child. i either have to work early or too late and as a manager i was required to work holidays. i believe as a billion dollar company they should be able to pay their employees more for all the effort they put in each and everyday.
good,"Footlocker being my first job was probably the best job for a high-schooler since they are flexible, provide a fun work environment, and are not too demanding with their jobs."
good,"Typically you'll never know how your day is gonna go in Footlocker. It'll be busy or it'll be slow, just as many retail places would be depending on where you're located. You'll have small rushes here and there or it'll be just a few customers at a time. "
good,"Typical day:"
good,It was fun to manage a Foot Locker.  The employees and customers made it worthwhile to go to work every day.  You created bonds with customers over footwear and apparel.
good,"Boutique fermé depuis 2011.. "
good,"De manière général très bonne expérience. "
good,Foot Locker is a good place to work for it is easy but also fast pace I like working with the customer base that came to the store the only thing is for like a does not give raises and I feel like that is something that every company should give no matter if it's $0.05 or $2
good,"I worked at Footlocker several years ago, I feel it was a good company to work for.  The job itself was easy, the long hours were difficult especially during peak seasons."
good,"I worked very good in Foot Locker thanks to my manager that gave me the possibility to improve my English and my sales skills."
good,"Bei Foot Locker hat man sehr intensiv mit Zahlen zu tun und es ist ein Muss für sich selber diese auch im Überblick zu behalten. Somit kann man hier sehr gut durch seine Leistungen glänzen und wird auch danach bewertet, was man erreicht und schafft."
good,Great place to work fun environment good discounts great manager great people all around and a company to work for.Would go back if the start pay was huger but overall good company
good,"The first couple weeks of working at footlocker were going well, until I personally did not have time to keep showing up everyday due to examinations and SAT testings."
good,"veel mensen op bezoek, heel leuk om daar te werken"
good,"Great place to start a young persons sales career! Can advance into management very fast, can create good people skills if lacking in area. Very friendly environment too work in"
good,great discounts on th newest product and awards for employees and managers whom work hard for the company to meet and complete goals over and beyond expectections.
good,"To work for this company you have to have a open availability, good people skills able to stand for a long period of time and be fast to service everyone in the store."
good,"You learn how to engage with customers on a personal level to where they come in and only look for you and you also learn more about sneaker culture , fashion the latest trends"
good,"Everyday is a new experience."
good,"Weekly sales goals were set. The idea is to exceed those goals for maximum commission payout. The easiest part of the entire job was customer relations. Show them what they want, sell them what they need. Things only get tough when you as the salesman are shy. Teamwork is always encouraged however, so you are never alone when selling."
good,Really enjoy the job..a great place to learn about Sales and Customer Service..But it was sales type job so really had to sell..Really enjoy meeting the public..
good,"Fast paced job"
good,cette expérience de travail m'a permis de découvrir le domaine que j'aime faire.
good,Footlocker is great company to work for . I was able to become a member of management after 4 years of working part time at the age of 20. Only complaint I have is they should have a tenure based pay schedule . After working for your company 6+ years I shouldn't be getting paid minimum wage plus commission.
good,"I worked there 14 years, was laid off during the 3rd round.  I like that sneaker discounts, but there were favoritism and cut throat ppl, i realize all companies are not perfect, footlocker paid better then ahold and had more up to date computer systems"
good,"a normal typical day at footlocker can be stressful at times but in the long run, helping other figure out what they are interested in is worth the hard work, because at the end of the day knowing you did your best and helped someone leaves you with a good feeling inside"
good,"The particular Foot Locker I worked for was very cool, not to mention the manager was really nice and always gave every employee to improve before making any changes. I love & miss all my old co-workers, they were a real definitional of team work!"
good,"Pretty calm, get to see the latest shoes before hand, always need for organizing and cleaning. Competitive as sales translate to commission and thus a more appreciated check."
good,"Overall, I had a good experience working for Foot Locker. I learned how to work in a team, work on my communication skills, and also network. Foot Locker is such a great company and hopefully I can make it to the corporate level."
good,"I enjoyed the time there, went to college to further my degree. While attending college I worked in the Oshkosh call center, to make ends meet. I found it a wonderful place to advance my career."
good,Ambiente stimolante a ritmi elevati...Le giornate volavano...
good,I enjoyed working at footlocker because I love working with all the different type of customers helping them find what they need. I loved learning new things everyday and getting to know the company better
good,Overall a good company that provides opportunities to those who work hard and are willing to go the extra mile. It provides a stable work environment.
good,"typical day its slow, business picks up on release days/ weekend. As store lead you're a keyholder so you help open/close the store, you help manage other associates as well. Basically part-tine assistant manager without the pay."
good,"I learned that there is no I in team and that the job is much easier working as a team. If you decided to work strictly as an individual that way was to difficult. The workplace culture was inviting, supportive and a constant learning work place. We all supported one another and never put others down, and the customer always came first. I gained and refined skills at this establishment that I can take with me to other establishments in the future."
good,"As a sales associate at Kids Footlocker the number one focus is the customer. Customers were always greeted when they entered the store. Our staff including myself was trained to connect with the customer and be genuine to give them the best experience to ensure they will return. When connecting with a customer I ask them questions to learn what they are looking for to give them the product that they want and also give them accessories that go with a shoe or other product they may be interested in. I would assist sizing the customer for their shoe size If needed, making recommendations, informing the customer of any new products or promotions and sales the store was having. I would also work as cashier."
good,"Truely enjoyed my experience with the company. Being in the right store is important. High volume stores go getters can makes solid commission."
good,Footlocker is a fun place to work out. The only downside is not getting that many hours and low pay. Often times they cut back on hours due to having too many workers
good,Depending on your team and your leader you will have the time of your life at this job. With my old mangers and my old team I literally had the time of my life at footlocker it changed my whole way of living my life and how I think of things and even the way I approach people and handle situations outside of work.
good,"Fast, paced work environment yet fun place to work if you enjoy being a part of the sneaker culture. I've worked at three different stores and the culture the company promotes was great (if you like working on a team). With any retail job, metrics and goals are always on your mind but the more you learn about the products sold in store, the better (and faster) your day goes."
good,"all in all i find footlocker a great place to work, when its busy time goes by fast. if your a sneaker head definetly work at FL, or kids footlocker. the discount was also bless."
good,Very easy and relaxed when there was no customers in the store to help. Not much to do but wait around of a customer to pop in. Enjoyable part was the people you worked with they made it fun.
good,Footlocker was a laid back work place. Managers were nice and we all were young so we got along well. The most enjoyable part of the jib is meeting new people who came into the store. The hardest part was trying to keep an eye on all the people in the store.
good,"A typical day included helping customers, organizing and cleaning the store and working on inventory. The most enjoyable part of my job was my fellow co-workers, everyone had great energy, and we worked off of each other and helped each other with sales, clean up and anything else we required of each other."
good,"stated out cabling, then moved into programming, trouble shooting Avaya phone systems. Did move, adds, changes. Did monthly backups, Also got into circuit ordering."
good,"The job was fun, it was very diverse and you definitely learn how to communicate with people better. Its a very competitive job just because you would get commission off sales. But the overall experience was great working there."
good,Job culture is cool but the salary is not as great. I would reccomend thos job for someone who is looking to build their skills in a profesional field. It makes you appreciate the culture.
good,Its a very competitive place where you are always striving to get a sale. You learn new things everyday and you are constantly being motivated to do better.
good,"Being able to see the newest releast on the shoes, helping the customers pick shoes out, working cashier for the first time was very tricky and I was nervous but once I got the hang of it very exciting."
good,"It was a very eye opening experience. Customer service is my line of work of choice and it filled that role well. Had to leave because of the environment and the direction of management. I made it to be an Assistant Manager, but I knew there was no chance of me making anymore career advancements."
good,"casual work culture, ability to multitask is important, daily routine very time sensitive, and must be organized and detail oriented.  Strong communication skills are very important, as well as, experience with Microsoft office suite programs."
good,Excellente approche du streetwear et de la sneakers
good,"Count cash registers, meet and greet customers, offer assistance, give information of promotions of sales, gather the right size of the product, and scan the products through the cash register. "
good,"Working at kids footlocker was so much fun. I loved helping customer look for certain shoes. The hardest part of the job is when you have to compete with other employees to sell a shoe to a customer."
good,"Its a time and place for everything. Work Hard Sale Harder"
good,"A typical worked day consisted on shoe sale changes, providing excellent customer services, inventory, and making sales. It was an urban culture, therefore your knowledge of fashion, sports, and the latest trends was helpful in selling merchandise."
good,"Good place to work depending on location area of the business. There are multiple locations located in Harrisburg, New York, Canada, and in Florida. The warehouses are located around the United States."
good,"A couple manager friends and I made up, ""footlocker fire and rescue"", as a store manager you spend a good deal of time fixing other peoples store. This is great when you don't do your job, but not so much when your store is doing what it needs."
good,On the move at all times . customers are the main priority. great discounts and good staff. fun time as long as your following directions and building relationships with your customers
good,"For a ""sneaker head"" its an awesome place to work! Its a product that your passionate about and a perfect place to meet like-minded people."
good,"short day typically less then 7 hours, i learned to communicate amongst co-workers, multi-tasking, and how to service not only one but multiple costumers. The manager is a strict but nice lady she takes her job serious and wants nothing for the best for her store, the culture of the work place is urban very friendly comfortable setting i enjoyed. the job is pretty easy there is many difficult task, maybe being efficient and fast when looking for multiple sneakers for multiple costumers. Seeing and meeting new people making them laugh or helping them find the sneakers they really want my is my favorite part."
good,"a fun competitive job, you do work for your money, harder you work, the more hours or maybe even the more money in your check. if yor at a good site the energy is great, building friends and a second family."
good,"Foot Locker is a very balanced organization. The truly work hard but when the job is done, they celebrate. It was truly my honor to work for this company."
good,"Foot Locker was a good place to work. A typical day was reviewing construction documents, working with Project Managers and providing preliminary plans for review and approval."
good,I'm competitive with sales so i genuinely loved it. I hate that I had to move because thats the only thing that made me forced to resign. Overall i loved it though
good,it a fun place to work with a great staff and a great management team. only issue i had was at the time the pay was extremely poor and the commission was even worse
good,"I generally started my morning off by reviewing the previous nights paperwork and doing a sales analysis from the previous year to date. The workplace environment was fun and energetic but often times it had gotten a little slow. That allowed my staff and I to do more inventories than requested. When doing so, it allowed me to keep my shrink to a bare minimum. That was probably the hardest thing to do is controlling your shrink."
good,"Long hours and must work holidays/weekends"
good,"Cool job for some someone fresh out of high school or going to college. Someone who really love sneakers. decent discount as well. cool people, can be competitive. Want to be careful sometimes co-worker tend to snatch peoples sales (they count)."
good,very friendly with the costumer. sometimes the shop is very busy but it is very important to laugh and be friendly . i learn about the type of shoes and the best insole.
good,"Foot locker is a great place to work, gives you the retail experience you need to strive with them or any retail store."
good,"I enjoyed so much in foot locker and I've learnt a lot, however, once you step into management career the amount of stress you receive is incredibly higher than your pay."
good,I like doing what I do there. I drive a forklift type vehicle going around the distribution center and picking product off the selves. They provide a safe working environment. The managers are fair and help you feel like you belong to part of the company.
good,"If sneaker culture is in your blood and you have a skill for leading, motivating, and developing people- you will advance quickly in this field. Patience, urgency, and a good spirit are needed."
good,"I was responsible for giving great customer service, recruiting new team members, training, updating sale and display fixtures, and achieving sales goals.  I took being a prime example of great customer service to my team very seriously, and enjoyed being a leader.  I was always open to others inputs and opinions, and open in learning new skills as well as sharing my skills and knowledge with others."
good,"direct my  team for sales, stocking, being helpful to custormer and making sure store stays in order.  My most enjoyable is seeing the smile on the customers faces and my staff feeling good so they can do a good job"
good,Team environment work place everybody must rely on eachother to work together as a strong unit lead by your management staff. The goal is to provide the best customer experience while also maximizing sales in the long run leaving the customer with a great lasting impression.
good,"Great atmosphere, fun job and real cool people. Pay is a joke. Only there if you like shoes. It's ok for a college student but that's about it. Just something to do on the side"
good,"Clock in, talk to co-workers. Make a few sales when busy, cleaned up when sales floor was empty. Perfected clothes, shoes, folded clothes, cashier, stocked shoes and merchandise. I learned how to jungle a lot of responsibilities at once dealing with having to remember up to 5 customers request for shoe size and the type of shoe. I learned to have patience within the customers, when they were indecisive on buying shoes or merchandise. The most fun part of the job was being active most of the time and being able to do all of that with friendly co-workers. The hardest was on a very busy day, getting 2/3 types of shoes for 4 different customers at once but I still managed to get the job done with having patience and communicating with the customers and with the help of my co-workers also."
good,I enjoyed working for this company. I had good management and good discounts for items we sold. I liked that it was a team enviroment that we had to not only meet out goals but the store goals as well.
good,"minimum hours to give to part timers, hard to move up within the company. Benefits are good like the discount. Management is also good chill but still work hard."
good,Good place to work when young. Greeting customers that come in the store and helping with picking out new things to buy. You learn a lot on how to greet and be polite.
good,Très bonne ambiance et donc bonne condition de travail qui en découle sur les résultats
good,"Footlocker was a very fun yet productive place to work. Selling and handling the most hyped up shoes as well as just your average kicks, footlocker was an amazing place to work."
good,i love my job. the people are cool most of the time and its always a fun atmosphere. the only down side that i see about the job is the pay. you can sell all you want but in the end the store manager reaps all the benefits.
good,"Working at footlocker has taught me plenty of things examples my customer service skills are now awesome, I was shy at first but as time passed it's important to make your customer feels comfortable with you and purchasing their items and even leaving a wonderful last impression."
good,"The hours were decent, the people that I worked with were amazing. As well as management always being there for you. The major downside was the pay. However the discount did make up for it."
good,it was pretty chill working in footlocker everybody was nice to each other.I learned how to talk to customers and everything. the hardest part of the job was learning where the shoes were at. the most enjoyable part was working with my coworkers because they were all mad nice and everything.
good,"work does need to get done, but overall a good place to work, The manager at eastview is great, the people are nice, easy to learn and easy to work there, great place to start or high school job"
good,It's definitely a great company to work for. Always carry your weight and responsibilities . I've been with them for almost 10 years now. It's been great
good,"The job environment was really comfortable, always smiles and fun working with the customers and helping them get what they needed. I learned many things in the company such as how to handle money and a safe, how to communicate with others in a good manner, problem solving and etc, the hardest part of the job for me was learning how to know everything to operate the cash register but i learned it quickly, and now i'm an expert and help others when training new employees on how to work the cash register. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was knowing that every time I walked in the work place it was all smiles, and just a good atmosphere. Also being given a task that needed to be done for the day, which allowed me to always have a focus. The job overall was a great experience- good people, and always something that needed to be done."
good,"Good company to work for,  they appreciate all the hard work you put in... Opportunity to  move up  and grow  with  the company, Its like one big family"
good,"A typical day at work would be coming in with a great positive attitude, helping the customer's needs, driving sales and suggesting merchandise that will go along with the sale."
good,"Its an amazing place to work at but when slow season comes, such as after christmas/boxing day, sometimes the hours they provide are not the greatest."
good,Bonne entreprise avec beaucoup de collaborateurs jeune
good,ho fatto una piccola esperienza di due mesi ma mi e' servita per conoscere meglio l'ambiente delle calzature e dell' abbigliamento per il quale provo anche un interesse personale
good,"the work place is very cool, and collective. the manager there is amazing and she always pushes us to reach our fullest potential no matter how hard the circumstance seem."
good,It was a nice place to work in high school but as you grow with expenses you will find that the paychecks become a little scarce. My favorite part of the job was the discounts.
good,"Foot Locker has an enjoyable work environment. There was never a day where I didn't want to come work. My only problem with Foot Locker is the pay rate was pretty low, but other than that I enjoyed every bit of it. Management was fun work around and the customers were the best."
good,"As a manager Footlocker pays well, however any part time position footlocker does not pay well. A typical day will consist of talking to customers and trying to add product to the shoes they are interested in."
good,"For those that apply themselves, it can be a wonderful place to start a career. It was a wonderful place to work for, and part of a product line that is never going to go out of need."
good,"Enjoyed the work experience and the employees. Would clock in and make our sales goal everyday. The hardest part of the job is Lady Footlocker is a women's only store, so we did not get a lot of male customers, like Foot Locker did. Foot Locker was able to attract male and female customers."
good,"Grazie al mio percorso ho imparato a gestire teams di persone composti da vari componenti. Lavoro con scadenze orarie, giornaliere e settimanali interagendo con clienti di ogni provenienza: parlo e scrivo inglese e francese."
good,"I have been a part time sales associate at Foot Locker for over a year now. Just like any other job it has its ups and downs which will be discussed briefly in this review. A typical day at work starts with individually greeting my coworkers as I walk to the back to punch in. Learned how to use a cash register and improved on my interpersonal skills but I learned how to sell and survive in retail. Management is always there to help out, more often than not they have been with the company for a few years so they have a decent amount of experience in all areas of the job. Hardest part of the job is dealing with stubborn customers and not having a sale go through after investing so much time and effort in to it. Most enjoyable part is working with people my age and building relationships with coworkers and customers. Workplace culture is enjoyable, music is playing a majority of the time and it is crucial in creating a good environment."
good,It was a great first job to have and the people I worked with made it 10 times better. I would recommend working there if you have a passion for shoes and interacting with a variety of people.
good,This job is the job that built my interpersonal skills. You deal with all types of people from all walks of life. Also gives you a chance to sharpen up on up-sale skills.
good,"Great work environment, fast paced and lots of diversity.  Enjoyed the challenges and providing customers with product they loved when they left the store.  "
good,"Depending on the location you work, everything you would want outside of the company  is within steps of the store so breaks seems longer. Good company discount to keep employees invested into the shoes and culture of the store. Knowledgeable environment as well"
good,As part time you don't make as much as you should. I get paid every two weeks a good amount IF I get a good amount of hours that week. I usually only get good hours during holidays and back to school other wise its slow and i don't get hours. kind of sucks. Pay should be more for every footlocker position.
good,"You'll be in the latest fashion and up to par, footlocker is fun and driven toward customer service."
good,"Très bonne expérience , équipe génial , bon rapport avec la clientèle"
good,maintaining Store Appearance greeting customers stocking inventory very competitive between co workers hardest part of the job was learning all the controls from systems
good,"Today I worked 5 hours and sold up to 4.1k. my way of making this happen is by hustling to the first customer and help them find what they are looking for. in doing so, i also suggest other items to fill the bag."
good,This is a great job to work at while in high school. I had a great manager that lead a great room. It was a pretty simple job. The hardest thing was always having a positive attitude and dealing with costumer issues.
good,"Footlocker is a very welcoming environment when you first start there. You have a ton of nice people to help you ease into your role. It's very laid back and you can wear whatever you want to work along with take breaks whenever you'd like. You get a ton of vacation and PTO to start off and there are a lot of free events to participate in. The big downside, for me, is the pay. I feel that I'm paid very little for what I do compared to other companies."
good,"Sale to customers and problem solve customer service issues. Stock shoes from shipment, mange care of shoes, manage cash for the registers, and send shoes out to customers or other stores."
good,"Hiring and training of potential managers, full and part-timers (from salesmen to cashiers) and scheduling to make store run efficiently yet profitable was a great experience. Was promoted and moved five times, from Michigan to New York. All stores set sales and profit records and all assistants went on to manage their own stores. It was a grueling yet satisfying experience."
good,Enjoyed being apart of the team and being able to assist customers from different aha range also being able to see how fast the latest trends are sold out and using communication skills.
good,"Most part timers are given maximum 15 hours. Good place to learn about sneakers and to become a sneaker head.  Great benefits and a good place to work. The best part of the job is meeting different people everyday.  You get a chance to engage with the customer, and make that customer feel like family."
good,During my job I enjoyed making conversations with different customers and trying to understand what they needed so I was able to make there experience as best as I can and make it efficient to get what they need.
good,Young and energetic team that loves to win. Has been at the top of the game for a few years now and there are no signs of slowing down.  Anyone who loves sneakers and athleisure gear will love working here.
good,"Being a manager at footlocker the duty require to make schedule, keep track of inventory, hire new employees and train them how to provided professional customer service and work lots of hours."
good,Footlocker is a great company to work for. However working a part time position is not capable of supporting living expenses.
good,I liked working at kid's footlocker. It was just the fact that I like to stay busy and it wasn't super challenging in that area.
good,"- Typical Day at work was bringing shoes out from the stockroom at customers requests. Helped find apparel sizes and suggesting products to help drive sales quota."
good,"meet different types of people"
good,"I enjoyed working at Kids Foot Locker. I liked the feel that it gave off and the competiveness game we'd play to try to increase our commission. My coworkers were fun and helped show me how to improve myself to help build my sales. The hardest part of the job was remembering where all the shoes were stacked nd who was by what, but then I got the hang of it."
good,"I loved working here until the fun caught up with me. The job is to be taken seriously but also playful. Loved the managers they're like family, i personally wasn't making enough and the work caught up with me. its long hours sometimes with no breaks either and all the hours and moving caught up to me as i was still in school while working here."
good,its a very fast upbeat and fun environment fun co-workers and always inform on all of the  latest fashion and styles salary needs improvements but overall enjoyed working for the company
good,"if I could go back to work with foot locker and my old team I would it was a great place to work, the hours were flexible, the staff was like family,"
good,"The management team is amazing, very understanding and willing to work around your obligations for school and your social life."
good,"Work was always fun, it was easy, everything was fun honestly, talking to people and communicating was great."
good,i enjoyed helping all the customers because you get to see them with a smile on their face and know that their happy and confident about the purchase they just made
good,"Typical day at work was relatively the same, definitely learned on how to work as a team and work together.  Hardest part on the job was that there was no hard part.  If you like to help people and make them smile this is the job for you."
good,"Excellent Job. Great people to work with, and good service. Sneaker Culture is always thriving. Low Pay. Low Hours. Needs to be changed"
good,"A typical day at work is walking around looking for customers, starting up a conversation and finding out what they are looking for. "
good,I loved shoes so I loved working there. I learned a lot there as it was my first job and I loved it. There is good opportunities to grow and move up.
good,A day in footlocker could pretty easy or could get hectic at times. Manager and co workers are always communicating so that was helpful. The job is easy to learn you just have to listen to your co workers and you will learn in no time.
good,"The daily business is to give the customers the best service of any retail store. I have learned leadership skills, Managing and hiring different type of people. Co workers are very friendly. The most enjoyable part of the job is making the customer happy weather its a young kid or a regular customer. The hardest part about the job is the retail hours because is less time you get to spend with your family."
good,Wonderful places to work for Sneaker Heads alongside of the modern day music. Short work days. Hardest part is servicing a large group.
good,"friendly work environment, with very flexible work hours."
good,Foot Locker is a fun place to work but there is not much room for advancement. co workers are cool and so are the managers. Foot Locker hires a lot of young high school student so sometimes you have to deal with immaturity.
good,"I loved working with Footlocker. Depending On If We Have To Shipment or not , we did inventory, Stocked Shelves. Working With Different Customer Trying To figure out the shoe that will be the right fit off of if they had high or low arches, whether if they were using the shoe for working-out, standing on there feet all day, running, lifting, indoors and out. that experience was very exciting and interesting, interacting and engaging with different people, races, ages and personalities is something that I had gotten a joy out of it. My co-workers were very friendly and helpful. they always had my back when ever i need an extra hand, except for the store manager , the management team were kind of useless when it came to managing things. And the hardest part of the job was to actually make sure if what the customer is buying today is gonna be the same tomorrow so they wouldn't come back and say it feels different and return any items."
good,"Management was great and was good at being organized."
good,"it was good for the time I was there. I have no complaints about this job, no problems no problems moved away. Company was fine and I recommend it to everyone."
good,"fast paced work place "
good,Been with this company 3 years now and if you put your time in the company you are willing to grow with them. Also working with this company you get to work with a variety of people from many countries and build long term friendships.
good,its a best place to work for beginners but not for the professionals because the mangers doesn't  have  any right to take a right decision on  time
good,"Enjoyable workplace for someone interested in footwear or sneaker culture. Opportunity to work with various different people with difference preferences and adjust to specific customers needs. Positive competitive person who prompted the best possible effort from peers. Ambition to grow within company allowed professional relationship with management to flourish."
good,"It was an amazing and enjoyable job, there were always new faces and different tactics in selling which made it an always great time"
good,So far it has been a fun workplace with supportive and helpful management. The environment makes it easier to work and get through the day. The most enjoyable part of my day is getting to meet new people.
good,Starting out in this company I didn't really plan to move up into management as quick as I did. I learned with hard work and dedication to the company you can do almost anything you want to. All stores are very friendly and helpful to others when questions or problems arise.
good,"Managed team of 15 of professionals."
good,"I love my job. This job is an affiliate of Footaction or is the same thing. As, I already stated it is an overall good experience. I just want another job during Mon-Friday to put more money in my pocket. I am a hard worker and enjoy everything i do with a smile on my face."
good,"footlocker was a great company to work for. it had its ups and downs, but I loved it. A great day at work was the customers. they kept you going and on your toes. I loved to do stock more than anything. organizing the back room and learning shoes was kind of cool"
good,"Great company to work for,pay could be better for all associates.Foot locker helped me overall in all aspects.... People passion,business passion and personal passion."
good,footlocker is a great place to work as well as advance within the company. They do have many opportunities to advance as well as progress in customer service. This job does push you to meet your own personal goals
good,"Team work, patience, and self-awareness are important qualities to have working at Dixie Footlocker all the while working with amazing co-workers."
good,"Fun work environment great support team all about number but in a fun way."
good,"a typical day at work was work work work work and more work, keep on pushing the sales to beat my own record from the week before. I basically learned real patience and sales how to approach a client smoothly and calmly. Before Miss. G. came to the store it wasn't fun to work there. Her job was and still is to fix stores and evaluate the persons in charge. She is sent to stores around the Laval area for that actually. I always had a great relationship with my co-workers. I don't remember having troubles with them at all. The hardest part were the rush parts where there is a lot of clients but these days go so fast you don't see them. My most enjoyable parts of all were at the end of the day when i use to watch my sales and beat my own record."
good,Footlocker was a good job that taught me a lot about myself and people in general. Before Footlocker I had only known working behind a grill by myself. My co-workers were very fun to work with and I only had a good experience with them. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting all of these new and exciting personalities.
good,"Overall Footlocker is a great job. It is a good way to gain experience with customer service and retail. Because it was slow business, hours have to be evenly distributed between employees, but the labor is extremely high. Thus causing hardly any hours at all, at max 10 hours a week. The management was great, I've learned a lot and could potentially be an assistant manager for a job. I've learned to open and close the store, count down drawers/ inventory, and more. The hardest part of the job would be being short staffed on weekends and during holidays. The most enjoyable part would be my co-workers. If you need help their always their to assist you."

My coworkers and I handled basic cleaning such as mopping, sweeping, and also stocked and restocked our back room and sales floor.

good,This was a fun and exciting place to work. I enjoyed the staff and the customers.
good,"Wait on customers and help them decide what they want"
good,"client souvent agréable a servir ."
good,"A typical day would consist of helping customers with their purchase. During the time of work I learned to expand a positive attitude to customers and have a friendly atmosphere.The management was lenient, which cause others to slack off. The hardest part of the job was to keep busy when business was low. The most enjoyable part of the day was interacting with different people and making a comfortable and friendly environment for them."
good,"Working in a fast pace environment with a lot of customers from all over the world was truly a learning experience on its own. I learned so many ways to approach different people with all types of backgrounds and always with patience and respect for others."
good,Learned a lot about Visual Merchandising at this company.  Great upper management support.
good,sweep and straighten up the store before we opened the doors check in new product from delieveries price it and put it out do online shipping orders. Fold sweatpants or tees fill in the wall help customers. The hardest part of the job i would have to say was trying to keep busy on slow days. I loved helping customers joking with them making them feel comfortable
good,"La tipica giornata d'ufficio consisteva nella ordinaria amministrazione delle attività proprie di un dipartimento delle risorse umane modernamente strutturato."

good,"A typical day at work is usually pretty simple. You come in and you get to it right away. Making sure all customers are being attended. I learn a lot about customer service. Customers always come first. I learned how to adapt to any type of situation thrown my way. The management is pretty good. My manager now is my hiring manager. He transferred me to his new store because he knew he could count on me. My co-workers are awesome. We all get along with each other. The hardest part of the job is making sure you help every customer accordingly to what they are looking for, everybody is different. Everybody is looking for something different. The easiest part is using all the selling behaviors that are taught to us. Once we use those selling behaviors with the customers, the whole interaction will go smoothly."
good,"I loved my job and it was very fun while working there and I learned a lot of things. Although, my manager was very sneaky and unprofessional."
good,"how to present new products, banners and policies."
good,"I liked everything about my experience at Foot Locker except the District Managers that I worked for. I routinely led my district and region in certain sales numbers and moved on up the ranks. I was deceived by my first DM when I wanted to manage a specific store. He said it wasn't going to be available and when I took a store in another state, the store I wanted became available. My DM in Oklahoma was ok at first but as it turned out, he was lying to me the entire time. On top of that, when I needed help hiring an assistant manager, he went out of his way to hire a 3rd assistant for the other store in Tulsa. Other than my bad DMs, I very much loved working for Foot Locker. As a manager, I enjoyed the competition between the stores and beating last years sales."
good,"I actually enjoy working at Footlocker, but like any retail job (especially management) they expect you to devote your life to it. Only downside is for back to school and holidays, it is REQUIRED ALL managers work 6 day work weeks, which is completely understandable but becomes extremely straining especially with a family. In some districts, it becomes more of who you know vs. what you know. Store managers get monthly bonuses depending on your sales/hours, which is always an added bonus."
good,"Long hours and hard work, but it pays of with incentives. Great way to meet new people."
good,Fun work place with great staff and managers. Obtainable sales goals.
good,"--Typical day, daily goal setting, tasks, communications, hours monitoring, sales, training and development."

good,Great job horrible pay and hours dictated on sales of the month so if your store isnt saling then your hours are cut.
good,"Foot Locker was my first job since I moved to Boston. A typical day at work was fun always fun everyday there was exciting setting goals, seeing how many shoes care you can sell with each shoe. The hardest part of this job was going out of business after having such a amazing relationship with the customers and team members, meaning nothing was hard about this job."
good,stock shipment afterwards hit the floors with an friendly aggressive attituide
good,A company that i grew with. Move up from a part timer to a store manager. A company that wants and look for associate to be the next generation when it comes to customer service.
good,Beginning as a service technician and moving up to a supervisor in less than a year because of my work ethics. Management look at the job that I've done when it came to my customer and decided to promote me. I couldn't ask to work for another company like that one.
good,"enjoy learning people needs and wants,value of being creative to sale merchandise and displaying them"

good,a typical day at work would be come in get in the zone make conversation with customers and invovle other employees in to help promote the sale. ive learned that teamwork is a major help in a work area. my managers are very helpful and take the time out to help you advance in your sales. my co workers love to work as a team sometimes it can be quite competative. the hardest part of the job is trying to make a sale in a low income area. the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and helping them find what it is exactly that they are looking for.
good,Footlocker is a very stable company with many valuable tools in training associates to work best with different types of customers. A typical day includes:
good,It was a great job until I moved to Ocala & couldn't get a transfer although they have a Footlocker & 2 sister stores in the mall here.
good,Working at the Foot Locker was fun I received a lot of my customer service from this place cause you really have to sell yourself as well as the products.
good,Everyday brought something new and challenging. The hardest part about this job was the lack of communication between employees and supervisors.
good,"Dimock is a great place to start off working in the medical field. It is a multi-cultural facility that will allow anyone looking or seeking for an opportunity to expand their cultural experience. It is a multi medical specialty facility, therefore the exposure to various specialities and what each one requires. Overall I do believe that because it is a community center there may be room to grow and advance, but not too many opportunities were given during my time."
good,"We use great customer service and hoping that every customers leaves satisfied. I have learned alot since being there and it has helped me become a great worker. The hardest part of the job to me is dealing with some of the widest customers but I know when I put my mind to it, everything turns out just fine."
good,Checking for retail direct orders to process.
good,"A typical day at work was making sure every customer was greeted and helped,, the floor was clean, shoes and clothes were in the correct spot and that our goal in sales was met.

good,"Its a very simple job with most locations being small, you can easily maximize your efficiency. Especially if you know sneakers, you can easily familiarize yourself with inventory & inventory placement."
good,Overall I would rate Footlocker a B. It's a great part-time job but I wouldn't recommend working full-time. Its a high demanding physical job that doesn't slow down but offers good benefits.

My managers did an excellent job at teaching the employees and that we felt safe as if it was our own home. I didn't feel that there were any hard parts of the job because I'm a hard worker and i have determination and drive in me. I enjoyed most of my time there and had no problems with the company until i moved."
good,Energetic positive vibes. Management dictates how much that will occur on a day to day basis. Stores are sales driven and customers come first. You are required to be a security guard because they don't want to pay for it. I was an assistant manager and its hard to move up and the pay should be higher for the responsibilities that are required of you.
good,I enjoyed my time at footlocker. There were challenges because of how competitive the location I worked. Sometimes Hours are long. Upward advancement is sometimes hard because veteran managers are there for a long time. But it’s all about what you make of it!

good,"footlocker everyone is very friendly, you learn a lot about shoes and you meet a lot of people who are very good, nice and loyal customers. small store."
good,This job helped me with my communication skills as well as customer service skills. It is very easy and laid back work environment. The hardest part about this job is getting the amount of sales to get paid commission.
good,I loved working for the company and helping customers find exactly what they came in for. Hitting daily weekly and monthly goals set by our manager along with providing excellent customer service is what expectations I set upon myself
good,"I love working at footlocker and their mission. Gives opportunity to grow within and train others as well. Customer service is their #1 goal, which needs to be a priority. Has a lot of perks like programs to help with financial security and discounts with other partners."

good,"working for footlocker provides a competitive atmosphere and a great experience to interact with a wide range of customers, the only downside is the pay, it is mostly commission based unless you are a salaried manager so if the sales are not high in volume neither is your paycheck"
good,"typical day at work is greeting and making connections with customers and selling shoes to those who need"
good,"Auch als Teilzeitkraft hat man die Möglichkeit Verantwortung zu übernehmen. "
good,"Greet customers and great customer service, shipping and receiving, train new employees, interview and hire new employees, weekly inventory checks, and audits, weekly conference calls, create employee schedules."

good,"Von meinen ganzen Erfahrungen im Einzelhandel bisher die besten bei foot locker gemacht "
good,"Time Management"
good,"Footlocker is a great place to work when you have a supportive  team and a District Manager that communicates and teaches you. I loved my time working their, the benefits were good, the pay should be more for all employees for the amount of effort and hard work that get done. I truly feel that Footlocker staff is underpaid."
good,"Lavorare da Foot Locker significa essere parte di una famiglia, un team col quale passerai quelle ore in negozio proprio come una squadra in campo. E' stata un'esperienza molto bella dal punto di vista lavorativo, perchè spesso il tempo passato a lavorare era piacevole grazie soprattutto ai colleghi con i quali stringi una vera amicizia. "
good,"My personal experience with Foot Locker was quite interesting. The store in which I had applied for that was offering Assistant Manager for was in rough shape. The store manager that hired me was working hard to improve the store and rebuild staff. Unfortunately the store manager had to resign a month into my employment and left me to run the store temporarily. Soon the company decided to change our district and gave us a new manager a couple months later and flipped the store to become a leading store in its own division. It was a wide spectrum experience for me to see fully the expectation of the company and their effort to improve. The job and culture it is involved with is everything any person to relate and enjoy. A work day is light paper work and easy money counting in my store since it was low volume. Requires good organization and decoration skills to keep store in appearance to what is the company standard. "
good,"As a manager, your time at footlocker will be very stressful, whether you're an assistant manager or store manager. Everything falls on you whether it is an employee, store, inventory, maintenance, etc issue. You are responsible for the whole deal. It is fun at times but the times that it is stressful, it can get very frustrating."
good,The most exciting part of the job for me was finding customers that had interesting stories. Having a conversation with an old sneakerhead with a wall full of jordans back home or meeting a former nba player buying some shoes for his kid is always fun. Im not saying its always that exciting...but SOMETIMES it is.
good,Easy first job in learning retail. The only thing I lacked in working at footlocker is using the cash register but learning how to communicate with customers was a plus.
good,Loved working there when I was there.  Single and moving up the corporate ladder rapidly.  Would have stayed there if the wife wasn't pregnant and wanting to move.
good,"Kids foot locker at University Mall is a great work environment. Unfortunately, the University Mall no longer has very much business so in turn Kids Foot Locker suffers and can only give so many employees the hours they are looking for."
good,"Most days in a management position starts at 9:00am. Come into the store office, check the email for new promotions, store decoration changes, new products coming in and other promotional events. This was a great job to learn how to stock product and maintain inventory. Also great for learning fantastic customer service skills and driving sales. The best part of the job is the flexibility of the work floor. The most difficult part were the hours around the holiday season. The hours for management are very strenuous an demanding. It can be very stressful to balance family time and the time spent in the store maintaining during the busiest time of the year."
good,"Include selling shoes and upselling products to meet and satisfy customer problems."
good,"Footlocker will work you like a dog to get their moneys worth.  they pay well but expect you to be at their beck and call.  The district managers are fair, but if you dont pull your weight you will not get promoted."
good,A fun place to work at but only if you're still in highschool. being that because of the pay getting paid biweekly wasn't enough to keep up with bills
good,"Great place to work as a young kid who loves shoes and the culture it revolves around. Besides the work, the only thing wrong is the pay for management. That's why I had to leave. Worked to much for so little."
good,"Footlocker was a great environment to work in, but didn’t offer much room to grow within the company. Also the compensation for amount of work could have been better."
good,"Foot Locker is a great place to work. I worked first in the call center part of the company and then in their eCare department.. I love the way they handle situation, however the work environment has become toxic with people creating groups and sticking to their groups and not talking to anyone outside their groups. I enjoy working in a happy environment where everyone works together respectfully."
good,"Ho trovato un’azienda seria,poche chiacchiere e trasparenza. Colleghi disponibili ad insegnare e a migliorare le mie capacità lavorative. Orari di lavoro ben bilanciati e buon salario."
good,"bonne ambiance"
good,Entrare a far parte di questo team è stato bello e produttivo.
good,"- Take care of all the customers, keep store spotless and do any stock in the back"
good,Footlocker is a great company to work for. The company offers different opportunity for employees and also customers. I worked for Footlocker for 7 years and I am still currently working for this company. I can admit that my salary isn't great however I love working with the customers and giving them a great experience while they shop at Footlocker.
good,Good coworkers and great  environment to be in. Just underpaid. I had pretty good coworkers we kept eachother motivated. I loved to work there and sale shoes. But the pay just didn’t pay my bills.
good,I was just graduating from high school at the time but the job was pretty fun.  I loved going to work and selling shoes.  I loved the culture and seeing new people everyday.

good,"Always a good time while working and taking care of customers. Managemnt was great."
good,"Footlocker is a great company to learn the sales basic. I like their values. You always have to compete against the others and yourself. Thus the sales techniques are pretty agressive and the management style is sometimes hard to bear. Over all, it was a great and rewarding experience."
good,"Really helped me learn my love of business and allowed me to learn many important skills for my future. I was able to use many skills I already had, and advance them. Very computer literate job."

I learned how to greet and talk with customers, how to treat the customer and how to produce a sale. I also learned how to work a cash register and computer along with folding and hanging clothes and finding shoes in the back of the store. when there are no customers we take time to clean and tidy the entire store and talk with one another to improve communication skills. the hardest part of the job would be dealing with a rude customer or completing a different transaction at the register like a gift card or ordering merchandise. the most employable part of the job would be working closely with your coworkers and being around the apparel that I know about and wear."
good,Traffic in store varies making it a good challenging job to enhance your decision making skills. I've learned how to find what the customer really wants and how to help them. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you will meet and work with
good,"While working in the call center at footlocker I felt that most of the employees were pretty segregated, and that the culture was always very cold and uneventful.  I also felt that the work that the workers in the call center did was under appreciated."
good,"They are very strict about attendance and productivity, not a bad thing.  Communication is not a strong suit.  Ever changing and trying to improve things for employee and consumers.  Can be a rewarding place to work if you have a good work ethic.  Great benefits for the long term employee.  Good place to see if customer service is what you are interested in."
good,"Fairly easy job...must be able to communicate with customers effectively. Some days are less stressful than others, but there is always something going on. Not too many dull moments"

good,Each day was a new learning experience and I enjoyed the interaction with the public. There was nothing predictable about working for footlocker and there were many challenging moments and I welcomed them with open arms. This company matured me in so many different ways and taught me how to be a great manager.
good,It was my first commission job and it taught me a lot of things that have made working in retail a lot easier. I wasn't comfortable with up-selling at first but I soon learned that it's an art that's hard to master but benefits you once you've learned it.
good,Footlocker is a family Friendly environment . I love my co workers we help each other we don't tear one another down.we don't have to work hard but sometimes we don't have enough time to do everything . We get shipment everyday which has to be put up .

good,Foot Locker is a great work place for those of ages 16 an up that love shoes. The hardest part about working for Foot Locker is trying not to spend your check in the store. You meet all sorts of people from athletes to soldiers and CEO's.
good,"Working there was satisfying due to the vibe of the store.Management was very good, they communicated with the team very well and made tasks simple. It really felt like a safe and fun environment to work at"
good,"Mgmt and co-workers were great, it's a fast paced goal oriented friendly and professional environment. The footlocker discounts were great, not to mention that since Champs and Footaction are the same company, you may get sent to those places for extra hours or if they are short staffed. Best part about it, your discount works at those stores as well and on Eastbay.com"
good,"Foot Locker was very good to me, of course some days were better than others but they've taught me how to be an excellent sales associate. Thanks to Foot Locker I am very confident in my customer service skills."
good,"Typical work days were stocking shelfs and doing errands for the boss when no one was in the store on empty days. Then handled merchandise on busy days, ran the cash register, handled the money and did the drop offs at the other shoe stores at closing. I really enjoyed my employees and the customers. I learned a lot of things while at footlocker. Such as to manage my time better and better communication skills"
good,"My managers have only helped my success and I couldn't ask for a better enviorment. My co workers have always been helpful, and supported me."
good,"Working at footlocker was typically a laid back job until holiday time came, but for the most part as a sales associate you would fulfill your duties and be done. No day is the same as the next because you meet different kinds of customers with unique needs every single moment and based on what they need, you will need to adjust and provide. the hardest part about the job is the unfair treatment for employees as they are seen as the grunts and do most of the dirty work while higher management sits back. But overall its a good job for high school students."
good,If you love shoes and using your gift of gab for competitive benefits and wages this job is for you! Working at Foot Locker was an interesting experience. The customer base and the coworkers you meet are very rewarding.

good,"Once I come to clock in to work, I would ready to sale the companies product. Comfortable environment, I would meet people everyday and have conversation with the customer on persuing to buy our product. I would have a goal each work shift and for the week that i would make sure to reach."
good,Fun job. Easygoing staff. Flexible schedule. Picked up some great communicative skills. Really enjoyed interacting with different types of people. I would say that was the best part of the job. The hardest part would be limited-shoe releases. Sometimes customers would get upset or persist aggressively. I used this as an opportunity to practice friendly but firm communication. I was uncomfortable at first but over time I learned to enjoyed the challenge.
good,Foot locker is a great company with many great employees. Their  customer service is top notch and if you go shop there you will have a wonderful experience.

good,"Friendly and helpful atmosphere. "
good,"I was a MIT with one of the Footlockers in MOA. Typically I would handle all the paperwork, I would handle any customer problems and assist customers."
good,"Great place to work, good culture.  Management can be stuck in their ways and not see everyone  for whom they really are.  Great benefits with being able to purchase shoes all the time."
good,"Great Place , Full of energy . All about making the customer happy , delivering great customer service . Help customers find the right shoes ."
good,"While woking for footlocker, i found out a lot about my self as well as the others that surrounded me. The job was a lot of fun and it challenged me as a person to become a better communicator and to also work on my problem solving skills. Management for the store was pretty good at the time and was very good workers, also very strict on what it was that they wanted and needed done. Every day at the job consisted of the same things day in and day out unless there as a new release then the game plan would switch up,due to the high demanded shoes. It was not a big adjustment it just the people become far more furious when they don't get they shoes that wait for, so you would then have to figure out of to please them with another shoe."
good,"There is a great focus on providing good customer service and maximising the money made in each sale. Though there is no problem with that, management do place this focus above all else and may sometimes disregard the wellbeing of associates that are not performing very well."
good,"Um bom local para aprender e crescer. Boas equipas, muito orientadas para o consumidor e atingir os objectivos tanto pessoais como de loja."
good,"I come into work and start to check in and organize new shipment. Afterward I would go onto the sales floor and sell products to customers. Throughout my experience, I learned how to deal with customers, work with a team, and have efficient organizing skills."
good,FootLocker has best quality shoes that can be affordable for any occasion. Working with this company has been very good and the sales are amazing. I would recommend people who are looking for a part time job or a full time job to work here.
good,Comfortable workplace and colleagues got along with each other well. We all shared a similar enthusiasm about providing great customer service to our consumers.
good,"I loved working with customers, as a store manager i only hired people who loved it the same as me. I just hate how the company keeps on ""existing people."" I mean these people who have been there for years and know every loop hole through the rules and literally get paid to do nothing."
good,"I learned how to communicate and also got better at interacting with people. I had a good time at Foot Locker built lots of great relationships with my coworkers. A typical day at work would be putting shoes away, dealing with money cashier, selling the shoes, managing the stores, it was a store that did not have many people on the floor so lots of times I had to manage the store myself which gave me a great experience. My co-workers and I all respected each other they were all older than me and took me under their wings. We would all often go out and grab something to eat. Hardest part of the job was when there were no customers or people to communicate with. The most enjoyable part of my job was interactions with people and building a relationship with all the customers."
good,"Les journée de travail sont mouvementé mais sont tout aussi agréable, L'aspect le plus difficile est le rythme a garder mais j'ai appris a m'adapter grâce a cela"
good,"This job is like second nature now, I am comfortable here but I need a change now. I am a key holder and the responsibility feels great however I want to push myself to find something more challenging."
good,Was a great company to work for. The only reason I left was the growth stopped and I felt it was time to go somewhere else to try to move up in the company.
good,It was never a dull day working there. Meeting new people and even getting to know some of the customers who came more frequently to the store by name as time went on.
good,The corporation is a strong place to grow and learn the techniques and ideas necessary to succed in the athletic footwear and apparel industry.
good,"I come to work meeting different people everyday which is nice cause I'm a peoples person i love engaging with customers and helping them out with what then need. helping them choose the right type of sneakers for feet comfy, running, work, school, etc we have it. I learned that just hearing the keywords help me figure out what then need for their footwear. My co-workers were very helpful and fun. The hardest part was selling certain products like insoles the most enjoyable part was seeing customers satisfied with the services i was able to provided."
good,Got my career started with this company. I would not be where I am today if it wasn't for the Manager who interviewed me and saw something in me that I didn't know I had then. Hardest part of moving on to another job was leaving my staff and fellow managers in the district.
good,"Des journée plein de bonne humeur et de dynamisme ."
good,"It's a fun place to work at because your always interacting with new people and also your co-workers make the job easier by helping you out when its needed. Everyone looks out for each other especially the managers, they let you know what you need to improve on and do their best to see a better change in you to help the store and leave a good impression on customers when they are leaving."
good,"In all honesty, I loved working every second at Foot Locker. Two of my favorite things in the world is Basketball and shoes; making Foot Locker seem like heaven to me. Additionally, I am a people person therefore making working at Foot Locker generally easy to me. However, working there didn't give me enough hours. I was always making sales but only sometimes I would get awarded for that with more hours. I understand that's not always management's fault having to deal with many employees; but it's one of my only cons with working at Foot Locker."
good,addetto alle vendite e appreso ottime tecniche di vendita finalizzate alle provvigioni
good,Helping customers with buying shoes can be fun and keep the day interesting. I learned how to interact with people more effectively off of social cues they displayed.
good,Enjoyable work environment. Higher management encourages the success of their employees. I feel valued as an employee and am driven to maximize my potential.
good,"VEry fun place to work at, especially right out of high school. Focused on athlete life making sure they get the right product they need."
good,as part time the experience is good but sometimes slow days which means no revenue. Management is nice a long with the coworkers.
good,"A typical day at work was all about production. Working as fast and accurately as possible to finish that days work and get it shipped to stores."
good,Constant one-on-one sales to customers and maintaining appearance of the sales floor. Co-workers are usually fun and upbeat. The hardest part of the job is trying to avoid being sluggish after 8 hours on your feet constantly running back and forth for customers.
good,Great place to work especially if in school. They offer flexible hours and maintain a professionalism within the company always.
good,I've been trying to get into Footlocker since I was 14 years old. I loved working there. The only problem is the pay. You will get paid like a waiter anytime you sell anything in Footlocker. Most employees way less than minium wage after you break your check down hourly.
good,"When you would arrive the first thing you would do is set a goal of how much you wanted to make for the day and how much you wanted to sell in shoe care, insoles, and socks if your manager didn't already make one for you. Throughout the day you would strive to be the best sales associate you could be using their six strategies and being knowledgeable about the products. In my three years for working for Foot Locker Inc they have had good managers if not they got rid of them fast. It was always fun competition with my coworkers which helped us strive to maintain and  get better. It was like a family working for Footlocker. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help customers by any means. There would be times when a customer would pull off the shoe they came in with and they would ask for the same exact shoe. The model of the shoe they had could be years old but being knowledgeable about how to check inventory could help the customer leave out with the shoe they wanted by ordering through the store. The hardest part of the job was  the flexible scheduling and lack of full-time positions. I was switched to this store after Lady Footlocker closed down in my mall, I can say that this job increased my knowledge about products for not only women but men as well and it strengthened my efforts as a hard worker."
good,The job is what it is your either on the floor assisting customers or your a cashier. Definitely not a career job but its a good job to have.
good,"I love sneakers and sneaker culture. The environment is conductive to having a fun time while earning a living. A typical day would contain engaging with customers, handling/ being responsible for large amounts of money, pushing sales, restocking merchandise. At the end of my shift I would assist management with the day's review as well as count the day's earnings and sign off to dropping the money in our ""in- store bank deposit"". What i enjoyed most about my employment at footlocker was being able to engage with a lot of different people, I am an approachable personality so I found interacting with people to be my ""pro"" of the job."
good,"Everybody in the company is polite, patient, and helpful. I enjoyed working with the customers. The only downside to this job is all the rude customers and thefts we come in contact with."
good,"A typical day at footlocker for me usually consisted of me helping children find shoes they liked. Whenever a customer would come in with kids they would always be directed to me because I worked well with them. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing people leave happy with their purchase. The hardest part of the job was making sales when the mall was dead, other than that it was an easy job that provided great work experience."
good,Overall I managed the store to perform increase in sales. The hiring and training was an ongoing everyday. To make sure everyone had a chance to make their sales as commission was a main way for the team to make more money.  the customer service was very important to myself. happy customers meant more sales in the future.
good,"I loved working here back in the day especially when the economy was good. Once the economy changed and sales went down, management would ride you excessively."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of fast paste customer service. My job is to determine my clients needs and obtain a style and shoe size according to what has been described to me by my client. I have multiple clients at once and memorization is a key skill in this job. Foot Locker requires great skill of teamwork so communication is key. What I enjoy most about my work is satisfying my customers needs and seeing them go home happy with what they came into the store for and even more. I dislike when my store runs out of shoe sizes, this makes it difficult to meet my clients needs."
good,Foot Locker has been a great place to work the past 12 years. There really is no typical day there and that is what I like most about the job. Being in a management position has its pros and cons and has taught me a lot of skills.
good,"Working at Footlocker helped me further my ability to work with different types of co-workers, and different types of customers."
good,"A Typical Day at lady Footlocker was very fun and busy, my coworkers were more like my friends, my manager was great at fulfilling our need as associates,the hardest part of the job was trying to make day, some times we would have a large daily goal and we would have very slow customer traffic.Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting with all of the customers that came in and experiencing different personalities day to day."
good,"Working at Foot Locker is a wonderful experience. If you have a passion for assisting customers, this is the job for you. Foot Locker is a great job for teens and for adults. Anyone should apply."
good,"My typical day in job is meet new people with friendly atmosphere in wich I learned skills on the sale. I had a competitive team. I like all in my job and"
good,"Being part of management its pretty much the same. Customer service is the mane important factor. There's no hard part for me, we get to be ourselves which is the most enjoyable part.  Productive work place"
good,Basic Customer Service. Learned to have more self confidence. Management is Great. Colleagues are competitive. Hardest part was meeting goals.Most enjoyable part was interacting with multiple personalities.
good,"It was great loved working with one of my passions."
good,If you have a good manager who wants too see his or her people do will then you will enjoy working at footlocker.
good,I like interacting with peolpe and this job offered me the chance to day so.
good,"Maintain outstanding customer service, generate sales, merchandise product, and support the store management team"
good,"i love the people here, but the salary is not the best unless you make good commission."
good,"Working at Footlocker was a good experience. I was a part time sales representative. I learned a lot about sports wear and the different types of running shoes to meet the clients best interest. My co-workers were all great and always had a positive attitude. The hardest part of the job was the hours , they didn't have the best balance. Overall footlocker was a good company to work for and the commission was great!"
good,"A typical day at work was never really very busy, it was always quiet, not many people went in. It was quite enjoyable meeting new people and their interest in branded shoes and jerseys."
good,"A typical day is opening the store getting to service customers, making sure the workplace is clean and ready for business, i learned how to run a business train co workers and advance through the company. Dealing with all different types of customers and attitudes everyday but not letting them affect mine. I was a part of management and we worked well as a team, the hardest part was letting people go or writing them up. I enjoyed the environment flexible hours and discounts."
good,i love working here because its very diversified environment to work in and i love interacting with different people.
good,"its ok if youre really into shoes, the discount is great, sometimes customers are needy, management can be pain and pay isnt that great either unless youre at big store."
good,Exciting and positive work place. I get to me new people every day and have conversations on a friend to friend level.
good,Everyday the challenges were different thus allowing for an interesting and dynamic environment that constantly pushes you to try new and innovative solutions based on client and staff needs.
good,I had to keep the back stock and in order to make it easy to find the product. I learn how to do my job and help out others. The management and co-works were ok. The hardest part was to keep the stock room in order after a large shipment.
good,"You interact on a personal level with customers, learning about the sports they play and the jobs they have. Being able to talk sports at work made it fun."
good,"Walk into work at 8am, create the daily break shifts, doors open at 9am. The remainder of the day is just talking to customers and selling them items until they say, ""I have had enough."" Management is pretty young and cool; between ages 23-35. The company is Highly competitive, you are evaluated on a daily basis. Actual numbers are presented to show ""how productive you are!"" I loved the store, and the costumers. A regular associate produces annual sales for the company in the amount of $540,000."
good,A typical day at work would consist of helping customers find shoes based on their special needs. I learned the perfection of customer service while at this store. The job was overall enjoyable because of the fun environment management led the store in.
good,"Fast paste most of the time, the managers really seem to care about you. The co-workers were cool because you all have the common goal. The best part about foot locker is meeting new people every hour. Hardest part about the job is selling the apparel, socks, and shoe cleaner. I learned a lot from Foot locker such as great customer service skills."
good,Working here was a great experience for me. I was able to learn the basics of sales and customer service from this company.
good,"*read daily reports "
good,"Fast-paced work environment with a focus on strong customer service and sales skills.  Difficult hours, but competitive pay."
good,"Démarrage de la journée en analysant les résultats de la veille et en communiquant, préparation de la journée en établissant les objectifs"
good,"A typical day at Foot Locker is full of entertainment. People from all different walks of like come in the store to get shoes, clothes, or accessories.It is a fast paced work environment, at any time you can be helping, 2 to 3 people at one time."
good,"opening"
good,"Le matin: contrôle et rangement de la marchandise, faire les nouvelles étiquettes, servir et conseiller la clientèle, planification des objectifs de la journée."
good,"nice work flow a lot of people coming in and out. I learned better customer service, how to help people find what they need and stocking. Management is nice and have great leadership. My co workers I get alone with very well. the hardest part is rearranging the store. the most enjoyable is working with new people and helping people out."
good,"greet customers, make sure everything that has been released is out the floor for customers to see. Management is very understanding and willing to work with you."
good,"On a typical day I will help multiple customers at once with either shoes or apparel. I will print SKU stickers to go in the shoes, I will fill shoe holes in the wall. My day will also include me closing the store usually. This will consist of me folding and organizing clothing, sweeping, changing the garbage, putting away and helping to count tills. The hardest part of my job is trying to quickly find shoes in the stock room while also trying to move through and avoid the mess. Sometimes if the stock room is disorganized, it can cause us to take longer than the customer would like to get their shoes. This is not helpful when we are trying to keep the customer happy as well as help them to leave with a decent and memorable experience. The part I like most about my job is when I give a customer exactly what they want and they end up leaving happy and with a smile. This makes me feel great about my job and remember how enjoyable it is when you can please someone and make them happy just by making their day easier."
good,"A typical day at foot locker starts by opening the store and making sure all displays are ready for customers, greeting them, bringing out variety of shoes for them to see, cleaning as we go through out the day, bringing out new products from the manifest, making sure the register is balanced, putting up creative displays and making phone calls to customers and warehouses placing in orders."
good,"-Assist customers on company's products and sale merchandise."
good,"I would engage with management to see what area of the store I would be working in. I would then engage with customers on sneaker care and accessories for their purchase. "
good,"FootLocker has great product for the customer and has wonderful people supporting their product. My store however that i was recently moved to because of them needing a new Assistant Store Manager because of one resigning was not the most professional work place. The Store Manager was a very respectful Manager, but tend to let other employees run over him and myself because they had been working with him for so long. Employees was very disrespectful to Myself ad customers at times and done things very frequently that they know was wrong. I loved to see the families with the children come in and i know exactly what they want and need. I learned that there are rude customers, but have to maintain a smile and help them the best way possible. I loved making a customer happy so that they will come back to our company. I loved the when we got new product and I could sale it to my best advantage whether I liked it or not."
good,I leared that working for a store if fun but a lot of work but i liked it there. I was the one management the back taking care of the shoe getting bnack to the boxes. i like working with the staff at foot locker there we great people meet new people and saw so people i had already knew. my job wasnt hard but i think they never gave me a good chance to help the customers. I enjoyed folding clothes and also not begin mainly on the floor.
good,"Love working at Foot Locker. Its something new almost everyday. As long as you have a solid team that cares about the customers and cares about the business, it can be a lot of fun."
good,A typical day consisted of keeping the sales floor and backroom clean and organized as well as provide costumer service. management of the store was very good. All co-workers were tolerable and friendly. 
good,"Made great sales, steady schedule and great discounts. The coworkers were great, I learned to stock and keep store organized. and upsale the products making the customers confortable."
good,Working at footlocker was a learning experience where as it assisted me with my communication skills. Working in an environment such as footlocker you have to know how to communicate with people in order to get them to purchase the product that you are trying to sale.
good,"Typically I would acquire the customers desired footwear and explain certain information regarding the footwear. I also straighten clothing racks, worked on the register and pushed to sell shoe accessories(cleaner, shoe string, ect.). I learned how to deal with unsatisfied customers. Management was up to par. My co- workers were fun to work with as well as very helpful. Finding things to do when the store became slow was the hardest part of the job. Meeting new people was the most enjoyable, especially the regular customers."
good,"Footlocker is a very fun yet challenging work environment. It will teach you how to multi-task as well as deal with a very wide variety of personalities. It gets challenging when the store is overwhelmed with customers,but that only makes me better personally."
good,"Footlocker was straight. The pay isn't all that good unless you are management. While working at Footlocker you get decent discounts and perhaps the joy of meeting new people all the time. The hardest part of the job is always selling add on's everybody don't won't socks, shoe cleaner, and insoles but the shoe is gonna sell on its own, but you have to sell it in order to get hours and etc. but overall Footlocker was good, hardly ever a dull moment. Its more of a high school/college job. I don't recommend this job for people who don't like selling or for people needing more money in order to make a living."

good,"Typical Store had 7-12 associates, heavy focus on attachment selling and upsell to better performance footwear."

good,I enjoy working with my coworkers because they all have a positive attitude about a lot of things. And when on the job they know how to stay focus and have fun at the same time.
good,"A Sales environment, where the customer is always right, the shoe always fits and Cinderella never shops there."
good,It was a very comfortable place to work at times. I felt that they could a valued there employees at little better. There was respect there but to a limit. They made it very hard to feel that what you did there was appreciated. And i felt that the managers were not firm enough. The employees did not respect each other that much either.
good,"Good pay and responsibility level, wide availability for advancement if able to move. Would still be there except for injury that precluded my return at the time."
good,Management's cool. Coworkers are alright. Customers are eh. Very very very flexible with hours. Not too many responsibilities. Good entry level job for students.
good,I enjoyed my time and experience at foot locker. A typical day working there is maintaing shoes walls stocked and knowledge of the product being sold daily.
good,"If you personally cannot connect with customers on shoes and know majority of shoes to help customers get exactly what they need and want when they come in, it’s not the right spot. The expectations are high and they expect you to continually exceed them."
good,Very cool fun and educational job to have this job is for people that are seeking to grow in a sneaker career you have to really sacrifice a lot to earn a lot here but you can move up and grow in the company
good,"Each day at work we have different tasks to complete. It could be from tagging and pricing clothing, remolding displays, lacing shoes and interacting with customers. There's really no hard part to the job, interacting and communicating with a diverse of different people everyday is the best part. You learn so many new things each day."
good,"I love the environment. It gets hectic sometimes but it can be a lot of fun helping people look for their next ""favorite pair of shoes"". When it gets slow it gets SLOW! Hours get cut quick and that's not good for someone who lives paycheck to paycheck (like me)."
good,Bonne expérience dans cette enseigne. Collègues agréable et professionnels.
good,Good company to work for. Enjoyed my time working for Whole Foods would recommend them as a great place for employment. Lots of opportunities to advance your career.
good,I love working here and dealing with customers. Unfortunately they had new management come in and wanted new employees. I highly recommend working there.
good,It was a good retail experience. I learned how to work well with others. I learned about working in retail. I enjoyed the experience it was a great 7 months.
good,"Footlocker is a good company to work for. They provide hours, benefits and more. The management is great and I have had a great experience being apart of it."
good,"This was one of my favorite jobs. It taught me many things about life, and what it means to work hard. My sales team was driven towards shattering expectations because we saw the potential for growth. The strategies I developed have helped me become a valuable employee because I will always aim to maximize potential because I have seen tremendous growth."
good,"It was an easy job, you got to interact with a lot of people from different cities, tourist and even sometimes celebrities. It was very fast past and it was always something to do."
good,It’s a great experience to and a great opportunity to grow. There is a lot opportunities once you are informed with it. This company does under pay you though.

good,"It's a really good company to work for if you're looking to advance in retail. Associates will learn so much if they are looking to become a manager with the company. There is a process to receiving your own store. Once you go through the process and the DM thinks your ready, then you would be able to run your own store."
good,"I have really enjoyed working for this company. What isn't great is that being part-time doesn't guarantee you are converted to full time. I am a hard worker, top of my team and struggle with being on the contract being that it's hourly."

good,"Foot Locker demands a lot from its employees for them to still compensating at the base wage of $7.25. It’s not a bad job ,but they need to increase pay if they want their business to splurge like it once did."
good,"Treat your employees better, specially if they are underaged and have no experience whatsoever in the workforce. Footlocker was great overall and gave me experience"
good,Footlocker gave me my start. I worked with inventory and gained skills with management. I would recommend Footlocker to anyone who is starting off . Its a good company

good,J'ai bien aimé travaillé à foot locker. Grâce à ce travail j'ai pu développer mon sens du relationnel
good,It’s nice but I don’t understand why there needs to be a 150 character minimum like idk what to write to be honest but if that’s what makes you guys happy here it is
good,Great place to work if  your really into retail.  Offers a numerous amount of merchandise to target all audiences.  Also opportunites to move forward with in the company.
good,"A typical day at the job open shop get ear phones to talk to each. Greet people with respect."
good,"When I was here, it was a brilliant company to work for. They took staff on nights out etc. the atmosphere in the stores were second to none. biggest regret was leaving here."
good,There is a casual dress code and most professional positions are very flexible with their scheduling. Unfortunately there is not a lot of advancement opportunities beyond for certain skill sets if you aren't willing to basically change your career. There is also some issues with under average pay. Overall a pleasant place to work with good people.
good,I really enjoy working for footlocker. I had great management and co-workers. Everyday was upbeat and always high energy. We all work hard but have fun connecting with customers.

good,Fun structured work environment.  Positive and enthusiastic management.  Ability to advance your career with productive training program.  Customer Service training.
good,Job was really easy I would come into work and just cash out customers sometimes the day could be slow or  fast you never know. When there’s no customers I focused on folding clothes and cleaning up.
good,"I love working there.. The hours are great, product selection is cool as well as the atmosphere. Great management and stafd. Glad to part of such a solid team."
good,it has its pros and cons but pros outweigh the cons by a lot.  Easy hours but not the best pay unless you’re a manager or lead position. Able to promote but takes time
good,was a good place to work for meeting new staff and engaging with customers most fun about the job was hitting my targets and making my boss see the potential i have to give and never missing my targets was fun i hit my monthly targets in one week
good,such an easy job! if you don't like a challenge this is the place to go. easy hours that suit you. the staff are very welcoming. The only problem i had with that place is the uniform. if you are a size 4/6 (female) there is no chance any uniform will fit.
good,"Good place to work someone who knows about sneakers and athletic gear is good to work there"
good,Working at footlocker can be a fun experience for some and quite challenging for others. This is a fast paced survival of the fittest kind of environment. With patience and awareness you’ll go far in this company

good,"Each store has a different environment, but I was lucky with the location I was in. Everyone was like a family and we all got along very well. When you get along with your co-workers it makes the job easier. As a cashier, I did a little bit of every duty in the store. This job can be very fast paced at times, but its never stressful."
good,Solid company to work for....being in management can be tough while having a family but Foot Locker was good to me in this regard. I was able to do my job effectively and properly and still have time for my kids!
good,its your typical experience with shoes and clothes and selling them to people. basically helping them each day with things they want to buy. pretty simple.
good,Very flexible place for growth but a lot of lost opportunity missed based on the management being unable to set structure amongst the team. But definitely a very creative work environment with high traffic Foreign/abroad clientele.

good,I loved working there people are nice they follow rules but aren’t strict they’re friendly they offer goodbye opportunities they offer transferring if needed and they are flexible they just need to offer better hours
good,As a person working part time this place was great because of the discount had the best shoes in high school and hook up the family really well. Overall fun times.
good,"Footlocker Canada offers an array of benefits that help contribute to balanced lives, general well-being and supportive personal and professional relationships."
good,"Simply wake up to Learn new Faces and agree/disagree with the Management sometimes. The work culture was a Mixed race. And the hardest part would be remembering how many sales you made in the day, but I enjoyed the Customers."
good,I love shoes and I love people a lot so it was a pretty easy job to me the only thing I would say is that if you work certain days it’s easy to make a lot of money because on release dates of shoes u get them sale versus a normal Monday or Tuesday where it is hard to do
good,"I enjoyed my stay there and learned a lot. Atmosphere is remarkable. Culture is cooperative and administration is very considerate."

good,"A typical day at footlocker is greeting customers when they are walking in, making sales during the day, and keeping the store neat. I learned how to communicate with people more and I found more interest in sales management as a major. The management was really good, and they were very helpful. The hardest part of the job was knowing where to find the shoes in the back room. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people and being in the mall."
good,"great for getting discount and other places own by footlocker. flexible with hours. short lunch breaks. easy pace, fast pace on the weekends. 3 times a year 50% off discount"
good,"One of the main reasons I love this job is that I myself whom other would consider a "" Sneaker-Head "", From all kinds I can tell you ins and outs of the shoes on today's market."
good,stock room was very disorganized and the experienced people were non diligent and left everything to the new workers. which necessary isn't a good idea. but it was a great experience enjoyable working experience
good,"The company was very friendly and was always helpful when you needed help.  The hours were long though and caused many issues.  The upper management, district, was always helpful when needed."
good,"This job is perfect if your are a high school student who is just looking for a little cash in their pocket. Management is amazing, there are some nice people. They respect child minor labor laws."
good,This job provided me with the skills necessary that talk to customers and interact also to help me gain a better idea of shoes and what it’s like to work in sales
good,"A typical day at work would be very busy and competitive. Either we are helping multiple customers, or helping one and maintaining the sales floor and stock room. "
good,I really had a great learning experience at Footlocker from employees and customers. This company would allow you to go a step further and give you the opportunity to grow within.
good,Was a Great place to work after college . Gained some real hands on sales and management experience. This place had a real solid workplace culture that really enjoined . Management was very solid. You can advance fast if you have a great personality and work hard.
good,"Buen ambiente y buen trabajo en general. Si no te gusta vender igual no es tu trabajo ideal ya que hay objetivo de ventas en todo, pero también hay una comisión que puede ser decente."
good,Footlocker isn't a career job. it could be a good 2nd job or part time job. I was there part time and sometimes it can be fast past job. dealing with multiply people. I love shoes and I love dealing with individual people>
good,the working environment was fast paced which helped me learn to be quick on my feet. The hardest part was dealing with angry or restless customers but the coworkers made work fun.
good,Footlocker was a fun place to work! Helped me get to know people in the community. Also helped me become a better sales man. Creating relationships with customers is good!
good,Didn’t like footlocker what so ever not enough hours but the people that I worked with were pretty cool some managers ain’t cool I liked it at first but than I didn’t
good,The day began with floor changes that were not finished from the night before. price changes are done before we open. We checked all racks and wall to ensure they are full and fixed.  The sales floor is competitive and fun.  The people are great.  I learned a lot from my store manager.  He was the one who got me to move into management.  the Hardest part was traveling during 2008. Gas was expensive so I had to relocate to a location closer to my house. Unfortunately there were no stores so I had to leave. Wish I hadn't.
good,Footlocker is a nice place. I enjoyed the most is working with my manager who showed me everything in the workplace and is patient on teaching how the cashier work and placing sensors on merchandise. The only bad thing is when I was an internship I wasn't really working and their company policy was I wasn't really allowed to talk to costumers.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of; greeting customers and giving outstanding customer service. I learned how to count in and close out a register. I also learned how to unload shipment and manage inventory. As far as management, i stepped up to the plate and played the role as a sales lead associate. At closing i counted all of our money, put in our deposits;and calculated our revenue to see if we made day. The workplace culture was very up-beat. We had today's daily hits playing and all of our associates were on the floor engaging with customers. The hardest part of the job was probably handling shipment orders because they were very time consuming and tedious. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting all the customers needs, and receving great feedback; via surveys and through my manager."
good,FootLocker is a great job for those who are new to employment it offers room to grow within the company. It is also an ideal place to work on customer service skills.
good,"Footlocker is a great starting job, especially as a part-time employee. The culture you're exposed to is very interesting and allows you to meet a variety of people as you work, but over time it tends to become repetitive and not as interesting as it used to be, over the course of a couple of years. The most enjoyable part of the job is making a customer's day, or setting them on the right path for the shoe they're looking for. There is also no real hard part of this job, as it is just a group of somewhat simple tasks."
good,"It was an alright job to have, not the best but it was very hard working. The management was not the best either, but the people who worked there alongside you were very nice and good people."
good,"nice work environment, team friendly, work based on commission, pay rate depends on skill level or job applied for. busy work environment, its just having fun while selling shoes."
good,Stack shelves and organize things around the store. We also worked as a team to provide customer service. Meeting the goals needed for a sales associate in the store.
good,Nice place to work at  they gave a great discount and the people I worked with were very cool . I loved helping people find what they needed at footlocker
good,I enjoyed working at Footlocker. It taught me how to be manager and get the best out of my employees. The hours always change from week to week. Holidays was extremely busy.
good,Working in the back i learned how to put all the shoes in order by every size really fast . By keeping up on the first time I was scheduled in the back a lot and then I got switched to cashier and on the floor .
good,The people are great especially satisfying the customers needs and taste in shoes. Providing to a wide variety of background ethnicities was satisfying to me as I found something unique about them.
good,Working at Foot locker definitely teaches me how to treat others and how to talk to people. Also it shows me how to sell a product to a person and how to handle merchandise.
good,"Management pushed us in positive ways to achieve personal, and store quotas. Always had a good time working. The first time I sold a record high in sales it was recognized by all employees, and gave me the confidence to sell more."
good,"Working at Footlocker was fun because i love sports. It is a great atmosphere, fun and challenging, and brings in all walks of life. It is a great place to work if you have an active lifestyle and enjoy helping others with theirs"
good,"The average day at Footlocker was relaxing in the sense that management didn't put stress on the employees. Everyone could go at their own pace, because employees worked off of commission. Although it was not stressful and people could work at their own pace, it was competitive."
good,really enjoyed working with the company. sometimes you never really know what youre getting into with a new company. but i must admit these people really are organized and efficient
good,All you have to focus on is selling shoes and making sure there is no theft. I've learned ways to sell a product through my experience working here. The main perk of working is for the discount.
good,"beautiful love this place I wish I still worked here... honestly but I only did for TPP program. I would recommend everyone was nice and friendly I felt like home they were funny,...."
good,The back stock was easy to navigate. Gave me multiple tours in the back to get comfortable with the stock. Enjoyed where I worked. I learned communication and selling skills.
good,Working at Foot Locker was one of the best experiences I had. I walked in with a great managing crew who were dedicated and ready to help me succeed at this job. The culture was great and the work environment was awesome. I know that if I ever needed to go back they would invite me with open arms.
good,azienda seria  solida e ben organizzata sempre al passo con i tempi
good,This was my first retail job and it introduced me to management. Great Company with a lot of perks. Great Opportunity to succeed Pay is okay you have the ability to maximize.
good,i have a love for trainers so being around them everyday made me happy. i was just as excited as customers who came in and asked what the good things about the sneaker were! i'd explain it with such passion too. i miss this place.
good,Doing sales and helping the people who sells. I learned about staying calm even at the toughest moments. It was all teamwork which is very important to have to work good.
good,"Footlocker was a great atmosphere ,learned a lot on how to make sales as a sales associate. Made a lot of people happy coming in and out of the store. it was great lesson on sales and I will forever appreciate the opportunity ."
good,"tanta roba, ottima preparazione e tanta voglia di far crescere I dipendenti"
good,I enjoyed the workplace until I was introduced to 5 different managers in the 6 months I was there. The flow was messy and there was also complaints from the customers.
good,Commission is a part of the employees pay so it can be competitive for an sales associate. With so many people coming to buy shoes there are enough customers to go around.
good,"Great job if you're into sneakers. You get good discounts off of new releases. If you're not into being on your feet your whole shift and going up and down to the stock room, as well as taking time and memorizing to locate sneakers then this job isn't for you."
good,"Travail physique"
good,"Working at Footlocker was a great experience. My coworkers were friendly and easy to get along within the workplace. I also, obtained many work skills such as working with customers that aren’t happy and working with the cash register."
good,Working at Footlocker is great if you love shoes. I am huge on shoes and I love helping people find a shoe that fits their needs and wants. its great there but they dont give hours. i work short shifts about three days a week.
good,If i had to  give my own oppinion about footlocker i would say thats its a good place to work at least in the location where i work and my team makes it a better place. I am a sales asscotiacte and i help people look for shoes there size there style and there eeryday wear. for instance there are everyday shoes cross training shoes shoes for walking for flat feet or for curved feet. a typical day at work all i do iis greet anyone who comes to my store ask if they need help and just interact and connect with my customers. the hardest part of my job in my opnion would be remembering every sneaker and color codes. the most enjoyable part of my job is connecting with people and helping with what they want. I live for helping people.
good,a typical day we set up service the customers stock the shelves and do security I learned teamwork and commitment.it was a fairly easy job nothing was really hard about the job the most enjoyable part was the great employee discounts
good,Great place to work if you're looking for part time. The pay is minimum wage but if you can sell well enough you can get commission which is always nice.
good,"Only 3 to 4 times out of the year, the team is actually constantly getting money. As the store manager, my salary is always the same so I feel for my co workers when it's the slow times of the year because their paychecks aren't great but they aren't bad either. It's very routine so it does get boring to not be challenged often."
good,"Workplace culture is competitive. as you are working for commission and trying to sell ""add ons"" such as cleaner, laces and protectants. Upper management was always awesome. Hardest part of the job was changing sales sometimes that would only last three days or so. Most enjoyable part was working in the mall."
good,Overal as a company I liked it. I did not like the drama that came with it. This distric I worked for did not like me and used it to theier advantage.
good,"Nice place to work, good work environment all round for learning new Technologies. "
good,I enjoyed working here but its time for a new environment . I feel like I'm ready to branch off with something new and explore other opportunities that other jobs have to offer
good,"I been working there for over a year and a half it's the best job I ever had , you meet different people everyday , it makes you feel at home . Everyone there is a family"
good,"Footlocker is a great company to start with if your trying to step into the corporate world. Well rounded, everyone is helpful. good promotional opportunities."
good,Great Coworkers
good,It was a great place to work. Friendly employees made the work environment stress free. I drove around on various different forklift machines and the work wasnt overwhelming.
good,"Great  working with the customers and learning about the different products that were available for walker, runners, and several different sports. Great manager experience"
good,"Awesome place to meet quotas, work as a team, and collaborate. Awesome people interactions.Just a cool place to work especially there music sound tracks."
good,A typical day at Foot Locker would be to restock shoes and merchandise. Open register for store opening. Take calls for orders over the phone. Assist customer with shoe purchase. I learned to work in a team culture. The most enjoyable thing was the discount and being able to buy Gym shoes at a great discount.
good,"Contributed with the proper opening and closing of the store."
good,"This place is much more uniform than any other retail shoe store I have ever seen. The culture of Foot Locker is breathtaking, involving regulars and new customers every weekend waiting in line for the next big shoe. An extremely competitive field but an amazing environment overall."
good,It was a one of a kind job u learned allot bout shoes different peopla. U get the chance to see how it feels to have people appreciate ur work effort @ talent. U meet Ahtletes @ Celebrities. But most of all u work out @ staying in shape is a GREAT-FEELINuG
good,"Loved working here, but didn't have a chance to advance in management when I was there.  Pay was great, and atmosphere was wonderful.  only reason I left is because I couldn't grow in the company."
good,"This job was great for just starting a working life. Provides great discounts for employees, and completely understanding of a employee also being in school"
good,"Great place to work for a first job, just to get your feet in the door entering the work force. For the most part it is more relaxed. Only time it gets fast paced is the holidays or different events such as back to school season. Management is great and the co-workers. It is real competitive but at the end of the day everyone is still a team and everyone is willing to help out one another, and you all end up becoming a family."
good,"I like the Management Staff with Footlocker.  I like the discount, also the learning experience that I had in learning retail and the way the systems works in buying and selling shoes to the different customers."
good,"High energy fun place to work. The discount is great. You get to make a lot of friends, if you do a really good o with customers they will always come in looking for you."
good,bonne entreprise en therme de fomations et bonne ambiance collective
good,"It is a great company to work for, but not for everyone. It is very fast paced, helping 5+customers at a time is challenging. Lots of room for advancement"
good,"Throughout my time at  foot Locker and Champs Sports, I learned a fair amount about the sales trade and trying to consistently expand upon a sale. When you are relying on commission to make your money, it can get very cut-throat but I was never one to steal sales although I worked with many that didn't have the same moral calendar. Only think I would change about the job is how they hire managers. I was subject to two that weren't' ready for their own store and it lead to an ultimate downfall and even a firing in one case."
good,"High sales volume working environment, with great reward program for employees. A fun working environment with benefits and discount programs. Started as a full time employee and moved up to store manager in 2 years. The hardest part of the job was the working hours during the holidays as this is the biggest sales production time during the year,but the discounts and free food made it worth the time."
good,"The job can be either fast pace or slow pace depending on what day and time but there's always work that needs to be done as some of the co-workers say ""If yo have time to lean you have time to clean."" The only thing that would really make the job stressful is if another person didn't finish their task before they left other than that it's not that stressful."
good,a pleseant place to work must have knowlodege up on your sneekes... working with younger employees was not so pleaseant .You must have knowledge up on the sneakers.
good,Working there was fun. I always liked sneakers and I was very happy to have been given the opportunity to work there as my first job. The environment was fun and there never was a dull moment with our staff.
good,"Working at foot locker nothing was really learned except for how to their job, but everything was commonsense. The job was laid back and the management was cool as long as you was a good sales person.  The culture was really on the manager of that store, but the one I was in was around respect and professionalism. Nothing hard about the company and the easiest part was everything."
good,Footlocker was a good job for somebody who wants and needs work experience. it was a very cool environment and relaxed workplace even though their were spurts of people who came in and made it busy. I left because i wanted to take on more responsibility at a higher institution.
good,I enjoy working at Kids Foot Locker due to my mother getting sick I have to let the job go but other than that I love the job very flexible schedules extra overtime if you need it extended family to work with
good,"Luogo di lavoro pieno di obiettivi giornalieri da raggiungere e forte motivazione anche da parte dei responsabili."
good,"working at Footlocker was exciting."
good,"Awesome environment, awesome experience and awesome coworkers. Been in formation for a year and really had an awesome time while working for a Great Company"
good,"Mina erfarenheter kombinerat med min vilja att alltid lära mig mer samt få nya erfarenheter har skapat en social förmåga hos mig som jag ser som en av mina bästa styrkor. Jag trivs både i att samarbeta med andra människor och är trygg i att prata med folk jag inte nödvändigtvis känner. Dessutom gillar jag att ta ledarrollen och att arbeta i ett högt tempo."
good,I started when I was 17 years old and worked my way up the management ranks. Footlocker use to have a lot of great discounts and benefits to being an employee. I would most definitely recommend this job to anyone looking for a steady career option involving customer service
good,"A typical day includes completing paperwork, helping customers, processing shipments and counting out registers. Attending to customers every need always comes first at footlocker and with the opportunity for rising commission, you're going to want it to be your only focus."
good,Foot Locker was very accommodating with my schedule since I was working another job.  The discount was really convenient but the minimum wage was a little bit of a downside.  My manager really pushed us to be competitive by getting sales.
good,Foot Locker is a fun job to have while you are in high school or college. I would not want to work there past that. The numbers they have you try to meet are absurd.
good,Foot Locker is a fast pace enviroment with plenty of work. Have to deal with customers every hour of the day. Also have to get a good customer skills and knowledge on the shoes that you are showing to the customers.
good,The job was ok. Not a tough job. The job was only tough on certain seasons like christmas or back to school just like an retail jobs. management was ok.
good,This job is cool for a college student. I became a assistant manager after only 1 year. The experience will very based on location. My store was fun most of the time.
good,"Styled hair for large events such as annual fashion shows and special hair expos."
good,"-Showing up too work helping people with their shoe sizes and friendly conversations about what and why they needed certain shoes, helping kids with their sizes and dealing with the money and the packages that were either sent or received"
good,"Walk in smiling to work every day, just observing all of the new and fresh shoes that are out on the walls. Provide great customer care and drive sales to the best of my ability"
good,I would work there again if I had the chance. But I learned a lot from the company and I will take those skills with me to the next work chapter in my life.
good,The hardest part of this job was to keep staying awake. When I worked there I worked morning shift and it was so slow we barely got many customers during this time.
good,"Great uptempo work environment, great vibes all-around and well oriented people who treat everyone like family.  Being able to interact with good people all day is a great thing to me and I appreciate everyone i work with."
good,Its a great sales job to get experience they push you to you full potential. You learn so much about the sales business. You learn how to manage multiple type of customers.
good,Retail depends on the day of the week and if there is a holiday approaching. Sometimes super fast paced and other times no customers. The tone of the store depends on the manager or assistant manager. Hardest part of the day is difficult customers. Most enjoyable part of the day is when everyone is working like a well oiled machine.
good,"I loved working at footlocker, it was amazing. This was the first job I had in retail and I loved it ! I worked with amazing people and loved my customers. I would be asked for by name, and what a good feeling that was! I love this company and thank them for teaching me so much !"
good,"Ambiente divertente, adatto a persone aperte pazienti e solari, a sempre a contatto con le persone."
good,Footlocker was a brilliant place for me to work whilst saving to go on my travels around South East Asia. I was very interested in the products that were sold there and benefited from the staff discounts.
good,It is a great part-time job while going to school. You make what you wish to make by selling shoes (commission). You get discounts on shoes and have opportunities of growing in the company.
good,"the discounts there were amazing, especially when it was friends and family discount week. The management team was amazing they worked with school schedule."
good,"relaxing "
good,It's a good job just not for part time you won't make enough money to pay bills they have good benefits though far as shoe discount if your looking for a job to help get you on your feet footlocker is not the job unless you go in full time
good,"The location I worked at wasn't very popular, so we didn't have many customers on a daily basis. It was fairly easygoing and relaxed. I learned how to handle money and ship out large orders to other locations. The hardest part of the job was getting to know all the names of the different shoes the store had to offer. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to swap shifts with people to either take leave or to work over time."
good,"we great all the customers who come into the store, "
good,my experience at the footlocker located in Duffrin mall that is now changed to kids foot locker was nice i crushed the top seller in my first week working there there .i was told this by the manager working there by the name of lee who is also i very good manager now working at scarborough town centre.i learned the scue numbers on the merchandise delivered to the store and i worked overtime.

good,"It's straight Could be better but they got some issues up in that place, people don't mind their own business and management doesn't act accordingly.."
good,While working for one of the largest shoe retailers my customer service improved a great amount. I was always looking for ways to make each shopping experience unique for each customer.
good,"Foot Locker is over all a great place to work. Everyone works together in a respectful manner like a family. The managers are amazing, and help you with any of the questions you have."
good,very nice enviorment and good team learned alot of things had very good customers sometimes rude ones but overall a good job only thing is pay isnt always the best

good,I worked several days a week and the management team was good and the team i worked with was good.  we had a lot of fun while working.  The pay was not that bad.
good,"The best place to work, by far. However, it is still a job where you're expected to be on time and do an above average job performance. Well worth the inner satisfaction though."
good,"	Answered customer’s questions about merchandise and advised customers on merchandise selection.  "
good,no complaints. I really enjoyed. Met a lot of friendly people that helped me out along the way. It was a nice challenge when we had to met monthly sales goals

good,Great environment. I learned to quit being shy and grow up basically. I was working with highly motivated and driven people. The managers were tough but that led me to become a very determined person in life. It was nice to work with competitive people. I had to make decisions to be more and get out of my childhood shell.
good,: Organize merchandise in stock room. Greet customers as well as make sure the floor is ready for customers. Answer phones and ensure all customers have been helped. Process online orders as well as returns. Make sure the team was ready for big days like shoe releases which would require more employees on the sales floor. Open and close the store along with other employees.
good,My time at footlocker was short lived because of timing of our lease in the mall and our jobs were cut and all the employee's were laid off which was unfortunate

good,"Depending if it is a good or bad day, that is how your paychecks will come out. It is a competitive based pay against your coworkers that will motivate you to sell"
good,I started here as a part time associate and quickly got accustomed to the fast paced work environment. After that I was able to move up quickly through various training and  exceeding sales goals. Management was very willing to teach me the tools i needed to succeed.
good,"Footlocker is all about sales and its a fast paced shopping environment where you meet customers from good to bad. The good ones know what to buy and need a little assistance picking out their favorite brand name sneakers. Where as the difficult customers usually take longer time in the store and seek more attention from associates. Footlocker is a high quality store where shoppers are coming in to spend on high priced products, and you receive competitive commission wages which help raise your paycheck."
good,I enojoyed working at foot locker meeting new people and most of all helping customers find the shoes they were looking for which allow them to leave the store happy and want to come back and shop again

good,"Footlocker was a great learning experience and my first job.They taught me how to be kind and how to cater to the customers. It was a very busy place to work and required alot of very fast paced work. This job had almost no opportunities to move up in the ranks though without working there for years and years, and even then your easily replaceable."
good,I enjoyed my time at Foot Locker.  The crew I worked with worked very well together and the manager treated everyone with respect. The only downside for me was the pay.
good,"The work week could be busy at times not only with customers but with shipment of new shoes, apparel, paperwork, etc. I learn not only how to multitask and being part of a team/ family. The workplace culture is amazing. The hardest part of the job is finding room in the back for all the shoes when theres a lot of shipment. The most enjoyable part is the people that work there."
good,"Good company to work for very well know great progression"
good,Working at footlocker gave me a jumpstart into the retail industry. I felt very welcome with the management team.

good,Great place to work dealing with shoes and clothes. Love the feeling of helping people purchase new and much needed clothes and shoes. Wish they paid more. Would do it again.
good,"Staff is amazing. Footlocker has its own culture, by that I mean, when you come into work everyone that works there believes in the same thing and actually feels like youre working with family, rather than associates."
good,Great place to work and create customer relationships. employees are like family. Managers are great role models. high energy needed.  Great benefits and promotions.
good,"Great environment to be around, there's always a ton of positive energy between co-workers. Usually throughout a shift things start to become really fast-paced. Sometimes we receive 30-80 boxes of shipment while theres at least 10-15 customers in-store. Lost prevention has been a issue, a lot of protocol has been put in to place but never seems to reduce the amount of theft. It could become pretty difficult maintaining balance between stock and the sales floor. Never the less, Footlocker is a great place to work if you have a passion for sneakers plus you get great deals!"
good,"Relación empresa/trabajador correcta."
good,it is a good place for kids that want a job in high school and a lot of kids nowadays want to buy the hottest sneakers  out there you are given a 30 % discount on any shoe.

good,"The company's mission statement describes of what type environment and culture they want to image. As a manager, you the opportunity to feel like an CEO. You have access to process payroll, hire candidates, negotiate with merchandiser, and scheduling. For individuals to get experience at management, Footlocker is a company they should consider"
good,"Not a bad place to work.  Many opportunities for advancement, either up or sideways.  Had a manager that was willing to teach and a supervisor that was willing to learn from me."
good,"As a recent graduate (who started working at Foot Locker while enrolled in a college program), I can say that this is a great place to start for a young talent (like myself). Foot Locker helps you to build a proper attitude, provides with all tools needed to acknowledge/explore how to deliver exceptional customer service and serves as a bright example of sales-driven position (meaning you still learn the concept of such jobs). And, of course, fun and positive vibes if you really like what you're doing (in other words, if you are a sneaker head or essentially like communicating with people everywhere you go). "

good,I had an internship with the ROP program and was at Footlocker first but then changed to Kids Footlocker due to the uninterested employers. My experience at kids foot locker was well enough to see how the work force is.
good,"greeting new people everyday, helping people find specific shoes that fit there needs. hardest part of the job is learning how to file paper work for shipments."
good,"Good job, Very time-consuming learn a lot about not only sneakers but the sports, music world, and fashion culture. meet new people and see what people from around the world likes to wear."
good,This is a really great company to work for especially if you want to grow and advance with a company. there are opportunities to advance with just 6months in the company.
good,Fun .staff and management are great. awesome customer service knowledge and experience. you get to learn about latest shoes. staff discount. overall great customer service experience.
good,For my first job I advanced pretty quickly and leaned how to work in a team setting. Management was very proactive in helping us advance within the company.
good,"Days at work were enjoyable,we all got along great.manager customers co worker it was always just a positive work place where I learned a lot about life an being happy at what you where doing."
good,"Aprendí mucho a la par de mi jefe, me enseño mucho a deshinibirme y el trato perfecto hacia el cliente,  los años en Foot locker fueron por lo general muy buenos, decidí dejar este trabajo para poder dedicarme a estudiar"
good,Footlocker helped meet many different people also help out many customers and have customers be satisfied with their purchase. It was always great to interact with others also with co-workers they are very helpful.
good,I only worked at footlocker for a week or so because it was only for the All-Star weekend but i loved every minute of it. a typical day was on the floor trying to sell products to customers and helping them with their needs. I learned how to be comfortable in sometime hectic environments where you really have to be on your toes. Management was really cool there they really make you feel like apart of the footlocker family and all the co-workers were always there if you needed any help. The hardest part about any job really is having to deal with the rude disrespectful customers whop wont even hear you out but that is when you just call a manager. The most enjoyable part of the job  was getting to meet new people who all share common interest with you and making new friends.
good,"Very fun environment to work with. Never a bad time at work, always have good costumers and good company. Management is very cool and they make work fun as well."
good,"The Co-workers are very easy to get along with and the teamwork there is amazing. Also learned a lot about shoes, not only the different brands but also what they are used for and the comfort and stability of a shoe."
good,Management is outstanding and understanding. The co-workers are like family. Wonderful place to be around. Work day goes by so quickly and fun. Customers are the most enjoyable part of my day
good,you must work fast and have great memory of the stock. You must have knowledge on fashion and on release dates. you must also know how to persuade people into buying your product.
good,"come at your scheduled time"
good,What I Learned Is That There Is Always Tasks To Be Done. Management Is Communicative. The Co workers Are Teamwork Oriented.
good,A typical day at work consist of helping costumer selling items and having fun while doing it. the managers were always very helpful my co workers were always on time and hands on. the hardest part of the job was when we didn't have an item available and we had to tell the costumer to order it online.

good,"A normal day at work for me is interesting. We have the regular shoppers that come in, laughing, having fun, yet getting the help and service that they need. We also experience new customers who also get the same type of treatment. I've learned patience and definitely how to make sure the customer is happy at the end of the day. Working with my managers and co-workers were also very helpful. When I didn't have the answers for a question that was asked, they jumped right in to assist me. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers but it always ended well. The most enjoyable part is being able to connect with the customers the way I did."
good,"Meeting new customers, influencing people into buying the latest sneaker out with sports gear to go with it. Standing in a store for about 8 hours a day, you learn to become a product in your environment and we looked at our work team as a family. The most enjoyable part about this job is that you get first grabs on the latest sneaker that is coming out"
good,"Going to work, getting my job started and done perfectly. Communicating with my employers and staff. Showing great leadership. Learning more everyday about the job. Be aware of my surroundings. Excellent personality. The most enjoyable part of the day would be seeing new people ever day and getting to get closer with your team that works with me/you."

good,"The work day is very productive, the management is understanding and flexible they help in anyway they can. Footlocker is very clean and organized so the merchandise is easy to locate"
good,The pay and benefits are nice. They bring in different food vendors regularly and have food days and celebrations for holidays and events such as customer service week. All of the managers and supervisors are very helpful and you're provided with a large amount of training when hired. You get a discount which is nice. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is a very stressful job and you will get verbally assaulted by multiple customers daily.
good,"fun place to work, selling shoes, and clothing, did receiving, operation and training ,   commission job, good benefits"

good,Assist customers with finding shoes and fetching them from the back.  Then  I would ring the customers out and leave them with a good impression of the store as they left
good,"The typical day was fun with a lot of customer interaction. It is a lot of back and forth walking to get shoes from the back of store but nothing too strenuous. I learned a lot about different shoes, insoles and cleaning, and customer relations. The hardest part of the job was some of the other employees. Several friends were hired and decided they did not have to work as hard since they were friends with upper management."
good,"The people in this workplace made the job as good as it was. Every one was always happy to help and lend a hand when it was needed and if no one in your store could help you could call just about any store in Australia and know that you were going to get a hand. "

The most enjoyable part of any day was seeing customers and having friendly conversations."
good,"Great environment to work in. Commission is nice, great people to work with, benefits and discounts are nice as well. Putting away drags are not very appealing."
good,Working at Kids Foot Locker is an extremely fun position for shoe lovers. Helping customers with different styles to putting outfits together with the accessories the store has is fun and the benefits while working here is great.
good,"The pay is not all that great, but the discounts and benefits are. Holidays and back to school could be a hassale but overally its rewarding with customer satisfaction."
good,"i worked as cashier and i help customers form placing orders, garbing shoes, telling them the newest product and also leaving them with a lasting impression so they would return. i work in footlocker for almost about five years."
good,If you love shoes and helping people find the right product this is a cool place to work for.  Working here gave me confidence that I never knew I had to be the leader I am today.
good,"Pretty easy job, maximize sales and add hooks ups onto the sale. Best part for me was working with my co workers as a team. Hardest part is memorizing the stock room, but once you get started it only gets easier as time goes by running back and forth grabbing shoes."
good,"I love working as a team. Our team would always compete with each other,Different Malls, and Stores. Exciting place to be at, Footlocker was a job where I learn how to push myself."
good,"I used to love working at footlocker, but being that I was in high school it was hard for me to have transportation back and forth. A typical workday would be going in at like 5PM right after school and greeting customers as well as providing them with great customer service until it was time to close. At the end of a duty day, we'll clean the store and count the register."
good,"Great place to work if you enjoy sports and customer service. Sometimes there are chances to get additional work hours, must nothing excessive or demanding."
good,It's a good company to work for when you're younger unless you want to make a career out of it. The pay is lower but they're making an effort to do better as a company and treating their employees better.
good,Because I love sneakers footlocker was one of the places I always wanted to work and as soon as i started managers and co-workers treated me like I was working there for ages. The managers were five stars always supported me in everything and my co-workers as well.

Overall it was a great experience.
good,the customers would always put a smile on your face no matter what kind of day that you were having. Co-workers are real friendly and supports every decision you make
good,"A typical day at this job was selling shoes and workout clothes. This is enjoyable if you're good at it and are personable person at work. The hardest thing here is simply the people who just window shop. They won't get you a sale. Here, you learn how to become more personable if you're not already and you learn how to sell in a fun way. Management here at the time was very cool and fun to talk to."
good,The management team are very helpful with the needs and misunderstanding of all employees. They make you feel like a family member and keep you going.
good,I love the people that I worked with and totally missed them once I transferred schools.  The relationships that I build were great.
good,"A typical day at work would be to not only provide or customers with the best customer experience. Daily tasks would be to set a daily goal and getting tasks done such as. Price changes, visual merchandising, emails training development daily and daily inventory control with merchandise. What I enjoyed most about footlocker was the merchandise we carry and our daily interactions with our customers."
good,"The daily goal is to increase sales, not only to reach day which is based off last years numbers. Personal goals, store reorganization, and competitions between employees drives associates to sell. Expand beyond the original sale by adding additional merchandise that complements the customers choice. Being able to relate with the customers interest of shoes allows each sale to be personal and the customer will surely return to buy again from the store. Management works alongside other employees to lead by example and walks through a sale on the sale floor. The most enjoyable part is the overall experience and in sight on upcoming shoes and sneaker news."
good,"friendly people "
good,"Sale, sale, sale is what a is being done all day, if not you are making sure the stock room is organized. I learned that if they buy shoes they got to buy some socks or shirt or some shoe cleaner.The hardest part was getting people to buy what they didn't come in for."
good,Good workplace to grow as an associate and person.  Huge opportunity to advance inside from part time to management.  Works around school and takes career minded individuals very serious. A company that always strives to be the best at everything they do and improve every year.
good,"I learned how to organize my time, to interact with different types of people, and to work as a team.  Each day can be different."
good,"A typical day at work consists of greeting customers with a conversation as soon as they walk into the store. Our goal is to drive sales so as associates, we like to help guide customers to their specific section of the store that meets their needs (basketball shoes, kids' casual, women's walking, etc.). It's good to stay close to customers in case they have any questions or would like to request us to bring out the shoe in their specific size. Usually they ask how much arch support is in the shoe or what each feature of the shoe offers for the foot. After bringing out their desired shoe with the correct size, it's automatic to allow them to try on the product to experience & picture themselves using the product. From there, I can either suggest additional merchandise (called a hook-up) or suggest a better shoe that will provide what the previous shoe is missing (more support, better color, etc.). After making the sale, it is best to reinforce their decision by complementing the shoes or merchandise they're purchasing. If we sell a shoe off of the display wall, it is our job to replace it with the same shoe or another shoe that fits the wall & makes sense (unfilled displays on shoe wall is called a hole). If there are no customers in the store, I usually straighten the wall of shoes, other merchandise, and sweep floors so that they are more presentable and easier to find in the store. From time to time, I am asked to organize the back room where the rest of the merchandise are so that coworkers can find products with ease. At the end of the day, I am present to count & maintain"
good,"very fun easy going place to work. I loved my time there. I love being around shoes and my managers, all of the were great people."
good,"I love helping people, I love to make sure they are happy.  I like stocking and organizing  making sure things are put back. I am a hard worker and  love to work on anything I can. I am a very positive person coming into work, I can make everyone smile and happy.  My typical day at work is pretty nice. I make people smile wright when they walk in. I learning  that people cant do things alone you will always need a little or some help.  The work place can be fun sometimes but also it has to be about the customers. I am always on time,  I am never late to work."
good,"A typical work day was fun, even though my manager was not the best of all. It was a good work experience. Hardest part of the job was getting hours. Since there was so many workers."

Danach wird eine ""To Do List"" erstellt um die zu erledigenden Aufgaben zu verteilen. Anschließend wird der Laden geöffnet. Jeder Kunde wird persönlich begrüßt und ausführlich bedient um seine Wünsche zu erfüllen. Bei ladenschluss wird der Verkaufsraum gereinigt und die Auslage aufgefüllt sowie die Kassen runtergefahren, die geleisteten STunden der Mitarbeiter gebucht und der Umsatz in den Tresor gelegt bevor der Laden verlassen wird. Ich habe dort viel über Kundenservice, Verkaufsraumgestaltung, Lagerlogistik und den  richtigen Umgang mit Arbeitskolegen gelernt. Das Management ist in ordnung. Man könnte allerdings mehr auf die Mitarbeiter eingehen. Die Mitarbeiter kommen alle gut mit einander aus. Schwer viel mir in diesem Job nichts. Ich habe schon wärend meinem Praktikum 2003 - 2004 gemerkt das mir der Beruf des Einzelhandelskaufmann liegt und ich eine Ausbildung anstreben werde, was ich dann auch in die Tat umsetzte. Das beste war für mich immer der Umgang mit der Kundschaft. Es macht einfach Spaß so viele verschiedene Karaktäre kennen zu lernen und heraus zu finden wie man ihnen am besten weiterhelfen kann."

good,"As soon as you clocked in it was time to hit the sales floor greeting customers, asking if anyone needed assistance, bring addition options to compliment the customers choice in product (up sell) all in a timely manner. We worked based off of percentages, shoes were a given, you knew you were going into work to gain a 1% commission on everything you sell. That alone was enough to make me want to add socks, insoles, shoe cleaning products, shirts even pants. A customer would ask for one shoe and I would bring not only what they asked for but also a similar shoe and a couple outfits to match. Now of course that sounds exhausting and like a lot of extra work but that is what I signed up for and that was the reason I became a sales lead so quickly after joining the Footlocker family."

good,"I would definitely recommend applying, very fun positive work place. Management is always so nice and hours are flexible. Overall fun and competitive."
good,"Primary responsibilities as a sales associate for a high volume Foot Locker/House of Hoops include operating cash registers, assisting multiple customers with sales, stocking and organizing shelves, various cleaning/maintaining standard of store appearance duties and answering questions about company policies, merchandise, and services.  Work alongside management team to drive sales and create a memorable experience for customers."
good,"I enjoy working at kids footlocker, you meet new people everyday and get to check out nice kicks. I love moving at all times throughout the day and footlocker makes sure it happens."
good,A typical day at work would be selling shoes for 5 hours or more. You learn how to interact with customers. Management is mediocre. Workplace culture is fun yet strict. Hardest part of working may be working through slow hours. The most enjoyable part are the people you work with.
good,heel veel positieviteit en veel goeie samenwerkende collega's
good,"Ambiente agradable, empresa que da opciones a promoción, que incentiva a sus empleados con comisiones por ventas, horarios flexibles, trabajo bajo objetivos pero siempre de forma positiva."
good,"while  i worked there i enjoyed it a lot the only thing is when they are on you about certain things defiantly focus on following them, you get good promotions and discounts are good also"
good,good starting job to get experience. Has a lot of opportunity to grow in the business if desired. Work is almost always fast paced and always have to be multi tasking to get everything done. you get to meet a lot of new people everyday and have fun on the job.
good,To work in a challenging environment and gain experience working in a setting that will utilize my skillsHike working at Footlocker I've developed better communication skills and it has allowed me to work better with others.
good,Productive and fast paced esp when the release of new products. management was great and respectful. I was a cashier a typical day was ringing up customers answering phone calls and restocking products.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to see a smile on your customer's faces once you have serviced them.  Making a customer happy and leave with satisfaction is the best part of the day.  Learning to work with people of different backgrounds and different areas is a plus.
good,"Nice staff, good for students. relaxed environment. organized. fun. Scarborough location is probably the most chill and recommended to work at. discount is good."
good,"El ambiente de trabajo en Foot Locker es muy bueno a la par que dinámico, los compañeros se preocupan por la gente recién llegada,  les enseñan sus funciones y trucos de la mejor manera posible."
good,It was a fun place to work at with great people and management. It takes a team to ensure the store is being successful and that it is constantly meeting its goals.
good,"Footlocker is a fair and productive place to work. There are primarily two shifts when it comes to operations. Security is on site at the Junction City Service Center (JCSC) warehouse 24/7. The work is somewhat tedious, and they want dependable hardworking people that will show up for scheduled work everyday. There are frequent internal job postings and any qualifying associate can apply for a different job internally. Employee discounts are 30% and twice a year, usually in December and July employees get 50%. There are production incentive pay bonuses in place and employees/management of the quarter awards are chosen. An employee can also receive a Quality Service Award (QSA) which can be peer nominated,for a conducting their duties in an extraordinary manner. They have a tuition assistance program in place for anyone wanting to pursue a degree so long as its business related. Lunch is occasionally on the company and every year every associate in the warehouse gets a free Thanksgiving Turkey."
good,"It has been a good experience, I worked with young people and we were like a big family, everyone was always smiling and happy to be there, time everyday was going very quickly and customers, most of the time, we’re enjoying their time during the sale; they could have a laugh with us and at the same time buy what they were looking for."
good,Fun job with helpful managers that work with your schedule. I worked there for almost a year and learned a lot about selling and never run into any serious problems with managers/coworkers.
good,"Some managers are easy to work with. If you do your job, then you're fine. However, there are those that let the power get to their heads and will be over your shoulder."
good,"You definitely learn a lot, the company is very diverse in its employment. I started at Foot Locker as my first job and I really enjoyed so much to as that I changed my entire career path to business. I love the culture I represented and that is shown in my achievements with the company. Really awesome job to have but pay is definitely not competitive being that they ask for many hours and a lot of dedication. Because they are a corporation, their benefits are also very helpful."
good,Worked part time so I was only there on the weekends. It was a fun atmosphere. Loved my managers. Customer service and making sure you get the customers in proper products.
good,Footlocker was a fun place to work the employees and the management where kind and friendly best job. Nothing hard about the job. Taught me a lot about customer service on how to help people with what they needed and wanted.
good,Working at Foot Locker I was never bored there was always something to do which made very motivated and a sense of accomplishment. It is a great place
good,"I enjoy my work and my manager is one of the best I have ever worked for. I have worked for companies where your management doesn't really have your back. It was a do as I say, not as I do mentality. My manager here at Footlocker truly walks the walk and has your back exactly like he says he will. He is driven, and consistent with his direction, accountability, management style and willing to praise as well as Critique. "
good,"Foot Locker is an environment where you meet new customers that's from a different race, engaging with the customers helps you with your communication skills, the pay rate could be better. The pay rate for the company is a little under paid for the amount of effort you put in for the job."
good,What can I say this was a great place to work I loved the inter action with all the customers I really enjoyed my time at footlocker I learned so much analogue stuff then that it really prepared me throughout my career from learning Accounts Payable to Accounts receivable to Payroll to Inventory Quality Control to Presentations on Sales and the presentation of the store it sounds like a whole lot because it was and I loved it. Ive met Star athletes and movie stars and Performers because everybody wanted a fresh pair of kicks lol or apparel. And the store I was in charged was the district managers office so I had to maintain the up keep of the store at all times and every shift
good,At footlocker I was able to enhance my communication skills by facing and dealing with customer queries on a regular basis. As a result of this experience I believe I became a much more effective communicator.
good,I enjoy working at Foot Locker it was one of my first jobs the idea of being able to communicate with a lot of people it was pretty fun because I'm a good talker and I enjoyed interacting with others I was offered this job through a workability program that my school offered that I also graduated from
good,Footlocker was my first and best job I must say. I was able to run the store and keep man hours down. Working at footlocker taught me how to get use to others and paid lol.
good,"Footlocker is a great company with a strong management structure.  Just like with any company there is room for improvement but the management team is open to suggestions.  The hardest part of the job is being able to communicate with others in the workplace, the reason for this is that the associates that have been around for a while do not like change."
good,"A typical day at work here consisted of ensuring the displays were properly set up, making sure inventory was accurate, and ensuring we met the needs of our customers. I learned how to help people find a comfortable or fashionable shoe that met their needs. Management was very engaged with the employees as well as the consumer. The culture of the workplace was friendly! The hardest part of the job was keeping track of all new and old inventory making sure nothing was unaccounted for or out of place. The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to buy shoes and clothing at a discount!"
good,"being a footlocker employee is not only just about selling shoes and merchandise in the store it's about having a positive attitude and being an approachable employee that makes customers feel comfortable while shopping in our store. I've learned a lot about costumer service here at footlocker, and about how the smallest stuff leaves a lasting impression on customers that make them want to come back. One of the best parts of working here is connecting with customers and seeing the smiles on their faces when we are able to help them find exactly what they are looking for. One of the hardest things is when we don't have the shoe size or the size of clothing item they needs turning them down because you want to please the customer of course but luckily we have many other options for people if something like that does happen. All staff at footlocker are all great people to work with from other sales associates to management."
good,"The job comes with benefits, and has decent pay. However, for a rather weak guy, unloading heavy box after heavy box from the trucks to reach a quota is difficult, especially the machinery jams often. When there is nothing to unload, workers are expected to find something to do, even if it means cleaning the same area over and over again."
good,"As my first job it was everything I could of dreamed of. Management was more like a mentor. Showed me how to be punctual, responsible, and energized. Absolutely Loved IT!"
good,"Working for Safeway, I developed a lot of people skill even though I'm a very social person already. I learned to become better with handling my responsibilities. By getting to work on time everyday. Being able to remove and put the right amount of money in and out of the tills while I'm on the job."
good,"operating cash registers, assisting customers with sales, stocking and organizing shelves, and answering questions about company policies, merchandise, and services."
good,"En esta empresa he aprendido a llevar a un equipo de hasta 15-20 personas, ha hacer horarios,planificar, organizar y a crecer profesionalmente."
good,Fun environment to work in can get very busy and hard on your feet. Managers get bonuses to hit quotas and goals so they can be very hard on you to sell even when nobody is buying.
good,"Always busy serving customers and sorting out the products for sale, setting up shelves with shoes and clothes. I learned to serve customers, set up the shop also did a bit of visual merchandising. Great. Taught me a lot. Always clean and tidy, nothing out of place. Climbing the ladders. Serving all the different kinds of customers."
good,"I love my job at footlocker. I would've still been there, I mainly like working with the public. it was just one of my co-workers that I really didn't like working with and due to the fact that it was my district manager brother, I couldn't complain because every time I did, nothing was done about it."
good,"My experience from footlocker was very important for my career job training."
good,"Very good company to work for. I was given the chance to manage different stores for 8 years. The company offers great benefits (health as well as personal) I learned how to train employees, drive sales, keep track of merchandise, run multiple cash registers, balance deposits, and make the workplace fun and efficient. The hardest part of the job was the hours required to work. The most enjoyable part was dealing with customers. One cannot go into work knowing what would happen was always exciting."
good,"Had a great time working there for most of the time. Only problems I ever really had was management always taking care of their close ones before anyone else.  But, that happens in almost every retail store. Nonetheless, great experience."
good,"M'a permis de pouvoir gérer mes vendeurs tout en leurs montrant comment suivre les indicateurs commerciaux, ainsi que de suivre mes clients tout au long de leurs achats avec grand plaisir"
good,C'est un lieu de travail très agréable avec une bonne ambiance au sein du groupe
good,"I enjoyed the working environment. It was a fun place to work at, with high energy people. I everybody supported each other for the great good of the company, and everybody held each other accountable."
good,"fun enviornment great connections ianstilled in me an excellent customer service, sales, and leadership experience. Didn,t like the manager change and toward the end i felt that my hard work and achievements did not matter and weren, valued"
good,"While you are of course trying to make your sales, you are sure to be entertained and feel welcomed in the environment. My coworkers were productive and extremely helpful. They treated me more like a younger sibling than a coworker. I felt right at home from the day i set foot in the store"
good,"Footlocker was a great environment to work in. This job helped me perfect customer service to the best of my abilities.It was all about what the customer wanted and more. With Footlocker it was always about adding more. You cant just sell a pair of sneakers to someone without having them try on our latest graphic design T-shirts or even our comfortable insoles. It was always about hustling and going the extra mile for our customers so they can walk out content. I really enjoyed helping others in time of need, whether it was a new hire who was having trouble learning the system or if a co-worker of mine was having difficulties with another customer. I enjoyed giving every customer who walked in 110% of my attention and satisfaction."
good,"Ti offre la possibilità di stare a contatto diretto con il cliente creando quasi un rapporto confidenziale, rendendoti più sicuro di te stesso."
good,"Fun, fast paced, innovative, and challenging! There is always room for advancement in the company. Keeps you up-to-date with the latest trends, and the most popular items."
good,i feel the footlocker workers or sales associates are confident and people person workers. i hope for one day to work at footlocker. the most enjoyable part of the job to me would probrably the excitement the costumers has before buying the product .
good,Busy on the weekends very chill and laid back on the week days all the co-workers are easy to get along with.Foot locker gave a good amount of hours. although i loved my job it was to far and i was putting out more money than i was getting just to get to and from work.
good,"Very competitive to see who would get the most sales."
good,"enjoy learn to manage a team and also having experience with heavy money, co workers were fun and also had better experience being apart of the company and growing with them"
good,"I would greet people in , and also helped them look an chose for whatever they were looking. I would also make sure would alos look neat and clean. After everything was done in the front I would go to the back to stock boxes."
good,"well managed, pay is not good. Great place for a part time especially if you like shoes. Dont expect to make a living off the salary unless your in management."
good,"Great atmosphere. Needs better training system in certain areas to newcomers into the retail industry. Relaxed work day, learn alot about shoes and how to identify them. Hardest part is learning the stock room and codes on shoes."
good,"Fun work environment.Knowledge of computers, athletic footwear, and apparel."
good,its a awesome place to work just not enough money. people that work there are great. we all had great knowledge about our products.
good,Great environment where everyone communicates with one another and gets along well. I've enjoyed it ever since I started working there and I continue to enjoy it.
good,"Absolutley loved working for Footlocker, great place to sharpen your sales and customer service skills. footlockers are always well managed and managed as a whole entity."
good,"I love coming to work everyday and being able to create the best work environment to increase sales at the same time build relationships with customers so they will return or take the company survey. The best part was being able to look at my results the day after build a plan and watch it come to life. I love training and developing people as well, without a great team you can't go but so far. My staff was able to identify who our muse was and make the experience the best for the parent and the child, which was the best part of my job."
good,"Discounts, Promotions, Trips to different areas for meeting, and job security. Never a boring day working at footlocker."
good,"Making sure all employees work in a safe and comfortable environment."
good,"I work the cash register, work and as team with my co-workers, and greet customers and in professional matter. My co-workers were nice people. The hardest part of my job was trying to get people to purchase some of the most expensive items in the store. Overall, i enjoyed working with he customers and my co-workers"
good,"Sie nehmen die Ware die wir täglich bekommen auf, Sie müssen durchgehend die Kundenbetreuuen sowie auch Beraten. Alles mögliche was mit dem Einzehandel zutun hat. Beraten, Kassieren, Waren ausgabe, Waren einnahme. Ein sehr harmoisches Arbeitsklima. Sehr nette und offene Arbeitskollegen.Schwierig war es immer den passenden geschmack des Kunden zufinden. Das ich so liebevolle Kunden und Kollegen hatte."
good,"For the most part, it's a great and fun job. If you enjoy sneakers and new ""street"" fashion, you will enjoy the job and the good discount. The only thing you won't enjoy is pretty bad pay."
good,"As a Footlocker Sales Associate I was responsible for selling shoes, stocking, and good customer service. Within the 9 months of employment I have won two sales based contest. I enjoyed going to work and seeing new faces as well as my co workers who are still good friends of mine to this day.The hardest part of the job was tryinf to sell shoe insoles to customers."
good,"Every day is different at footlocker as the number one goals is always to drive sales.  I manage a team of 10 associates.  I have learned how to multitask while working at Footlocker because you always have task to do, but also you still must help the customers."
good,"I love working at footlocker, it is a great experience that can be some what challenging. On a typical day whether I open or close, I would sell our products to the customers who walk in, whether they intended to buy something or not. On a day to day basis I have to deal with money and make a decision based on the companies policies. I learned that you can not always give the customer what they want, because sometime what the customer wants is not ethical. As a manager I have to deal with not only handling customers but also working with my co-workers, who are very hard working. The hardest part of the job has to be all of the paper work, the easiest is getting the shoes and making the customers happy."
good,"I learned a lot from being a store manager and taught myself whatever I needed to, to make my store as successful as possible.  My store was a LFL clearance store which was very few compared to regular LFL stores.  A regular LFL has about 4,500 pieces of apparel.  When I first started as store manager, the store had 12,000 pieces of apparel for 6 years it was like that. I came up with my own inventory plan and when I left the store it had a little over 7,500 pieces of apparel.  My inventory plan was a success and it also helped drive sales."
good,"loved how laid back my co-workers were. Work was never quiet, we could listen to our radios which kept us from falling asleep."
good,A typical day at Foot Locker consisted of procuring devices for our field operations and management.  It also consisted of troubleshooting device issues and communicating with our providers as well as other Foot Locker teams across the company.  I learned that I work well under pressure and can multi-task under stressful situations.  The management staff was great but there was an issue with communication and that was sited as the number one problem in a review of a survey that was given company wide last year.  My co-workers were great to work with on-site as well as with all of our other corporate locations.  There really was nothing difficult about the job and the most enjoyable part was to get an associate's problem resolved in a timely manner.
good,"I love working here for discounts and the environment. The customers that come in are great. The only thing is if it's not busy, you don't get paid as much as you would if it is busy. And the compensation can be a bit higher, it's only at 1%."
good,I'm a sales type of guy also especially in active wear. Loved the environment the only thing that I didn't like was the fact that I worked in the mall because all the other stores got my money.
good,Great Company to work for. Good enviroment. Open Door Policy.
good,"I have learned alot of knowledge about the many types of shoes I had to sell, based on every persons personal experiences."
good,I love working here. Co-workers were always friendly. Management was the best.
good,le magasin ouvre 10h du matin ou fait l organisation et le nettoyage et le rangement du stock.  les client arriver vers midi onze heure il faut être a l'écoute du client bien le renseigner . chez foot locker ou peu Évolue tre vite si ou n ai un bon travailler. la difficulté du métier de vendeur il ne fou pas avoir peur de reste debout parce que c'est un métier on l on bouger beaucoup.moi c'est que j'apprécie le plus dans les métier c le contacte avec la clientèle
good,"great job plenty of advancement if you wanna move."
good,"sale, customer service, sale, fashion, cashier, helped customer the best way I could"
good,Foot locker was a good job. I learned more basic work skills.
good,"l’accueil client, la gestion administrative (divers programmes), applications Oracle PeopleSoft  les horaires, commandes / vente"
good,"Footlocker is an adventure almost- You learn something new everyday and you meet alot of interesting people. A typical day consists of helping customers find shoes for many different needs such as running, walking, casual wear, and basketball. If we don't have what they want, we point the customers in the right direction to help them find what they want, whether it is by looking online, going to one of our sister stores, or ordering the product from our store. "
good,"A typical day is sales not much to really describe. Will get the usual ""sneakerheads"" and sports fans in which leave us with a great conversation. You will learn a lot  about different products and what they are all useful for. The staff is overall pretty well trained if one person can't find you a answer more or less likely they will ask another co-worker to confirm a answer for you. Honestly the hardest part of the job is mainly during peak times of year (holidays and such) where most customers are in the want to get in get out rushed mood. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the customers leave happy with their purchase."
good,"A great place to work, the first to give me chance to become an Assistant manager. I've really enjoyed my time there and I have met some great people alone the way."
good,Sell shoes and other products to customer. I learned how to listen to the customer and figure out exactly what they were looking for.
good,I like working with the different people.I was given the opporunity to be a Assistant Manager.
good,This was a customer service and sales driven environment that challenged me to adapt with the economy and customers. I developed the ability to listen and react appropriately in situations while at the same time satisfying customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing repeat customers that knew your name and putting smiles on customers faces.
good,Footlocker is a great company to work for. This company provides training certification for all upper mangement that deal with multiple buying habits.
good,"Foot Locker treated me well. I was promoted to Assistant Manager within the first few months, then promoted to Manager. They do a good job recognizing people for their accomplishments. Pay is pretty fair if your are in management. Though the sales associates get basically minimum wage. The benefits were great, and well as flexibility for scheduling. They promoted within and if you did the job your were trained to do you would enjoy your time there."
good,The staff was very helpful and friendly and motivated you to do your best!
good,"Great place to learn how to upsale. Meet new people daily, learn product knowledge from employees, and customers. Great company to grow in."
good,"the time i had this job i was going to school in the morning and work for foot locker at 4 pm and get out at 10 p.m. . i enjoyed it and learned that you actually get to work for your own money and rack up alot sales . that was a goal for everybody , we was all on our toes . the people i worked with was very nice and team players, we all got along perfectly fine."
good,"I thoroughly enjoy working for Footlocker Inc. Not only is it a very easy work environment, but the Management staff is very easy to get along with. The most difficult part of my job would have to be the amount of information that I consume within a work day and retaining that information to recall back to."
good,the job and the people was good to work with but you didn't have any days off
good,count in register
good,"Working at kids footlocker is a lot of fun. I enjoy my job because I like to help customers, work with different people, meeting new people, and I enjoy sneakers. I learned some much from this company when it comes to helping and dealing with different customers and finding out what are the needs. Management is the best the really help you to get best out yourself. The hardest part of the job would have to be difficult customers."
good,"Loved working for this company, wouldn't mind going back. Work days were challenging with goals needing to be made and handling different customers from A to Z but Id have to say it was all worth it seeing smiles and building relationships with so many others. Moved up in the company quite fast from Sales Associate to ASM in one year and i loved that most. Endless opportunity with this company when you apply yourself."
good,"Typical day consisted of creating personal sales goals for the entire staff and creating and exciting environment for the staff and customers. It was very important to walk the store upon entering each morning to make sure the closing staff cleaned the store and refreshed all displays. There could be no missing shoes at the start of the day and every shoe had to have the correct price on it. I would immediately check emails for any new markdowns or transfers. I would always create a in store contest to increase the competitive spirit. Right before opening I would give a pep talk discussing Task and Responsibilities for each associate, talk about any new promotion or product and get everyone excited to beat all other stores in our district. I would verify funds in the cash register with all cashiers before they started. My responsibilities included recruiting, hiring and training, that was the best part of my job. I was able to hire someone that had no experience, no money and help them develop a successful career while supporting their family. The hardest part was being promoted to a store that had serious issues such as poor sales, internal and external theft and a negative staff. I had to single handly retrain, recruit, hire, terminate and reorganize the entire store. It was hard but rewarding and satisfying once completed. I learned the importance of listening to your employees, leading by example, completing all task and how to conduct my self during a Coroprate Visit. I was truly the best learning experience I had beside 4 years of college. This company invested a lot into"
good,Loved it great staff. Benefits are incredible corporate staff were great and are very understanding with scheduling and staffing.
good,This job allowed advacement to higher positions in the company. It allowed people to communicate with different type of people.
good,"I enjoy working at footlocker. Great working environment, I love helping the customers and I love the responsibilities I have as a cashier. What I love most about working at footlocker is the people I work with; They’re always there when you need help."
good,"If you love sneakers and providing excellent customer service, this is definitely the job for you. You get to connect with people from all over the world. This is a job you can be yourself while setting trend's. I wish they could raise the pay a little more."
good,"Foot locker gave me the opportunity for development. They help me to becomes an Assistant Manager in less than three months. "
good,"This was my first job had, which means I was young and pretty much excited about it, I was freely ready and willingly to learn and ready to grow as a team."
good,"teamwork is a skill that the company is looking for. always something to get done, & helping customers. very competitive. learning how to attend customers, exceeding their expectations."
good,Its a very good balance between work & your life if you are involved with anything else. It’s hourly & commission based so your paychecks will not always be steady throughout the year. All in all I enjoy working for the company
good,The most enjoyable part of the Job its when you get confidence with the clients. That make special conections with the people that visits and heals your working desirate.
good,My review on footlocker was great. I was able to learn how to interact with people and better my communication skills. This helped me be more confident about helping a lot for other jobs or just regular people in general. I recommend this job for anyone who is very interested in interacting with people and learning how to be respectful to the customers and help out.
good,"As a customer care specialist for footlocker inc., you will answer phone calls and use a computer to access customers accounts to help them track packages, place/cancel orders, and transfer them to the appropriate extension to further assist them."
good,"Bonnes perspectives d'évolution et travail formateur, dans la vie privée et publique."
good,"Sadly the location where I worked closed down but, Footlocker overall was a good company to work for."
good,They had a very nice break room. also to get into work you had a badge you had to swipe. if you forgot your badge then you had to talk to the security guard.
good,I mean it’s chill to work at but there is not enough hours or enough pay. I would advise someone that wants money to work another place but If you’re just there to have fun then that’s the place for you.
good,"des collègues en or, et une expérienc enrichissante d'un point de vue marketing"
good,Overall was a great experience to work at a place I spent a lot of time and money as a kid growing up and to finally see what it was like to wear the stripes it was amazing
good,I would arrive at work stock the back then hit the sales floor. I learned how to interact with customers and all walks of life. My manager was great always pushing us. It was a fun place to work hardest part was selling insoles. Best part was working with customers.
good,Typically the company has 8 hours shift and during high season 12 hour shift. A typical day at worked doing packeting and problem resolution. Learned to work with WMOS which is the operational system of this company. The hardest part of this job is lift boxes from 30 to 45 lbs. You have to work stand up all the time.  Most enjoyable part of this job are the 3 breaks the company gives.
good,Interact with your workers and customers a lot meet new people help others out with different outfits.if you know a lot about shoes you’ll be able to make a lot more sales.
good,"viele weiterbildungsmöglichkeiten"
good,"My favorite job by far! Super laid back place to work part-time and a good job for when you're in school. Good for ""sneaker-heads"" because you learn so much about shoes and get the satisfaction of releasing shoes into the store, and discounts of course. Daily tasks are listed every day so you know what you're in for every day. The only thing that could be looked down on is minimal hours like sometimes it's below 10 hours a week."
good,"After working with the company for 3 years, I've developed great customer service skills. There was a very friendly staff and environment, which helped improve us working as a team to reach store goals."
good,"good commission"
good,"Being a sales associate at footlocker taught me how to be the essential salesman. already being manner friendly and easy going, I used those skills in advantage to pursue and gain a sale potentially in each customer. knowing when to engage and when to back off can be tricky but once you get a couple down packed your eager for more. being there taught me how to use team work be innovative and be responsible`"
good,footlocker is one of the best jobs ever.my first manager was horrible but other than that i loved the job.it helped me get comfortable with talking to people.
good,"I am very passionate about the sneaker culture. This was an amazing first job. Manager's are more like mentors. they want to help you and they want you to succeed. This job helped boost my communication skills as well as my sales skills. The base pay wasn't great, but you receive commission on everything you sell."
good,"Footlocker was my first retail job. I was immediately welcomed and treated fairly amongst management and other coworkers. I learned various sales techniques as well as organization, and learning to adjust my time management skills. A job at footlocker is beneficial as well as influential. The job was not very challenging, but whenever it got a little out of hand, I had my team there to help me out. It was a great environment to work in and I was often excited to go to work everyday."
good,"Devo tutto a Foot locker ,"
good,Loved working a Footlocker so much I did it twice. I had ample opportunity for advancement. I worked my way up from a part-time position to a store manager at multiple locations throughout central and Southeastern Ohio. I highly recommend anyone who is interested to check it out.
good,I was here during most of my highschool and college time. I think that the company didn't value it's employee's as much as they should have. The shoe game has changed and their clientele as well.
good,"Busiest day is Saturday Monday-Thursday is kind of slow, but little customers come in. What I learned working at footlocker is being flexible. Being able to multitask and work with multiple customers at one time different ages and choices. The management at Foot Locker is great! They're always there helping you and pushing you to do better. The hardest part of the job will have to be is the holiday rush. That's during the holiday times such as Christmas and you have 5 or more customers wanting your attention at the same time and youre trying to assist everybody  and their needs but its all about patience and time. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people, your co-workers, and learning and seeing new shoes."
good,"Un trato cordial , buen compañerismo y ambiente de trabajo"
good,"Working at Foot Locker was a joy. It was my dream job when I was a child and it was worth it. The management was fantastic, the people I worked with were competitive in everything they did. A typical day at work included selling shoes, ink tagging shoes, and cleaning up the store at the end of every shift. There were no hard parts of the job in my opinion; I found everything enjoyable. The most enjoyable part of the job was watching the kids smile when their parents just bought them shoes."
good,"Working in an enviroment with lots of energy. even more fun if you have a passion for fashion, sneakers, and working out. I was able to move up to management quickly."
good,"The workplace enviroment here was very friendly, fun, and interactive. Everyones got their work done, contribtutely evenly, and o one was selfish. We all were able to work hard and hit our commision goals even though we didn't the most busiest store. I Would definetely recommend working here"

good,Had a great time working at Kids Footlocker. Worked with a great group of guys. Also liked working with the kids and helping them choose out their fresh kicks.
good,Footlocker is a very quick paced environment due to the numerous customers entering the store on an everyday basis. A great networking setting for all employees.

good,Footlocker is a great job. Management pays well and is very rewarding. The work is very minimal if you are good at managing and have a successful staff. Definitely a good company to work for if you want to be in retail.   fast paced work environment with the benefit of being able to receive discounts for shoes. Enjoyed the supervisor I worked with he was fair and worked well with his team.
good,"It was fun, hard work at times and a great paying place. I drove a man up which is alot of fun and picked items off the shelves to be shipped out to many locations across the country. Very fun"
good,Throughout my time working for footlocker I absolutely loved it ! at first it was supposed to be my first job and my goal was to make it a temporary experience and instead i made it into something longer gained so much knowledge and work experience that I even moved up in the company.
good,"I enjoy sharing my shoe knowledge with the customer. Answering any questions they might have, also making sure they are satisfied with their purchase is my goal and is what makes the job fun."
good,"Most enjoyable place I have worked"
good,"Foot Locker's Marketing Department is full of talented and dedicated employees. The work pace is fast and deadlines were typically tight and tended to move frequently. Adapting to these changes was an essential skill to have to be successful."
good,"I learned different things on shoes and what each one provides and helps with your feet. I also learned how to be a people person, and how to sale different product's. Great customers."
good,"I have been with Foot Locker since I was a senior in high school. Since then, not much has changed in 5 years. This is a great starter job. The perks that come with the job are pretty cool as well."
good,"I was recruited in 2001. Worked a couple of years in Biloxi, MS location. Later was promoted to assistant. In fall of 2002, was promoted to my own store in Gautier, MS.  Achieved alot of goals during my leadership. But things changed after Hurricane Katrina. Resigned that next year."
good,I loved working for them. Kids are my life and helping children find their new kicks was joyful. Teaches you a lot about sales and how to work with adults and children.
good,"The best part about the job was the people with whom I worked with. The pay was not enough but the management was great and super supportive! If it wasn't for the low income, I would work there again!"
good,A typical day at work would be from the minute I clock in to the minute I clock out I'm always being productive and finding new ways to grow in sales volume and helping out customers with any issue at hand.
good,"Very demanding job, since it's a very personal customer service. We always had to offer more things appart from shoes and trainers, such as insoles, shoe cleaners..."
good,"Great sales team, and learned alot of social/ customer service skills, customers can sometimes be quite a hassle or downright ignorant. but at the same time working hourly plus commission can be great"
good,At This Job I Was Able To Get To Come Around And Meet New People Everyday And I Was Able To Have The Chance To Make People Have And Sometimes Make They Day
good,A typical day at Footlocker was coming in and immediately hitting the sales floor and communicating with my coworkers on what the agenda for the day was. Then talking to multiple customers and trying to give the best customer satisfaction as possible.
good,I loved working here because I got to work in different parts of the store and my ability to learn and understand grew with each department I worked in..I enjoyed helping others find exactly what they needed for themselves and there families..
good,"Was een leuke werk ervaring, op tempo werken zorgy voor een goe lopende zaak."
good,"The typical day at FootLocker was more complex then it seems with having to deal with up to 5 customers at once, but thanks to that I have grown in better ways of helping customers."
good,"Great company to work for, great benefits and awesome managers. They also have many hours to give to their employees. I wish i was still working here."
good,A typical day will be hitting targets and KPIs set by the manager followed by serving customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is to work with people who have the same passion and interests as you.
good,"Great environment, I learned a lot about customer service and sales. Along with advertising and management skills. You have to be very skilled in communication and multitasking."
good,Everyone greeted me with an open arm when I was first hired. My co workers and managers made it fun and relaxed so that we could do our jobs and help customers to the best of our ability.
good,"I really enjoyed my time working at Foot Locker, and found the role to be very rewarding. There is a great team spirit, and the work is varied and fun. The downside for me was the strong targets which I found were sometimes difficult to achieve without being overly forceful, which I think takes away from the customer service."
good,A place of constant change.   Have the ability to adapt to say situation and on short notice. Management keeps a close eye on performance.
good,very welcoming and very helpful co workers that I worked with while as a sales associate got along with everyone never had a problem or issue working there
good,"A typical day at work usually consists of greeting customers as they walk into the store. Customers come up to me to grab a shoe in their  size very early on into the shift. I happily grab them their shoes and let them try it on. Once a customer has decided to buy the shoes, I offer them socks, t-shirts for sale or a hat to match with their shoes. The tasks are very repetitive. What I learned at Foot Locker was working as a team. I learned to push myself and exceed expectations, especially when it comes to customer satisfaction. The management at Foot Locker is wonderful. When I first started working, the manager helped me be comfortable in my new position as a Sales Associate and made sure that I knew what I was doing. The training process, however, was very tedious, especially when it came to reading piles of papers on store policies, product knowledge and what not. My co-workers were likeable, and very helpful when it came to my training. Their constructive criticism was appreciated, as it helped me get better at my job. The hardest part of the job was definitely dealing with rude and impatient customers. Some of them could not see that we were struggling with the number of people coming into the store, yet they complained that we had ""slow service"". The most enjoyable part of the job was (hands down) talking with my co-workers and getting to know more about them. Of course, these moments would only take place when the store is not busy. Overall, I rate this job a 4/5. It's a great place to work at, especially if you know your products well."
good,In my time working at foot locker I really felt like a part of a team. The people I worked with interacted much more than some other jobs which made the atmosphere awesome. I felt challenged to make sales every day without it being stressful it actually made things more fun in my opinion. One down side is I felt sometimes that in order to make sales numbers in our store the managers would try to suggest things a little too often which came over as a bit pushy rather than just being there for the customer to give information and assistance. Overall I would gladly work for foot locker again and recommend the job to anyone. Also the 50% discount on almost everything in the store is to die for.
good,i learned alot of stuff that i did not know. my co workers were nice. if you like shoes go work for them. the shift is sometimes long or short.
good,"working was a very fun experience. it was very customers everyday were all different some friendly others rude, but the coworker i was friends with made it fun"
good,"I learned new things everyday. I enjoyed engaging with customers and making their experience an enjoyable one, ensuring that thay will return."
good,"Great place for employment, fun place to work with many advancement opportunities. Fast pace workplace where you interact with customer's and build leadership skills."
good,"Pretty cool job to work in, even more if you like style really into sneakers . get to meet different people everyday other day."
good,"I loved this job, it taught me how to sell and have confidence. The management was fun and we all had a good time at work. When the days were slow, we all made it fun an anyways. Probably the most fun and easiest job Ive ever had."
good,"I love the overall workplace. The employees are great, the managers are great as well. The biggest thing I learned is how to manage a store and making sure to stay attentive. The most enjoyable things is interacting with the customers."
good,"My schedule is based upon my school schedule, so I witness a clean, fun, and busy environment between 10 am to 10pm. I walk into a bright store, with calm, upbeat, patience, and diligent people.  I  am greeted with open arms as if I were a customer. I say hello to everyone as I clock in and I began my shift teaching and learning about shoes, feet, runners, running, shoe care, apparel for running and all purpose apparel. Every other day I am refreshed on how to use the register and how to become a better cashier. One of the hardest parts of my job is sweeping the floor with the sort of broom we have, and the best part of my job is learning how to manage multiple customers at one time to increase sales and our customer's love for the business. I love the fact that this company trains their employee's on how to do everything including the duties of a manager."
good,"een typische dag op het werk start met een meeting waar er besproken word wat de targets zijn voor de dag. Persoonlijke cijfers worden doorgenomen en er word feedback gegeven op de prestaties. zijn de prestaties goed dan word er gekeken naar manieren om het nog beter te doen. zijn de prestaties minder dan word er feedback gegeven en moeten wij als teamleden helpen om te prestaties te verhogen. dit kan door middel van coaching, ervaringen uitwisselen of een dagje extra meewerken met een andere mederwerker die  heel goed presteert.  Deze band met je collegas maakt footlocker zo een leuke plek om te werken. iedereen helpt elkaar om aan het eind van de dag onze doelstellingen te behalen.  het moeilijkste van  mijn baan is nog altijd de bij verkoop. Niet omdat het moeilijk is maar omdat de consument er vanuit gaat dat footlocker slechts op winst en extra verkoop uit is. terwijl het een stukje service is die heel belangrijk is voor het bedrijf."
good,I would like a job at foot locker so I can show my parents I am responsible for the job I have.
good,easy job with fair amount of challenges. work with great people who all work together and have different personalities
good,While a working at Foot Locker I starting as a normal floor sales person and was promoted to Assistant Manager
good,"sold shoes and shoe care, commision based, competition to work on major launch dates."
good,great part time job but otherwise pay is bad it gets stressful at times and upper management does not see you as human being but as a moveable pong and if not a yes man you will not advance.
good,always changing with trends and a good degree of autonomy with merchandising.
good,I work on shipment until I am complete and then I interact with customers.
good,"A typical day at work required me to receive shipments, match paperwork with merchandise, stock merchandise in proper places, manage stock room, complete inventory, assist customers with purchases/finding merchandise, customer service, cashier, and close down the store. I learned how to better my customer service skills, conduct inventory, and send and receive shipments. Management was always helpful in the workplace and showed the employees how to successful lead a working staff. My coworkers were easy to get along with and treated each other with respect. The also helped one another out when facing difficulties. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers when becoming rude and disrespectful. The most enjoyable part of the job was reaching the daily goals as a store. Feeling accomplished is what made the job fun and what gave me the drive to help reach our goals."
good,"Footlocker was very smoothly operated everyday you followed the plans to success. I got a better understanding of organization and execution working for them. Everyone was a team player, the mangers acted an treated everyone equally. I love shoes and selling them was a lot of fun. The hardest thing about footlocker has to be when a shipment comes in and you have to rearrange every shelf."
good,"A typical day at work involved answering telephone calls and troubleshooting customer's questions. I learned how to enter information in the company's database. Management was fair, straight-forward, and aided when you had an issue. My co-workers were respectful and stayed within their own work space. The hardest part of the job was not being able to service a customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping someone and having that person thank you for your service. "
good,when i came to work i could always look forward to and expect a funny customer.
good,"it was possible that the footlocker that I worked at just wasn't a typical busy footlocker but my job was very much relaxing, they didn't ask too much of me other than to know which shoes were where in the back of the workhouse. The work that I was asked to do wasn't ever out of my understanding, the work environment was overall a positive workplace"
good,"I had the experience of building, deciding and running a skate department on my own, it was a great once in a lifetime experience but the work hours weren't always over 20 hours a week, even though the management was great. I needed to move on to a more secure job."
good,Very fun job and manageable job. Fun to talk to the different customers and other employees from the other stores.
good,"For three and a half years i learned opening/ closing store procedures, dealt with emails, setting goals, delegating time managment. I've learned not to feel overwhelmed with extra work, customer service, and training other associates. I enjoy leading by example, such as always preparing task, training, touching base, and recongizing accomplishments no matter how small or big the accomplishment is. My co-workers have always gave me the highest level of respect, and acknowlged my dedication to make all situations beyond a positive atmosphere."
good,"I think the hardest part of my job is getting customers to add on accessories such as socks, cleaner, insoles and etc...The most enjoyable thing about my job is my co-workers. We all have known each other for a while or gotten to know each other and its just like a big happy family. I've learned more selling skills in order to begin and end a sale getting in all the proponents to have a returning customer."
good,"I enjoyed working at Foot Locker upon working there for a couple months I got promoted to the key holder position. Working here taught me managerial skills, running expert, responsibility, and patience. An average work day for me was opening or closing the store, creating a daily goal for each employee, check email, fill stock locator, check in shipment, help with customer complaints. My co-workers were all motivated and loved their job and we worked together well as a team. The hardest part of the job was trying to sell insoles and shoe cleaner to customers on a budget. The most enjoyable part of my job was successfully completing a sale."
good,"You alway have something to even if there is no customer like traning and development, keeping store and stock room clean and tidy. Price checks, sku check..........."
good,Ik heb met veel plezier voor Footlocker gewerkt.
good,"working at FTL inc. teaches you a basic foundation of dealing with customers and becoming an expert at customer service. My managers from Regional down to market leaders and Assistant managers was all down to Earth and very understandable about situations if any ever came up. The hardest part of the job for most people is understanding sometimes you can't take the emotions of a customer feeling about a situation or product personal, stay humble and push through the day. Other than those rare times its a fast pace job in which you meet new people everyday with good pay."
good,"I loved working at Footlocker,got a chance to meet so many new people, and had great coworkers"
good,I would say the best part was the 50% off times as well as when you go to a new store and they make you feel welcomed. I worked in 2 different states and was welcomed.
good,When I was out of high school this was my first job. I would work here forever if I could. But eventually I had to relocate to a different state. They even transferred me to help with the transition.
good,Footlocker is a good sales associate job to work in!! Dealing with customer needs learning to work the cash registers and bonding with your coworkers to make the goal for the day
good,Aside from the starting pay for part-time sales associates the environment of this company is well balanced and it’s and amazing job to have. This place gives you room to grow and excell your team and communicatuskills.
good,I personally loved working at footlocker and would suggest anyone to work there extremely fun. Coworkers were easy to get along with and the work is easy
good,its a great place to work. it helps you keep a social life and at the same time your selling merchandise that have culture to it. the work place is most time slow pace but when it come around holidays and weekends its very fast paced.
good,FootLocker was a great starting opportunity for me to learn sales and management.  I was able to advance through the company up to a Manager Trainer position but that was the cap for me.
good,the managers didn't really help me long enough on finding the shoes I would struggle a lot and ask for help but didn't get to much of that. I learned how to communicate with customers. Wasn't really a hard job and the most enjoyable part was meeting new people.
good,"A typical day at work would most likely just consist of customers coming in, them being greeted at the door, and walking out satisfied with wether they’ve either brought what they wanted or not."
good,Great environment. You get to learn a lot about shoes. At this job I learned to work the register and send packages . Management was great most of the managers are very helpful and understanding.
good,"Working at Footlocker you have to ensuring a high levels of customer satisfaction by being knowledgeable on all products offered, and teaming up with co-workers to provide excellent sales service "
good,"I was hired to work as a sales associate and quickly worked my up to management. I enjoy sales and we had great management. As a sales associate, i was given incentive to make sales, and always over appreciated for hard work. My team and I were a close knit group and worked well as a unit making every aspect of this job wonderful."
good,I can only vouch for my store but I absolutely loved my team. We created our own family and it made all the long days go by quicker. there was never a time where I wanted to quit because of a coworker.
good,"Very good experience it was very Fun and a lot to do for a very first job , love working and loved my co workers . The managers was good and it was a very great environment"
good,"Was A Stress Free Job, Some Days Were Fast And Some Days Were Slow.  Sometime's I Would Have To Do Other's Job And Make Sure Everything Is Going Well."
good,Kids Foot Locker is a good job to have if you are already working another job and want something for your free time. I would not recommend this job if working in the Wheaton area. The days slow paced which means less money for the store and towards your paycheck.
good,Great place to work if you have no outside life. work hard they advance you. great employee discount when I was working and not bad pay. Only issue is all the stores had the same visuals. There is no originality to the company.
good,"Addressed customer inquiries, inventory checks, maintained knowledge of current footwear, provided prompt customer assistance, organized display of products, handled cash transactions, and restocked merchandise."
good,"Bonne ambiance, l'équipe est accueillante. "
good,"I really enjoy this job! I heard it is different at high volume stores. My store is small and pretty slow. We make commission and I heard that at the higher volume stores, people steal each others sales. So I guess you have to be careful of that. We either make commission or base pay, whatever is higher at the end of the day. So that kind of sucks. You work pretty hard to sell stuff. You should be able to make commission on top of your base pay. The commission rate is pretty low also. For high volume stores its somewhere between 1.5-3. My store is low volume so its 3.5. Which is not a lot at all since we do not make a lot in a day. My coworkers and managers are amazing though! I really like learning all the different shoes and selling them to people and helping people get the shoes they want. The only thing I don't like is the pay."
good,Great workplace and environment. Sneaker culture and easy going place to work in! Everyone is super helpful and it is definitely a team-work place. Recommend for sports-related junkies!
good,I really enjoy working here everyone is really nice they hold special events for there employees and make sure they are comfortable work for them I would definitely recommend.
good,Good place to work for younger people with no kids. I would not  recommend this job for a person with a lot of financial responsibility. Fun work place
good,I like the challenge of trying to fit the customer into exactly the pair they want. The management was very understanding of my main job's scheduling requirements and changes.
good,Pays the bills for now. Good job. I like the commission. wish i had a set schedule but for the most part Six:02 is a good retail job. i would suggest to someone who likes retail
good,"A typical day at work would consist of customers coming in and out of the store asking for a shoe size, maybe if you were lucky they would also ask for socks or shirt. I learned how to create great customer service, count large amounts of money, manage my time, complete more than one task."
good,"On a typical day, I would greet customers, bring customers correct sizes to try on, check out customers, reach daily sales goals, sweep, adjust or replace shoes on the floor, lock up and close. The people at footlocker are very friendly and in fact I still have friends that I worked with there! The most enjoyable part of it all is being able to talk to customers and meet new people (bonus points when you get little kids to laugh! :)"
good,Experiencia muy gratificante. Aprendí muchísimo y cada fallo que cometía al principio se me rectificaba con paciencia .
good,"A typical day at the job was never shown, I learned that when you welcome anyone that comes in a store always say hi with a smile no matter at what circumstances you might be having. The co- workers were very helpful towards me. The hardest part of the job was on weekends when the store was with a lot of customers and only two co -workers were working throughout the day. The most enjoyable part of the job was that you could never feel lonely or bored on the job because you get to meet new people almost everyday."
good,Overall it's a good starter job to get experience in interacting with people and to get to see what service customer look for. The job is very exciting and very modern.
good,Sûrement l'une des expériences les plus enrichissantes qui m'a été possible d'effectuer
good,Assistant Manager position was one of the most motivating positions I've held. A lot of growth and challenges is apart of this role.
good,"Tysons Corner, Foot Locker is always a busy day. High incoming traffic of customers and dealing with many tasks and employees. I learned to never slow down and to time manage and prioritize every thing you do in order to stay on track. My coworkers are also very motivated and understanding of the job and what needs to get done. Hardest part of my job is just dealing with the long work hours every week. The most enjoying part of my job is being able to meet new people and train and see people grow."
good,"Very enjoyable team orientated environment with supportive management team who treat staff with respect. Potential to earn well- commission. Extremely busy sometimes and slow other times, unpredictable environment. Great experience with customers."
good,"My typical day would be just calmly selling shoes and greeting customers."
good,I sold shoes and ran the cashier. Provide right sizes for customers is a good example of my every day duties. For the most part the working environment was very relaxed. The management  of course can be strict once in a while but thats how all companies are.
good,"Enjoyable environment. Assisting customers, answering phones, and visual merchandising. Very easy job; however, definitely have to try to keep yourself busy especially when the store is dead."
good,In this work i be the charge man to decord the store make sales to the puclic and interactive with them. have bring big and heavy merchandise to the store
good,"A typical day at footlocker is pretty productive, there's always something to keep yourself busy and plenty of things to do. I learned how to interact with customers and how to work the cash register. My co-workers were like family, everyone got along great and it was always fun to be around them."
good,"greet customers, measure, sell and recommend options to customers.  supervise stockroom when shipment arrives.  replace missing items from the sales wall."
good,"This is a very fin job, you get to work with a lot of cool people, at least I do, and you get to meet a lot of awesome customers, and help them find the best stuff for them. I thoroughly enjoy working at Foot Locker."
good,Ottima azienda per chi vuole crescere professionalmente e migliorare le proprie capacità di impegno e volontà .
good,Footlocker is awesome. I like the people and environment. Gives me room to grow and showcase skills of communication and more.
good,"footlocker is a really upbeat place of work, you need to be able to work as part of a team but on your own initiavtive also as you have individual goals to achieve. A general day to day in this line of work involves enthusiasm and good conversational skills. It is a fast paced enjoyable place of work."
good,"I would come in and get the area around the register ready for opening. I learned that you could actually have fun on a job and not get bored when it comes to dealing with the public everyday. Management and co-workers were great! Hardest part was keeping an eye on everyone in the store during holidays, it would be really crowded. I enjoyed the upbeat personalities the most!"
good,"- I learn how to deal with multiple customers everyday."
good,"Best job I have worked for."
good,"At work there are many different people you meet each and everyday. You learn how to work well and communicate better with others. Although during the busier times of the year it may seem difficult to keep up with the fast pace, it starts to become easier. i really enjoy meeting all the different types of people and helping find what they like."
good,"A typical day of work would consist of greeting and serving customers, opening and closing registers, and keeping display and stock room area cleaned. I gained a lot of customer service experience and obtained an ability to meet store goals.Working at Footlocker gave me a better understanding of the purpose of each type of sneaker and or shoe. My former co-workers and I always remained focus on our goal and aided each other when needed to achieve our desire goal as a team. One of the most difficult part of my job was always having to keep my attitude positive even when customers were very rude and irate. At times it seemed customers belittled me just because they looked down on a shoe sales person. The most enjoyable part of the job was having the opportunity to keep up with the latest sneaker trends and the upcoming releases."
good,"no complaints. nothing but good comments, would recommend to a friend."
good,"something to keep you busy at all times made day go by fast."
good,Learned how to better my multitasking and how to create a comfortable environment for customers.
good,"People might think Footlocker is just about selling shoes but it is a lot more to it than that. Footlocker has taught me so much when it comes to dealing with inventory, interacting with people of different backgrounds, and it just helped me tremendously with my managerial skills as a whole and It also worked with my school schedule so I didn't have to choose getting an education over working and vise versa. My co-workers are like family, we might argue and disagree but at the end of the day, we all worked towards a common goal which was making that store the best it could be and we were successful because of it. I love shoes and my closet is forever thankful to footlocker for adding many new pairs to it. The hardest part for me was when I first started working for footlocker was learning all the different types of shoes because I had no idea that their was SO many different variations but after a couple weeks, I got the hang of it and was fine. A typical day at work varied, sometimes it was slow and other times I ran around like a chicken with my head cut off but I didn't mind because I like fast paced environments."
good,"Working in Footlocker was an awesome experience over the past 3 and half years, i enjoyed the different cultures and friendly work place ."
good,"A typical day at work would entail basic cleaning tasks like sweeping, mopping, dusting etc. It also requires a lot of heavy lifting and climbing up and down ladders. You have to be quick on your feet and proactive. We set goals to engage with EVERY customer so that our service is top notch. "
good,"I think the most important thing about my job is sales. Although management varies depending on who your District Manager/MIT is, our most important goals are Driving Sales. The pay is fairly low at a Lady Footlocker if the store doesn't prosper on sales. The management of my district is amazing. It all depends on your dedication and be open-minded. I've been working with the company since last year and I'm already a manager."
good,"Agradable ambiente de trabajo, buen compañerismo y aprendí bastante sobre el sector textil."
good,"It's pretty mutch simple; just know your sneakers, provide good guest service, and work hard and you'll be alright."
good,"I'm over the whole stock inventory so normally just go in check in all the incoming product. All shoes go in the wall by Brand, name, color, and size. Management is like the best they work with you threw anything, co-workers get along great sale shoes find common ground with them enjoy work. The hard part I've ever had to do was put up a shipment of 118 boxes (12pairs of shoes in each box)"
good,"Footlocker was a great first job , it was a little bumpy at first but i hit adjusted in no time & from then i was doing outstanding sales and on top of my game"
good,During my time at footlocker is when I did the most growth. I had to ability to work under many great managers and I was able to learn so much from each of them. I was able to get hired as a part time employee and then was able to climb my to being a store manager.
good,"Un journée typique de travail dépend du poste occupé. Par exemple le vendeur va prendre connaissance de ses objectifs de la journée et va s'atteler aux tâches qui lui seront confiées."
good,Existe uma cultura organizacional saudável boas expectativas de promoção.
good,I liked working at Foot Locker Inc. Everyone had good energy and was very kind to everyone. The mangers were always on top of everything and that’s good. The hardest part of the job was remembering where everything was. Overall this was a good job but they could raise the pay a little more.
good,"a typical day: can be really busy during exclusive sneaker releases, some days can be slow."
good,"I had the opportunity to manage multiple store locations and division.  As a Manager Trainer and District Manager In-Training, I mentor other associates to extend their career to the next highest level in management. Working at this level gave me great satisfaction when I know my customer walk out my store satisfy and my associates received the training they was promise."
good,"Fun , very active , always have things to do . You stay busy here !!! I love helping others and this is what it's all about driving sales and helping out new faces"
good,Not a bad place to work but if your wanting to grow with the company you sometimes have to move to bigger volumes and leave your are. Thats the only way to advance in the company
good,"its a fun workplace. very professional. meet alot of people day by day. good environment and good people/coworkers. learned about handling customers helping people what they need with good manners. hardest part of the job is when theres a special day such as black friday, boxing day. most enjoyable part is you get discount with the products. fun coworkers, and the loyalty of customers"

good,Footlocker was a great first job. The managers were great. The customers never gave a problem. My coworkers were great too. Footlocker is an organized place to work at.
good,This job taught me how to lead a group of employees. It taught me how to coach employees up to meet their goals whether it be through coaching or corrective action. This job was a great stepping stone and taught me a lot that I now transfer to other companies and careers.
good,By far all the managers and coworkers were awesome it was mainly the customers they were so rude but I kept it professional and talked to them but they still seemed upset so ill go get the manager . Some customers wete very nice and easy to work with
good,"I loved this job, discounts work environment was awesome. meeting new people. it was definitely a great experience, I loved everything about both stores"
good,I love working at this company I have been with this company since I began my journey as a graduate student at the University of South Carolina
good,everything about the way the company is structured and how it deals with its employees is backdated and unfair. the management will not pay you for the full time you have been at work as they will clock you out 1 hour or 2 before you have left.
good,"Fun, organized. Learning management positions. My coworkers are civilized people. The hardest part about the job is nothing becuase I do my best at work. And I enjoy my employee discounts there."
good,"No job security"

good,One of the funnest jobs I have had but one of the worst pay and benefits as well. Thanks for the awesome collection i built while working there and meeting awesome people.
good,the most enjoyable about this job was the discount and people you encounter. other than that the hours are trash and the pay is terrible there is no way you can survive off of it.
good,Require a lot of you and sometimes push you too hard however overall a fun environment. Management at times do nothing and their job is easier than a normal customer service member.
good,"When I started working I had long shifts with a lot of people.  It was a productive environment and we always had something to do.  After the store had its grand opening we didn't really get any shifts because they were over staffed. Most of my co-workers were amazing to be around for both me, and customers.  Overall it was a good job just not enough hours and the management at the time was unorganized. My most enjoyable moments were interacting with the children and parents."
good,"This is a good job to have while in college, they worked with my school schedule. Commission is great if your a good sales person, it really boost your check"
good,Footlocker is a ok but not the best pay is really low for a big company now I have to find another job think twice before working there. They give great benifits but 7.50 pay is not enough

good,Footlocker is a very fun place to work when it isn’t so busy and when it’s busy it’s also fun Because you can have little competitions with your colleagues to make more money for the store. It’s a great way to build costumers service skills

good,"Footlocker has its ups down"
good,i liked working at foolocker for my first job it showed me the basics to actually having a job.

good,Working at footlocker can be fun. You learn about sneakers and clothing and different brands. If you don't like being on your feet and moving alot this isn't the job for you. You will have to climb ladders at time and sometimes you could just be standing for hours straight. Managers at most of the footlockers I have experience are pleasant and understanding. The hardest part of the job if you are a sales associate would be to really maximize your sales because you do work on commission. The most enjoyable part of the job will be day your work day goes by fast because the pace of the job. Only thing i did not like was there was not alot of opportunities to be promoted.

good,"When arriving at work I start off by clocking in and then walking to the front of the store. I then check to see what the sales goal for the day is and my dollar per transaction. When the customer arrives I greet them, approach them, and ask them what brings them in. After they explain what it is I then suggest merchandise that may fit there needs. If they agree on the merchandise I show additional items to compliment the merchandise. I've learned to not give up on the customer even when they say 'I'm just looking'. There is a reason they came in. Therefore I continue to ask additional questions to figure it out. Sometimes things get busy on certain days, but I know I can always rely on my co-workers by asking for their help and passing a customer off to them. The hardest part of my job is when a customer is not interested in items that compliment the merchandise they are interested in. However, I don't give up I continue to suggest other items. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to know different people and making them happy due to my positive energy I bring their day."

I have learned the ins and outs of management whether it is handling paperwork and money at the end of the night, to being apart of conference calls with the other stores in the district and the District Manager. My co-workers are mostly high school kids whom are eager to learn which is great to see. The hardest part of the job is having to push sales to make the day but with very little customers it makes it tough and us as a store looks bad at the end of the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is the joy of helping consumers with purchasing shoes or apparel that suit their needs."

good,"Working at Lady Footlocker was the best job I ever had. The management provided good training, honest feedback, and support. There was no typical day at work because sometimes the store was excitingly busy and other times business was slow so it was a good time to clean, put out new inventory, and straighten up the back room. The management taught me how to make suggestions to customers so they would buy compatible products to match their purchase. My co-workers were fun to be with and we all knew that every day we had to work together to reach our quota. The hardest part of the job as store manager was the extra hours I had to work when an employee called in sick or just didn't show up for work. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my customers. I got to know some of them very well and hopefully I left anyone who came to my store with a pleasant shopping experience. I was very sad when my store closed and Lady Footlocker had no full time position for me in another store."

I truly loved everything about my job position and seeing the satisfaction on any customers face after I sold them a pair of sneakers, socks or insoles. Truly was one of my greatest jobs."
good,A typical day with Kenny shoes was very fast paced. And you will always have something to do from picking to cleaning. That was one reason why I enjoyed working for them because I like a job that has various duties. You don't have time to be bored because there is so much to do.

good,"I've been with Footlocker for almost five years. It started off as a part-time job while I went to school but quickly advanced into bigger opportunities. On an average day, I am managing the sales floor and the team, helping with customers' needs, and maintaining paperwork and shipments to ensure the store runs properly. I've learned best practices on how to build relationships with people in a professional work environment as well as build my own work ethic and confidence as it pertains to management and sales. My managers have all been mentors to me, pushing me to be the best and offering support whenever it was needed. The company I work for strives for achievement and the success of its employees and it is obvious in the approach of their managers. My co-workers are some of the greatest people I've ever met. Without the experience of being on a team with strength in communication, support, and the ability to work together to produce the best outcome I would not be the manager I am today. The hardest part of the job is spending so much time in the store. I sometimes wish I had more free time. The most enjoyable part of my job is customer service- without my customers I wouldn't have a job! And also working hard and seeing what it's produced- meeting sales goals, getting promotions, and recognition.  Although I love my job, I'd like to use my experience in customer service and retail management in a new direction. I am fast learner, eager to learn in new areas, and quickly adaptable in various situations!"
good,"A typical day at work was selling products such as sneakers, clothes, bags and shoe accessories to customers. I learned how to sell different products at once. My management team worked as one and all got along. My co-workers were team players. The hardest part of the job was not meeting your quota when the day is slow. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting your quota for the week."
good,"A typical day of work consists of greeting customers and informing them on the type of sneaker they want or advise a better alternative for them. We have to sell so we must inform them about the apparel, shoe care and insoles we offer as well. I've learned how to work the cash register. I do regular transactions, returns and exchanges. The most enjoyable part of my job is my co-workers, They are very easy going and great to work with. "

good,Great company to work for. From top to bottom a good place and atmosphere
good,"Open the store and prepare the store for the customers. Once, we are opened, greet and serve customers and satisfy whatever needs they need fulfilled. When we get shipment, if we have a stock guy on shift he/she will store it in the back or I will take time off the sales floor and stack them properly in their shelves. Clothes will get restocked on the sales floor as well as any display sneakers which are sold. If we get any new displays, we build them and place them in their proper locations. Once the workday is over we review our daily goals and update any information that needs be. When thats complete, we count out the registers, close the store and drop the money into the bank safe. As for management and co-workers, everyone is very helpful and patient. They give us all the information and training to be the best sales assoicates and managers we could be. The hardest part of the job is waiting for customers to enter the store. The most enjoyable part of the job is the looks of all the happy customers as they depart knowing they had great customer service."

good,"Footlocker isn't always fun and games, especially during holidays. But overall the people you work with are very fun but also self concerned most of the time."
good,I personally feel it’s the kind of job you go to after school as a teenager. It’s a decent job but that location was not. Management admitted that was his first and only job he had ever had.
good,It’s an okay job. Part time hours. 10/hr plus commission. Have to be a quick learner! Watch out to make sure no one is stealing your sales. If you’re a part timer selling a lot for the commission  is the only way to get a decent check.

good,My experience at footlocker has always been fun to work. my co-workers were easy to get along with also very helpful. We've always been trained to attend every customer and satisfy their every need and suggest and engage to make sure every customer walks out with a bag footlocker bag in their hand. Also was trained to exceed the daily quota for our day.
good,"Smooth Days Depending On crowd Also Day Of The Week Hours Fluctuate Depending On Staff If There Is A Lot Of Staff Not That Many, Management Great At My Store  Coworkers GOOD .No Job Struggles"

I learned working there was how to get people to buy our merchandise. What to say and what not to say to them. Management was okay they was nice. My co workers was real cool i'm close to them even tho i don't work there any more i still stay in touch.  the hardest part of my job was when it was busy and if its only two people was working we have to help like 5 people at once most of the time people don't have time to wait. the most enjoyable time at work was when nobody came in.
good,Great part time job surrounded by my piers and sporting goods.

good,"I've worked for this company for 5 years and the only negative things i can say about Foot Locker is no matter how much of a clean record you have with the company, one mess up will cost you your job. There are many managers that bend the rules and are still currently employed with this company. i just feel bad for the ones that worked there butts off and made one mistake and lose there job."

good,Working for Foot Locker gave me the skills I needed to provide the best possible customer service I can. My only complaint is the hourly pay. It's way too low for the amount of work managers and associates do.

good,"small office no complains, they work around your schedule cant complain they understand if your a student. Amazing doctors extremely inspring, they go above and beyond for their patients at any given day of the week."
good,Mostly fun when you doing what your post to do. It's not hard at all. It's actually a easy job once you get because they tell you your requirements each day. I was a cashier and the only thing I didn't really like was inventory because it was so much to put in the system but I always got it done so I wouldn't have to worry about during the busy days.
good,"My manager was a great guy. He was always very helpful and taught me so much about being approachable and available for customers.

Working here, my day included making sure the customers were all satisfied and keeping the store neat and organized."

good,A typical day at footlocker would consist of making sure the stock room was clean and up to code. I would receive the shipment and was in charge of making sure the equipment was put away in accordance with regulations. The hardest part of the job was just selling the product made by the company as most people sought to only buy specific merchandise. Themes enjoyable part of this job was working with the people I was privileged to work with.

good,"I sold shoes and clothing, I made purchases for customers as well. Was not real hard part about the job, everything usually went smooth unless a customer was unsatisfied something such as a shoe that wasn't in stock. I enjoyed every bit of the job, my co-workers, my manager, the customers, the discounts came in handy. and the money was satisfying at on point."
good,"Easy mornings, busy afternoons and evenings. Managers had little to no break. Constantly on your feet. But the people you get to work with and meet along the way helps to make you culturally well rounded. This job teaches you how to have drive and ambition to do better everyday with incentives and staff motivation. Your co-workers quickly become like friends and family even with competition in the air. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet all day and having the patience to deal with difficult customers in trying situations. But having your hard work constantly recognized and being able to advance to a high position makes the cons seem non existent."
good,Very relaxed enviornment. based on giving great customer service.
good,Working at Schneider National was an excellent place to work. The trainers and dispatchers take time to know you and help you in any way possible. You never feel alone out there on the road. I learned a lot about trucking and the upkeep of the trucks. The hardest part of the job was just unexpected things that pop up on the road. The most enjoyable part was representing a great company by doing a great job. – less

good,A typical day at work consist of marking new sales and preparing new advertisement. Being able to give the customer great service providing for them the product wanting to be purchased any means possible. Being part of management it was difficult to encourage others to have the same motivation to do the best they can to make quota for the day.

good,"a typical work day consisted of checking in shipments, reading and comprehending company numbers, managing the store and part timers when the GM was off. Footlocker depended a lot on youth culture and the stye and fashion of what was hot for the current season. The hardest part of the job was probably managing all of the daily task with only 1 part timer on the sales floor, since there always needed to be a body on the sales floor, it was hard for me to check in shipments or teach the other workers things when I was busy managing the store, being security and maintaining my part timers all at once. The most enjoyable part of the job was probably the atmosphere, everyone was so people friendly and everyone knew what needed to be done so there was always a sense of organization."
good,"Azienda che può dare tanto personalmente e lavorativamente, in continua crescita."
good,It was hard to keep busy when the store is slow; which was a lot at our location. I mainly learned from my co-workers and the assistant store manager. The Store Manager isn't the best. SM had poor managerial skills and was very aggressive to employees and customers. All the associates got along well and worked as a team. Nothing about the job was hard. You do get DISCOUNTS which is a plus. Not the best location for advancement.
good,"-Great for someone hungry to learn and grow their sales skills with people from a variety of backgrounds. "
good,Very friendly working environment between staff and customers. High communication skills. Knowledgeable staff on products. Delegated team when it comes to being busy.
good,I really didn’t mind anything. We got 30 min breaks I feel like I should have got another one since I was working a long shift . You honestly just need to have a good memory to remember all the shoes bar codes
good,its better than my other jobs ive had previously the cultute is way better the management is way better i just wish the hours where better because im forced to get a second job to make ends meet
good,Is a good job for a young adult who has no responsibility or is trying to get in his or her feet . Footlocker gives out a fair employment opportunity for each and every worker
good,"I loved working at Footlocker, It was the greatest experience ever considering it was my first job. There are a few cons like on manager has very poor management skills but the other was very welcoming and warm, to were we built a strong relationship as a ""work-family"". There are a lot of customers who come in daily, for new releases or just daily shopping. You have to have, I guess a very high drive for sales. Overall, I promise it is a great experience literally, you build really strong bonds with each co-worker which for me made my day-to-day job duties easy."
good,"A typical day was hitting sales goals, very pleasant environment and employees. management was great and communicated well with the staff. I learn great customers skills"
good,Foot Locker is a great company to work for. Fun fast paced environment that allows you to really get to know your customers and yourself. A lot of time and effort from full-time staff goes into each and every one of the part-timers and/or new hires.
good,"Lavoro abbastanza impegnativo, ambiente molto sereno."
good,My review on footlocker is a 10 out of 10 because i love shoes and i love giving advice because i believe i have good taste so was good at helping people choose what shoes they should get.
good,"It Was a very laid back job, just make sure you do what you have to do. long as you stay on top on your daily objectives the managers wont bother you, but you have to be thick-skinned due to it being retail, because some customers will curse you out if you dont have the right size."
good,"Working at FootLocker was a new experience. the management was well structured and the workplace was easy going. A typical day at Footlocker was busy so I  was always moving, learning the best ways to see all customers was vital in being successful at FootLocker. The hardest part about working at  FootLocker was trying to help every customer that came in the stores only because at times we were so short staffed. "
good,"The environment is a great one to work in. You learn a lot, great team. Great location, some managers are cool, can go to them for any & Everything. Security is pretty cool."

The staff were excellent, and provided minimal stress by doing their jobs well. The culture is very cultured, with new music and display changes. The most enjoyable part of the job was analyzing sales and customers."
good,"I loved working here, great music and also a great atmosphere. Management wasn't the best, not enough hours, and hours wouldn't be equal among all coworkers."
good,Great job as long as you learn how to ignore people and do your work. a lot of drama like any company. but also a lot of benefits. I would come back to this job after I lost some weight because its straining.
good,"Footlocker is very fun,manager is so understanding with schedules,love the commission there,great place to work if your still in school,a good place to start your customer service experience there."
good,"trés bonne entreprise "
good,"Fun environment to work in, Co-workers where always fun and helpful. Management was always helpful and willing to answer all questions. This job helped with my people skills and patience."
good,"Il faut avoir le sens du contact, inspirer confiance, garder son sang froid et s'adapter à chaque clients."
good,"It's a fun, easy fast pace job but you don't get paid enough for the work you put out . It's easy to get along with other employees and the managers. This is not a job you would want to help pay bills with"
good,Poor pay in the slow months where your commission can only be but so high. however was fun. I would still be working here if the pay was higher. I got too comfortable here now I need change in my life.
good,"enjoyed working with the teams fun and fast paced environment,great training programs involved with the role, training nights and staff benefits where good"
good,"I worked for Footlocker until 2003. To make the best of any opportunity given, commission sales was a must at Footlocker. Showing or suggesting to a Lady Footlocker customer that a half size larger is better for her feet that a size smaller, made me feel good. Always looking out for the customer's best interest."

good,"Good company to work for. However, as a sales associate we don't get a raise and only make $7.25. Management system is great"
good,"What I've learned was to be more Professional. Working with costumers on daily bases Footlocker taught me professionalism is a major key. The hardest part of the job is balancing four to five customers at a time and giving them all the equal attention. Most enjoyable for me was seeing the satisfied faces of customers when they are about to leave the store. My co-workers were never negative about the flaws of the work day, so it was always positive energy throughout the day. A day of work is not predictable for an hour it can slow then within the next five minutes the store can be swarm with customers."
good,First day on the job you get paired with someone in the stock room to learn how they do it then after you learn you get your own solo projects.
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company. Fun fast paced working environment with great opportunity for advancement. Management was great, associates were also great."
good,"The store where I was located wasn't a very popular place so not a lot of customers came daily. Most of the time I would be looking to keep the store organized and clean. I made sure there was an appropriate amount of merchandise in display. My coworkers and mangers were very comprehensive and they always had new tasks for the workers. I gained more job experience and I got to interact with customers and I improved my communication skills."

good,"it was a very fun place to work and i loved working with the kids at kids foot locker. but, it was very hard to move up if you were transferred or hired at a low grossing store because it was almost impossible to show impressive numbers"
good,"  On a typical work day, i provided customer service to customers. I assisted them with any questions they had and also serviced them with the decision on picking out footwear. Also I maintained order within the work environment and trained other associates. I also operate the register using the POS system. At the end of the night I cleaned and straightened up the store and made sure the store was operational for the next work day."

good,"vente, reassort, encaissement."
good,Customer interactions kept the job interesting and new. Management genuinely cared about their employees and co-workers were easy to work with.
good,"on an average day i would: organize the new shoes in the stock room, then go out to the sale floor and help out with finding shoes for customers, and at the end of the day i would make sure the shoes on the walls were appropriately placed, then i clock out and head out. But before any employee left there was a routine bag check."
good,"A typical day at work is giving best customer service overall. Greeting customers as they enter and leave the store. I would help customers with shoe sizes, and ring them up. Sometimes, I would stock shipment in the stockroom, pick things out, and help out with a customer order. When shipment come in I would stock it in the stockroom. I learned a lot meaning this was my first job ever. The management here was terrific! The hardest part of the job was meeting deadlines, but I still manage to get everything done. The most enjoyable part was working the stockroom and customer service."
good,I loved working in Footlocker. I wasa able to move from different stores due to my good attendance and work. I love how all co workers got along and had a good time while working.
good,The typical day at work was selling shoes to individuals and giving them the best customer service you had.

good,"Fun workplace and flexible hours. Very good part time job.Low increase in salary tho. Good discounts for employee."
good,"Footlocker is a great job for someone looking to get into sales while still in school. They give you the ability to learn a product, personalize each experience with each customer, while understanding team work. You'll quickly learn how to handle customer issues and product details and how make sure you keep the customer happy."
good,"This was my first job and I currently still work there. It’s a great part time job to have.

good,This is my first job. I have learned a lot. A typical day consists of making sure the customers are waited on effectively and efficiently. The hardest part is working shorthanded. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people.
good,"When I first started there, it was really fun, I was learning new things. As time went by, things started to change, not for the good, people started to quit and the job wasn't as fun as it was before. Pay was very bad for the amount of stuff we were responsible for, we put in way more work than what was normal for that job. But at the end I still will always love it and miss it dearly."
good,The work experience at footlocker is all about organizing and customer service. We organize all the merchandise and stock by number or letters and everything neat and tightly fitted into the stock wall. We are all about customer service because if we want our customers to come back we have to give them great customer service experience in order for them to keep coming back and to bring more customers in cause if you here great things about a store the more customers you have rather if its bad no one comes in.

good,I worked at Foot Locker for 13 years I met a lot of people and learn a lot of things that I carry with me to this day I would love the opportunity to go back if I had that chance
good,A typical workday included greeting customers and assisting in what they needed and figuiring out their shoe size and finding the shoe they wanted in the back. Management was really cool and would joke around but was always serious too. The hardest part inventory because Fed Ex and UPS were usually always late with shipments that we needed. The most enjoyable part was working around the type of shoes I liked the sports enviroment and the employees and manager.
good,"At Footlocker you would have morning meetings talking about goals."
good,A typical day at work is always fun. I never not like going to work. It's a very competitive job when coming to sales and daily goals.

good,Fast-paces and fun but also lets you be yourself while working with others. Gives you the opportunity to learn about different types of shoes and products. Management makes the job easy by teaching you about the material and guiding you. The atmosphere of the job is my favorite. The smiles on customers faces when they receive a shoe for them is the motive. The hardest part of the job would be trying to sale additional merchandise until they get to the checkout bench. This is a challenge but it also helps with sale skills.
good,Its a fun and fast paste to work smiling and greeting customers all day and getting the items they want plus more making sure you get to them in a timely manner.
good,Great staff benefits and training programs like minded people with a passion for the industry and the brand and the culture. Hardest part at the time of employment was hours(weren't enough) and breaks were subject to availability

good,it was a company that was hard to leave. loved my customers love my co workers. a normal day always invoked shipment and moving around the visuals of the store.

good,"•	Greeted customers and assisted customers with final purchases "
good,"Great Company "
good,It's a wonderful place to work but at times it's like you may feel like you don't get compensated enough dealing with the customers and not knowing what an ordinary day at work would be like because anything can happen. It's all about customer interaction and helping them feel better so that is a big plus about my job. I'm not even sure if we get benefits as an AM.
good,"go along well with co-workers"
good,working here is soooo fun. The managers are fun and makes it enjoyable to come to work. Not so fast paced but you do need to be aware at all times. People love to still from our store.
good,"The environment that I was working in was probably my favorite. I was an assistant manager at that time, so I had many responsibilities as well. I seen so many joyful kids daily, which was pretty entertaining. My coworkers were mainly females, so it was a pretty chill environment. I honestly don't find anything difficult about that job, it was pretty easy."
good,"Perfect job the co workers are great, the job is fun. You have to be outgoing to work there.. The most enjoyable part is helping the kids and the hardest part is when it's slow.."

What i learned was great customer service skill. Management was ok it could've been better, more helpful and can encourage their employees to do better. most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with customers and selling them the product they want, also seeing the smile on their face was awesome to me."

good,"A typical day at Foot Locker was coming in and following a routine. Opening, grabbing products for customers, answering daily questions on new and existing products, offering up products to fit the customer, to closing the store. After some years at foot locker I was able to do all things consisting of filing opening and closing paperwork, editing the schedule as needed, resolving escalations with upset customers, organizing store products, and assisting the store manager. I had all the qualifications to run that store and could do it with no hesitation. I learned from working for Foot Locker that I could be a leader and develop any employee into being the best for the company. I took pride in what I did for this company. The only thing I didn't appreciate was my air manager not giving me the title to continue doing what I was doing. Unfortunately I don't work Foot Locker any more and it is upsetting knowing that I deserved but I am proud to say I worked there because my store manager worked just as hard for me as I did for her."

good,"Foot Locker is an exciting and fun place to work. There's always something that needs to be done around the store; which makes for no time to be bored. I've learned a lot while working at this company from being able to do management duties, knowledge of the products we carry, customer services and learning from my co-workers on how they succeed at doing their job well. I work with a management team who wants their store to succeed as well as their employees. They take the time out to train and push their employees to be the best sales associates they can be. The hardest part of my job is meeting the needs and expectations of each customers that visits our store; the easiest part of my job is being comfortable enough to ask my management team and co-workers for help when I need it."
good,"The job is all about sales first, However it can be relaxed at times, most times associates and managers are chatting if no ones in the store, however the customer always comes first.

good,First few days on the job will be somewhat difficult but after awhile its easy. Everyone is there to help out as a team. Great place to work.
good,I really do enjoy working for Foot Locker and I also like the people I work with. The only thing I will say Foot Locker needs to adjust is what they pay their employees from assistant manager positions down to part-timers. We deserve more for the work and hours that we put in and the company makes more than enough money to give us more.

good,I would recommend this sales associate position for your first job. I love the experience with people and selling products. Also you get a discount. I may reply for a part time position .
good,The goal as a sales associate at footlocker was to be able to persuade people into buying a shoe that they like and for them to buy more to get the business more money and yourself included.

good,Footlocker allows employees to feel comfortable at work being that it is a sneaker company that is based off fashion and athletic gear. We wear any kind of sneakers to work that the cmpany sells which allows us to express individuality and style while on the sales floor.
good,"Conference calls, regional meetings in Arlington daily Monday’s about sales, working 45 plus hours as a manager no commission but straight salary. As a manager you managed the schedules, employees and inventory plus sales as well trained all employees under your store. If your a smaller store you have to manage shipment as well Tuesday and Thursdays. Compared to town east or Lincoln park you’ll have stock guys. Cool company to work for if you have no family like kids since it’s ratail you’ll be working them long shifts and holidays as well. Great opportunity for anyone with no kids or no hobbies outside of work. Footlocker has you for good them discounts as well. I strongly recommend don’t fall under shoe discount if you go over the balance, corporate don’t play discount abuse if you go over it’s a game over for you. Yearly awards for managers on sales gain, leadership and manger of the year. If you’re young great start for ya! Footlocker approved."
good,"bonne expérience, possibilité d'évolution, bonne ambiance"
good,"a great place to call home, but its a mans club not a lot of movement or growth but lots of fun great regional manager. id work for them again in a heart beat"

good,"My experience working at Footlocker stores was worthwhile! I advanced in my position quickly while employed and enjoyed the progression. Whereas we had up and down time, my team managed to still remain courteous and helpful to all customers and peers on a day to day basis. Footlocker was my first management position in retail and taught me much patience and how to excel my skills. I admit, the toughest part of the job was required I not be as flexible in hours working management..so I missed a lot of time with family. However, with an awesome elated team, you build a work family as well. Providing customers with accurate product knowledge, friendly swift customer service, and stylish vibes I'm sure was the most I enjoyed about Footlocker."
good,"great chance of being comparative in the company, management loved to great new types of challenged, by making the employees see who can sale what the most the following week. open door policy in which most companies, assist if have personal or family matter to attend to.

good,"My job as a part-time cashier typically is to make sure the store looks nice and neat. All shirts are folded, pants are hung up properly, shoes are not falling off the walls along with putting ink tags on all clothing, putting SKUs inside shoes and cashing out customers. I do count my register when I clock in and usually count the registers with my manager when we close. Sometimes we can be really busy and I have to work fast or we could be slow and I can take my time with customers. I learn a lot about selling products at the register for instance selling our shoe care (Crep, Jason mark, MINT, ect.) and socks which are buy one get one half off.

good,"Working for Foot Locker corporation was very fulfilling. It was my first job and I loved my managers. They pushed you to be the best and help mold me into the man I am today. I wish that the pay was better, but when I got promoted to Sales Lead (Key Holder) the pay went up, but for the amount of work the Sales Lead do and the assistant do, we deserve more. Other than the pay, working there was very enjoyable and fun and fast paced."
good,This was my first job and was very rewarding as a part time sales associate in highschool. The company has a lot of opportunity as I was able to grow and become an Assistant Manager in which I gained a lot of professional skills to carry with me in the work field.
good,Good job for someone who just looking for a job but has another source of income. You do get an employye discount and most of the time they would try to work with you with your time.
good,Working At Footlocker gives you the opportunity to work on talking to customers and engaging conversation with them to build your communication skills. Sometimes the workplace can be busy or not so busy depending on the time of day. The hardest part of the job is when nobody is coming into the store for the employees to not make commission.

good,"Foot Looker is a great place to work as far as atmosphere and training. The only bad thing I would say is that the pay is low, less then minimum hourly + 2% commission at full time so you really have to hustle to make $10- $12 an hour. Atmosphere is great and generally everyone is passionate about the same things like sports and sneakers. Very rare to find someone in the company that you don't have anything in common with."

Never a dull moment while working; if there are no customers there's always something to do like organize and make sure every shoe is priced and I'm the right place. Clothing and other things sold are constantly restocked. Employees are always helpful to you when you can't find a shoe.
good,"A typical day at work went by pretty quickly. I learned about shoes and how much people really care for them. Its important to know shoes my manager would say. The culture was very unique, we had many shapes and forms of people come in with all kind of moods and languages. The hardest part of work is working behind the counter during big shoes releases. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of the customers."

It is a performance based company where the goal is to sell more than just the shoe by itself, but if you are greeting people, attending to their needs and showing them the products, then you should be good."

good,"a typical day at work would be a target we all have to meet as a store and as individuals, it would be very busy as you will meet different types of people and they would just either come in to buy or come to just browse. i learned how to improve my selling skills and my confidence in order to approach and serve customers. management was very good as to they were strict but was necessary in order to make us better workers and also for the store to achieve its target. i enjoyed every part of the job and it was a fun experience, the hardest part was to find shoes in stockroom whilst its very busy so it was technically me running up and down the stairs in order to get some shoes. my co workers were very cool with me and very friendly and we also got a long very quick."

A typical day at kids footlocker is greeting every customer making sure they were helped, and finding exactly what they needed."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of organizing shoes, keeping the store presentable, using the register and phones. Also spent most of my time listening to customers and trying to help  them find a product they are interested in and one that best fits their needs. Management was great they worked with my schedule and were very smart and good at training me and same for my co workers. The hardest part about the job would be dealing with upset and frustrated customers, but overall was not to bad."
good,"Every morning we begin the work day with some very beneficial stretches and warm ups, to prevent injury threwout the day. I believe the hardest part of the job is to help people understand the job so that they can work quicker and more affective. Nothing a little persistence cant fix. The most enjoyable part of the job is the opportunity to help someone else achieve a goal they had set their eyes on. I learn stuff everyday at work but recently i learned that coworkers will always do what they believe is right for the job but the more i allow them to make mistakes they learn too, and when they do im there telling them how great of a try that was and build them up instead of tearing them down."

The hardest part about my job is doing hookups, its hard to make sure a person buys a shirt and socks or a hat when they really just came in for some shoes. The most enjoyable part about my job is talking to my customers, we have a lot of different type of people that come in there and its just fun getting to talk with them."

While working here I've learned that you must be patient and remain calm at all times in order to keep the peace between both customers and employees. My co-workers are great outgoing, fun, driven, and they all have great integrity. The hardest part of my job is telling a customer we don't have something and not being able to even order it for them seeing the disappointment in their faces kills me. The most enjoyable part of my job is having my customers at the end of a sale tell me I was one the best associates they've ever had that always makes my day."

good,"In a typical day at work, I could off learn more about how to be more friendly even more and also to learn how to offer the costumer our best products and make them buy it. My co-workers were all friendly but I think it was more about my personality, I am a really good person. I can say that there weren't a hard part about it I am a guy that makes everything I could say easy or that I do everything with passion or not at all so. I think that everything was enjoyable since I take everything serious but with I make everything fun."
good,Worked With customers and other employes on differnt sale and went beyon the call of duty as always
good,"A typical day at work would consist of opening or closing the store, working the register, selling product, doing stock, cleaning, ordering, accepting shipments, updating displays, and greet customers. I learned to just jump out there and greet people and ask if I can be of any assistance to anyone. I learned that it takes many people and many things to make a business successful. Many co-workers came and gone. Some were nice, hardworking and great people but the core 4 people who stayed over 3 years created the most efficient work bond. When certain people would work together the shift would go more smooth and more products would be sold. The hardest part of the job for me is the fact that you have to stand the entire time. The most enjoyable part of the job is at the end of the day when you're closing the register and before you send the report off you are fulfilled with making quota or sometimes even getting close to making quota. "

good,Most enjoyable time at my old job was helping out the customer and making them happy.

good,This was the first job that I ever had and I couldn't have wished for a better entrance into the work force as a young man. The company was fun and the product was a product that has had an impact on my life ever since. I'm a shoe guy now.
good,Foot Locker allowed me to grow into an adult and taught me things that may not have been elsewhere. I established relationships that will stick with me and never forget a very down-to-earth environment such as the one that drove the store i worked at.
good,I loved working with footlocker the only thing that I didn't enjoy was the pay. If that was raised it would be the best job; getting paid to sell shoes.
good,Je prestaties bepalen heel veel of je wordt gemogen door medewerkers en managers en wat je mogelijkheden zijn in door groei
good,"Put out shipment "
good,"I'm really into sneakers so working at Footlocker was a dream come true for me. Ever since commission was removed, my co-workers and I didn't fight for sales and I could now say that we all have a close relationship. Great place to make friends and that discount is blessed too."

good,"Great Place to network"
good,C'estai assez bien il y- avait une bonne ambiance de travail .

My manager did a great job at being flexible with it. I had fun with my co-workers, everyone worked together when things got busy. It was a fun environment to be in!"
good,Everyone was like family. Very friendly customers and easy to work with everyone. Store always stayed neat and organized and very understanding customers.
good,As I walked in at Footlocker and clock in I check what I can do such as folding the clothes fix the shoe wall and make sure all the clothes are hung up correctly. While doing that I make sure I attend customers and help them with anything they need.
good,More money hourly for your grind would be nice. if you are not a store manager only thing you benefit from is your discount which is what most employees work for is their discount.
good,A day at footlocker is a fun and competitive place between you and your co workers. Being a manager of a location was rewarding and helpful in reality knowing what people or loved needed for comfort in their everyday. Great training and always something to do.
good,"This was only the second job I had, but I loved it. It was a fun atmosphere and the discount was nice too. I transferred stores to follow a manager and had no regrets. The House of Hoops in Oak Park was my favorite."
good,"I loved the job, I relocated to another area for family reasons. The management was easy to work with.  I would have stayed at this company if it would have not been for my family issues."
good,"Work environment was incredible. Management is great, pay just sucks. There's a lot of different characters you'll encounter on the day to day basis but it's all about how you handle yourself."
good,"Footlocker is a great place to learn teamwork and an easy way to learn product knowledge. The environment of the company is to have fun and sale. If you love shoes, I highly recommend working for this company. The benefits are wonderful and the staff is very down to earth."

good,"Being that I was one of the Assistant Managers, it was a great experience managing a team of 9 Sales Associates. Everyone got along well with each other."
good,"Working at Footlocker gives you the opportunity to interact with people that you never have and never though you would. It also allows you to do a job that you will enjoy if you enjoy shoes, apparel, etc."
good,"I really enjoy this job! I heard it is different at high volume stores. My store is small and pretty slow. We make commission and I heard that at the higher volume stores, people steal each others sales. So I guess you have to be careful of that. We either make commission or base pay, whatever is higher at the end of the day. So that kind of sucks. You work pretty hard to sell stuff. You should be able to make commission on top of your base pay. The commission rate is pretty low also. For high volume stores its somewhere between 1.5-3. My store is low volume so its 3.5. Which is not a lot at all since we do not make a lot in a day. My coworkers and managers are amazing though! I really like learning all the different shoes and selling them to people and helping people get the shoes they want. The only thing I don't like is the pay"
good,I was a Cashier and Sale associate at Foot Locker. It is competitive and demands a good seller. The hard part about i was trying to sell more shoes than another to make more commission. but the competition was very fun.
good,Very fast paced and very competitive. Hours are flexible but sometime workers are over worked. Under paid for the work that is being completed. Otherwise very fun environment and good staff to work with.
good,"Typical day at work is pretty fun,outgoing,surprising & most of all challenging.An experience giving to all customers who walk into the store, making them feel like home giving them an experience at the shoe store they can never forget. Each and every day is another day were you learn something new, and gain or accomplish another goal ,strategy, or method. Its just about being opened minded and realizing that  we dont know everything in life, because each day that passes we learn more to life and everything that comes with it. Management is great even though sometimes it needs more work like everything in life, but besides the odds in supper great. The hardest part of my job could be several things sometimes, just depending on the task or dutty. But everything has a way in and way out to accomplish and succeed. And the most enjoyable part of my job would be everything going to when ever I have a corresponding shift."
good,"I enjoyed working at footlocker, great competitive, good starter job for some one right out of high school, gives them a way to learn how to hustle and be competitive in life"
good,"At times, the atmosphere can be quite hectic. Sometimes it can also be very relaxed. Either way, your main goal will always be to try andbdrive the sales in !"
good,perfect job for me. I had to relocate and where I di the traffic is slow over here. The atmosphere is what I like. The competiveness between stores is sometimes cool. Things have probably changed since 2013 but I loved it.
good,It was my favorite job & I wish I could have stayed longer. I got pregnant & had to resign. It was fast paced & never boring. I got paid well & got enough hours. The hardest part would have been when customers were rushed or angry over something & you have to remain professional & deal with the customer so they are satisfied. My favorite part at this job was the overall establishment. I had great coworkers & superiors & everyone made the enviorment enjoyable.
good,"I love working for footlocker, all the people that is a part of the company is really cool. a typical day usually consist of going to customers, finding what makes sense to them. ensuring they have the best customer service experience they could possibly have."
good,"A typical day at work very interesting and fun. Have you ever went to work happy?  6 times out of the week that's me. Being part of management is kind of a handfull especially when u have to be strict at times, but I also believe that while at work its not the time for friends its strictly business until it's break time then you can do what you please. The most enjoyable part of work are the 30-40% discounts on sneakers."
good,"Great environment to work in if your a people's person, its fun and enjoying productive job, can make it high in the company if you put the time in and work in a good location pay varies by store volume."
good,"A normal day at work consists of sales floor interaction, constant customer engagement, and heavy multi-tasking. Working for Footlocker has taught me speed and accuracy. I enjoy the people I work with and I love my customers."
good,"No existe una empresa que forme mejor a sus empleados para la venta, ha sido el lugar dónde mas he aprendido en mi vida laboral."
good,Clock in and have an amazing shift. Many customers come in and you enjoy helping them out. The co workers are great. The discount is amazing. 30% off of everything.
good,"although im only a part time sales associate I love the atmosphere I get to work in, the upbeat of co workers the dynamic and diversity of our customers and my managers. I love  the ability to grow in the company."
good,I enjoy working there and creating relationships with new people. The management makes working there fun and is extremely encouraging. The employees are all friendly and are willing to help you with whatever you need during work.
good,I really enjoyed working here. I started here before my senior year of high school and had the opportunity for promotion before I graduated still looking to get back in this company
good,"Es un buen ambiente para trabajar, aprendes mucho en como trabajar en equipo. Aprendes a como entender a las personas, sus necesidades en lo que andan buscando. Nos enseñan a usar la registradora. Nos dan un training, a finales del mes nos evalúan en como hicimos nuestras ventas. Lo difícil es hacer tus números, porque siempre viene ese cliente a solo mirar o también viene a la tienda y se mide todo los zapatos o ropa que tengamos y no se lleva nada y etc. Nada es fácil, siempre tenemos que tener paciencia y tratar a los clientes como a ti te gusta que te traten. "
good,"My managers make sure that the team of Foot Locker meets their goals. We more than likely do, and when we do, we get rewarded. This job brought me out of my comfort zone whenever it came to meeting new people and I met new people anytime I worked."
good,You come in and get excited. You get ready to engage with customers and have a great shift. Everyone likes shoes and you get to talk about them your whole shift.
good,Footlocker has set me up for the future . Company's core values are amazing . Training programs provided are specific and gives you confidence to work with people as you know what you are talking about .
good,"Working at footlocker was great. A typical day involved hundreds of customers coming into the store to try on/purchase different shoes and apparel. There would be times where I had ten different customers with around 3 pairs of shoes each, so I had to make sure I remembered who had what and where they were in the store. I learned a great deal about the importance of pairing and upselling. Sometimes people could not see an outfit coming together with a certain pair of shoes, so it was essential to know what was good match with what, even when a customer did not see it. The management there was extremely helpful in guiding us to success. They worked on the floor with us and gave advice when we were struggling. The hardest part of the job was to sell insoles. Most people either already had some, said they had some, or said they did not feel the need for them, but once I was able to get a customer to try them on, I usually closed the sale. The most enjoyable part was the camaraderie and friendly competition among coworkers."
good,Footlocker is an amazing company to work for. There are a lot of opportunities for associates. Easy to get promoted and or relocate to another store for more opportunities.
good,"Working with foot locker was a wonderful time and great experience. Love working with the other employees, great communication with the customer and you get hands on with the product and the store."
good,I enjoyed my time at footlocker.  The only reason I left the company was to move to Louisiana for college.  I did not transfer my job because my parents did not want me to work during my first year of school.
good,Customer centric environment. Service first mind frame. Long hours.  Stand 8-12 hours a day.  Sales and metric driven.  Easy environment for natural leaders to excel.
good,"No constant routine, encourages flexibility and improvisation to situations. Teaches how to interact with broad range of individuals."
good,"I love working at Foot Locker because I have a genuine joy for talking and meeting new people. From the management down to the co-workers, everyone there truly enjoys each others company, and that is what I appreciate most about the job I have. I don't think there really is ""a hardest part"" of my job outside of just general customers and whatever they come in with during a given day. Some may come in joyful and happy, others may come in with attitudes and moodswings. Nonetheless, I still manage to adjust and get through every shift as needed. The most enjoyable part of my job is really the networking. You never know who you meet or what they know until you open up and just talk to a person. I love where I am at and what I do, it is a joy to be there."
good,Not very busy on a daily basis due to the other location in the Acadiana Mall. Often days at work would be extremely slow. There aren't many hard parts about the job itself at all. Only thing that may be challenging for some is having the ability to multi-task and take care of more than one customer during busy shifts.
good,Work was always exciting cause of the new people i would meet. I learned about how the cashier works and counting money. My manager was pretty cool and so where my co-workers.
good,"Foot Locker is fun. Helping people is a big part of the job, and  it is a great place to work at with great people. Cashiers don't get commission but are made to work as sales associates"
good,"Foot Locker is a great company to be apart of, co workers and management are fun, understanding and help you with skills you haven't mastered."
good,"A typical day at work between monday - thursday is really slow and friday , saturday are the most busy days . my co-worker are so fun to be around and really helpful and the most part i love about my job is helping customers out and being around my co-worker and manager because everybody so cool to be around . Everybody always cheer everybody on and try to stay on top of everything and always remember to always put the customer first ."
good,I learned a lot of different things while working in footlocker. One thing i learned was how to start a conversation with open-ended questions to figure out what the customer is looking for. Another thing i learned was that not every customers come's to the store knowing what they are looking for.
good,If you're into the shoe game there's no better place for you. I love Foot Locker and all they've done for me but it's not necessarily the best place for career advancement. If you aren't a store manager the only true benefit is the discount price on shoes. The environment is as good as you make it so as long as you have a positive attitude you'll do fine. Customers are the focus so as long as you're building and maintaining rapport there isn't much you can miss out on.
good,"A typical day at work i work on sales so i greet customers, help them with any sneakers and additional items. Footlocker helps you interact with customers."
good,"Footlocker was fun, challenging and it tested your efficiency. Moving at a quick pace and in a timely manner was a bonus."
good,My coworkers are very loving. The workplace is very fun and kid welcoming. You learn how to deal with new customers everyday and there is never a dull moment.
good,"Benefits are great and it is a fun work environment. Management is sometimes stressful, depending on who it is. Other wise it's an awesome ob."
good,"Typical day at work is to enjoy and have fun selling items "
good,"Foot Locker is amazing especially if you are a sneaker head. Absolutely great place to work if you like customer service, and shoes. Highly recommend as a highschool student or college entry student. Very enjoyable"
good,"I normally work in the stock room of kids footlocker, a typical day for me is coming in and making sure my back area is cleared of any garbage so that when shipment comes in there are no accidents. once shipment arrives I count all cases and make sure all the number of cases I sign for are there. I then proceed to check each case in by matching up my carton cases to my manifest. After this I start unpacking each case and place them in the areas in which they belong in. Lastly I place the shoes in their right shelves, sometimes having to move other boxes to higher or lower shelves depending on style, brand, and size. If I am not in the back room I am out on the sales floor greeting customers, and engaging with them to make sure that they get what they are looking for as well as making sure they are getting the best customer service as possible all while maintaining a positive attitude and smile. My team is a very fun and attentive group towards one another as well as our customers, which makes coming to work more enjoyable. Engaging with my customers and getting to know a little more about them and having them come in and out with a smile because we provided them with what they needed is my favorite part of working for Kids Footlocker."
good,"Busy weekends, always engaging with multiple customers. My co-workers are very friendly and their always helping when help is needed. Management is wonderful always pushing employees to strive for the sky. The job itself is not so hard but the customers can sometimes make the job but there are many ways to fix the problems and always end the day happy. I enjoy interacting with customers and using my excellent people skills, also enjoy making people smile especially those who are having bad days. Being able to sale shoes and clothing the everyone likes can be very interesting due to sometimes customers educate us on unfamiliar shoes because they may be shoe phonetics, meaning they research shoes and keep updated."
good,"Um dia típico de trabalho onde não existe monotonia. Desde a hora que abre a loja que o nosso principal objetivo é somente a satisfação do cliente. É nos dado por parte da empresa uma serie de diretrizes quer a nível de visual, produto, estado das vendas, formação, etc."

good,Co-workers were really great. Great environment. Management is really understanding when it comes to scheduling. Just an over all great place to work
good,"Job was fun if you and your co-workers know how to work together. A lot of slow days unless it is release days or holidays. Management was easy to get along with friendly, and knew how to keep people busy. The hardest part of the job is understanding the pay, and the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing customers leave happy."
good,"The morning shift is slow at times, but from 11AM until closing time, it's busy and active. There's always something to do, so that you aren't bored but always busy."
good,I also opened and closed this store. I managed my co workers. lots of responsibilities in which i really enjoyed. The management was always on top of things. Team mate type coworkers. Very reliable and dependable employees. the only down side to this job was the slow seasons. I prefer to keep busy.
good,"This is a great place to learn about the Athletic industry and how it influences and is influenced by current trends. The environment is welcoming and fun with a great dose of hard-work. You will get out of it what you put into it. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people. You will meet people here that will be a part of your life forever, and that you can learn from and grow with."
good,awesome place to work great location only in the summer time.. learned marketing the management was great loved the crew there was no hard part just parking was hard because of the job being in the city.I enjoyed EVERYTHING
good,A typical day at work was inventory. I learned how to sale myself and products. The management was wonderful. Co-workers kept me on top of my game as far as sales and commission. Nothing hard about selling shoes and accessories. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting  new people.
good,I enjoyed working for the footocker Company for many reasons one would happen to be because of the location there where plenty of people from out of the contry that come to shop and at times it challenged my position but what's work without a challenge.
good,"Lavorare per Foot locker è stata un esperienza bellissima,stimolante e divertente.Lavorando in un team giovanile con la giusta grinta ed energia,anche le ore con un livello di stress altissimo,si alleggerivano"
good,"Working at a shoe store, mostly what we do, stocks,sell, strive to be the best store in the nation. This is one of my proud moment working at a job. Started out as a sales associate to assistant manager in less than 3 months.  I learned how to be discipline, be productive, hard work, and be responsible."
good,"Learning stock, managing sales floor, managing staff, customer service, audits were tasks that were done daily. I learned a lot about inventory from working at Foot Locker."
good,"A typical day consisted of selling merchandise and keeping up with paperwork, stock, etc. I was a part of management, so we always made sure our employees had a safe and friendly work environment. My co-workers were very hard workers and did their jobs without any problems. The hardest part was sometimes trying to reach daily goals when the store was having a slow day. The most enjoyable part was that we were all like family and that made for enjoyable work hours."
good,"At Footlocker there is never a dull moment. Being able to assist customers in making purchases can range from the easiest thing you've done to being as hard as pulling teeth. Finding a balance in what the customer wants and what your store carries is a difficult task sometimes. However, the extremely inviting atmosphere and my amazing co-workers made the job enjoyable."
good,"Everyday is different, different customers, different needs,  having to adapt to every customer needs, helping them with their purchases."
good,I have been with the company for 7 years now and I have been more than happy with the store staff and most of its management team. This is a great company to work for with the right advancement.
good,"A typical day at Foot Locker is all you would expect it to be - shoes, shoes, and more shoes! I learned that not everyone has the same taste and you need to have patience while waiting for a customer to decide on the perfect style for them. Management here is outstanding. They schedule you weeks that fit your lifestyle, they are very easy going with school hours and the flexibility and organization of scheduling is like no other job. The hardest part, however, is remembering all the shoe numbers and which order the shoes go in. Also, all the styles of boxes that go with each brand! The most enjoyable part of the job is when you have made a customers day-its always nice when they leave the store with a big smile on their face."
good,At this Kids foot locker you don't stay in one spot forever there is always room for improvement.
good,"Every day was a different task, but the goal was to meet store standards and give great customer service. When I was employed there, I had an amazing store manager that trained and guided me in the beginning. The work environment is youthful and friendly. There was few cons while working here, such as large crowds and holiday time, which can be quite the stress. Overall I enjoyed my time there and will truly miss the staff. The community of other shoe stores is a great support when trying to advance yourself with the company."
good,"This company provided a fast-paced work environment with outstanding opportunities to learn how to sell products and enhance customer service skills.  Extremely fun, and relaxing environment.  I was afforded the opportunity in an environment that promoted growth, team building, and a positive work place.  This was one of my first places of employment. The skills obtained at this company have led the way in allowing me to be a positive and productive employee for any place of employment.  The most enjoyable part of the job, was that each day offered new and exciting opportunities to work with the public!"
good,I love this place it was like working but getting paid to do it.
good,we was always busy never a boring moment fun people that we meet everyday
good,"My managers were like friends, people that I could talk to on a personal level. I liked the consideration for my needs when it came to making schedules and wanting/needing time off or to work more."
good,Really enjoyed my time there. Great place to start. Great co-workers.
good,Great place to work for a shoe fanatic. not really an adult job mainly for teenagers. I learned a lot about myself from Footlocker. The hardest part of the job was dealing with different attitudes and personal issues containing co worker. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people everyday and being able to put a smile on their face.
good,"A typical day starts by clocking into the system. I've learned how to handle sarcasm with face to face customer interaction and how to sell better. Management is great, they always encourage you to do better in life and at work to drive sales and for you to be a better person. Co-workers are great too, they all encourage you to do better and are there to help when you need assistance. The hardest part of the job would have to be not being able to perform the job accurately because of low traffic in the store. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customer interaction and the knowledge of knowing what the latest fashions and having the access to it."
good,"Fast paced, high energy environment. Ability to make commission, and advance in company."
good,"Helping all customers in the first priority. Our goal is to make sure the customer buys a product and that they are happy with their purchase. Also hooking up  the customer with more than one item in which that increases our store goal.. "
good,"Working here is awesome. I have an awesome boss and my customers are very cool (with the occasional not-so-cool customer), but it definitely makes you forget that you are even at work! The pay is not great, but if you drive sales, the pay will definitely get better."
good,A typical day at work would be busy most days then others. The  managers were never rude or took there position to serious were they were rude. Always treated others with respect.
good," A typical day at work is counting and sorting merchandise, boxing it up and sending it off to the receiving department to be shipped out. Management was pretty fair and helpful at times by getting on the floor and doing work with us to help get the merchandise out when dealines needed to be met. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new co-workers and racing against each other to see who could pack the most in a certain amount of time. "
good,"A typical day at Foot Locker consists of performing your daily test check (inventory/SKU count of a particualar item), receiving and completing any task that management has for you as well as your assigned job for the day (cashier or sales associate)."
good,"Learned time management, conflict management, and sales tips."
good,Possibilité d'évolution. Equipe et ambiance géniale. Clientèle variée. Très dynamique.
good,"Working at Kids Foot Locker showed me that working at that job wasn't enough. Making sales was the way to make money. Selling your knowledge and giving a great performance everyday to customers who need great customer service. The team members there weren't hard to get along with or work with. They showed me if i come into work ready and willing to give everything i have to make myself into a good sales associate, I wouldn't have much of a problem into making a sales goal everyday. Learning about new sneakers and remembering little facts about each individual sneaker was pretty hard in my opinion, since we received new sneakers every week."
good,Working 8-12 is not enough time to get everything accomplished that I want. I create and distribute multiple reports daily which keeps me busy and make the time fly by fast!
good,Throughout the day at footlocker I would have to say I meet a lot of friendly sometimes humorous people. One of the requirements of working there is to engage with the customers; and learning from that helped me learn that some people feel more comfortable and trustworthy with the employee handling the products they want to purchase. My co-workers i would have to say are very opened and easy to get along with; however the hardest part about working for footlocker is the pay. Since its based on commission its much more work for very little pay. The more knowledge you have with the company the better chances you have to move up within the company.
good,The different suppport you need to play sports as in the shoes . My co-workers are reliable and helpful . I love seeing the customer leaving happy.
good,"operated cashier, handle large amount of cash, customer service, received shipments, kept store clean, supervise employees when manager wasn't present."
good,normale con molto da farsi coi clienti
good,"Helping customers find out the best shoes and sports apparel for them to use while being active. It was great to learn more about each shoe and being able to help customers with a specific need. Everyone got along, a nice friendly environment."
good,Parfait pour progresser dans le monde du commerce.
good,"one of my best fun work i was ever involved in my life this job was strict, fun, and lots of work to do."
good,normally a sales associate has to open up the store with the manager and look up for the daily targets and push the sales. greet customers nicely and attend all customers. Required to manage the stocks and the co-workers.
good,"What I have learn is working my way from bottom to top, and making sure that I show all my leadership skills."
good,"footlocker was very productive and a fast paste work set, but the mangement was very poor. she had rude customer service."
good,Gret place to work as a college student. Sales environment that allows for employees to operate and use own personality. Have no complaints about foot locker.
good,"Only disadvantage is the hours shortage.We work based on budget, if the store does not make a lot of money the employees dont get as much shifts. On the other hand the store dynamic is pop culture friendly. The managers are open minded and do not treat you like their inferiors. You can literally joke around with your managers."
good,A very laid back place of employment. Th work environment is fast paced. It takes someone with a great personality to work with the various customers that come into the store. You must used various skillsets in order to determine how to satisfy the customer needs. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing a customer smile when you were able to fulfill their requests. This is a great place to work!
good,"If you love a busy work day, and love doing sales and helping people, this is the place to go. Keep in mind you are on your feet for long hours a day."
good,Footlocker ad oggi è una delle aziende più competitive al mondo.
good,this was my last job i did not like the place a lot very unorganized and rude managers i do not think i will work here again. bit other then that it was ok
good,"Within the last year I have been employed by several different companies in the Junction City area.  I was terminated from 3 companies due to absences where I was required by the VA to attend. When Footlocker was advised of my medical situation, and having to travel to the Topeka VA, all absences due to VA appointments are excused and not held against me. I was hired on as a seasonal employee. I was given the opportunity to continue employment with the company at the end of the season. Knowing my limitations, and having to take a physical for full-time, Footlocker offered me an alternative position instead of terminating my employment."
good,For someone who like shoes as a part-timer it’s cool as a manager you work long days and hours overall it’s a fun job you meet a lot of fun and outgoing people
good,"Ambiente lavorativo tranquillo, store menager fantastico, sempre Disponibile e pronto ad aiutare il suo team. Porterò con me questa esperienza fantastica che mi ha insegnato molto."
good,Very laid back. There is no dress code. The supervisors are friendly and knowledgeable. The software is old buy easy to maneuver around it. Cons: it can be alittle dramatic ive learned keep to yourself and you will do well.
good,A typical day at work was making sure inventory was organized and checked in from the shipment as well as making sure you had new inventory on the sales floor. I learned how to organize the back room and I learned how to make executive decisions when it came to the customers and their needs. Management cared for their employees and made sure that their schedule met everyone's needs. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep up with every customer when it gets busy during the holiday hours but as long as you are able to multitask then it gets easier.
good,"I really loved this job because I was able to help others on a daily basis, and was able to work as a group to keep the store going and overall loved what I did."

good,I enjoy working with my coworkers because they all have a positive attitude about a lot of things. And when on the job they know how to stay focus and have fun at the same time.
good,One of the best jobs I ever worked. Employees were cool the atmosphere was ok at most time. Upper management was the issue for me(district manager)the Pay was awful for as much work they expected from us. A lot of gossip which would cause a lot of feud almost employees.
good,"I believe we should be payed more due to the fact we do a lot for the company and some"

Being sales driven we had been trained to provide excellent customer service, have a positive attitude, and make memorable moments for customers so that we could have repeat customers."
good,"ottima azienda con la quale ho avuto la possibilita di iniziare e crescere, mi ha dato molto e avrei potuto ottenere molto."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the kids happy about there shoes. A typical work day was helping people find what they was looking for. The hardest part was when we didn't have the product that people were looking for.
good,"I would come into work for a shift and I befriended all my coworkers since they were very easy to get along with and I helped as many customers as possible and I enjoyed helping and interacting with the customers. The workplace culture was amazing since everyone was welcoming and friendly. The hardest part of the job was come to work since I had to bus but now I can drive so that will not be an issue.

good,"I worked at one of the busiest locations they have and constanly saw and talked to hundreds of people a day. I got to understand how different culutres came to view our store, and learned how to best serve them. I learned ways to break the language barrier between us, and find them the product they need."
good,The job is fun. You meet alot of new faces and its easy to Network! Never a dull moment at the Locker! Since I love shoes I have gained more knowledge about sneakers and how they benefit our daily lives.
good,The company is a great place to work with a friendly and welcoming staff. It is fast paced environment with lots of great benefits. Customer service is the major key within the company.
good,"A day at Foot Locker is never the same, where our teams are very diverse, multicultural and very ambitious. Everyone wants to develop themselves while aiding Foot Locker to be the global leader in sports retail. "
good,"I loved the energy and environment, working there was a lot of fun. The discounts are awesome I was able to purchase new releases for my younger siblings and myself. I always recommend this job to young high school and college students because their hours are so flexible, the discounts are great, and the staff is always lively. The only challenge is that there is a sense of competition with the sales, and your customer service skills need to be sharp in order to make sales and earn commission."

good,Love it! Grateful to have the opportunity to be apart of a billion dollar company. The pay could be better but it’s ok when you only need a part time job.
good,"Working at Footlocker as someones first job is honestly a(n) great experience in my opinion. On a regular day you clock in, grab your walkie and get on the floor. There were so many different personalities and You ALWAYS have to be updated on all the shoes or else you wouldn't be able to cope with the different styles all the customers had. I looked at everyday working at Footlocker as a ""Wave"" one minute the store would be almost empty and the next its packed! My favorite part about working at footlocker was the shoes, being able to know when the next release was ahead of time, and being able to learn about other shoes I never really payed any attention to. The hardest part? well the hardest part for me was that I always had trouble finding certain shoes within a timely manner and dealing with angry customers but I always managed which helped me improve myself."
good,Footlocker was an amazing Job. It gave me the opportunity to learn and grow as a individual and become a better sales associate and solidify my love in marketing.
good,"Some days as with any retailer it will be slow and your finding task to do but Footlocker always had a steady flow of work to be done and work that came from the loyal customer. I left for a better opportunity and a more flexible schedule but for the young professional with nothing but free time to dedicated to their careers, footlocker is the job for them."
good,"Fast paced, unpredictable, stressful and sometimes seems like a little bit too much.. however I love my job because it challenges me and makes me step out of my comfort zone as a individual to help other people and deliver customer service. A typical day at work involves talking to customers, getting the shoes the customers ask for, maintaining the cleanliness of the store, etc. I hardest part about the job is keeping up with all the shoes that drop basically. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you do everything correctly and it all culminates and it makes all the struggle worth it."
good,Footlocker est une bonne école pour apprendre la vente pur et dur
good,una empresa donde los compañeros se ayudan uno al otro compañerismo siempre y un habiente agradable
good,"I would start my day by opening the store, and I'm still in the process of training. So, I train and provide customer service throughout the whole day. I'm trained by my store manager and the workplace culture is very diverse. There are many different cultures that are employed at work and there are many cultures that come in to work. The hardest part of the job is there is no hard part.  I love customer service, dealing with money, challenging myself to learn more about what I don't know and learning more in depth about the things that I do know. I mostly enjoy dealing with the customers."
good,Los compañeros y los jefes siempre estaban dispuestos a ayudar y colaborar en las labores de la tienda.
good,Started of in stock room some days was crazier than others depending on how much stock we received. Learned how to be a leader and take on more responsibilities. Management made me want to come to work would get me excited .
good,"la giornata iniziava con la sistemazione negozio e magazzino se arriva merce  Si contribuiva allo shift dell personale di vendita, assistendoli nella ricerca del modello e taglie desiderate dal cliente. "
good,This was one of my favorite job it taught me about the commission pay scale.it taught me a lot about the hustle of sales. i apprentice what was learned
good,Footlocker is a great company and it is an honour to work for them. The managers are friendly and relatable. The head-office managers are wise in who they promote within the company.
good,"Cette entreprise m'a permis de me découvrir un certain don pour la vente et le commerce, que je souhaite maintenant appliqué pour une autre structure"
good,"There is a lot of potential to move up in the company but they want you to live, breathe, eat, and sleep Footlocker. You can make good money but you have to sell sell sell which if your good at then  it wouldnt be a problem."
good,"Working at footlocker was actually a great experience for me, learning to be patient ,helping people accommodate there wants and needs. The associates were great also so it was like working with family."

good,"Footlocker Incorporated was an amazing company to work for, but the hours was very scarce between associates. This was a great place to learn the basics of selling to boost my career."
good,I was trained to make sales and I learned the positions and roles of a sales lead and a manager. I loved the competition and thrill of this job. The best thing about working at this company was being able to interact with different customers.
good,I really love this job because it broke my social anxiety. They really help shape my character. I was scared to be on the floor but once they showed me it was breeze.
good,"From the first day Foot Locker they made it clear that they prioritize the employees first. They understand that most of their employees are students and they are willing to work with class schedules. They also provide training and opportunities for advancement within the company. Within 6 months of being employed I was already on the fast track to being advanced from a part-time sales associate to a full time manager. Sometimes there would be push back if there would be some improvement that would needed if a part-time would bring it up. This could include criticisms of the scheduling, the way the floor was ran, or if certain employees were not doing their job. But eventually the managers would notice the initiative a part-time would be taking and begin to address those concerns."
good,Foot locker company is the perfect way to start your sales career. It's very great at helping you increase your communication skills and engagement with customers.
good,i loved working there & want to work there this summer BUT the only con to actually getting a job at footlocker is actually the waiting process. It really sucks & I don't like how you have to wait a whole month to apply for the job especially if your a returning Employee coming from college trying to make this money & also help the company flourish.
good,"Great first job. Fun environment, lovely employement. If you like shoes you'll like it there.. great way to open up an become better at conversating with people"
good,Footlocker is a great place to work for a first time job. especially for high school students who are looking to get work experience. footlocker allows employees to earn base pay plus commission.
good,I've been employed since I was in high school. The work/life balance here is amazing and the management is amazing. This company is very fun and does a lot for the community.
good,This was my very first real job and I gained a lit of skill frim working here. If you looking to learn about leadership or like gain retail sale experience this definitely for you.
good,"Within my time in the company, I love it not because I love shoes, but because they do offer great work benefits and it is a good hustle. You make your own paycheck because of the commission a regular day in Foot Locker can be real smooth, get to every customer measure a foot here and there and make sure your apparel and shoes on display are neat and presentable. The best part is making a connection with customers and making a memorable experience it always makes me feel good when a customer comes in and says "" I want Gabby to help me because she did so great last time.."""
good,"Footlocker is the ideal dream job, the opportunity is impeccable for growth and the environment is is exquisite and welcoming to the customers upon arrival."
good,"Working at Footlocker is good no matter what position you take. Everyone gets benefits & treated fairly and we treat customers fairly as well too , especially foreigners."
good,"Typical day at footlocker, is going in to work and getting to know customers. The management there is really good and fair towards everyone. The hardest part to the job would be dealing with difficult customers, talking to those who arent fluent in english. The enjoyable part is being there."
good,"a good job for a young person wanting to get into the life of commission. management could use work, overall good experience. not a job you would want to do forever. also a good job if you love sneakers."
good,"Footlocker, although not always busy, had a competitive culture which pushed each of us to sell. Up-selling with accessories was the name of the game, and although competitive, it was a lot of fun! I learned how to better close a sale and how to teach others on how to raise their closing rate as well. During my time with footlocker, I had the privilege of having a manager who also was a mentor. One of the hardest parts of the job was trying to get the customer who wasn't looking to buy, to walk out of the store having bought something. However, knowing that you closed a sale like that was one of the most enjoyable parts of the job!"
good,"I learn a lot, learn the quality of shoes and get customers opinions. Management is great, and always teaching new things. Culture there is diversified equally. Typical day at work. BUSY. Enjoyable part of the day is learning new product, being able to explain to customer if they have questions about it."
good,"The team and management were always positive! I loved working here. One thing that was both beneficial and stressful was the commission based pay. I was able to make over the minimum wage of $7.25 (at the time). However, off seasons were disappointing due to your sales reflecting your overall performance. This job does require you to climb laters and stack boxes very high above your head. This job is perfect for young adults or people who are sneaker enthusiasts. By offering full time and past time positions, Footlocker is able to work with college students on flexible hours."
good,"Six:02 was a nice working environment, its calm nothing to crazy, working in this company helps with customer service, organization, and the mangers are always there to help, and motivate, hardest part of the job is to stay positive sometimes extra time is required from one, also going in while its day time and getting out when its pitch black kind of affects mind set, and mood. But while one works ones always on the move and associate help have a nice time, some mangers are also super positive during slow customer flow times."
good,"Loved working here, the management was fun and communicative with all the employees, customers are always easy to approach and speak with. Salary is good for a student and the overall environment is very fun to be involved in."
good,Typical day is interacting with customers and sharing a smile. Being around the most popular and iconic shoes in street fashion. The culture is high and makes you proud to work here.
good,"Footlocker is a wonderful company to work for. If you love shoes as well as helping people this is the place for you. There's always something new to learn since the technologies used in running, training, and basketball shoes are constantly improving"
good,"I had a great time working at footlocker, I grew a bunch working there I really loved it. I sometimes wonder i'll ever find a place that nice to work at again"
good,I loved working at footlocker it was a challenge because it was something I was new at . And I love to compete and be the best at whatever job i'm doing .
good,"J'ai aimé travailler au sein de cette entreprise , l'équipe est géniale , je me suis intégrer ét jaime le rapport avec les clients"
good,"Great work environment, managers push you but don't pull you in multiple directions. Can laugh and have fun while still making customers feel number one."
good,pay could be better . but i felt it was a great company to be with to advance my career and move in up the company as well . i loved working with customers but the hours and the pay could have been better
good,I would highly recommend working at footlocker. They help work with your schedules so that they are flexible for you. The work is a little challenging at first but you start to get the hang of it.
good,"I had a great experience here, being an assistant manager nand be able to help my team succeed far as my store as well. Making sure customers are taken care of is important. Interacting with kids is the key. Point of sale is to make that commission."
good,Footlocker was a team of passionate people more like a family. co-workers are great and the shifts where also fair. I learned how to up-sale while working here.
good,"I worked here for over a year now and i have no complaints whatsoever. i has been a pleasure to work with everyone there. the management was great, treated everyone the same and made sure everyone felt good about them sleves."
good,environnement professionnel fort agréable et motivant a la progression
good,"Well, I did not know anything about being a sales associate, but my boss had given me an opportunity to learn. He taught me how to sale products, up my sales, talk with customers."
good,"Working at two separate locations, both were very similar."
good,This job was all about working as a team and somewhat working by yourself. Always had to make sure that my customers were always satisfied.
good,"I've had one of the greatest experiences at Footlocker. Its an exciting job and it's definitely what you make it. On a typical work day, it consisted of slight paperwork but more of interacting with different type of people; from small children to adults. Working here, I've definitely learned about business and how a business runs. I learned how important it is to ""drive sales"" because that not only pays the employees but it keeps the busniess running. I had the opportunity to become apart of management and that was fun as well. Learning to work with people with different personalities was very interesting but it was very easy to deal with and manage. The hardest part of my job was delegating. At times, there were things that needed to be done in the store that were required to be done in a timely manner and in a specific way, and with that being said, most of the time I would end up doing those tasks, just to insure that it was being done properly and in a timely manner. The best part of my job was satisfying customers and builing clientele. I've had so many customers that only wanted to shop in the store while I was there. It was a great experience and I would recommend this company to anyone that has a passion for retail and customer service."
good,Its a great job that will work with your schedule! The management all depends on who the manager is but the manage usually changes every 2 years. The customers are nice until back to school or christmas times. Other than that benefits of are good! The pay is decent don't think your going to make more than 30k unless you go in the company. (opinion not fact)
good,"Great leadership qualities with management, outstanding initiative among staff members, always a productive day at work. The company is really flexible when it comes to personal days and other priorities. Safe environment to work in. Great communication skills among staff members."
good,I started with this company as apart time sales associate and worked thru the training program to become a store manager. Foot Locker is the worlds leader in athletic footwear and apparel. The leaders of this company understand that in order for the business to flourish its employees must as well and have continuously provided the tools for the success of the business and the people.
good,"Journée type : heures de travail très variables, les equipes tournent , vous vendez des articles de sport ainsi que quelques vêtements mais principalement des chaussures. "
good,"this job had me very busy throughout the day. i was constantly moving and selling shoes and clothing. i made sure the customers were satisfied with their product before purchasing. i also handled the money and open and closed the store. i enjoyed working here very much, made my days go by very fast."
good,you get to become a family with your employees due to the fact that you get to work with each one numerous amount of times. amazing discount on sneakers especially when its xmas time
good,"This is a great ""first time"" job for anyone still in high school trying to work and go to school. They are very flexible with hours, and you also learn a lot about customer service here as well. The only con of the job is that its commission rate sucks, but as said before if your in high school its very decent money. Overall its a fun and up beat environment and also get good discount on products."
good,The most enjoyable part about the job is. Being able to dress and meet new people.You can learn a lot more about a particular merchandise and or fashion on a typical day at work.Positive attitude develop cool customers.
good,"Azienda seria, ha sempre rispettato i termini contrattuali. "
good,A day at footlocker was helping customers pick the newest shoes that were fashionable for their needs with clothing to match the shoe. Also pushing multiple items on customers such as socks shoe care and insoles.
good,"Footlocker has great work hours, such as the day ending by 9 p.m. Always meeting new people and being able to have a personality to complete sales. I learned the world of being a sales woman. Co- worker had great communication . A typical day at work was pretty fun."
good,"Working for footlocker was a fun experience. I recommend this job for people who are friendly helpful fast paced and knowledgeable about shoes. This job has its benefits of discounts on shoes and clothes. You have to wear uniform but its not that bad because work clothes is better getting dirty then your own and the uniform is really cool . "
good,great job to have if you are in college because this company works well with your school schedule. Also this company treats their employees well when it comes to purchasing shoes for yourself. Most customers already know what they are looking for which makes the job fun and pretty easy
good,"I had the best manager, it was a shame the place shut down. Employees get 30% off, first dips on shoes, several 50% discount days. Easy to move up, Ice co-workers."
good,"Definitely a good job, pay not so good but its a comfortable place to work and clean environment. I would love to work there again."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the opportunity I have had to positively affect my employees lives.
good,Great place to work at. Only bad thing about it is the pay. This is the only thing
good,typical day working here is very good. helping the children and watch them grow is very exciting. I've learned to be very patient with children while working here.
good,"I've been working for Foot Locker since i've been in the 11th grade. The people I have worked with have been really great. From the regular associates to the management. Its like a family. I've worked at 2 different locations, 1 inside of a mall, 1 street side store. Its a huge difference in traffic but its something to adjust to. I can say its not a job for everyone. People always tell me ""you are lucky to work at Foot Locker, I'd love to have that job"". But you have to meet different sales goals every day, every week, every month. "
good,"clock in , count inventory , keeping a clean work play , slaes of sneakers and other sports wear , attending shoppers needs , working resgister making recipes ext."

good,I rocked at it.  I was one of the top sales people (and that at even part time) in the region.
good,"whats not to love about a sports apparel store. customers, team members are all full of energy. thriving work place. I've learned how to easily greet customers into a store where they feel comfortable ask any question that was on their mind. it is a personal requirement to have knowledge on all footwear and apparel in store. customers rarely say no to a great saving on a particular item, so we would ensure to have knowledge of all on-going promotions throughout the company."
good,"A typical day at work was always busy, great company to work for when your looking in management."
good,Everyone in the office is really friendly and relax. We can wear sneakers in the office which is a huge plus.
good,"- Its all bout the customer service."
good,"An excellent company to work for. Co-workers are like family, management team was terrific. What was learned at Kids Footlocker how to work well with customers."
good,need to do better with the work environment i hate it. but selling shoes to customers is the best thing
good,"My co-workers are hard workers, it's never a dull moment. The most enjoyable part of my day is seeing kids leave out with a smile because they got a new pair of shoes."
good,Its alot to learn in this company. You are able to move within the company freely and quickly.
good,Foot Locker was very fast paced. Being ambitious was a very big part in getting the job done right. Your mind set had to be competitive because it was based on commission. I learned that you have to be ambitious to get where you wan to be in life. Set goals for yourself to be successful in life. The best thing about the job was helping people and getting to know who they are and what their needs were.
good,"I enjoyed work the most on weekends,it was always busy and kept us moving. I learned how to communicate better with customers and other employees. Everyone at work was like a family we stuck together and helped each other out when it was needed. Management was great, mangers/supervisors always kept the store and employees in order."
good,"go in check in , make sure everything is in it's place , I learned about team work , interacting with different people manger was great , most enjoyable part was finding out it was the real world I was working in didn't know about much until I was there"

I learned a lot of different things about the customers and sneakers in the store. How to clean the shoes up, how to make each customer satisfied, etc."
good,"Working at foot locker is enjoyable, hard working, and fast pacing job. But you work a little too much to get payed just a little."
good,"If you like fast pace, you will like working at Foot Locker. The benefits were good, the music playing helps the day go by.  The hardest part of the job is selling the shoe cleaner and socks."
good,"it is very steady paced , fun full of laughs place , great to meet new people and learn very great communication skills. the management where i work was very outstanding great people and very understanding, and the co-workers there are all very outgoing and easy to get along with. only time the job got really hard was on holidays you have to multitask a lot and make sure your paying attention to everything around you, but the best part would be just being surrounded by alot of very going and fun people make you actually looking forward to going to work on a daily basis ."
good,A typical day was fun music in the store we had a good vibe going we always mad our sales day it was fun. My co-workers were amazing we always had laughs while handling business. My manager was so busy she fell off some times. The hardest part was merchandise issues not being shipped on time or not enough and not having enough to sale. Best part was being in a field that I loved which was sales and being able to sale shoes and cloths was great.
good,  I was a District Manager for Footlocker from 03/1997 to 06/2001. The company recruited me from Famous Footwear in Sab Jose California. I did not want to be in California. Footlocker offered me a District in Colorado. Footlocker moved my wife and I to Colorado. I worked in Colorado for a year and a half before I was promoted to Washington. Based in Seattle I supervised thirtyone stores in three states. Between the travel in my market and the travel to other markets for support I was traveling too much. My wife and I had just had our first son and I was simply gone too much of the time. We relocated to New Jersey to be closer to my wife's brothers and their children. I did not want to leave Footlocker but it was the right choose for the good of my family.

good,"A typical day at work : Selling shoes to customers, pricing shoes, running stock in the wall, ringing up purchases, putting away clothing."
good,Every call center is about the same. You have your own little cubicle to do your job. Take incoming calls and place orders with customers over the phone. They keep me busy throughout the shift most days.

good,I worked there for 1 year under 2 different managers. Both of my managers were easy to understand. They were clear on how they wanted the store ran and those who exceeded expectation were rewarded.
good,"Excellent hours and room for potential growth. Very energetic staff that were attentive and helpful in training, expertise, etc. Most difficult part of the job would be carrying heavy weight and stamina to work efficiently."

The company has a great training program and a knowledgeable management team to help you succeed. The work environment is fun if you like helping others, working as a team and learning how to run a business. Sometimes the hours are long and the list of things to do are even longer. If you are looking for a fast pace, exciting career, and not scared of a little hard work, Foot Locker is definitely a company you should check out !!!"

good,"A typical day at work, all the associates and managers contained a positive attitude with each other including with he customers.

good,"A typical day at work would include me coming to the store earlier than my shift was supposed to start, getting food from the food court, and changing into my uniform for work. When working, i would have to keep an attentive eye for customers who looked like they were going to buy shoes, and help them out if they required any. I learnt how to manage my time and be as quick as i could be in finding shoes and other items for the customers. The hardest part of the job was keeping memory of the sizes of the shoes for multiple customers, but over time, i got better at it. The easiest part, however, was helping out the customers when they needed it."

Depending on how much you want it and what hard work you are willing to provide is where you will categorize yourself in the business. Focus on the customer and your people.
good,I like working there it’s just boring when it gets slow but the 30%off for employees is what really keeps me there to be honest it’s a fun place and everyday is different
good,"I've really enjoyed my time working for Foot Locker. My job has really helped me progress and grow to point where now I would like to put myself in position for a bigger career opportunity. Over the past 5 years, I've trained and hired over 75 employees, I've had 2 assistant managers get promoted to Store managers, and I've had a lot of individual success at the store manager level. As a store  manager, I take pride in creating a positive, helpful, impactful work place for all of my employees and customers. The hardest part of the job is not always having the necessary resources needed to run my store at an even higher, proficient level. I most enjoy being a leader among my employees, customers, and my other store manager co-workers in the district. I've been in a leadership my whole life and this job just helps me to improve at all areas where I want to perfect."

good,"Can't say enough good things about Foot Locker. I absolutely loved it here. Coming in everyday was a treat. My crew and I were all so close, like family. And we had the chemistry to work efficiently alongside each other. We were all very unselfish when it came to sales. The commission was nice of course, and some people were overly concerned, but a lot of us learned to become selfless and put the team before ourselves individually. That's how we succeeded and made everyday great. There was always competition within store walls, but at the end of the day, it was nothing but love and respect we had for each other. So by this review, of course you can tell that people made a huge difference. But this was my only management role, and leading a team, along with learning from my team was a humbling experience. Will never forget it. But of course, all good things must eventually come to an end."

Another thing I have learned is that a customer is most likely to buy if they try a product on. The hardest part of the job is when traffic picks up and you have to help more then one customer."

I learned a lot about sales, working as team and of course i learned a lot about shoes. Management was great, Footlocker has great leaders. Co-workers were fun, helpful, and they loved their job. Hardest part of the job was trying to sell accessories to customers. Most enjoyable part was talking to customers on a daily basis and getting recognized for all the good work you were doing. All around great company."
good,I worked at Foot Locker as a seasonal employee for the all star games. It was a great experience because i love to learn and Foot Locker had a really supportive learning environment. I also gained additional experience in customer service because Foot Locker finds customer service very important.
good,A typical day at work for me is just walking in and getting to see all the new apparel and stocking everything out back. The most enjoyable parts of the job is that I am friends with a few of the other employees outside of work so it makes the days go faster as well as I am a huge sneakerhead so the job goes hand and hand with me.

We learned engagement techniques as well as product knowledge, and techniques on handling all aspects of retail management; from stock to maximizing sales potential."
good,"ce fut une bonne expérience  en tant qu'étudiant"
good,"This job had its days when it was busy, mostly around holidays. It was my favorite job because It was my chance to be able to interact with customers and instead of them coming for a reason, I would be the person to encourage them to buy more items in the store. I also led the store in highest sales and went from the position of Floor Member to Floor Manager."

The hardest part about my job was nothing. The most enjoyable was just going to my job everyday looking forward to see my coworkers and the newest sneakers."

Management teaches their associated to helpful with sizes and show knowledge offering expert advise. Co-workers work together to cover all needs all customers in-store.

Enjoyed organizing freight and building store visual aids to better store appearance."

good,"this is a cool job straight out of high school, easy to move up, the pay isn't great and since its commission based you have to work your behind off"
good,"My typical day at work was always far from typical. It's always something new to learn with managers willing to teach. I learned how to manage my time correctly, I could get the task done while still having time to spare. My managers were understanding and actually cared if you needed help with anything and they were all willing to answer questions you have. For sales associates its more of a competitive environment due to the fact that they work on commission but w always worked as a team some may even say we worked s a family. The hardest part of the job was clocking out. I loved working there. We had great loyal customers who enjoyed our customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to constantly learn but not feeling the pressure of being quizzed. the customers made my job worth wild and I would love to have the opportunity to work in customer service once again."

Typically it involves getting their desired shoe size from the back, or helping them find the proper size of clothing that they are looking for and them helping them at the checkout.

good,great place. got right to work selling products. as manager trainee I mainly was taught how to train employees.
good,"I loved working here. When I began it was so easy learning about the shoes and other products that we had in the store. Once you are hired you are able to train to become an assistant manager or store manager. I thought that was great. In only a few months I became an assistant manager. I loved the responsibilities of training, opening and closing the store, checking in inventory ect. I had great co works. But my boss even though she was very helpful with getting me my position she took all the credit for my work. If you are completing training modules and if you meet sales quotas (selling shoe care, accessories, and 1 insole a day) you would get footlocker cash. Since I was doing really well with hiring, training, and keeping the store together I was rewarded and my boss ended up taking credit for most of my work when she was never in the store. I would work for almost 2 weeks straight without a day off starting my day at 8:30am - 9:30pm at night. So I really hated when I had to leave but I just couldn't keep getting used anymore."

good,"My typical day at work was very rewarding. Meeting new people, developing a team to defeat the task at hand, and last but certainly not least making the customer happy. We work to enjoy the fruits later. I learned by being the manager you have to know when to be stern and when to be understanding. But to never let being understanding appear as being weak, because people will take advantage of that. This is the hard part, but if handled just right it can run very smoothly. but always respect your employee or fellow co-worker"
good,"First thing in the am, you open the store.Setting up cash registers to start the day. Doing a brief orientation with staff. You get new shipments in all the time. So, you need to add new stock and check stock. You began when the customers  come in. Greeting them with a smile, and a brief hello statement. Completing the sale."

good,I loved the shoe industry. I am currently a sneaker head and knowing about the product was a breeze. I enjoyed checking in new stock and showing off the new merchandise.
good,A typical day at Lady Foot Locker is to sell shoes and make our customers happy at all times.  I have learned that there are many different styles in the world of shoes.

The hardest part about my job is getting customers to buy socks for $9.99 when they know they can go to Walmart and purchase for $4.99. I enjoy the flexibility in my work hours."
good,"Greet customers and ascertain what each customer wants or needs. Open and close cash registers, performing tasks such as counting money, separating charge slips, coupons, and vouchers, balancing cash drawers, and making deposits."
good,"I was the assistant manager of the store so I worked long hours. I learned how to conduct interviews, make schedules, balance inventory and budget the store.

I developed great customer relationships, and all of my co-workers loved me. Laughing and talking with the customers is what I liked most."
good,I've learned how to build my customer service skills at this company. I had a wonderful boss and wonderful co-workers. We knew when it was time to chit at and when it was time to be serious about our job. We always put the customer first. The hardest part would be having to be in the stockroom. It's not hard but its very tedious to put hundreds of boxes in numerical order.

good,"Foot locker has allowed me to grow and learn as I am entering important times in my life as a young adult. Foot Locker has built a basis for me of what Jobs expect and essentially that hard works pays off. Foot Locker has showed me how Days could be tense and challenging but that is the beauty of work, your hard work will determine your performance for that day. The culture of the jobs promotes you to interact and have positive relationships with customers while providing amazing customer service, ensuring you achieve not only your goal but to gain the customers satisfaction with your helpful assistance. The hardest part about my job is handling multiple customers. Not that this is a negative thing, but this brings some challenge to working and also allows me to learn how to balance multiple tasks as well as be more productive under pressure, which i have successfully built in the past year. The most enjoyable part is completing a sale and knowing that you have attended to the customers needs and provided the best customer service you could have."

I would disarm the alarm, and began with printing out the daily printouts writing down who would be working that day counting the money for both register 1 and 2 and also counting the merchandise. With the other manager I worked with we together kept our store in order, meaning with employees and items in our store. My co-workers the employees working under me, in my personally opinion took there job as a joke. They came in late and left early, they also sometimes did not make there day even when my co-worker (my supervisor) set there days very low. The hardest part of my job was telling someone they were fired, but it was only to better the company. I enjoyed moving in between two different stores, only because I felt like I was working my way up to becoming a store manager and having my very own Footlocker store. I have learned with this joy how to manage more than one employee, I also learned how to manage money within a business, and I also learned a lot about the different parts of the human foot."

The ladies have pushed and helped become a great sales associate. They taught me alot about products and how the system works at the store.There is no hard part of the job because my managers or manager on duty are always one question away.

good,"Started with Foot Locker as a store manager where after 8 years of service I was promoted to a district manager in Louisiville Ky. I was also offered the rewarding experience of only 3 District Managers in the US chain to visit several stores in Europe for a month to train the sales teams and help improve sales. I worked with Foot Locker from 1988 until 2004. Foot Locker also believed in recognition. Each year store managers, store manager trainers, district managers and regional vice presidents were awarded as the best in their position. Before I was recruited by Gamestop I was a Regional Vice President in training. Hind sight is 20/20 because several of my store mangers that worked for me and I trained for their promotion to District managers went onto become regional vice presidents with Foot Locker. The siging bonus and numurous other offers Gamestop offered me I decided to accept. At the time the company was growing so quickly I felt I would certainly become a regional director. I also enjoyed working with the store managers and their staffs as well as the customers. I managed 28 stores while I was a district manager for Foot Locker. I believe now that Foot Locker was more likely to promote from within where Gamestop often hired external candidates to fill positions that I felt many of the exsisiting district managers and / or store managers should have had a chance at."
