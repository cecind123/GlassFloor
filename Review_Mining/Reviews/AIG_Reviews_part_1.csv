rating,review
bad,This is not relevant to my resume .Therefore I am  not answering this question. I do not work here any longer .The division went out of business a few months after I started working there
bad,"Hated the place. They had these random stand up things whereby you had to say what you were aiming to do that day, then again another before you left, on what was achieved. You had to rate your mood too - happy, sad etc & say why you felt that way! Such a strange place."
bad,"This was by far the WORST place I ever worked. The management in my department was awful. Just a few months after I left the company cut about two-thirds of the people. I worked at a branch office and the culture there was not white collar at all, they treated people like they were on a manufacturing line. They only cared about production and not the person at all."
bad,"Revolving new management every year led to:"
bad,"I enjoyed working with my co workers and the clients. Team work is very necessary at any office environment. Our office in Hickory were a great family/team, we always supported each other."
bad,"Management and training is horrible. Company moral absolutely no existent. The moment you start you will want to resign. Its not worth the money. At least in Travel Guard Department. There are many divisions in AIG so I cant speak for all departments but as far as travel insurance. Travel Guard is the worst department to work in. No organization, no structure.  EVERYONE THERE IS MISERABLE AND its contagious. Working there will cause you to have strokes or heart attacks its a proven fact."
bad,"Not a lot of positives about this company right now.  Lots of lay offs, no clear communication to the field on the direction of the company.  Executives are getting huge salaries, while the worker bees scrap by.  The work culture is very stressful and pretty toxic right now.  I would not recommend working for this company."
bad,"I had to learn quickly at this new position, since there is no training to they teach you to figure it out yourself quickly and survive.  This job had taught me a lot."
bad,"Will not recommend"
bad,"Employees don't care about their job. The job is just scamming people out of their money. It is an insurance company, what else do you expect out of this kind of thing?"
bad,long hours ; even asked to comein at 8 and leave after 6. no work life balance or flexibility; no progression map or appraisals.  people paid different salaries varied  from 35k to 110k doing literally the same job.
bad,"It's not what you know, how well you know it, how much value you  bring, but its about who brought you in.   Never seen nepotism run so rampant.   This is why this company is such a epic failure.  Middle and upper management are all in the same club. Managers will never admit they are the problems, rather they will shoot down lower level hard workers and keep their job security than to make sure the company runs profitably.   You have been warned, do not work here!"
bad,Very long hours. Very poor systems. Poor direction from management. Poor collaboration among workers. Lots of relatives work throughout the company - political more than skill based decisions. 10 years never got a raise. Management seems very well aware of all the issues but indifferent to making any changes.
bad,The hardest part of the job was management and dealing with co-workers. I learned that co-workers were back-stabbers and wanted to keep all information to themselves for job security.
bad,"AIG is known all over US, South America and Asia, currently the leading Insurance company in the United States and best employer of the year, Surprisingly recognized by more than 50 countries all over the  world. Working with  internationally acclaimed company is both fun and enjoyable but with big responsibility in a sence that we need to be careful, efficient and trustworthy for the protection of our company and maintaning the top position. Over all it's not easy but the company make sure that you will be compensated rightfully, treated fairly and lived a balanced workplace and personal life."
bad,"There were very limited agile concepts followed by the team.  There was no communication to the other departments that an agile team had been created and some of the other department's processes may have to change to accommodate releasing software every 2 weeks.  The atmosphere then became a ""scrummer fall"" type of culture we were a scrum team following waterfall processes and the executive management team refused to change."
bad,"Very poor management carrot and stick approach to managing advisors, poor compensation. Lack of opportunities for advancement. The district manager needs to retire and let someone who really knows how to grow a team take over. Bad job choice."
bad,"The best part was working from home, so many at the office didn't do their job and was pushed off on our team then not to mention we had no room for advancement. This was a deadend job."
bad,"•	Accountable for the divisional profit and loss for all lines of coverage including general liability, auto liability, workers’ compensation, and various professional liability programs."
bad,"Pay could easily have been much better as I discovered that AIG was billing me out to an agency at $100/hour, while the agency paid me only $37.50/hr."
bad,"You have the wrong ""AIG"". this is not the company that I worked for. The company I worked for was a property investment holdings company. This is an error on your part and apparently I cannot proceed with out writing this."
bad,"It is all about working on the phones, taking calls as quickly as you can.  They want you off before the 12 minute mark and if you are not they are messaging you to find out what is going on.  You learn alot, but do not expect to move up and if you are not well liked you go no where. They also do not like to give you time off and micro manage."
bad,extremely poor management.  No teamwork everyone seemed to be cut throat and out for themselves.  Not open to suggestions or any type of streamlining to enhance productivity.
bad,"I got ill during my employment at AIG, so I had to use short term leave of absence.  When I came back after four weeks they had taken my desk and my funds away. I sat alone in a conference room and filed.  Everyday I came in something more was taken from me.  One day the computer, next day the phone, it was becoming clear they wanted me to quit, because of my illness.  After a few weeks, I literally was in an empty room with just a couple files.  They broke me and I resigned."
bad,"Very bad management, stressful.unfair treatment. partiality of some. waste vendors do not recocommend to join this company at all. unless those vendors are removed."
bad,"Senior co-workers who have been there 20 years etc. etc. They just want you to shut up and do what they say, no thought involved.Directors were tasked with projects that they didn't know how to direct. Somebody has to be accountable for this, and it won't be them!"
bad,"Esta empresa hace contratos eternos por ett, sumamente inestable. Lo que conlleva no tener descansos ni días libres por tiempo ilimitado, incluso años. Ascienden al personal por ser añejo o pariente, provocando que no sepan como solucionar o gestionar las labores con continuas ordenes contradictorias. No hay nada peor que darle poder a un incompetente, que ademas se lo lleva al plano personal, haciendo de su trabajo una batalla de acoso y derribo contra el empleado, hasta que con una palabra suya,consiguen echarlo, sin previo aviso, llamando a última hora de la tarde para avisarte de que al día siguiente no vuelvas, e impidiéndote el acceso, ni si quiera para recoger tus cosas. En esta empresa se llega a niveles de exigencia absurdos, impidiendo al empleado incluso ir al aseo cuando es necesario, cuando las coordinadoras se pasean por los pasillos con las manos en los bolsillos gritando a las espaldas que cojamos mas llamadas. Cómo quiere coger la gestión de mas servicios invitan a otras empresas a hacer visitas para que vean como se gestiona el trabajo, las cuales están falseadas e incluso le dan al empleado un guión de ante mano preparado para que no se diga la verdad. Por no hablar del sueldo, que lo ajustan al mínimo interprofesional para no se ilegal por cuarenta horas a la semana."
bad,"management was terrible"
bad,I did not work at AIG. It was the company that bought my business in 2005. They were great to work with in the transfer of ownership. That is all I know about them
bad,"You'll receive little to no training, will be expected to meet expectations that are unattainable due to the lack of training and will be written up for not doing your job correctly.  Forget about going to management for anything because you will be classified as a trouble maker.  Management does nothing to correct employees who won't work and expects those who do work to pull the slack.  "
bad,not a great place to work did not  like the  management they were rude and not helpful with questions no room out of sales department could not move out of sales
bad,No promotions are granted because of educational background.  The job is who you know and friendship is essential.   The turnover rate is very high because the pay is very low.   The management team are  not experience to handle business.
bad,"This organization has changed so much over the years so my comments here will not apply to all, my old department has been laid-off.  I did enjoy the welcome when I first started."
bad,"Worked in a back office support capacity, never felt welcomed, no culture to embrace.  extremely high pressure environment, little to no support from management."
bad,Currently the company is experiencing numerous layoffs so I would not recommend applying since there is no guarantee as to how long your position would be needed.
bad,"I was wrongfully terminated for following the directions of a manager who instructed me to alter dates on a spreadsheet for audit last week. At this time, I do not have any positive feedback for the company due to the situation I was put in which caused me to lose my job of 19 years and the reason was CERTAINLY not my job performance nor production numbers."
bad,My department has anywhere from 3-10 times the amount of claims as other departments.  Upper management refuses to properly staff our office and just work people until they burn out and leave.
bad,"This was the worst job I have ever had. The leaders in this company could not agree on anything and it took them away from work to seek way to counter one another,  I do not recommend this company to anyone."
bad,rude co workers... rude managers... EVERY ONE was just rude even the trainers that train you were rude. glad i do not work there anymore. goodluck to the ones who do get the job earlier
bad,"Senior management is horrible and does no care about their employees.  They have no interest in retaining talent."
bad,"At the time of employment - commission based sales without benefit of renewal commission paid, mismanagement of departments, massive layoffs due to market crash 2008"
bad,"Could be a great company but it fails.  Different departments doing the same work in different fashions,  why not stream line and handle calls, disbursements and other transaction the say way among all department.  AIG does not value it's employees."
bad,"Very political , high turnover, employee gets burned. there's not too much advancement. stay there not long, can't comment on too much. Can this sight not force people to write review ?"
bad,"I was hired along with two other people for one position. I contacted HR a number of times with no response.  Funny thing, they continued to pay me until I left, which was low but I didn't do anything."
bad,"Company no longer in operates in Atlanta, GA or working under this name.  See 21st Century Insurance company - company was ""re-branded""."
bad,"Mangement very poor."
bad,"I would not recommend working for AIG what so ever. This place is going down hill fast.  The management is a joke. I work in the Houston office and the management over L&C, and New Business have no clue what they are doing.  You cannot ask them for help on your calls because they have no idea anything about what the department does. They have no backbone to stand up for us and try to get us the systems we need and the so called ""goals"" set for us to meet out requirements for bonuses are unobtainable.  Our call volume does not allow us on any given day to meet the ""goal"" that is set of 70 calls/day per person.  The Manager refuses escalations, is unavailable more than half the time, leaves early, gets here late, and when she is here she doesn't return calls that have been escalated to her in the first place. We constantly get agents calling us back complaining about how she was supposed to call them back a week ago and never did. They want to micro-manage but are not worried about giving us the proper tools to accomplish what they are micro-managing. The Director is just as clueless as the Manager. And so is the site director.  Forget customer service, it is about the numbers. Everything is becoming outsourced to save a dime, but is in turn ruining the company. The pay is a joke, and there are no raises, so as the cost of living goes up we are stuck making crummy wages."
bad,This company is outsourcing my department and getting rid  of  alot of people some thats beem with the company for over 22 yrs
bad,"Do not waste your time and go there. The company is going through major lay-offs and their audit department has been impacted.  I was one of the many that were laid off.  It is a cut-throat type of environment, managemet likes to blame staff for their lack of managing their teams, and no work and life balance.  They are very quiet about letting people go since they do a surprise type of lay-off. I have worked for this company for a long time and it has changed for the worse. Don't waste your time, you will be disappointed."
bad,"Leuke werk omgeving leuk personeel veel geleerd,"
bad,"all work, no respect. it was simply a job, not a career. Long hours, lots of work (which was sometimes gratifying). no talent development available."
bad,"Making decisions on applications for writing personal insurance for high net worth client. Works closely with brokers and agents to ensure clients have appropriate coverage in place. We work as a team and bounce ideas off of each other all day long. The hardest part of the job is getting people to understand that insurance is a commodity and that there are times where we have to take action on an account or increase rates. "
bad,A typical work day was busy.  Manager was great and encouraged promoting within.  Manager also encouraged and approved education and tuition reimbursement.
bad,"Highly political company.  Heavy red tape inolved in internal processes. Motivations based on he said she said mess instead of actual information.  Very Crony, this company promotes from within.  It promotes based on management likes instead of qualifications.  Some ideas not liked or proceed based on who said them.  No minorities in management."
bad,"My immediate manager was fabulous.  The managers on up the food chain seemed to be all about politics.  I came from another insurance company and was told I would make double, but the pay was no where near what I was told and much less than I was previously making."
bad,They cared about no one. If you were late they docked your pay by an hour.
bad,"I worked in the Facilities Department and had a great work experience that helped me to develop my skills, however was faced with challenges when trying to advance.  Very shady and unethical business practices within the group.  No integrity existed - hence their collapse"
bad,"Manager's are snubs & extremely rude."
bad,My experience with the company has been a challenge for advancement. Little to no diversity. Very little room for growth change or advancement. I was not told that we were able to obtain pay increases for receiving the government bailout. You are penalizes for presenting ideas or if you questions ratings for end of the year reviews. When ask how can we help the company save money I suggested using technology vs travel. work from home. Ideas were shot down.The plus is the company offer a pension but of course not guarantee.
bad,"A typical day at work would be processing annuity checks from 3 different lockbox drops and ensuring all checks that were in good order were processed same day. Processing items in ""Not in good order queues and personal queues. Responding to various emails and voicemails. Researching various work items to bring into good order. Ensuring the lockbox was balanced."
bad,"Wouldn’t recommend .. not good for emotional stability, company does not look out for employees.. most managers are stressed out mentally and emotionally.  Hard to plan for a vacation. Do not apply for a call center position."
bad,"Poor culture, abusive supervisors and childlike behavior from peers and managers   No sense of stability or job security   Gossip and game playing  horrible atmosphere"
bad,Management lacks professionalism. Advises not micro managing but clearly that is the case. It is sad that a department has over 200% in turnover and it is not addressed. Miserable place to spend the majority of your waking hours. The work is not hard but working becomes unbearable when you are constantly attacked by first level managers and no help is available.
bad,"expectation to work extremely long hours (12-14 hours a day) with no breaks and often on weekends. no reasonable way to maintain work/life balance and not much empathy from management regarding ""family life"""
bad,"RUN dont walk away from this company, they have MASSIVE layofffs with little warning. Severance packages are good but that's the ONLY positive with this company"
bad,"Unorganized and unprofessional environment "
bad,"I worked 80 hour weeks for these guys and when bonus time came around, if you're not part of the ""good ol boys"" network back east, you'll get a big goose egg."
bad,"Management absolutely clueless.  Claims were never paid on time, if at all.  Once it was known office would be closing due to downsizing, nothing got done.  Everything stopped."
bad,"Overcrowded. Zero management abilities. No help from others. Everyone to fearful of their own longevity"
bad,Run away from this company. I worked there 10 years and was laid off. We saw it coming 70 of us gone. No raise in years. Nice system installed if you went to bathroom you had to put yourself on break because manager gets a red flag if your computer is idle 5 minutes. Good severance package.
bad,"The Management team over the new business, customer care, licensing & commissions department is the absolute worse! There's high expectations yet nobody (CSRs) has all of the proper tools/training to do the job ""efficiently & effectively,"" as management calls it. Access to the systems that were provided, was not given until the end of training. Callers are constantly escalating & demanding managers to speak to but guess what? The managers & site director Lisa can't assist, they have no clue on how to do the job! Talk about having people with titles just there to collect a check! Keep in mind, these are the same individuals that determine how much of the annual bonus that is offered. There is no opportunity for growth because they find a way to block you from other positions. There's no resources available and the managers never answer questions. It's ridiculous that escalations are passed to the manager & the manager will ask another rep to call the caller back to fix the issue! Beware when getting accepted into one of the positions above."
bad,Worst place I have ever worked......Treated like a little child. Watched constantly for even talking to your peers. If you get up from your chair to talk to someone you are reprimanded. This place is a sweat shop.......It's like a maze of people all around you in little cubicles. Dirty environment. 4 small bathroom stalls for at least 75 to 100 women. Disgusting...Managers are incompetent and are still there because they know someone or related to someone in the company. Daily stress is terrible. Constantly being told you have to bring up your production or you will go on probation. Very stressful. Would not recommend this company to anyone I know and have not done so......
bad,"if you looking for good career advance don't look job in AIG,"
bad,"Berkeley Heights Loss Sensitive group had a very weak management team. Young kids with huge egos ran the place. Competent managers who worked hard,were smart and who treated people with respect got trampled on. My VP took naps every day and stayed awake just long enough to muckup work of staff or hand out pink slips. The Operation is truely shameful."
bad,"Unreasonable case load, ill defined expectations, emotionally and verbally abusive management at the branch level."
bad,This company has no regard for their employees. Discriminatory practices are prevelant through out the company. They are not a diverse culture. The work force is made up of people that are not professional and respectable. It’s the old insurance man mentality. They do not educate or provide budget to get people up to date on industry practices. They fire anyone who is progressive or a woman. Orientation is a joke. They listen to Wall Street as they follow the money and don’t give their insureds proper pricing and service. Underwriters run the company and the rest of the workforce is not respected. It’s disappointing as they have the means to lead and be a better citizen in the industry. Go work for other insurance houses not here. They don’t deserve sophisticated talent.
bad,The only good thing about working for this company was the benefits. Management did a horrible horrible job. A lot of favoritism with management and horrible communication skills between management employee and hr.
bad,"Too much turmoil within company. Hemorrhaging losses, I don’t think they learned any lessons from the 2008 financial  fiasco the economy experienced. A lot of inefficient decision making within the organization"
bad,"i have been there for almost 5 years and it is like a prison. The management is terrible. They don't like to give raises, but they continue to give you more work."
bad,If you want to work in the mill of insurance companies choose AIG. I felt like I had to take a shower when I'd come home from work. I was routinely asked to do things against insurance regulations.
bad,Work life balance in American International Group is good and 90% of the crowd working in Bangalore is of energetic age group which is an added benefit for new learnings and implementation
bad,"As an account engineer doing account reviews, the replacement work software (GRASP) often required four to five times as long to accomplish account reviews. Little consideration was given by management for the increased burden in establishing work loads and due dates created by this software."
bad,"This job was way to stressful, morale was very very low, they did nothing to raise it. No acknowledgement of work well done. Although I had a good manager, not all were"
bad,"How you feel about AIG is going to vary severely from person to person, depending on what operation you work for, where in the world you are located, and who is in charge at the time."
bad,"The management after 2008 began a race to save the company.  Unfortunately, the company decided the best way to save money was through forced attritions.  They never stopped.  No new hires have been allowed, if a consultant could be hired to perform the work.  This meant that institutional knowledge required to maintain business is now in the hands of contractors."
bad,Only focused on the bottom dollar regardless of what needs to be done to get there. Hardest part of the job was constantly looking for ways to reduce headcount or outsource jobs to other countries.
bad,"Overall the team-culture in the office is quite enjoyable but there is a distinct lack of support here and a very high level of turnover of staff."
bad,Coming into a data migration scenario there was rather frustrating because the testing team did not communicate to the iso builders and  the department I worked in was expected to make things work with their proprietary software.
bad,My standards were way above the standards that this company requires their agents to be held to.  I did not feel that I could continue to work for this company and save my dignity and integrity.
bad,"They are currently hiring for a position at the Corporate Sec that will be outsourced within 6 months, but they won't tell you that. '"
bad,Corporate culture is counter productive to accomplishing day to day goals. The flag of critical is waved too on objectives making completion of goals difficult. 
bad,"Nothing personal, just not interested in working in financial institutions."
bad,Too many promises without rewards. It is clearly who you know and just how far you are willing to stretch the truth to get ahead. There have been several series of downsizing in the Farmington office; just outsourced the call center to the Philippines before Christmas this year. Weak leadership and inconsistencies across all aspects of this office make if a very difficult place to work.
bad,Vast differences in flexible working and treatment of employees across the organisation. Managers focus on own career ambitions/goals and people are routinely employed due to who they know rather than experience. It really depends on what part of the organisation you work for.
bad,"AIG Life in Reigate used to be a great place to work, but changes in structure and management this year have turned it into a very bad place to work. Staff moral is low, there are not enough staff (they keep leaving) and long hours are expected. They have removed some good people, more are working notice periods and everyone you talk to is looking to leave."
bad,"No progression no money no support, very stressful and very poor management. Nobody is happy. People are leaving one after another. Micro management in some teams."
bad,"not much more to say.  Firm has a long way to go.  the low interest rate environment is a real problem as well.  Overall poor management, poor culture, poor performance."
bad,"Skills and work ethics are secondary; One needs to know someone at management level to grow. We cannot blame the AIG, but the people. Despite working longer hours and getting above and beyond rating never had any opportunity to grow."
bad,"This company l lacks innovation, technology, pay raises,  qualified management, ability to train properly, ability to inspire, and ability to properly quality the work produced. Morale is Horrible. They are constantly firing people. No job security, no appreciation, and add work responsibilities and expectations without adding more pay. They package looks great from the outside. Don't believe the hype. The only thing that keeps anyone there is the time off. Health insurance will leave you with thousands of dollars in medical bills. 401k does not grow fast enough. People are promoted to positions they are not qualified to perform with very little training. Training department lacks innovation and ability to train properly for any position. Systems never work properly. The IT department fixes one issue and creates ten other issues with updates. This place is ridiculous and will never keep anyone truly qualified."
bad,"The expectations were to work as many hours as you had to work to handle the job.  Technology is big here as is automation and there is little to no support of the Underwriters.  Long days, weekend work was needed; no incentives for extra work."
bad,"There is a constant barrage of reorganizations do to poor financial performance.  In general communication among both departments and locations is poor. There is a fair amount of racism and sexism.  Yes, the company pays well, but this means having to deal with many problems which hurt AIG as a corporation."
bad,"pushed for more production. little to no appreciation. they do not care about there employees. raises are beyond rare. no matter how hard you worked, you were excepted to work more. yearly lay offs"
bad,people are ok.  advancement opportunities are limited to protected classes.  severence is phenominal but it has to be because the announcement of your RiF (reduction in force) is non-professional
bad,"Poor management of the division I worked for, out of Wilton CT office.  No direction, and hired workers to prepare CCAR reports, then once reports created, wholesale fired nearly entire staff.  This company is a pariah,  and should not have been bailed out.  They are as careless and shameless as a company can be."
bad,"My work experience at AIG, to date, was my worst working experience ever. I gave up stable income to relocate to, and promised to be trained thoroughly because I was newly licensed and new to the industry. In addition, the office closed four months after I was hired."
bad,"It was the most disappointing experience at least from my view."
bad,"Lacked clear vision."
bad,This job is all about meeting quotas and the constant monitoring by supervisors shows a complete lack of trust in the individual to perform the job they were trained to perform.
bad,"projeto mau planejado, gerencia despreparada para trabalhar com pessoas"
bad,Have to apply for and receive new position to get higher pay. No raises. Pay rate is decent. Office is brand new and nice. yearly bonuses are based off the companies earnings the year before.
bad,"AIG is a toxic workplace. Most of their best talent has left and the ones who remain are woefully out of their depth. "
bad,Hired for a long term along with 60 people. All 60 people were fired upon completion of a strategic project. Low integrity by leadership as they knew the team was not permanent.
bad,"Worked In legal department. Heavy volume with"
bad,Avoid if possible as the company is reducing headcount and letting people go every few weeks.  Outsourcing is occurring for various groups.  This company is now only a shadow of its former self.
bad,Work with various tasks and work very hard. Sometimes not apprecticed for successfully completing task that require more than one person to finish on time.
bad,"AIG is a nightmare. The company is the most poorly managed organization I ever worked for. The culture is toxic. No one shares information outside of their friends. There is no mutual support, cooperation or collaboration. "
bad,"The work I did was very interesting. I was trained on several different jobs. You got to work from home two days a week. "
bad,"Loved the job at first but was never given a full job description for my position. Never received clear guidance on what to do.  Very poor management and clear discrimination against employees over fifty. AIG does not care about their worker bees, just about the dollar and appearance of being family oriented and customer friendly.  All I can say is, be sure and cover your butt if you work for them."
bad,I worked here for two months. The first month you take a training to learn the computer system that's used. After that I held down an empty desk for 8 hours a day and did absolutely nothing. I was never assigned a department or a supervisor. I got tired of sitting around and being bored out of my mind.
bad,"Working here, I will say they have really great benefits but the pay will make you not want to stay for the amount of work you are doing on the phones. You also can’t move up in the company unless you know people."
bad,"I was initially hired as a financial advisor that would receive certification during the training program.  Subsequently I found out that I was the first person in the district that was hired and successfully completed the program.  AIG was not equipped to train, coach or promote for the job that I was hired to do."
bad,"Not a great place to work. Corporate to the point of mediocrity. Weak and incompetent middle management. You come in, feel your brain leak out of your ears for 8.5 hours, and go home taking all your day's stress of unfulfillment with you."
bad,This is not a good company to work for.  They have been losing money for the last 10 years.  They are not willing to invest in technology to be competitive and have a dozen or so lay-offs throughout the year.  Senior Executives have no clue what is going on with their teams and are completely disconnected.  They are making decisions looking at spreadsheets.
bad,"One of, if not the biggest insurance companies in the world, and thet start you at $12 an hour. Benefits are amazing, but you have to work overtime just to offset the deductions from your check. Management is horrible, no communication between departments, no communication between supervisors and their employees. They preach about focusing on customer service, but that is a lie. It's all about hitting your points on the qa sheet. I know workers who are 100% in quality, but sound so monotone or are rude, but they hit the qa marks, so it's a good call. That's not customer service. They will tell you one thing and stab you in the back if you aren't one of their drones. If you want a highly stressful, low paying, frustrating job where you get yelled at by customers and management on a daily basis, this is the job for you"
bad,"Very poor at training new employees. Manager was located in Chicago and did not have a defined training program for me in the Cleveland office. Another employee tried to train me, but she was already busy with her own job."
bad,"The only constant there was change. Each Executive that comes in, brings his/hers own people and let's go those brought in by the previous team. It has become a very toxic environment. Letting people go to meet expense reductions in order to pay the hefty salaries of those Executives coming in."
bad,"I had no idea what I was getting into. Very slow paced, unproductive and inactive in the Claims department(s). Extremely uninspiring as I hear managers talk about ""time off"" and ""working from home"" on a daily basis. No engagement in the work and un-collaborative. I would not recommend working here if you are at all career minded."
bad,"Terrible culture, totally disorganized, zero leadership. Everyone worried they'll be let go at any time. Any worthwhile leader is quickly weeded out by the bad apples. Most of the good talent was let go after 2008 meltdown."
bad,"Very terrible place to work with cut throat senior management. If the leadership has no clarity on their future and direction, how can the other employees have any clarity. Totally directionless senior management"
bad,"This was the worst company I've ever worked for. Politics run the place, outsiders are discriminated against, and mediocrity is rewarded. Years of management changes have left the company bereft of expertise and management."
bad,"Poor management, Not very helpful with providing opportunities of advancement or growth. Very ""selective"" with who they choose to give opportunities to. High turnover rate."
bad,It is not a good place to be anymore.  They continue to lay off all the time.  People do not want to attend meetings with their managers because that may well be their notice of termination.
bad,"The culture is very corroborative and abusive. Freshers are treated badly and experienced professionals are denigrated daily.  "
bad,"Work place isn't very pleasant, hours are long and most employees are not very helpful. They don't help achieve goals in work place and put you under a lot of pressure."
bad,Every thing was bad but finding out your laid off from the security guard after having a day of PTO instead of HR or a direct manager is what makes it awful.
bad,"That was the most horrible place ive worked at as far as management"
bad,Noone that works in call center is happy. They have strictly timed calls so taking care of the customer is on a timed basis. Most people need more than 7 minutes for you to explain something to them
bad,"Hated this place, do not work here. Management sucks and the culture sucks. They are liars and do not do anything they say they are going to do."
bad,"I was super excited when I got this job.  The training was fun."
bad,it was ok.. the benefits were ok..a typical day was answering phones
bad,Not the working environment I need in my life. I didn't enjoy this experience at all really. It did help me pay my bills so I'm grateful for that. I luckily found I new job after a couple of miserable months of being there.
bad,"Micromanagement at it's worst. Favoritism and back stabbing. If you are new, they'll set you up for failure pretending that you can ask anyone at anytime for help which simply isn't true. In the end they blame you for all the mistakes and not raising your hand, if something is wrong. The complete management downright sucks - nothing but buttkissing clowns. The atmosphere is toxic and highly racist. The whole department needs to be shut down - the seasoned employees are tired of being there and the new ones don't want to be there the only one who are loving their own presence is the management."
bad,"I was hired for a 3-6 month temp to perm underwriting position to work remotely. Was flown to Nashville, TN to attend 2 weeks training. Training went well. Once I got home constant system crashes. VPN dropping constantly. Offline 1-2 hours a day due to system issues. The most antiquated systems and technology I’ve ever seen. "
bad,"Do not apply for customer service representative in retirement. Horrible, nothing is what it seems all smoke screen, training is a waste of time......"
bad,Maybe a good start for a college student. Not for a family. there is a lot of Nepotism. Hard workers are not rewarded or given credulity. When I worked there no merit increase for 3 years.
bad,"The old American General, or AGLA, was a venerable and well respected life insurance carrier with over 100 years of experience and goodwill.  It took AIG less than two years to completely crater the company, destroy the reputation, imperil the policyholders, and ultimately put over 1500 people out of work.  From 2013 until it's demise in January 2016, the AIG Financial Network (read old American General) was dishonest, enriched the futures and pockets of a precious few imports from a rival company, broke promises, told outright lies to both colleagues and clients, and disgraced themselves.  AIG has no business existing; it will be a good day when they are sold for their components and the name disappears"
bad,"AIG has pretty good benefits and compensation but there is no job security. Currently, positions are being sent outside the US and people that have been there for many years and probably should be let go are getting promoted."
bad,"There's no vision or mission for the business"
bad,"Boring and restrictive.  Could have been a great place to work if they let you be a financial; advisor.  You were forced to service hundred of accounts, but you had no relationship with these people and you didn't get paid for service."
bad,"AIG is a terrific company, but if you’re looking at a job in a satellite office, investigate carefully.  Reno in particular is a horrible place to work.  Snarky, gossipy, multiple complaints against managers that are ignored.  No true supervision means a good corporate culture may not exist in these small offices."
bad,Terrible work environment with 70-80 hour weeks and no possibility of having any personal time. You would be lucky if you are home by 2am on Sunday and unlucky (which is the most probable scenario) if you have a useless planning meeting after that on Monday at 9am. Management denies it's employees any life outside of work.
bad,"I worked in the Houston, TX call center for 2 1/2 years and if you're looking to work here RUN and run fast once you get hired on as a customer service rep it is darn near impossible to advance in your career because the Director Lisa Lau and management try their hardest to block you from going anywhere else that you have no other option but to quit because quite frankly who wants to be answering inbound calls all their life and lets not talk about WORKFORCE management here or trying to take online courses to better yourself even if the company promotes it the call center managers and current director will try and block you from going to company classes and seminars.  The benefits was great I can say that but the salary $30K a year for all the work you do is not worth it."
bad,"The management and promotions were hand picked. It was a case of who you knew and not what you know. 2 of my 4 person group left after 10 months based on poor management."
bad,"But a terrible environment, mostly because one day we had a massive lay off - over 600 people were fired and let go on a conference call.  It was the worst experience of my life."
bad,"I was very excited to work for AIG at first but then noticed that management ONLY worried about increasing my work load and deadlines without a pay raise the entire 7years I worked there!  "
bad,I was very disappointed to work there.  It is a very slow paced environment.  A lot of politics and it takes a while till something is done.  I wouldn't want to work there ever.
bad,"I remember bailing this company out in 2008 as the world economy tanked, in part due to the unethical business practices of AIG."
bad,"Management has no clue and you are just a number to them. They would bring in outside trainers, so you were lucky if your direct manager knew what your day to day job was. Outsourcing a ton of their business overseas."
bad,Enjoy working for AIG for 16 years.  I was promoted three times during my 16-year career at AIG.  Each new assignment challenged my management and technical skills.
bad,"The bail out. Enough said.  Aig paid very little, like a lot of companies in atlanta area, but they paid even less that standard.  This was my first job out of college, and I learned a lot."
bad,No comment.  Great company bad management.  Good ol' boy system.  No room for creativity or POC in upper management.  Pretty cut throat political environment.
bad,"The job was good. I actually LIKED the job in an of itself.  But MANAGEMENT was HORRIBLE.  PTO was good and benefits were day one. More pay is needed. "
bad,"What kind of a company lays people off just before Christmas? One that cares nothing about its employee. It used to feel like a family, not anymore. Upper management has gone downhill."
bad,Leadership is confused. There is a lot of uncertainty except for people that are part of the coteries. There is no team spirit or loyalty to the company. Sorry workplace.
bad,"I started this job April of last year and it has been awful.  This is the work job experience I have ever had in my 30 years of working.  They hired me and have nothing for me to do.  I work for a newly formed group and they had no plans for my position.  They have been giving me busy work, administrative stuff to do that I was not hired for.  Thought this would be my dream job and it has been a nightmare since the beginning."
bad,"There are several positions within this company however I would only suggest if you are looking to work in marketing or sales. Benefits are great but the compensation, training and morale is lacking in this corporation."
bad,"The company is at-least 20 to 25 years behind the industry standards. A company of this mass will take longer time to recover from technology dept. So think twice before taking up an IT job in AIG."
bad,"Productive operation within AIG that although was working with an outdated and limited computer  production system which meant  a  fair amount of manual work, the company was able to turn a profit over the  years, In being the only US Insurance operations in Jamaica, it was a very challenging operation ,having to meet  and balance the demands and guidelines  of AIG Corporate and the FEDS  with our local  demands ( regulatory, etc)  and our local culture.   There was a high level of Home Office and Regional support and expertise  and this helped to boost our stature in terms of local staff and managers job knowledge and skills which was very strategically complemented  with our global knowledge and expertise support and this made us a very important partner for our producers..  We were highly broker oriented ( 99%). "
bad,Most unnecessarily stressful place I've ever worked~!  My team manager was great but there was way too much micro-managing from others.  I wish things would have been different because I was on a wonderful team and I really miss them.
bad,I went through two reorgs in 6 months. There was no vision when I was there and the politics were intense. I was disappointed in the lack of support of employees and financial waste.
bad,"This company does not mentor, or set their employees up for success. Nor do they compensate there employees, the benefits are decent but that is all.  I would not recommend this company to anyone."
bad,"Wonderful group of co-workers and direct manager.  "
bad,"Average company to work."
bad,"Fair company to work with AIG. The onshore partners are good and collaborative. The leadership is fair to work with."
bad,"If you're looking to work your tail off for little thanks or recognition for good ideas an efficient work then AIG PCG is the place for you. Management is secretive, sneaky & plays favorites. Clients & agents are abusive and will throw you under a bus as soon as they don't get what they want. No good deed goes unpunished as they say."
bad,"Terribly managed, did not care about employees or clients. I shouldn't be forced to write a summary about companies that have employed me in the past."
bad,Laid off all of AIG representatives in the US. I only worked there for a short time. My most recent job is social media marketing then Tulane University as a research assistant.
bad,"Pro: Ok for benefit."
bad,"No job security. Turn over rate high. no warning when your job will terminate. would not work for them in future,"
bad,"if you are in our position, you think you are gonna be here in long time? no  more places in this company because the management was so strict"
bad,"no more salary increase and only supervisor are required in other company rules like bringing gadgets, and they are very strict in implementing company rules"
bad,"Not very employee friendly!   Directions change, senior leadership turnover is a result, senior leaders cannot work together."
bad,"A typical day at work is mid week making accomplishments to complete the processing of my open items to meet my target dates and have a great performance grade for management and reviews."
bad,Not worth writing about.  The company isn't what it used to be.
bad,"I worked for AIG for 2 summers and while they pay their temps really well, working for them feels like selling your soul. They constantly force older workers out and replace them with pretty little things that have nothing but air between their ears. I wouldn't take another job with AIG if they paid me $1 million a day."
bad,Would have been an enjoyable experience had it not been for the excessive travel. Learned a lot from AIG good and bad.
bad,i wasnt there long enough to give a review this was a temp job for the season
bad,Laid off thousands of employees in one week across the country. Executive management was not connected to the workings of each branch office. Poor communication.
bad,Handled automobile renewal policies and payments. Very stressful job in that I had to often deal with extremely irate customers. I did learn a great about different policies.
bad,Management was very unkind. Fast paced office. Reps were great to work with. Very helpful.
bad,Was great working there and was well compensated for your work. Bad management and the crisis 0f 2008 changed everything. Work continued fine until 2015 when they suddenly and without warning fired all their investigators. No warning to allow cases to be brought up to date of closed. Was one of the best jobs I ever had but after that experience I would never work for them or trust them as an employer again. Low level management was great but the farther up they just live in a fantasy world.
bad,"This was not a good place to work.  Management had a ""click"" and if you wasn't in that ""click"" you didn't have much room for advancement. This job absolutely was horrible and a lot of favoritism was most definitely show. This job was not professional at all!!!"
bad,".hard to make money."
bad,very competitive without the reward.  quotas were constantly changed so that you could not hit bonuses.  I had 5 managers and none of them cared about anything but month end production.  one month you could be top salesman and the next you could be on the chopping block. top sales people were predetermined at the beginning of the year.
bad,I did not like working there and so I went to another firm.  The management structure was not articulated effectively and the position as described was not what I found.
bad,"AIG lays off so much that everyday people come to work with the thought, I wonder if today is the day. The managers are bullies and very disrespectful.  They are not supportive of their team and request you do no talk to a member of the team on which they do not care for."
bad,Bana göre bir çalışma ortamı değildi ayrıldım. Kariyer hedefimde ilerledim. Smmm aday adayıyım.
bad,Handled workers comp claims from beginning to end.  Was allowed to work from home 4 days a week.  Co-workers are very helpful.
bad,"Older workers need not apply, as they are focused on younger workers.  Too many employees are laid off due to out sourcing, or leave, to avoid being laid off.   Management and procedures are constantly changing.  Very competitive, stressful, work environment.  Lots of employee turn over."
bad,"Management style is not great, from the top down.  There is no room for advancement and insurance business is so regulated that there is no creativity in marketing."
bad,"Handle VIP accounts. Learned all aspects of insurance. Management is constantly changing. Not a good workplace culture, the hardest part was the volume of work."
bad,"Would not recommend. Good old boy/girl management style. Quality of your work doesn't matter. Promotions based on frienship with managers, not knowledge or quality of work."
bad,"AIG used to be a great place. Unfortunately, it has been going downhill since the last 4 or 5 years. Career growth, bonus etc is based only on favoritism"
bad,They just keep piling more and more work on you with out any compensation or training. Outdated computers  and slow programs and you must meet there time limits while processing.
bad,A  workday is one in which you do not talk to or interact with other employees.  Stressful with less than 5% allowed for errors.  Would not recommend.
bad,"Well I mean, we know what happened right? The whole AIG story? When the market crashed? We all know. The things with money. We saw it on the news. It was everywhere."
bad,"Reorgs on a continual basis.  Friends and family hiring process.  Has not made money in the past 10 years.  Environment is hostile,  managment offers no direction, wants to be a tech company but falls miserable short.  Too many chefs with no ingredients to work with"
bad,"This company is not worth the time to review.  As an example of the quality leadership we had, my VP quit over policy changes and mass layoffs.  It took them a month to hire a replacement, and his replacement quit after only two weeks on the job."
bad,poor compensation package.  Excessive amount of travel expected to service policies I didn't write and didn't receive money for.  Poor management support.
bad,There was not a lot of opportunity for advancement. Had to train my replacement. Did not learn much from my manager. Lack of direction in my department.
bad,"Very stressful job, incoming calls were usually from a very unsatisfied customer. The co workers were very nice people. I learned a lot about Extended Warranty Insurance."
bad,Job security is no existent. It appears that every year there is a threat of job security.  It could be a good company but maybe there needs to be a change in management.
bad,Working pressure where your boss has no vision of growth and dosent  respect his employees. They do all false promise and dont even think twice on the decisions.
bad,"AIG is going through a “transformation” where they seek to modernize their HR operations and IT infrastructure at a tune of millions and millions and millions of dollars and through outsourcing. In five years, for example, AIG’s payroll and HR services will be executed from somewhere in Asia. Also, there is the issue of the money this company owes the government and the continued divestitures that have been necessary and will continue to be necessary in order to fully repay the government. With respect to compensation, incompetent managers make huge and ridiculous salaries and bonuses while most analyst type employees earn salaries in the high 30k to low 40k range. The only way to advance in this company is to kiss your way up the corporate ladder … If you only want a job I suppose AIG will do. However, if you are in search of a career, then look elsewhere. You will notice that AIG has not made the Houston Chronicle’s list of top employers … Now you know why!"
bad,"They expect you to work 60 hours a week and if you don't they can't understand why. When it's review time the only thing that matters is how well your boss fights for you, otherwise you get very little. It is a politcal powder keg and if the job market was better most of the employees that I used to work with would be out the door."
bad,"Frequent changes in your manager so the new manager comes to either like or dislike you. It’s like starting as a new hire every time a manager changes.  Always new manager (who will probably be your manager for about a year) has completely likes and dislikes. So it is not generally the quality of your work, but rather you personally “click” with the new manager. So “kissing” up is the key rather than your work performance. "
bad,"Poor management , lack of care for associates. Work no fun . Poor bonus structure, very subjective reviews, not enough programs for associates to benefit, cheap management , blame type culture"
bad,"I was in an internship that was really temporary work; I had no longer term plans to stay in my position.  because of this, it is unfair for me write a real review since I wasn't there that long.  My coworkers were pleasant."
bad,"I do not recommend working at AIG. The work culture is mostly very dysfunctional and bureaucratic. The execute team is very out of touch and overpaid while the upper management team consists of loyalists who knows how to brown nose more than perform."
bad,"AIG is horrible place to work. They fired a lot of people including myself just before holidays to be able to satisfy the street by turning a slight profit by Q4."
bad,I worked for this company for 14 years I didn't receive a raise for 6 years. Why did I stay? Because of the work from home opportunity and the vacation. The manager of this department was unprofessional and bully every other word out of her mouth was profanity. They are more concerned about cheap labor than having the work completed properly therefore shipping the work to Manilla where it would end up back at Olathe to be completed properly.
bad,"Not a very good place to work at, and not a lot of opportunities for advancement. It is very hard to make an impact at the company given it is very politicized."
bad,"Company lacks leadership at all levels.  Poor decision making. Very behind in technology and processes. No job security, constant position eliminations."
bad,"some good people but system rewards not merit based, the reduction in size was an attempt to shrink to better performance and ultimatly the clients paid the price"
bad,The opposite of a collaborative environment.   Expect little support from peers and old timers will hold it against you because you were not part of the recovery.
bad,"Management did not have a vision to increase revenue, just cut expenses.  Its a dangerous downward spiral.  "
bad,It is a job that requires you to work from dusk til dawn with the notion that overtime is voluntary however they force you to work and if you have to leave when you regularly schedule time to go you must work the overtime of get punished.
bad,"The work culture at AIG was not well defined and hard to interpret. The management team was sometimes difficult to work with, and the other employees did not take the time to help you learn the ropes. Very much a sink or swim environment."
bad,"I am surprised how this organization running....very few places they are following ITIL processes. Full time employees are very lazy in work. "
bad,"Management was horrible in the second floor department, it was completely unorganized. The managers would be upset if you weren't into gossiping with them."
bad,"Too much money goes to the upper management while the people who actually do the work that makes the business the success it is, get a pittance (if any) ""bonus"" based on an unfair ""peer review"" process.  There is not enough of the profit spent on software improvements which directly affect efficient operation."
bad,"This was a fun place to work.  I worked in the customer service environment responsible for in-bound calls from customers in an accident.  This position, department, was eliminated."
bad,Management has been forced to cut expenses in order to increase returns to investors.  Cutting to the bare bones.  Forcing out good people with invaluable institutional knowledge.
bad,There is favoritism. Upper management prefers a passive employer. To stand up to managers is to put a target on yourself.
bad,"The department I worked in was chronically understaffed and poorly managed with no recognition of incredibly hard working employees who constantly took on uncompensated extra work outside their job description; promotion from within is rare due to understaffing, and management and HR serve only themselves, NOT the rank and file. Also, annual reviews are based on AVAILABILITY OF FINITE AMOUNT OF NUMBER GRADES and NOT based on actual merit or ability."
bad,Not a good experience with the work environment but learned a lot.
bad,"I recommend this company for those of color who have no desire to advance, Cultural differences are shadowed however alive and well nonetheless."
bad,"Packaged and coordinated physical documents for storage. Document, archive all correspondence and troubleshooting, follow up suppliers’ visits and maintenance."
bad,"Workload was distributed evenly, this was prettey standard."
bad,The culture is dog-eat-dog because of the performance rating system.
bad,"Hired just after the 'Bail-Out' crisis.   This company is HUGE, too-big-to-fail."
bad,I was told the job would cover a certain area and when I got hired the area was completely different. The person that hired me left the company. I was working with clients that did not want to talk to an advisor
bad,"If you know mid-level to executive level employees this is the place for you. You're guaranteed a great job because many interview and hire their friends and family. There are a plethora of employees who work hard every day, lead teams though they're not official managers or team leads and are often told they're not good enough for better positions. However, they're responsible to train those in the new, better paying roles. This organization promotes the same people over and over. "
bad,"AIG is a stressful place to work with managers who have poor management and people skills. They have created a depressive environment.You are always worried about your job and job performance. Advancement is limited and the only way out from under an oppressive boss is to make a lateral move, demotion or quit."
bad,"manager was and abusive, unprofessional and unqualified for  the job and created a work culture from hells kitchen."
bad,"Constantly laying off people; got to work from home, liked my co-workers. Still laying off people, no reason to work there.  No raises either, for about 8 years."
bad,"AIG has grown by acquisition and struggles after 100 years to be a success story. A lot of great talent is poorly managed. Typical work week for IT resources, those that are successful is at least 60 hours, but most weeks closer to 75. I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that you will regret the day you accepted the offer, no matter how much money they throw at you."
bad,"It's a great company for executives. I personally don't care for high power pyramids - where there are the few on the top and then everyone else. I am round table type. They couldn't even bring themselves to pretend they care for employees. But then again, they are a bailout company that never quite stopped doing what caused them to be on the bailout to begin with. "
bad,"Too much legacy middle management that is not invested or interested in employee development."
bad,"This has got to be the worst place I’ve ever worked. There is NO work/ life balance. My department has been doing overtime for the last year with no sight of slowing down. We work 12 hour days Mon- Fri and also work on Saturdays. They overwork their employees to the point of exhaustion and then punish them when they make small mistakes and making mistakes, whether small or big, can cost you your job. They have an extremely high turnover because they treat their employees like robots. Career progression is only possible if you have perfect attendance (not even ONE sick day), perfect error ratios and productivity. If you are not  constantly 100% perfect, you do not progress within the company at all! They set you up to FAIL."
bad,"I learned to work at an extremely fast paced company. As a paralegal the high volume case load with strict deadlines was great, actually because I love being challenged and focused while on the job."
bad,The executives are running this company into the ground.  The employee morale is horrible because everyone is overwhelmed with the plethora of work after all of the layoffs and not hiring replacements when people quit.
bad,"Initially good company to work for however very poor communication and decision to relocate the local office was difficult and unnecessary, not explained well to the staff"
bad,"Top heavy, reactive, unintelligent,  Management,  that hired many employees without having adequate means of keeping them busy.   Procedures try to remove all types of subjectivity , replacing it with check lists."
bad,Management team scattered and inconsistent. Appalling lack of professionalism within the entire organization. Management provided no resources to complete job requirements.  Unwilling to invest money/time in databases designed to track legal documents. CIO misappropriated/unable to find $400MILLION in IT assets.
bad,"Best part of the job was some of the tenured, hard-working people who worked there.  Worst part of the job was a remote manager who had no experience with training and was not on-site to observe the productivity issues that were occurring."
bad,"Not much to say except that this company goes through employees like water from a faucet. They will cut you from your job in a heart beat and will do it in the most  cold, clinical, terse way possible although their severences are fair to you based on time served. Work life balance is poor and their training is not very well done. Constant system changes and expectations. AIG was much better when I originally joined but things have gone down-hill."
bad,This is not a place for the week of heart. there is a lack of meaningful communication from upper management to the workers. You get  communication with no substance.
bad,The management micro manages its employees and plays favoritism. It's a very stressful environment with unjustified monitoring system that doesn't reflect daily work functions and doesn't take it into consideration when grading overall production levels.
bad,Given a large company they are able to provide solid compensation.  Management varies in each department.  Experienced strong to poor management.  Learn to take the good with the awkward. Have met some incredibly decent and professional individuals which helps to make the professional exposure worthwhile.
bad,"It was a great job for after you retire from your other job.  It is not great for young people if you are looking to start a career.  The most enjoyable part of the job was leaving for the day,"
bad,"I'm guessing that if you're reading this, you're considering taking a job at AIG in Stevens Point as a travel insurance sales/service phone rep. They're always looking for people because they burn people out so fast. The turnover rate is horrendous. I would advise you to do everything you can to find something else. If you decide to take the job, this is what you're in for - eight hours a day of being chained to a desk, taking phone calls from crabby people who think it's your fault they had to wait on hold for 20 minutes. Better hope you have a strong bladder because if you have the audacity to go to the bathroom more than twice a day you risk having an unacceptable occupancy rating. And you'll need to keep that rating as high as possible for breathers, because once you get all your licenses the calls DO. NOT. STOP. You will be expected to take call after call after call after call after call after call after call after call. Most of these calls will involve you arguing with a customer who either thinks they know your job better than you do, or are mad because they feel the price is too high and want you to give them a special discount for being so fun to talk to. You will be surrounded by coworkers who you will never know anything about because any time you try to converse with one of them one or both of you will get a call. In the meantime you get to watch the supervisors wander around the floor, chatting and socializing with each other. Then the supervisors will call you to their office and call you on the carpet because saying one wrong thing (and I'm not exaggerating)"
bad,"Stressful, not family oriented and no job security. Difficult to know who to contact within any given department and no real cohesiveness between home office and the branch offices."
bad,"I used to be proud of working for AIG but it has changed so drastically, The department i just left was way too many hours with very high stress and very low morale. I would have liked to have stayed at AIG and move to another department but since I hadn't been back with the company a year yet, it was not within the guidelines to move me to another department. typical day there was going in and tracking everything you did on a daily basis down to restroom breaks and getting up to go to the printer. I did learn alot about processing withdrawals and transfers for customers but it is extremely high stress job with everything being quality controlled. With all the details you need to watch for, they really don't give you enough time to master the 95% average you must maintain. The management seems as burned out at the employees going through the day in a haze. This is due to the long hours that change from day to day which was the hardest part. The most enjoyable were the times when we were able to act like people, enjoy and count on each others wisdom and guidance which before I left was being frowned upon."
bad,Company is in serious turmoil with constant cost cutting that means very steep cuts of employee headcount and offshoring of many jobs to India.  Confusion reigns from all the layoffs.  Countless people inside the company are looking for jobs on the outside.  Not clear that the company will be able to survive long term.  Company continues to shrink and sell off many non-core assets.  Management is in denial about the extent of the company's problems and does not have any clear plans to help people move up and retain any internal talent.
bad,AIG has good benefits but it does not pay well. There is little room for advancement unless you relocate to a regional or home office. The field administrative staff enjoys working with teammates and the districts but do not feel recognition through pay increases or acknowledgement from management.
bad,Never got a pay increase. very low bonus. Department layoffs happen every 6 months as jobs are sent offshore to the Philippines.
bad,"I started at AIG FN and three months later they closed the North America opperation. But before it closed, my experience their was not too bad. The pay was good, the freedom was good, and the people were. I would have chosen to stay if I could have."
bad,The management in this company is terrible. You will have no room for career development if you work for some BAD managers.
bad,"I worked in the Global Voice Engineering and Ops groups for over 2 years.  I was lied to join this disaster of a department to begin with.  This is strictly a ""sweat shop"", where you are expected to work many extra hours doing tickets.  Change controls are only allowed on the weekends and you are expected to work all weekends doing these change controls, thats if you filled everything out perfectly.  Many were denied because you didn't add a phone number to the contractor or did no put the right start time(had to be after 9:00pm).  It this happened, then you were reprimanded and threaten with termination if it happened twice in a month.  There is no training except what you can learn on the job.  The VP of telecom even said, if he trained people, they would just leave the company for a decent job.  Very closed minded as they would not even consider any other direction but Avaya, even though they were spending over 60% more  .  Engineering director only knows Avaya, so will not consider anything else except what the Avaya account team tells him.  Extremely unorganized and run like a ""dictatorship"" by the Ops Director.   Only perk is the pay is pretty good and you get 21 days a year off PTO.  Of course you are not allowed to use them 80% of the time because of the change controls and ""emergencies"".  The VP of telecom has no technical ability and has no idea how to manage or drive the telecom department.  The politics is so bad, that no communication between departments exists, so as to make your peer manager look bad."
bad,"Working here was great! Some of the best people I have ever worked with.  The work pace was fast and stressful, since I needed to inspect vehicle damage, settle injury claims and answer/return all calls as soon as possible and all at the same time."
bad,"Many procedures, policies and routines.  No one tells you about all the restrictions and requirements to go through until you violate a sanction, and then they really climb on you.  Wedded to hiring only H1b visas from India, anyone else gets a limited contract.  Many overtime hours they will not pay you for."
bad,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
bad,"Management needs restructuring and new philosophy from top down.  The culture is outdated, disorganized and not suited to retention of young talent.  Management dictates rules with no regard to the wants or needs of employees.  There is little trust or respect for experience.  Collaboration is completely absent.  Expectations are high yet the basic tools necessary for employees to perform the basic functions of their jobs are grossly lacking.  Technology continues to be a challenge for this company causing the employees to work longer than necessary to make up for the obvious systems deficiencies.  If not for the long hours, hard work and dedication of the employees I do not see how this company would endure.  It is a relic of days gone by that needs a complete overhaul.  Work/life balance is non-existent."
bad,"I worked for Gaylord nearly three years. The culture of the job was good they also provided good perks. It is nice to receive fun things, but the money wasn't nearly enough to provide for my family. I was required to work weeks without an off date."
bad,"Worked on at least 3 renewal quotes per day and 3 new business quotes."
bad,"AIG offers an amazing benefit package! If you or your family require benefits, this would be a good place to start! "
bad,"Senior Management likes to blame contract PM's for other's poor performance.  I was the 5th PM to take over the same global project."
bad,It used to be a really good place to work. Then upper management did a major layoff and then another and nust ruined it and stopped caring about the employees that were left.
bad,"My experience  at this company was after spending 10 hours per day of hard work,I would have to experience disrespect from the Director who criticized everything I did every single day.The first 8 weeks were horrible! "
bad,The job was great but never knew when there was a new manager or when someone or some department was getting laid off.  Was able to just do my work and we had potlucks for team building.
bad,AIG ended up selling off the personal lines business due to poor management. The financial part of the company appeared to use the personal lines as a tax write off.
bad,"I was there for 6 years, hired as an IT manager.  Great people to work with, but 3 CEO's in past 3.5 years and constant layoffs.  No communication from management, about the layoffs, or when they will stop.  I was rated a high performing employee leading business critical applications, but yet I too was impacted along with nearly every manager above me.  Terrible moral and no support from management.  New CEO at least has insurance background, so I expect things will get better once they are fully reorganized and get the expenses in order."
bad,"Company has plenty of opportunities to provide interesting and challenging work in may areas, including accounting and finance. Generally hard work is appreciated. The toughest part of getting through the day is the ongoing frequent lay-offs for the past couple of years dampening all the positives the Company has to offer."
bad,Director was funny in townhall meetings but in person was not as nice. Instead of trying to place my small team in different positions the entire team was laid off. Management was not on the same page.
bad,Unstable environment.   Opportunities for advancement limited with various management cliques in place that prevent qualified and deserving team members the opportunity for advancement.
bad,"My management team, who was let go soon after I left, did not attend to employees needs or development requests.  Hours worked to get the job done push 65-70 hours per week."
bad,Many of the US jobs have been moved to the Philippines  so there is always a worry about being laid off.  This does not make the work environment a very happy place to work.
bad,it was great working at aig and the employees were all treated very well. there were barely ever any complaints while working there. the work was really easy to understand and perform. everyone was so nice and very welcoming.
bad,"I loved my job, my clients, my co-workers and my direct manager and his manager.  But from the day I started, there was the constant threat of being let go due to organizational restructuring.  The financial constraints led to less development and customization of our systems which would have dramatically improved the user experience and our competitive value in the marketplace."
bad,"Grwat people to work with,  however, no movement in compensation for over 3 years.  Year end bonus targeted towards favorite employees. Does not take into account my ADA status."
bad,"I have been with this company for almost 10 years.  There are three overwhelming things I would say about this company."
bad,I do know that this section of the company has been renovated. They did have problems with the government.  I don't know any person that I worked with at still is there.
bad,Good place to learn the business but not much direction from management on career advancement or other opportunities within the organization. Very political office culture.
bad,"Company says it will not punish employees for bringing things to their attention."
bad,"Very stressful environment.  When people left, there were no replacements, just distribute the work among the people left.  Systems not updated and maintained so that work could be completed."
bad,"Worked at AIG for 4 1/2 years.  In that time, all staff was subjected to organizational restructure and layoffs each year.  Very unstable environment!"
bad,"The workload at AIG is extremely heavy. They do offer a good benefit package, but I don't think the high stress level of the job is worth it. Management lacks in helping you advance in your career."
bad,"This is VALIC. It is owned and operated by AIG. Culture here is divided between longtime VALIC employees and those funded by AIG Corporate. There is a BIG ""us"" vs. ""them"" mentality and this place couldn't spell collaboration if it tried."
bad,"Constant threat of lay offs.  With only a few exceptions, no salary increases since 2010. Those you work with day-to-day are wonderful and supportive."
bad,"After the tumultuous the 2008 crash, top leadership changes never took the time to solidify the strategic direction of the company. This lead to middling support of necessary changes to shore up the holes created during the crash. Many of those who joined post-crash have a rosier view of the company's direction than the ""survivors."""
bad,Executive management is looking to automate and outsource wherever possible. Job security is virtually non-existent. Benefits are great but you are punished for using what management views to be 'excessive' PTO.
bad,"it paid the bills and keep me working, the days were long and office was hot but it was okay, it closed down and relocated out of state they fire people very quickly"
bad,"It was nice meeting the new people. The training was not good, and job security is very low. In my time there they downsized more than they brought in."
bad,Compañia que no tiene equilibrio entre la vida privada/laboral
bad,"the most enjoyable part is being able to resolve issues and concerns from repeat calls,having been an instrument to help them resolve insurance concerns and issues"
bad,"Worked in the Medical Malpractice department of American International Group; a large insurance carrier.  Reviewed cases and negotiated settlements, when possible.  Nice co-workers and supportive management, with generous benefits."
bad,"The current environment at AIG can be described in four words: "" Do more with less""."
bad,If you are looking at AIG for an opportunity in the Information Technology filed…RUN.   Most of the systems are not updated to new releases until they are unsupported by vendor.  Management is rewarded for sending jobs offshore without any regards to weather our not the offshore personal have the abilities to perform job function.   Management also refuses to promote from within and goes outside of company to fill positions even when there are more than qualified employees in house to perform function.
bad,I did not wish to write this review at this time but this app is not allowing me to bypass. I work as a collector which the type of work I'm doing now I had no intention of doing. We're collecting in an economy that is still recovering and it's definitely difficult when people are out of work. 
bad,An interesting place to work as there is so much exposure to deals and analyzing companies at a young age.
bad,"The management is rude, at least the person I worked with was. I needed to talk to him about certain things and he would never be there to discuss certain situations."
bad,"During recent years, the stress level became enormous, and it was difficult to find happy, productive employees. Prior to AIG's involvement, American General was a generous, respectful place to work, and I enjoyed my coworkers enormously."
bad,Empresa familiar (70%) onde a família está em primeiro lugar.
bad,they start you off selling accidental death and dismemberment and its a huge scam.
bad,My Work experience working at AIG was very good. I really enjoyed working with the company. I have grown with the company while working there. Got along well with my peers and I also received a promotion at the company as well.
bad,"Co workers and management were fine, but the constant concern over layoffs and the pathetic pay scale, no vertical movement opportunity...little chance for lateral movement for that matter. Lack of pay increases and expensive benefits made it hard to stay."
bad,"Offered zero flexibility, had to fight to work from home towards the end of both pregnancies. Could not work from home at all post-maternity leave. Was told if left before 6:30pm, no chance of promotion ever."
bad,Company is cheap and huge turnover. No communication among management. I enjoyed leaving at 5 PM every day- didn't really need to stay past 5. Everyone works individually.
bad,Stressful phone calls from angry customers. Management that has no knowledge or care on how to make things better for employees. The only good aspect is the benefits are great.
bad,"Company is going through a very difficult period.  Continuous rounds of layoffs, almost every quarter, makes it a very stressful place to work.  Employee morale is extremely low.  Hoping that things improve soon."
bad,"The company has been constantly reorganizing for many years.  Lots of layoffs again and again.  The culture has suffered a lot.  There are still strong parts of the company, but the corporate center is a hard place to be.  There is opportunity there, but it's there is also a lot of chaos."
bad,"Company needs significant improvement.  Constant change of leadership has hindered the mission of the company.  Too many layoffs.  Employees very concerned about future of company and lack of upward mobility, opportunities for growth."
bad,This company used to be a great place to work. The atmosphere has changed dramatically in the last 6 years. Every week there are layoffs with no explanations.
bad,many hours of work. high expectation with very little reward or praise. many people have not received raises in 10+ years. They pile on work on you with exception to finish the project at the same time to finish the new project. The amount of disrespect and back stabbing was unbelievable. Rarely got praise for good work. was laid off after 10 years of hard work. Even though I would get good reviews
bad,"Good Work life balance at work"
bad,"Lack of good, fair and supporting management makes this place an undesirable place to work.  In addition to POOR management, career advancements are minimal and mainly based on who you know not what you know.  The company does very little locally to provide company sponsored training to keep staff in the know of what is going on in the industry, but then again many of the company's practices are outdated so this explains their outdated managers, training and anything that resembles teamwork."
bad,"The culture is all about cutting out expenses and doing more with less.  The work life balance is way out of balance. No annual reviews of compensation, which they did not talk about in the interview process.  Bottom line - buyer beware - get the salary you want and know who your leader will be."
bad,"Work culture and environment is good but few managers,they treat you like slaves,not much learning.Top management is good and takes cares of employees,young work force but it has become more like call center."
bad,Started as the receptionist and worked my way up. This job can be very stressful at times and requires a the majority of your time. You are given addition training on a regular basis.
bad,"Large size of the organization, multiple acquisitions, number of legacy systems and pressure to cut expenses made for a difficult work environment."
bad,"Employees are overworked, pressured and exhausted with unrealistic deadlines and demands from lazy managers who act like bullies most of the time."
bad,"I began working at AIG after college, starting as a medical only adjuster. Even though I received a lot of claims as a new adjuster, the training helped put me at easy. With co-workers who held many levels of experience, the in office training and assistance of co-workers helped create a good working environment. "
bad,"first working experience and learned:"
bad,"There is no job security, and no employee loyalty.  There were no salary increases for over four years. It was once a good place to work, but no more."
bad,"It is a good company but it all depends on who you report to. You could be in both the best or the worst place to work here."
bad,"Much better places to work, Executive leadership is horrible"
bad,"Leadership constantly changes direction."
bad,A good place to learn. The management encourages all employees to take up training and be responsible for their carreer advancement and or personal development.
bad,"Since 2008, AIG has been consolidating functions to global service centers and downsizing to improve the expense ratio. As a problem solver and project manager, I actively lead and participated in projects aimed at identifying, consolidating and transitioning functions to centralized service centers around the world. This has lead to an ongoing reduction in local staffing. In an attempt to optimize efficiencies AIG has also redefined it's claims target operating model including skill segmentation and span of control for management."
bad,"High turnover, lack of clear directives and structure, company still transitioning.  Pay is poor with little staff development or career growth.  Good talent leaving for brighter opportunities and stability."
bad,"It has the potential to be a wonderful working environment. However, if one is not interested in political head games ... this is not the place for you. Management is technically challenged and does not provide for an effective alignment of businees goals with technical possibilities. My co-workers are mostly competent and motivated but, inevitably, over time they become sycophantic in their demeanor. Ultimately, technical honesty takes a backseat to job security."
bad,I worked at AIG during the US Financial Crisis and was impressed with the overall transformation of this company during this period.  Management was keen on keeping morale up.
bad,Too focused on cutting expenses than retaining talent. The company lost its way for the past few years. It used to be a good place to work. Working remotely is acceptable but depends on your manager.
bad,"I was with AIG over 5 years. I loved my job, I was highly trained and did everything AIG had to over. They hire new at a higher rate of pay I do not recommend this job to my friends."
bad,"No support"
bad,"Let go after 5 years.  They are bringing in a younger workforce at higher pay than longtime employees.  No compensation for seasoned employees. After 5 years,  my only compensation was a .27 per hour for a cost of living increase. That $2.00 per day really helped!"
bad,"Multiple Layoffs per year and lack of stability across all levels of management.  High-paced and stressful.  Good benefits, annual bonuses and time off. No room for advancement.  Raises are non-existent."
bad,"When I started , the company was family oriented , and the company took good care of employees.  After the CEO retired and new one came in things changed and it became all about profit with much stricter rules more expectations good with no compensation.."
bad,Management has changed continuously and constant change has resulted in a terrible morale and uncertainty. Who you know is the most and perhaps the only criteria for survival and growth.
bad,"Very stressful cause you deal with people’s correspondence and their money basically their checks and their billing, also the co-workers are very segregated and judgmental not a healthy work environment"
bad,"AIG does one thing well, and that's go through executives.  In my time at AIG, I've seen the company transition through 10 different ""Chief Officers"" because they use AIG as a resume booster, and nothing more.  They come in, enforce huge changes to the structure of the company, then leave as the wreckage burns behind them.  On their way out they get a few million in compensation, and it's left up to the peons to recoup that loss for AIG."
bad,"AIG is an ever changing environment and therefore offers great advancement opportunities. However, there is also little to no work life balance as a result and far too often a very demanding and stressful environment."
bad,"Most stress came from customers at this job, so coworkers relied on each other to improve their morale and get through the day.  However, a new manager was hired on and began firing the existing employees, making it less and less attractive to work here, with no support system at work."
bad,"Enjoyed working with colleagues, management was terrible.  Micromanaged to the extreme.  Was terminated a month after contacting HR about manager and the way they treated advisors.  Would recommend the company, but not the St. Louis office."
bad,Had 15 managers in 21 years; 6 in the last 3 years. The unsettled environment affected everyone's morale and I had to constantly train new managers on my team's responsibilities in order to obtain the support needed to effect the results we were seeking.
bad,"A typical day would start at 7am and end at 5:30pm with a 1/2 hour day, and you still could not keep up.  I learned a lot about subrogation while at AIG.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the fact that I worked from home.  The hardest part of my job was the number of hours I had to work just to stay a float without any salary increase in the past 4 years.  Very difficult to keep up with the cost of living without a salary increase."
bad,Very repetitive work.  I learned how to deal with retirement accounts.  Management is okay.  Culture is fine.  Hardest part is doing the same thing over and over again.
bad,"I work as a call team member."
bad,"Good and talented people, poor management and allocation of resources.  Money more important than employees. Money wasted on outside contractors and not internal employees."
bad,"A typical day at work is very much like the day before, If you love routine you would like this company."
bad,"Emitir las pólizas a los agentes, trámitar polizas, solicitar el articulo 140 a clientes nuevos y existentes."
bad,"The job itself wasn't hard, pretty typical call center stuff. Management was terrible, very unorganized, never wanted to help with questions or concerns. I had a harassment case that I was filing on another coworker for threatening to assault me, and instead of handling it, my manager chose to ignore it. I left not long after because of it. There is ONE payroll department for this multinational corporation. My checks were wrong 4 times in the 4 months I worked there. I got overpaid, then underpaid, and paid wrong amounts, and always had to sit on the phone for ridiculous amounts of time when calling payroll to get it fixed, which always took another week, so my check would be late all the time. Trying to move up was a joke. We were told we would be trained in a new book of business every 4 weeks - I was there for 4 months and NEVER got even one training class. You had to be trained in multiple areas before being considered for advancement. Salary stays the same, unless you move up. There are no pay raises. Unless you choose to take on 3-4x more work, you will make the same hourly rate regardless of how long you work there. Most people do not stay for more than a year in this position. They leave the company, 90% of the time. ""Paid Holidays"" are on a rotating schedule. They put your name in a cup, and if it's drawn, you HAVE to work that holiday, even if you volunteered to work the last. "
bad,This is a decent company to work for.  Flexible options with nice people. Most days are very busy and full of meetings. Convenient work location.
bad,"Unless you had prior working relationships with the group leads e.g in EFT you will be ignored."
bad,"La empresa deja libertad de acción para desarrollar y ejecutar, pero muchas veces sin directivas/pautas claras o inclusive contradictorias. Se observa falta de una adecuada visión y estrategia, y falta de buen liderazgo por parte de la Casa Matriz y el Directorio."
bad,Bonus is almost non existent. Management lacks training. More of an old school boys club.
bad,"No one notices you unless you mess up.  The pay is fine but the environment is incredibly dull and corporate.  No innovations are made in the department and all money is spent elsewhere by the company in order to make them look better in the public eye.  If they would focus on in-house issues then id probably want my job back but as the summary says its a thankless job and everyone from all other departments look down upon new business operators.  Its the most critical role AIG has and yet there are no innovations and no updates to old operating systems.  AIG still requires faxes to be sent in, which most insurance agents are not happy to hear about.  Everyone shoots the messenger and thats exactly what this position is."
bad,Working there was like working in a Warzone. The only reason i stayed was because i had a wedding to pay for and the money was good and i had an awesome manager. Other than that the people there are horrible humans.
bad,"I had a lot of great experiences at AIG. I had numerous roles and learning experiences over the years of my tenure. I made many great friends and supportive professional colleagues. The last several years the salaries remained flat and IT became very restricted by constant cost cutting and numerous layoffs, which really eroded the culture. The retirement and insurance benefits were pretty good, but those were cut back every couple of years. Work life balance will depend on which business unit you work for. It was not all bad, especially my early years at AIG, but the heydays of AIG are pretty far back in the rearview."
bad,High turn over. Great pay but poor upper management and team structures.High turn over in critical areas such as the Compliance Department. The Floor.
bad,"N/A - I have no opinion about this company, each person experience is different. "
bad,Great place to start your career. Great training. Dont plan on retiring from here though because they will force you to leave after your benefits max out.
bad,I returned to a prior role and worked for a manager that trusted my work product and allowed a lot of latitude when setting up his initial operations.
bad,"I have enhanced my skills in customer service. "
bad,"Benefits are really good but advancement is very limited and management is very removed from their team given their global locations managers could be thousands of miles away which makes it hard for managers to get to know their team well."
bad,"The hours were long and relentless. No one seemed to care what the other was doing and some even tried to trip you up. Leadership cares about themselves and when I tried to hire someone with a disability, it was flagged no."
bad,It was a very fast paced environment with a lot of information that you are required to know from training class that takes several weeks to learn. After that i feel that you were just kind of thrown into knowing what to do and how to completely execute it 100%.
bad,"I worked at AIG (Chartis at the time) during my senior year of college. I wasn't a fan of the work itself, however, it was a valuable experience that I think everyone in the finance/accounting field should get to experience."
bad,"AIG is very random across departments.  Some groups barely work and other teams work 60+ hours per week plus weekends.  There is constant turn over and lay offs.  The strategic direction of the company changes every year, so it is hard to understand the priorities."
bad,"AIG is an organization of constant change.  You must be well versed in ambiguity, bureaucracy, and corporate politics. Stable executive leadership fluctuates, organizational changes are frequent."
bad,"I have worked for dysfunctional companies in the past. This one takes the cake."
bad,This job is a dead end career. If that's what you're looking for then please apply. This job has good qualities as far as the work environment goes but the management and pay is overrated. None of the higher staff have a human bone in their bodies and everything is strictly black and white with them. I suggest staying away from this company unless it's a temporary job for you.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job completing my task, working with dependable co-workersthe hardest part of the job getting laidoff. and learning different task."
bad,It is a tough environment to work in but those who are self reliant and goal oriented will do well.  It is an environment an entry level person will learn a lot in a short period of time.
bad,they lay off people left and right! i would not recommend anybody to apply for a job at AIG
bad,"Handling phone calls for customer inquiries on life insurance, annuities, car insurance etc"
bad,"The pace of the environment was just right, with little to no pressure. Employees and management had a mutual understanding of professionalism and work ethic. I looked forward to going to work for my own professional satisfaction."
bad,"The benefits and PTO are amazing, however, the pay for the amount of work you are doing is not there. For my position Overtime was required with no notice (which was in the contract), we could go in as early as 6am and leave as late as 8pm. The job had multiple activities to promote employee appreciation. There was little to no appreciation for the work you do, mistakes are always noted."
bad,Corporate was restrictive. Company was hard to navigate and its internal processes and system were cumbersome. Old company in Finance. The local people created a fun environment despite limitations.
bad,"To AIG you are just a number.  They will layoff the whole department anytime they want or need to. "
bad,"Our team jobs were outsourced to Manila in 2017, We all applied to work in other areas in the company but unlike the past years, we never got interviewed or hired to work elsewhere. We are all over 50. Enough said. Some of the managers were good. Some were micro managers. We had a lot of overtime. I worked two jobs, as it was. There were days we were not given any notice that we were staying that evening. "
bad,"In order for the company to achieve its strategic and financial objectives it needs to move more quickly and thoughtfully on implementing its plans."
bad,The introduction of a new staff productivity monitoring system in 2013 marked the beginning of a dramatic decline in morale and working conditions. The emphasis on quality of work was replaced by the need for speed as all work tasks were measured in minutes and seconds. Consequently the focus to meet personal productivity targets eliminated both the team work ethic and putting the customer first. Healthy sales outstripped adequate staffing levels and so career development had to be overlooked. A successful company but not a place to stay too long.
bad,"International working Culture, Very unpredictable - Poor Management , employees lack leadership skills,  awesome Work/Life balance "
bad,AIG IT has become a tough place to work as the company has several years of decreasing revenue. The environment everyone is always looking over the shoulder worried about the next set of layoffs.
bad,"This adjuster possition is fast paced and a bit stressful.  The company has not kept sufficient staff so if someone leaves, they are not replaced or it takes 6 months to replace them.  There is very little room for advancement."
bad,"This huge company has been reorganizing since 2008 - hiring and then laying off staff again.  It is all about the bottom line and even though I haven't worked there for a number of years, I am still in contact with some former co-workers who tell me that nothing has changed.  They don't know from one day to the next if their job is going to be there...  A lot of the jobs have been outsourced to India and the Philippines to save costs, and that is what happened to me and 14 other senior admin staff 4 years ago who all got laid off on the same day as well."
bad,This Company would rather employ new untrained people with little or no experience than its own employees. management picks on the most ridiculous things. The claims department overlooked over 20 experienced candidates to hire an untrained girl that worked at Hooters.
bad,"Great place to hone your negotiation skills, and good opportunity to get exposure to the laws of multiple jurisdictions. Limited opportunity for advancement."
bad,"Poor Work Life Balance, but great benefits. Not much room for upward  mobility. Decent Pay, but poor compensation structure."
bad,"I worked for this company for one year.  This division is trying to compete with the ""BIG"" boys in the private client market.  They do not want to invest in technology rather make the employees work like dogs until they have to go on stress leave."
bad,"A typical day as an insurance agent would entail phone calls to current customers, new potential customers, setting and making sales and service appointments."
bad,"To review statement from local offices when they submit their no into a systems called comshare and ensure they were provided us the correct no.  I also compared the various from last quarter vs to current quarter, ending balance to current balance.  The hardest part of the job is to learn the business without any training and figure it out on your own.  "
bad,"For the first year and a half at SunAmerica, I liked my job. I could listen to my headphones while completing my numbers and it was pretty simple as that. Micromanagement reared its ugly head for the last year and a half that I was there. Management constantly instilling fear in the employees. That was when I left. I have since talked to former SunAmerica employees and they admit the atmosphere is even worse than before."
bad,"low job security, restructure"
bad,"If you can focus on your work and ignore the toxic culture, you may get to keep your job."
bad,"Senior Leadership lacked a coherent business strategy.  Moved from one ""strategy"" to another without clear or timely communications.  Hired some employees into a line of business that they planned to eliminate."
bad,"Totally overloaded as whenever somebody left, they assigned his or her work to other underwriters. Usually they raised salary about $1000 per year! Bonuses were also minimal."
bad,lack of direction in management no follow through lack of training It could have just been my department but I highly doubt it. Lay offs and hires all in the same week
bad,"Great culture that allows shorts and sandals during the summer.  Friendly management team that is always available.  Work is awful.  Bottle necks at IT, company is in constant state of project management because infrastructure is so outdated and centered around manual processes (which leads to human error).  Company has experienced a lot of brain drain over the years, and there needs to be an overhaul of internal systems.  Senior management has all left within the last year to competing companies including the founder.  Pretty bad sign"
bad,AIG offlate has been going through a lot of Layoffs and the last India layoff was unneeded and driven due to poor leadership and poor planning of their India Operations.
bad,"Once a great organization. AIG leadership was committed to their employees and gave you the opportunity to learn and grow in a fast paced environment, surrounded by hard working individuals that were committed to the team and their clients. They compensated you well for your performance. Respected on ""the street"", there was a great entrepreneurial spirit and will to succeed in providing the best product for the brokers and insureds, while ensuring consistent top AND bottom line profitable underwriting results."
bad,Major layoffs and no job security. Depending on the department your being hired for managers are a mess! I would highly encourage you to search online and look at AIG stock values over the last year. TIP search AIG layoffs and look and read through site called the lay-off.
bad,Benefit was ability to telecommute. However the pay is about half of industry norm. Raises and bonuses were a guise. However the company was struggling financially so it was not surprising.
bad,"They have the potential to be great, but nobody cares to be. They focus more on Agent satisfaction more than customer satisfaction, especially more than employee satisfaction."
bad,"Diverse portfolio.Lots of opportunities for horizontal movement.Great mix of product and services.Friendly culture, have good benefits and you are working on a project and you can move around."
bad,I enjoy the work when we have it. I have been here 10 years and had only 2 raises. The job that I have is something I enjoy we just need more work. I think when I started the company cared more about the employees. I can process two different kinds is jobs cause not only new business have I done I have processed loans for the company also.
bad,I worked for the co for 17 years and the exited the sector I worked in and let everyone go in 2016.  They are in a restructuring mode.  They do offer an excellent benefit package.
bad,The environment is difficult to work in given the amount of layoffs and the lack of motivation given that raises are very rare. The benefits are decent.
bad,working with annuities and the senior population. high turnover rate. hardest part was being a temp agent and being unsure of getting hired on full time
bad,AIG is currently going through a major transformation - 7 CEO's since 2005. Major asset divestitures with shedding of may countries and businesses. Massive lay offs across all platforms and businesses.
bad,"My department was not supported properly, and the management was clueless."
bad,I worked in the fund accounting department doing financial reporting for the mutual funds. The department was always understaffed which created huge amounts of overtime.
bad,"During my service here, I had a terrible and lousy boss. all that she done was getting angry for any solid reason. That's why I left the company even though the pay is reasonable."
bad,Work day is very stressful and very difficult to determine what management wants.  Co workers were just as stressed. Hardest part f the job was keeping up with all the changes.  Most enjoyable part of the job was leaving for the day.
bad,My review is I probably would not recommend anyone to work at this company. Management tends to play favorites and moving up is hard to do.
bad,not the best job ive ever had. i didnt enjoy much here. you were encouraged to stay in your cubicle and not to interact with people outside of that and it was frowned upon to talk to people around you.
bad,"Great location downtown"
bad,"AIG, Inc. grew too quickly without investing in infrastructure and proprietary HR systems.  Consequently, the organization faces many serious administrative challnges."
bad,Claims Unit Manager for auto claims in a multi state territory.
bad,"In the various duties I fulfilled, I created opportunites for the growth of my people and our businesses. Processes and practices were implemented encouraging direct reports to be responsible and accountable for the business segments which they ""owned"" and provide focus on the key objetives."
bad,"While change is good the constant change of leadership and direction at AIG can be confusing.  Every new leader had a new focus and direction while employees were still focused on implementing change from the last leader.  "
bad,"The short version is that if you fall within the parameters of the AIG culture box, life is good and straight forward.  If not, expect challenges every step of the way."
good,"I liked working there, but they were losing a business and didn't tell us until they laid us all off. I worked for whirlpool and had to quit because they didn't have any calls and were going to fire everyone."
good,"Not a pleasant place to work!  Management is terrible and there is no room for growth!  I would not recommend this location to work, if possible avoid!"
good,"No work life balance"
good,The company has a stagnant point where they would simply retain employees without continuing to develop their potential in order to move the company forward.
good,When I did see her she was always dealing with meetings so that left me with a trainer that kept changing her mind about how I should do things. I asked for help multiple times and was still just brushed me off.
good,"Coming into AIG you would have to have a strong background in the job applied for, for case managers the training is poor. They also tell you that working from home is an option in 6 months which is not true."
good,"Throughout my time with the organization much of the time spent during the work day was frivolous meetings about ""competitive"" in house challenges that really have no real value in advancement nor recognition."
good,"I worked for a very short time at this company. The systems where old and room for to upgrade them was too limited. "
good,"no rewards for hard work unless you are a management favorite. no raises in over 5 years, bonuses are laughable, management gives all the same except to their favs.  everything is manual, no new programs to learn, can't advance because they are behind the times in technology.  HR is for management, know of numerous people who complained about a manager and they let those people go and kept the manager - this was at different times they complained."
good,Old world insurance company. The firm is going through growing pains. Massive layoffs is not a moral booster.  Technology is extremely poor.  A lot of time wasted just trying to get a document to print.
good,Gained invaluable experience working with the management. Very Knowledgeable and committed to achieving results. The normal politics in the company and communications are not the greatest at times.
good,"Company started as progressive, enjoyable atmosphere that cared about employees and maintained office morale. Different management that ""played favorites"" limited growth opportunities for majority of employees, severely lowered office morale, and frequently laid off essential, long term, loyal employees for personal gain."
good,"If you are just starting as a financial advisor, this is not the place for you. You need to have a lot of contacts and clients in your funnel on day one so you can ensure success. It is commission based, so get used to living off your savings."
good,"Continuous Layoffs, no upward mobility, senior management is constantly changing, nice bonuses but no raises. This is a good place to get experience when you are first starting but don't expect to stay there long."
good,"AIG is like any other corporate businesses in Kansas City. There is no hope for promotions or raises for employees. You would have to know someone within the business if you want to move up in the company. "
good,"-Management with poor EQ unable to coach frontline staff to success"
good,I was hired as a FTE and when I arrived I asked questions.  No answers were given.  The person in change of my group was a nasty individual that demeaned people in a bullying manner.  The person I reported to was not technical and her eyes glassed over when I tried to be specific.  I was blamed for things that she did not comprehend and eventually they restructured and I was released.  Best thing that ever happened to me.
good,"Very nice insurance company to work for.  It has a lot to offer employees, and also allows you to learn more in regards to how they operate."
good,"When I started with AIG in 2010, it was very good.  There was a lot of work, but it was a fair and reasonable environment.  Currently, 80% of the IT staff has been severed and 90% of the mainframe work is outsourced.  The former mainframe programmers are now working tickets and making the remaining systems ready to be outsourced.  "
good,When I first applied to this job I was told that there was a lot of room for advancement.  The advancement opportunity just isn't there.
good,"Although the people were fine they were not great, their work was mediocre.  Most managers were good at one thing but did not have a broad range of skills.  They all needed a lot more training to be effective."
good,"The process is still not that solid compared to other companies that i have been in. plus the management is also not that supportive on the life balance of their worker/resource. if i were to say, if you're looking for a high pay company go for AIG."
good,I learned in this organization about the Medical Billing and AR.
good,You may be able to telecommute but you are expected to work long hours and under very stressful timelines.  Often other co-workers shared their thoughts on loosing sleep over the stress how management treats them.
good,"Don't buy into the ""development for everyone"" campaign. They spend the money on advertising but don't back it up with anything substantial for individuals outside of the SMT."
good,Needs more diversity and better employee moral culture is doom and gloom.  Culture and review process has created a cut throat environment.
good,"Assessed and evaluated moderate to complex risks for the accident and health, group travel and special risk plans."
good,AIG work you to the very minute.  Work environment is very stressful.  Learn a lot about other things beside insurance.
good,Do not waste your time.  Compensation package seemed to change every 3 months.  If you started to make too much money - they would change your comp or raise your quota to one which was not attainable.
good,"In my experience with AIG, I have been expected to work overtime due to being consistently understaffed making it difficult to maintain a work-life balance. I would not recommend applying to a claims position within AIG if you like to have weekends and evenings free for personal activity."
good,"I left because of my boss. She could do the job great but had zero people skills. She was rude, overbearing, micro-managing, hyper-critical and did not support initiative.  The most enjoyable part of my job was lunch and the PTO benefits were great. A typical work day involved avoiding interacting with my boss as much as possible. She made the work a lot harder than it needed to be."
good,I was a contractor not an employee.  I have no right answering most of these questions. These questions are better answered by one who is an employee.
good,Company follows poor work/life balance. There is no job security. Positive things are good exposure to technical knowledge and comparatively better package than similar companies.
good,Continual layoffs at all levels over the last 12 months closing sites in the USA but continuing to.hire to executives & buying companies. & expanding overseas
good,"I worked at AIG full-time about 5 years.Work expectations sometimes were unreasonable; there is a disconnect between the goals and actually how much work is required to implement."
good,"i have good experience with that company. it was a great time "
good,"Lots of friendly people at the company, but average benefits that are always in danger of being reduced; constant management instability & turnover; a ridiculous ""incentive based"" bonus structure that effectively ensures average employees won't get their full bonuses, & little to no opportunities for advancement"
good,Hoping for a more positive future. Enjoyed working with co-workers and meeting new clients. Challenge was staffing clients and hiring good and caring workers.
good,"no flexible working hour"
good,"Was  great company to work for, a lot of change is going on leading to many job cuts."
good,"Commission based with book of business to cultivate.  Necessary to also 'bring in' new business to achieve performance goals."
good,"Trying to convince people to sign for a private pension on a time when there was no culture for private pensions in Romania, was more than harder. It was nice to work with young people, it was my first job after graduating from the university. It was a challenge, it was something new, it was about making money on your own."
good,"I wasn't happy overall with the company.  The management team is one big clique, and if you aren't a part of it, you don't stand a chance."
good,"I learned a lot at AIG and I am so grateful.  My day consisted of processing claims, providing customer service to claimants, doctors and attorneys.  The job itself wasn't hard but we didn't have the right system to perform the job  that was required and that made it difficult.  The job required a lot of manual functions.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the team players working together to get the job done."
good,"First 6 months had fixed salary but then you get paid by the amount of policies you sale."
good,Only interested in self preservation and individual advancement.  Toxic and volatile environment.
good,It is a great diversified Company in some areas due to management can be a great place to work but can be also the worst place to work
good,"Administrative staff are disposable for the upper level promotions."
good,Your experience will depend on the strength of your direct management. It has grown to be a harder environment to grow in over the years. Reductions in force is another name to let people go because there is no value in employees.
good,Big projects.
good,support recruiting manager and HR business partner
good,The hours are too long and management has a hard time understanding senior leadership's expectations. There is an increased workload with same amount of headcount.
good,"I did not like the compensation tied to pure production. "
good,"AIG used to be a great place to work; after financial crisis though there is a continuous firing and hiring going on.In a recurring fashion, top leadership changed. Each time resulting in a cascade of changes that happened too frequently"
good,AIG will need better training. Training was very obsolete. No one was on the same page. Everyone had a different answer for the same question. You were unable to take off for minor things like your child’s doctor’s appointment because there was never enough time available which meant you received as point deduction every time you took off.
good,"Insurance companies changes ALL THE TIME... this we know but not like this....."
good,"third party hiring company for AIG was a joke, horribly unreliable management, company reveals that you are completely expendable, and it is clear that you will only succeed if they allow it, nothing is based on merit or workmanship."
good,"At AIG, there is lack of creativity."
good,Mauvaise ambiance entre collègue qui sont intrusifs.
good,"AIG is struggling to adapt to new technologies and ways of doing business in the IoT world.  There are lots of opportunities for innovation however most senior managers do not know what their people do and therefore are unaware of the changes that are needed. "
good,"Like any job you have the good and the bad.  I would return to work for AIG; however, it is a highly demanding job and often stressful. If you like challenges and work well under pressure it is a good job. There are the typical diplomatic hoops you have to jump through for promotion; however, there are a lot of good people there willing to work with you.  The company is world based and the only experience I had with it was in the Texas Panhandle so I cannot attest to how things are in other places."
good,"I have been working with AIG for the past 9 years - the office and people are great to work with, but have reached to a stage in life where i need a change and use my capabilities to benefit myself and other multinational firms ."
good,Work is life with AIG. People don't work til it is almost time to get off so that they can get as much overtime as possible. If you do more work you still have to stay late. Not for people with families that want to be home with them.
good,"Honestly speaking, there is nothing positive to say about working for AIG other than the good old people they let go over the past year....its probably best you look somewhere else!"
good,Δεν υπαρχουν προοπτικες εξελιξεις και χαμηλος μισθος.
good,"Pay is fine. The only true issue is the management is pretty nonexistent. The policy and how things work are pretty outrages, but then again that maybe just the call center of things"
good,"fast pace and always changing "
good,"I was not happy with the compensation. I worked the book given to me, keeping the clients happy and received no compensation. I didn't receive compensation for rewriting business to keep it active. Yet they were quick to take away when someone cancelled even though they were an old insured who I did not write."
good,"People are not promoted with in the company, very bad culture, lack of company loyalty. Management is not interested in employees success, no training, no structure."
good,a typical day at work consist of answering the phones in a fast pace environment and helping clients with their retirement needs and questions. I learned how to handle angry customers and the laws when it comes to distributing retirement funds.
good,"Not a pay raise! While ensured you will get a bonus every year, you will be getting a pay increase, even at top 10% on reviews. Cost of living increases were also not to be seen in 6 years of working here."
good,"Company didn't pay me what I was worth.  They also had me doing multiple jobs.  I would have continued if they compensated me, but they instead chose to let me quit and hired 2 people to do my job and paid them more money."
good,Management here was not great to work with. They were not friendly and did not make going to work helpful. I did enjoy my work schedule. I worked from 5:00am-1:30pm
good,"Good working community. The people are conservative in a good way."
good,"AIG could be awesome. But as with life, a few bad apples ruin the bunch!!!!!"
good,Good Pay and benefits. Management always infusing uncertainty down the line of employees. Poor decision making and everyone like to pass on the bug to the Otherside. Taking ownership and feeling the pride in it is lacking heavily.
good,"AIG would be a great place to work if the people that put the time, and the work were recognized and allowed advancement. The upper management encourages cliques and in groups that blatantly do less work to thrive and expand further within the company, causing morale for the people doing everything they can to move up to drop immensely. Co-workers are nice and respectful, but management does not fix issues that remain present for months that effect every single rep on the call floor. Mismanagement and disregard for real issues within the company that effect both customers and employees go untouched for far too long."
good,Initially an enjoyable place to work but I was there during a period of deep cost cutting. By 2017 it was bleak. Investments IT primarily relocated to NC but various jobs were parsed out to various lower cost centers. Initially benefits were good but were cut significantly between 2012 and 2017.
good,"If you need or require some type of experience to place on your resume, i.e. sales, marketing, your FLMI etc. okay to work.  However, do understand that longevity is not appreciated."
good,"Company had great benefits and perks but extremely long hours, no worklife balance.  I enjoyed what I did and learned a lot but the job security that was sold in the beginning was not the reality.  Every couple of months, they were doing layoffs.  I thought the management style at times was micro-managing from some.  Learned that I was doing more than Business Analysis work and wasn't compensated for it.  Felt there was no room for career advancement at times."
good,"Overall my experience at AIG was not good. Not clear who your reporting to. 3 changes in management in a 6 month period. Overwhelming tasks, Work/Life balance almost non existent.Head of Department resigned 3 months after I resigned. Good for a single person who is a workaholic."
good,"Due to the nature of the business, pension plan administration has ongoing deadlines throughout the year. The complex plans at VALIC required immense knowledge base skills and detailing skills."
good,"Problem-solving claim’s professional with an experienced litigation and insurance background. Highly proficient in the assessment of coverage,  factual analysis and legal acumen to secure successful, "
good,This was a completely meaningless position. I wondered everyday why I was showing up and continuing to work a position that made no real difference.
good,"Unfortunately, AIG Corporate did not do a good job managing AIG Financial Network and after 2 years dissolved the company.  There are many good agents that are out of a job.  I am sure we will all land in a better position."
good,"Company was hiring new employees until a month before they terminated operations. Financial advisers were not provided needed communications capability such as individual phone lines or voice mail. They had to use personal cell phones for company business.  Work space was typically at a table for up to eight salesmen with two telephones provided.  Job training was good. First level management was generally experienced and helpful.Relationship between the company and SagePoint, the broker/dealer for securities, was poorly defined. Parking was plentiful but uncovered and at some distance from the work area."
good,10 to 12 hours a day with 2000 plus miles travel per month were challeges.  Co-workers and field investigations were most enjoyable.  Working with the insureds and claimants keep the position fresh and interesting.
good,"Processed death claims, researched beneficiary designation, contact beneficiaries when necessary. Assist customer service with beneficiary designation and payment estimations."
good,Ambiente de trabajo muy agradable debido al personal de la empresa.
good,I was consultant at AIG.  Work environment is excellent. Friendly staff but compensation is not so good.
good,"Nos reunimos en un sector acordado por los asesores y supervisora, vamos por calles o cuadras llegando a las casas ofreciendo nuestros servicios con seguridad de que sea una venta."
good,The company has been faced with expense challenges and overall workplace culture has been impacted for many years as a result of continuous work force reductions at all levels and businesses.
good,Good place to start with no guarantee of growth. Training is a lacking factor in most sectors of company. Poor communication too often visible in most departments.
good,In the summer it's extremely hot. I learned how to use a tape measure appropriately. We would have meetings on Mondays to make sure everybody's on the same page. I worked with a small group we all got along best we could. It's not a bad place just easy to get cut or hurt.
good,"A good place to begin a career but not a good place to stay. Ineffective management. No opportunity for advancement. No raises, only if you change jobs."
good,You work more then the pay is worth.  They have a lot of lay off going on and work being sent to Manila.  Some managers play favorites and other are fair across the board.
good,"I found something I really loved doing at AIG. But the requirements of the job started to increase, and they expected more testing in less time, and expected testers to quickly learn new software and products and procedures on their own time...practically overnight. The job becomes overwhelming and unbearable due to the workload and time constraints."
good,"currently undergoing major restructuring and layoffs"
good,"Great place to work overall.  However, years of expense reduction due to misguided management is unfortunate. Once there is an increase in premium and policy holders, the company should turn around and be a better place to work."
good,"Early morning meetings, due to India off-shore team members. Same folks who runs the meetings need to turn around and do the work, which leaves few hours in the office to work after many meetings. There are groups and clicks of people who does not share information outside of their circles. It is difficult to have close relationships with team mates, since many are in remote locations. I enjoy the few individuals who really wanted to get things done and are willing to collaborate and get the job done. The value of individuals are not praised very much, thus it is imperative you are a self motivator."
good,"When I was brought on board as a temp employee they had already decided to outsource their entire first-notice claims department to another state. I saw dozens of seasoned employees who had worked there for decades get thrown under the bus in an instant. AIG may need you today, but tomorrow you will be disposed like garbage. Be wary when applying to this company."
good,"I worked as a consultant and did not reap any benefits as a FTE, however will say I did learn quite a lot in a short period of time."
good,they put too much importanc on time and not on doing the job right and too much information to learn to really help client out right. too many people rushing through Job and not taking car of work right way
good,Very fast paced. I was with aig 30 years before i was outsourced to ibm.The hardest part of my job was being outsourced. I enjoyed the challenges that were put in front of me.
good,Unfortunately the culture at AIG has become very political. The move away from Centralized IT Enterprise Services to Decentralized Business Unit IT Services is promoting this behavior.
good,Was a great place to work but little opportunity to go permanent. Our group was fun to work with however there was little communication between members.
good,"You are hired by an agency."
good,My negative review is because my most recent area was complete bunk with a terrible manager. All my former managers have left elsewhere due to a lot of churn at the company.
good,Usual day is filled with full of surprises and Meeting to discuss many initiatives. Lot of bureaucracy in Organisation which makes Work-Life Balance a challenge
good,"It's difficult to rate a company undergoing major management changes.  Everything is up in the air including job security and compensation.  Management does not seem able to relate to the average worker and there is very much a finger pointing culture here.  On the upside the benefits are very good, many people have flexible work schedules and work from home a couple days a week.  Overall I would say the compensation is fair."
good,"I had a great manager who encouraged growth and work/life balance.  The rest of the firm was a cut throat, ruthless place; this was under Hank Greenberg as CEO, so expected."
good,"A Billion dollar company yet they do not look out for their employees. It can be a stressful job depending on time of the year and workflow. Management has it's pros and cons, also hard to advance within the company."
good,"AIG has been doing a lot of reorganizations in parts of the company.  "
good,A typical day at work. What you learned. Management. Workplace Culture. The hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job. Give us your opinion about the following.
good,Nice people.  No work/life balance.  Lots of overtime.  Limited and dated resources.  Creativity is limited.  Work is very mechanical and repetitive. Downsizing is common-  No job security.
good,I loved working for this company until they laid off half of the people and wanted the current staff to take on another position and no pay. this became very stress full.
good,"Empresa Boa pra quem esta começando,Tranquila e com Bastante Funcionários ."
good,"Carga de trabalho muito alta"
good,This office of AIG is being closed and is currently winding down. This was a small in-house legal office dedicated to insurance coverage litigation against AIG member companies. Due in part to numerous upper management changes at AIG the office had constantly changing objectives. Eventually due to a cost cutting caused by a private equity firm becoming a major share holder the decision was made to wind down and close the office.
good,"My working experience with aig was excellent when dealt directly.But mainly I was staff of an outsourcing company and was working for Aig.I really got very good experience working with am american company as always very beneficial.It increased my communicational skill,good custome service and also thought me how patiently an employee must be at workplace."
good,"* Typical day is exciting and rather hectic"
good,It is a great leaning opportunity & had a good co workers who thought me the work where it is require. The management is very good & always supports me to learn new things in the work. The most enjoyable part of the job is freedom to learn new things & comfort environment.
good,There was no room for advancement unless you wanted to move to the technical side of the house and then that wasn't guaranteed. Lots of lay offs with the administrative staff.
good,"I liked underwriting, the associates I worked with, traveling for work related trips,  ""winning the deal"" as in obtaining the order to write the policy, training agents & new hires, the close commute"
good,"Long hours and could improve on appreciating dedicated employees for their worth, value and skills."
good,"Changing the business model and threw the baby out with the bath water.  Effect was bad enough that senior mgmt decided to shut down employee agent operation.  Bad hiring decisions by senior mgmt came home to roost, but unfortunately impacted lower level employees and not those responsible."
good,"A lot of uncertainty in strategy for growth, resulting in unprecedented headcount reductions and limited career tenure as indicated by current CEO."
good,"Pros: "
good,"If you work in an environment that this company has as an exclusive case, it can be a good company to work for. But if you are in a marketplace where the name is a problem, it is very very difficult. "
good,"The job is in a fast paced work environment that requires you to speak to a large amount of clients a day. The clients ages range from 20 to 90. Ability to work with opposition, and overcome obstacles is something you will face daily. You will have to pass the series 6, 63, and Texas General Lines. Once exams are complete you must learn about all the products from annuities to mutual funds. In this position you will never stop learning."
good,"Benefits were great matching 401k, pension plan OK salary.  No long term salary incentives. The company is very fragmented so you may know very few people in your office."
good,Management opportunities are lacking. Extremely high stress levels. High caseloads. Severe micro-management. Not a good culture as management does not support their employees.
good,"Although frontline management is energetic, mid- to upper-management communication is infrequent and often unclear. This results in low morale and makes work/life balance very difficult."
good,"A typical day in the office was a very busy one, each morning I would arrive to around 100 + emails and around 25 meeting requests"
good,"Okay environment to work in."
good,"Each day supplied numerous challenges and you would need to think outside of the box to identifie steps that would need to be taken to handle the challenges."
good,"7 hour work week was really nice"
good,Working at AIG is very challenging.  There is little appreciation for work-life balance.  The amount of work given to each employee is overwhelming.
good,On the phones all day.  My hardest part of the job was dealing with micro management and aggressive customers.
good,"There is little to no formal training. For the past 11 years I have had the same job more or less, but learned all jobs within 3 departments. But since Florida's economy doesn't allow for us to bring in more money I have not been allowed to be promoted from within."
good,"As a 10+ year employee, I am proud to be part of the ups (AAA rating) and downs ($182BN bailout). Unfortunately the current management in place has inconsistent initiatives, which is driving a lot of good talent away."
good,"I worked at AIG for 27 years and planned on retiring from the company. Unfortunately my job was eliminated. My co-worker was really great working with. The hardest part of my job was not meeting my manager, everyone else on the team met her directly. The most enjoyable part of my job was a feel of self fulfillment. I enjoy work with people in a customer service roll."
good,"My work day started with case management and resolving customer issues.  Second to that I processed off cycle checks and sometimes"
good,Great benefits package and reasonably competitive salaries.  Limited opportunity for advancement within units.  Changing company culture places far less emphasis on work/life balance.
good,"A typical day is sitting in your cubicle staring at the computer screens entering information from contracts. Managers were micromanagers. As employee, you are rarely made to feel appreciated."
good,Interesting job. I have learned so much since I have been here.
good,Working on my own schedule finding new prospects and maintaining a current book of clients was a new experience.
good,Experienced pigeon holing there. Internal advancement possible but tough. Great education benefits.
good,Learned alot about global project governance and offshore teams. The financial review of IT projects is second to none.
good,"Productive and friendly coworkers were the best part of the work day.. I learned a lot and the training was great. Management is fair but limited in what they can do for their employees. The work place culture is very inclusive and accepting. The hardest part of the job is there is not enough work life balance for the annual compensation. The expectations and demands on the employee get higher with limited advancement and raises, but the work load steadily increased as the company streamlined it's processes. The best part of the job was the flexible work arrangements that made it manageable."
good,"We were always worried about retrenchment, year in year out, a lot of manual work, ancient systems that makes it hard to produce quality work. Great international exposure"
good,"Overall, there is a lack of communication and empowerment which makes it difficult for teams to move forward with work. Systems are outdated and  management need to put some budget to upgrade systems."
good,The hardest part of the job is limited amount of training for a specific job function; it was usually an hour or two of training.  Chosen favorite  team members given the opportunity to train in other areas.
good,"AIG management and culture declined with the stock price while I was there.  Alot of false starts on projects and efforts that they did not see through.  Mostly special project types of endeavors were groundbreaking, expensive and wasnt around long enough to be realized in their core business."
good,Great experience. My knowledge of insurance was greatly expanded and I also experienced many difficult situations that will help me as i further my insurance career.
good,They have great benefits and the work is easy but the work/life balance is not the best. The jobs offered at AIG are not difficult and can be done rather simply as long as you have a head for memorization and can keep up with constantly changing insurance and retirement laws.
good,I felt completely overworked and way underpaid.  I was told when I started that overtime would be seldom and that they may work 1 Saturday per month.  After starting we were scheduled 8am-5pm Monday - Friday and we ended up staying until 7 or 8 every night and working most Saturdays.  Management didn't really enforce people doing their jobs and that put more processing work on 2-3 individuals instead of the work being done evenly with the 12 team members
good,Job security was always in question in recent years.  Good place to start your career.  Global opportunities and exposure to a lot of cross-cultural co-workers which makes for great experiences.
good,"I worked with lovely, talented, supportive colleagues. The constantly changing management and vision of the organization made it difficult to be as productive and secure as I would have liked to have been."
good,Decent work / life balance.  Exceptionally high amount of turnover.  Even higher layoff cycles.  Systems and tools are advanced. Decent people. Not much else to say.
good,"The company needs to redefine it's organizational culture and hire senior and middle managers who will exemplify them. The constant management turnaround has led to a lack of identity and has contributed to the rampant cronyism in the company. "
good,"It was required by the manager to review each new loss, identify all exposures and set reserves for each one. Then provide extensive initial handling instructions and assign to the skill-set of an appropriate adjuster. A short manager diary was mandated, measured and monitored."
good,"Worked diligently for 20 years,  Received many recognition awards for excellent customer service and processing skills.  Learned on the job which helped me excel my career with AIG."
good,"The company has a Chinese water torture approach to RIFs which keeps everyone nervous and uncertain about their job security."
good,This was my first job out of college. AIG offered good pay with decent benefits and good PTO. I was a remote employee so I can't comment on how office life is. Like all jobs a lot depends on individual managers. I met some that were great and others that needed some improved people skills. Work life balance overall was okay. Some times of the year were slow and others periods I worked into the late hours of the night. There was not a clear path on how to advance your career which was frustrating. Stability is a concern as layoffs occur without warning.
good,"Daily Routone for last role consisted of management of 20 employees in Amarillo and LA, up to 6 conference calls a day, long hours.  Many days staff and management did not have the oppertunity to take breaks or lunch hours (staff was given options to take breaks/ lunch and the OT was not mandatory but approved by upper management) due to the nature of the business based on the stock market the team couldn't leave in the evening until all business was processed which consisted of the long hours on peak seasons throughought the year, first, second and fourth quarters were peek times."
good,"Nothing to state here, its good and bad depending on where you work. A lot of turn over in leadership, a lot of layoffs as of late. People re hoping for packages and desiring to move on."
good,"It was a fun place to work when the going was god, but once the reductions in force started, there was no end. Add in the constant change in IT leadership, it became a survival effort, so you had to keep your head down.."
good,"Workplace is congested and disfunctional and the environment is toxic, the lights are too bright and there are way too many people, the only good thing is some of the people"
good,Good company with compwetitive compensation and benefits.TRavelled nationally and interfaced with international peers.Abble to work remotelyand interfaced with all levels of management.
good,"I've worked with very nice people, although the management was very uneducated and very unprofessional. For example -  company hired an ex Sony salesperson to be an IT manager."
good,"Great brand, smart people but difficult to advance if you don't have a manager willing to be a true sponsor/mentor. Management training is limited to underrepresented minorities or women of certain job grades.  If you aren't in either group, it's pretty much self driven."
good,"The work is interesting, challenging and rewarding. You have to watch out your back as it is cruel environment. The pay is good but there is no benefits if you work as a contractor"
good,"Overall, leadership appear to want to improve employee moral, but don't appear to be certain how to do so... "
good,"I enjoyed working with coworkers.  Many meetings and trainings needed and provided.  The work schedule is flexible, but requires a lot of time working at nights and weekends."
good,"Fast paced environment working at accelerated pace"
good,"A large infrastructure to support their global sites around the world. "
good,"A typical day will involve 3 hours of meetings. Meetings are focussed on ""bringing people up to speed"" rather than making decisions. Too many layers of management. The firm is very inefficient. Higher level jobs are given to outsiders. But benefits relatively generous."
good,Company management changes often and with that there is confusion regarding process and responsibilities. VP had no idea about Claims and was making adverse decisions that will affect the Claims Lines of Business by transgressing processes back 15 years.
good,"low morale and chance for advancement"
good,Great place to work at BNYMellon. I am very lucky to get selected in the interview and get a great platform to work . My team was very supportive and helpful.
good,great way to start your career in the corporate space but there is minimal advancement opportunity.  there are plenty of ways to learn and expand your knowledge base in order to move forward in your career.
good,"Simply put, you will not want to stay at this company for no more than 2 years if you're under 45 years old. Get your experience and then leave. While the majority of the people under management rank are great; half of lower management are striving for more power through office politics trying to get to mid-management level. While the other half and are trying to do their with what resources they have. Forget mid management ranks and above; if you do not support them directly and continuously they do not know/care who you are. Regardless, you'll be thanked namelessly equally for any big efforts."
good,Unfortunately while i worked at AIG the Senior Managers were involved in the Ponzi scheme and I have recently received a $76 check for restitution being a former employee. I hope they have changed their ways.
good,"Poor management, failure to disclose full job requirements, unqualified overseas staff, too much box-ticking red tape, failure to replace staff, HR run the company"
good,"Very typical of a large insurance/financial broker.  Brings in young men and women and trains them for a week, then sends them out on their own to sell 403b and 457 retirement plans to clients.  Not a lot of support after the first week of training.  Top producers are rewarded with sales manager roles.  Not all top producers are management material."
good,"would have been a great place if one wasn't afraid of being on the chopping block each round."
good,"In the 17+ yrs I have been at AIG, I've seen the culture steadily change for the worse. The Sr leadership team seems to care more about numbers and how things look on paper but there are very few ppl in management who actually know what they are doing, make decisions that seem best for the dept, the employees or even customers. It reminds me of high school. If you don't fit in with the right ppl, you get no where."
good,"The managers tend to micromanage the employees and there are not any positions open. No one ever receives a raise as many employees have been at the same rate since being hired and individuals stay in their positions, as open opportunities are typically lower salaries."
good,"Yeah there are some great benefits for working for this company, but if you get 6 occurrences in a 6 month period (Absences or coming in late/leaving work early for any reason) you get fired not questions asked."
good,"Working in technology was interesting and there was a lot of investment in systems when I was there.  There were a lot of good people, but it was hard to keep relationships as new managers were hired in senior roles.  Probably better now..."
good,"Workplace culture was constant change for change sake. Changing leadership made goals and developing culture a moving target. New leaders were still supported by ""old school"" teams of leaders a and managers who were self-serving and not in tune with new vision for leadership, which made implementation quite difficult."
good,"no job security, poor management structure, to much outsourcing."
good,Good company but unstable job security. Company and departmental changes are constant so job stability was often uncertain. Great benefits and vacation.
good,"Although AIG offers great PTO, benefits, and a decent work life balance, the management is terrible. There is a severe lack of transparency and care for employees from the top down."
good,"Every big company has their good ways and uncomfortable ways of"
good,"A lot of changes in upper management and the desire to cut costs is what led me to leave. Many employees were laid off and the ones that weren't were stuck with the work load with no compensation. The company stopped giving out raises and gives a ""performance bonus"" which is a complete joke."
good,I was sorry to see the recent changes in the corporate culture.  Became less employee oriented over the last few years. The company put great emphasis on customer service without making the necessary investment to keep up with the industry.  Communication is poor.
good,"Hardest part of the job is working for poor leadership/management  that is not interested in developing or growing talent. There is no clear business strategy and a lack of alignment at the top. "
good,"Management was young and did not really know what he was doing and was friendly to much to certain co-workers.  It was a nice place to work, but not the department that I was in which was the Data Entry are."
good,Process are in AIG is excellent. The biggest challenge to sustain within legacy systems and cater world-wide client. The segmentation within company is tremendus.
good,"When I worked there I would start on my reports and/or coding, worked on audits, and developed workflows. As my job was hyper-focused on efficiency and productivity, it was very frustrating working in a culture that supported a management structure that was primarily focused on swelling their own department sizes and so individual titles. My job was to create efficiency and this environment creates boatloads of waste. I had ethical issues with how much work I had to code to send out of the country (we would have to rework most of it due to error) while management laid off onsite employees. I also struggled with the issue of this company reducing and denying so many coverage claims as our clients are real people and could easily be my own relatives or friends in need of coverage."
good,"AIG has undergone a tremendous amount of change over the course of the last 2 years.  While some of the changes were needed, layoffs have been ongoing since Q3 of 2015.  A lot of people, especially within IT, have joined from the outside and brought a ""smartest person in the room"" attitude with them.  This has created a political struggle between new IT and legacy IT that is preventing groups from collaborating or making any significant progress."
good,"A large corporation with plenty of politics and bureaucracies. Typical 9 to 6 job with late nights during quarterly close & year end. There isn't too much opportunity for growth and appears to be somewhat of a revolving door when it comes to employee turnovers. Not particularly interesting work as most people specialize in particular areas (since it's a big firm) with layers of management on top. The culture definitely has negative impact on employees who tend to be fearful of making mistakes or being blamed. Otherwise, the actual work is not terrible. Decent work life balance."
good,"Changes in management over the past few years seem to have caused lots of the issues being faced with the company. "
good,"Pros: Good work culture, flexible work hours, transport facilities are good."
good,"L'aspect le plus positif chez AIG est que tout salarié qui souhaite s'investir dans la vie de l'entreprise peut le faire. Chaque initiative est prise en compte et le quotidien n'est pas rythmé que par son activité principale. "
good,"As I am part of service Provision team its always been busy team working on service now request raised for software license request for different types of platform and application."
good,Lot's of changes in the industry and organization means pressure to perform while understaffed. Employee review process is too subjective.
good,"I spent a total of 12 years there and the first six were great, the last six not so much. Undoubtedly things had to change after the 2008 crisis. However, much of the change has not been for the better insofar as how it impacts the day-to-day operations and typical employee. Morale is low, layoffs are ongoing, budgets tight. Senior management more worried about The Street than employees and customers. Need I say more?"
good,"A typical day at work is a stressful one wondering when you are going to be laid off.  "
good,"Working at AIG was very enlightening. They invested a substantial amount of money in my education; I will always be grateful to this company. Popular opinion notwithstanding, AIG is a company with deep insights in its market space and storied past. As with every large organizations, there may have been instances of a less than artful execution of the corporate mission; by a few. Overall, it is a good company with a tremendous human capital."
good,"Fairly good place to work, people are friendly, benefits are good.  However, would like to have worked there longer to really get a good handle on the job they had me doing."
good,"Moved up quickly from BA, Sr. BA to Team Lead (business operations). The culture and overall future of location, outsourcing, etc. is uncertain."
good,"I worked remotely but my manager was great and very supportive. I would conduct 10 plus appointments per week to do reviews for clients and develop new prospects."
good,Please see my review under directDME as the parent company is AIG. I had gone back to school for Health Claims and medical coding as the company is sending many positions and job duties overseas.
good,"Overall a pleasant environment, great hard working staff, great training. Management is ok. "
good,The infosec team has grown a great deal over the past few years with increasing budgets for cyber security efforts.  Company has invested heavily in securing its assets.  Challenging company to work for particularly with the constantly changing management and corporate directions.
good,"Great for anyone who knows a ton of people who can invest in annuities or wants life insurance, as this is a commission only career.  Don't expect a lot of help from management or anyone. If you can't get out and hustle and sale sale sale, you won't make a paycheck."
good,"I loved my job and everything that went with it but the lack of advancement opportunity was terrible."
good,"This was an ok place to work, environment was good, co workers were all good to work with. Management was very kind and fair."
good,Unlimited growth potential along with product knowledge to get an employee ready for any avenue they may want to take.  Great employees and wonderful clients.
good,Strongly suggest newly hired employees negotiate salary as best as possible prior to acceptance of initial offer.  It is important to have a good head start for your career hinges on it.
good,Company inherently supports work/life balance and is trying to catch up with the rest of the market in terms of technology and accountability. Many changes and restructuring going on at this point in time.
good,"After the financial crisis of 2008, there were some drastic changes.  Eventually the right CEO was put in place with Bob Benmosche.  The company was slow to react to the improved economy.  While other insurance companies were growing, AIG was still going though rounds of layoffs.  That has slowed and there is upside to joining this company now.  It may be a good company to get into for production groups.  However, support personnel might want to wait."
good,"reunión con el área comercial y clínicas de ventas todos los días."
good,"fairly ok"
good,"AIG is a good company to work for.  It is well managed, and the compensation and benefits are adequate."
good,"It will be to your benefit to negotiate as hard as possible for your starting salary. There are no cost of living adjustments, your yearly incentive is all bonus."
good,"very busy, good place to work, management needed to work more on managing time but overall good place"
good,"AIG is one of the largest Insurers in the world.  I held a position which assisted in reducing risk and saving money for all lines claims.  I assisted the field investigators in several states with logistics, case loads, storing evidence, maintaining reports, I also assigned some cases to third party vendors.  I collaborated with internal Adjusters to assist our field investigators, used various industry specific databases and Microsoft Office Suite programs, as well as  passed an all lines 520 licensing exam with a score of 98%."
good,"Learnt 2 softwares,, value addition. Good for freshers.. new in india.. setting business.. hoping for best"
good,"Ample vacation time, generous pension and 401(k), etc. but base pay was quite low for the type of work and mandatory overtime is starting to become a fixture."
good,"Fast Paced Environment, Technology a bit behind the times, not very employee centered and not much growth opportunities. All commission based pay."
good,"A relatively flat organization within the legal department, the work is intellectually challenging and if you make an effort, the business clients respect and appreciate you."
good,"Its ok. Was better, but layoffs quarterly. Direct managers treat you well, higher level treats you like a disposable number."
good,Great co workers to have. New management makes it difficult to function as a group.
good,made follow up calls to see if any customer wanted to further there insurance with the company.
good,"I was a consultant, but was quickly asked to come on board as and AIG employee."
good,Its an experience however my co-workers are outgoing people who work well as a team and we confide in one other to get through the challenging days.
good,"The working environment has changed so drastically after the 'almost' collapse of AIG in 2008. It is really hard to begin. Since the Government bail-out in 2008, AIG is not the best environment for an employee to grow in if this is something that an employee desires. I never witnessed this type of transformation of such a large comany in my 20+ years in corporate America. I am grateful for  the knowledge, training, computer systems and procedures that I have learned and mastered over the last 12 years. "
good,"Outstanding Financial Company at the time , with quality Products and an excellent reputation."
good,"Everybody was a boss in AIG,we used come together around the table and discuss a lot of matters partaining our work.Including the business itself and other matters."
good,"Decent job, challenging and complex work. The higher you're able to climb the better pay scale. Nice work life balance. Lots of opportunity to volunteer"
good,"Odd working hours, lack of sleep, fast faced and requires you to multi-task with interpersonal communication skills. But it depends on which department or field of work you enter. If you end up in customer service or call center environment, most do not survive over a year. It is a good temporary job if you need a stepping stone to pay the bills while you focus on your aim. Unless, this is your aim in life."
good,"Employees exemplify the values of diversity, inclusion, and global citizenship – and in return, AIG offer world-class opportunities that lead to exciting careers across a broad range of disciplines."
good,"Though my time at AIG was short; I discovered that AIG needed a major culture change. Pertaining to my role, I was not given the opportunity implement the ideas and program I wanted institute."
good,"Very corporate, people are fired regularly with no warning or mention of mistakes made. Work life balance, benefits and vacation are incredible, but beware of my first statement."
good,"Low pay and no advancement. Enough said. The company is well known for great benefits. And that is very true. However, salaries tend to be much lower than competitors."
good,Good co workers but really fast pace work environment. There is good mixture of technology stack right from VB6 to Web API's. Plenty of opportunities to learn and grow.
good,I worked for AIG for 10 months and only met the Manager one time.  There was No direction for the Technical team and no target dates to complete the activities.  Very little direction in moving forward.
good,"An individual's experience ranges depending on the team he/she works with. There are continual structural and corporate changes that make the day-to-day stressful. If you have a good team and manager, you'll weather the storms together."
good,"Managers treat their employees differently. Some people get away with blatant violations of the dress code, some get away with being late EVERY DAY, some people get away with leaving for extra paid breaks."
good,"- good working environment with flexible working hours"
good,AIG is great at sponsoring and hosting special events.  They motivate their employees to come together and participate for many worthy causes.  The company is very diversified and has created many organizations to assist with networking and individual growth.  The most enjoyable part of my job was my interaction with vendors as well as assisting other colleagues to complete the task at hand.
good,It was a great experience. The location was near my home and the company had great benefits. The work hours did not require to work after 8pm and there were no weekend shifts.
good,This place could use some improvements. There's a feeling of unsuitability here that makes a lot of people uneasy. The technology used here could use some improvement as well.
good,it was a good place to start my accounting career.  made life long friends and learned a lot.  would recommend AIG as a place to work.  it was relaxed.
good,nice culture was nice working for them as a contractor very structured  in certain area. was working out of the houston office near and close to the downtown texas
good,"Numerous processes for the sake of process continue to grow at this employer.  Focus is profit by cutting headcount not improving processes to sell more.  Good place to start your career to build your resume, but not a long term place to grow."
good,"Amazing benefits (not many other places have such great benefits, specially for paternity leave).However, there is almost no career advancement and every year there are mass layoffs which hinder job security."
good,"AIG was an enjoyable place to work.  We were like a family there.  We helped each other and learned a lot from one another.  People were always willing to go the extra mile.  I learned how to be a team player.  Management was always great.  They always had an open door policy.  "
good,Not enough focus on work to support clients..focus is on hitting the numbers by reducing headcount. management is focused on reducing staff to the level to achieve financial goals regardless of the effect of the deliverables
good,A company that has gone through major downsizings at all levels trying to regain strength and establish an identity. Needs to regain the strength and regain customer confidence. LAck of trus as a result of all the layoffs and sale of gusinesses.
good,"It just ok. I don't like the micromanagement style of some managers. Beside this, the company is great. They give you PTO right way and you can use it at anytime."
good,Company closed department with no notice. Entire department laid off in same day. Work life with the best part of the position there.  Would consider working there again in the future.
good,Liked remote working option that was given from few years back. Work culture depends on the group you work. One group was very bad. Other group was good. In recent years the management was very unstable and changed every few months and there was no job security. Not many opportunities are provided for employee career development.
good,"I have worked for CMS for seven years and still make less than $48,000 per year. The workload is heavy with very little time to plan. "
good,"If you have the right leadership team you can excel in the work environment. I have worked with some of the most amazing and talented leaders and co-workers globally that taught and guided me in my career there. In my experience, I was able to take advantage of all my opportunities and made things happen. Don't wait on others, seek those opportunities. The down side is work life balance is missing."
good,The benefits at AIG are great. The prices and benefit plans are ideal for families. They offer ideal programs for volunteering for employees to give back to the community.
good,"Large company with many layers, that is shedding seasoned staff at a high rate. Great place to develop your skills, but may not be the place to spend your entire career. Benefits are above average."
good,"AIG is not better or worse than other insurers in the market.  In some cases the attitude towards change management is actually worse.  However, as a whole they are very typical."
good,I was one of their first class TAP Program. Program was overall great but some were treated like interns. A lot of unknown during the rotations. Training at beginning was useless but nice part was they fly you to New York. A lot of changes with organization. Wouldn’t get any raises but finally the new CEO Brain has done something about it and whoever Deserves the raise will get it. Great exposure in the real corporate world for entry level.
good,You definitely work more than the 37.5 hours (unless they've changed and now pay people for 40 hours but you will still exceed that). They will squeeze all that they can out of a salaried employee. Management can be helpful or a hinderance. Workplace culture can be cutting or extremely close & helpful. The hardest part is trying to adapt to the whims of those in offices that aren't located in GA but somehow feel that they know exactly what challenges are faced in GA. The most enjoyable part is the people who are experiencing the same challenges but are still trying their hardest to get the job done.
good,Work life balance is difficult but a great group of people.  Culture is changing with the organization .  The best part of the job is the people.  Organization is changing and growing.
good,"Financial Services Team - Their heart is in the right place, but way too difficult to get anything done. Company should really work on streamlining workflow."
good,"AIG is a great place to be if you want a good work life balance. Hours are on average 9-5. No working after hours or the weekends."
good,"Productive, fun, challenging, great work environment, fast paced. Learned about claims setup, insurance cover-ages and policy types. "
good,"On the office floor the atmosphere was friendly and helpful"
good,"Financial, leadership and position instability were the reasons for me leaving to seek employment elsewhere.  The people were great but all afraid daily of losing their jobs."
good,"Working with AIGSS is such an excellent experience considering the job environment, co-workers, and collaboration between top management and business partners."
good,a typical day at work. micro managed. cubicals everywhere. overtime at the last minute without notice. advancement is very difficult.  raises are 2 or 3 % a year which amounted to about 30 or 40 dollars a month to most people.. it was a joke of a raise.
good,"Long work days, making for difficult work/life balance. Focus not on the welfare of the employees, but management did try to remedy that somewhat. Salary compensation not great compared to the experience of the staff"
good,"La empresa cuenta con una cultura laboral buena y lo que mas llama la atención es la salida los viernes al medio día, ropa casual y bebidas calientes gratis."
good,"Typical day - lots of conference calls, status reports, touching base with customers"
good,"Management is not good"
good,AIG is going through a transition period with a new CEO so change will be coming.  Layoffs are not uncommon so the hardest part is always wondering if you will have a job tomorrow.  I work with a great team of people who are very supportive of me.  I'm on a project so my hours have varied.  It's not uncommon for me to work 10-12 hours  a day.
good,Learned a lot in 16 years at the company but the problem is that they keep outsourcing the positions overseas.  Once you learn a position at AIG the management has the habit of constant restructuring the department or groups and not always for a different position.  There are too many managers and supervisors for a small group of people.
good,"send and review emails, works about 40 cases daily. Answer and return calls to and from agents regarding cases. Work with underwriter to get cases issued."
good,Good benefits. Flexible work options. Paid leave is good. Career advancement and spending on employee training is poor. Chances of getting a promotion or raise is rare.
good,"Benefits are fantastic, but there is no solid direction and leadership changes directions often, creating little job security.  Overall co-workers were helpful and friendly."
good,"Don't expect your hard work to be recognized or appreciated. Make your own connections and way up the chain, for having better chances of career growth."
good,Working for AIG has its Bitter Sweet moments.The Sweet  My manager is very motivating and helpful.  The Bitter The Current position requires a lot of research and emails and follow ups  not suitable for call center environment.
good,"good leaders are very hard to find and the pholosiphy the company has to Train advisors are pretty poor. all in all, you eat what you catch, so if you can't fish, you will die, they don't know how to train you to fish, so you will die if you can't already. they also lie about how much interest the actually pay on IUL's. and because the cost in insurance goes up, IUL's can implode and customers can actually end up owing money."
good,"The pay is okay but working overtime everyday for six day a week is very tiring. I would have stayed if only its a day job. Our training is for 2 months but was reduces to a month and a half, after a week we were required to do overtime and there are times that I feel like walking in the dark because there are process for the job that training don't cover."
good,"but no job security and no pay increases and management usually dont value the workers, however they have good 401K contribution 9% matching overall and good health insurance"
good,A productive place to work. You can enhance your skills in here like being a professional bpo employee. This serve as a training ground for professionals.
good,"AIG  is it business casual professional atmosphere, built around a team environment.  It's fast-paced dealing with brokers insured's and other teammates"
good,The back office environment is a typical corporate setup. At times there is poor communication between departments. Advancement is very difficult.
good,Start my day at checking mails. Start/Continue pending jobs. Interact with my co-workers. Escalations are the most challenging part of this job. Management is fine and considerable.
good,"I enjoyed working with schools to problem solve issues and assist students. Training co-workers, pharmacy help desk, Tech support with website were also enjoyable parts of my job."
good,"Although an Industry giant in the Insurance/Mortgage Financing, the company is overburdened at the top of management. It probably needs to be split up to be more efficient."
good,I love that the company allows schedule flexibility by implementing  virtual work at home opportunities. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with my co-workers while the most difficult being I (along with many others) have not gotten a raise in 5 years and this tradition will continue unless one transitions into another position.
good,"The company has had turnover in senior management over the last decade.  This unfortunately has created an environment of chaos with regards to having effective management in place.  Many managers typically stay in their office and it is up to the employee to approach the manager vs. the manager actually setting clear and direct communications.  This leads to the overspending of funds for system enhancements and/or projects.  A number of the Project Managers hired recently don't seem to know how to manage a project as those project managers from years ago.  It is unfortunate this company gone from being a great company (with some issues, needless to say) and many, many dedicated employees to a company of counting $$$, which it is wasting on an immense basis."
good,Such a disappointment that the company went under. Management was great!  They were always pushing their employees to better themselves and to advance in the company. Enjoyed my position!!!!!
good,"Positiva ya que conocí a gente, fue un contrato de practicas."
good,"Company just went through a massive down sizing. Coming from Metlife this company was way behind the curve.  Behind in culture, technology, reporting and compensation for lower level administrative positions."
good,"I am the middle man between application developers and claims adjusters.  I make sure the system is functional, and I work with the technical teams if it is not.  The department wants to build everything as fast as possible so they do not commit enough resources to long term maintenance."
good,"Great benefits and paid fairly. Up for bonuses on a yearly basis. Travel occasionally. Not a lot of room for advancement in current location, but large company worldwide."
good,"Pretty standard company to work for. BKH office was way more laid back than the NYC office, however it seemed they'd hire any random ""friend of a friend"" to manage the BKH office, which resulted in no one being on the same page and completely unavoidable situations would occur."
good,"My typical day involves the challenges involving cash movement and monitor incoming/outgoing cash.  "
good,"I was working as a consultant for American International Group (AIG) in Property Casualty in Financial Lines as a Business Analyst for 21 months in New York. While not having any insurance background or experience, I assisted in establishing and maintaining a database library where I received a $7,000 promotion for my contribution and performance on the project"
good,"I really enjoy the people at AIG, but the work/life balance just isn't there and they are laying off many employees that have given 20+ years of their professional lives so they can send the jobs offshore.  I came to AIG with the intent of making this my retirement company, but that hasn't worked out."
good,"Good place to learn new things but low on professional culture."
good,still waiting for those promised bonuses and incentives for working third shift..Oh and then Over Time---waiting...mandatory OT!
good,"team environment"
good,"Enjoyed working along my co-workers from various departments. Was able to attend training classes (such as excel, fraud, and insurance). Hardest part, was maintaining (and exceeding) company requirements to meet regulatory standards."
good,"It depends on the department. Nice people and clean office. Its a very busy work place for accounting people, not sure about other department."
good,"A typical day at work as a workflow coordinator would be managing  at least 200 tickets a day, answering phone calls from our follow technicians and responding to emails from your boss and clients"
good,"Great co-workers loved working with the public, could have used more specialized training"
good,Each day was full of action from beginning to end as we competed in the extremely competitive aviation insurance market. Changes in the marketplace were commonplace requiring nimble reactions and insight to stay ahead of the curve. The management struggled to  to bring technology up-to-date to increase productivity and improve customer service in the face of an under-investment in this area in the last 30 years. Everyone worked hard and supported each other to win and keep customers.  Winning new and keeping renewal business was the most rewarding part of the business as it meant successful relationships with our broker customers was being realized. The financial crisis resulted in many changes at AIG and eventually there were many lay-offs as the organization 're-structured' to focus on stock price and investor returns
good,"Make Calls for Projects that I was working on."
good,"Heavy caseload, unrealistic deadlines. No raises. Yearly evaluations pit all employee's against one another. Very toxic environment."
good,Working at AIG as great.  I was able to take courses to move up in the company.  I was hired as a file clerk and when I left I was an Exec. Assistant.  I was able to learn new things by attending in-house courses.  Management was management and the people were friendly.  They never recognized loyalty or even said thank you but they made up in other ways.
good,"I think AIG is a great place to work.  My co-workers here are very nice and helpful. There is a constant change in what is expected of us from the management team, I feel that the management team needs to provide clearer goals and direction on where everything is heading."
good,"Very busy environment with hard working individuals. Company paid training sessions, working overtime, learning new processes and keeping busy with daily workflows of the department."
good,"Rien à signaler, si ce n'est que c'est une grande entreprise d'assurance avec le fonctionnement est assez bureaucratique mais tout de même axé sur un sens du service en interne.. Intéressant  mais très formalisé ce qui bride un peu  les initiatives."
good,Great benefits and pay per hour.  Good training.  It can be difficult to gate outdated or inefficient procedures updated
good,The management was not great nor was the pay. I learned a lot about the retirement business.
good,There are some really bright people at AIG. The company could do a better job with developing the talent within the organization.
good,"Poor management, unfair and biased. Lots of politics. GM has good training, but plays favorites. Good if you can sell and avoid the BS, bad if you need help from GM to establish a career. Money talks."
good,"I enjoy my coworkers and I believe the AIG is a good company overall. However, I am not sure about advancement opportunities. I believe it is easy to get lost in the ""system"" so to speak."
good,routine position with kind co-workers who are very helpful
good,"The manager, I work with is very nice, but does not know how to develop the staff. I was hired in a position where I would be able to get promoted to management level within 6 months-1 yr. As said they promised me the position, but are not standing by their words. I do everyone’s work and there is no sense of appreciation for our VP."
good,"Excellent companies to learn how the big cooperation work. Company operated in 130 countries world wide, had opportunity to be in half of them during my tenure."
good,Soent 6 solid years with AIG. DC had a good work environment and staff was top-notch. Issues with management as high turn-over slowed the progress of the staff at the time. New management meant new objectives and visions. Always proving one's worth with new management.
good,"Great for fresh grads to start their career.his experience can often be gained via temping, which can, in turn, lead to permanent work. Also if performing well will get opportunities to travel abroad."
good,"Great team, i left due to poor management. Colleagues were wonderful. Difficult to advance within the company. Due to manager entire team left within 6 months"
good,Colleagues were helpful and fun to work with.  There was a team environment and everyone worked together to get the job done effectively and efficiently
good,"Overall it was fantastic experience with AIG, management was so supportive and well guided. I got very good exposure to different technologies and got a chance to train other as well."
good,good environment management another story had fun while working here would look @ again if need be fun company had to be proficient in excel and emails
good,It was fun working in AIG with mature work environment and predefined processes. Very skillful management with prime focus on customer services. Worked closely with onshore team on day to day basis to achieve defined goals.
good,"The job often requires working through day to day tasks independently without a lot of oversight so motivation and being pro-active are key.  Work life balance can vary depending on what department you work in."
good,"Constant change is the norm at AIG, must be willing to get used to this fact, otherwise you might be better off looking elsewhere.  Provides great experience in the industry, but not a great choice for long term stability."
good,"-Good place to work "
good,work from home most days. Stressful work environment most days. Lots of dealing with agents and brokers. I learned a lot about insurance and commercial.
good,It was good experience working in AIG. I was part of Financial operations and also got an opportunity to travel to London for Transition. I got an experience to work in Insurance Domain
good,I worked here as a co-op student. Was able to apply what i learned in school to work. Management was good but there were no room to grow or move up or to return.
good,"Teams run in silos.  Experience and success varies significantly based on the assigned silo. The majority of the senior management team is no longer there, so things may be different now."
good,I wouldn't recommend working at AIG. Insurance business is changing. More likely to streamline business units than to expand departments. Simi regular lay offs.
good,"Most of the client employees are very kind, supportive and helpful. Project task is demanding. Many learnings have been gained thru my experience.here."
good,"When I worked for AIG, it was a company in transition.  Each business unit was under review and remediation causing a great deal of disruption to strategic direction."
good,typical adjusting job behind a desk: answering calls and adjusting files. Timeliness and organization is what you need to succeed. A lot of the time there are issues you need to settle quickly
good,"It's a good company.  employee engagement. good atmosphere at the office. salary does not equal the experience, but they offer training for insurance."
good,"The company was a good company to work for at the time.  AIG provides training classes, good benefits with decent hours of work. If I was not laid off during the recession years I would have finished my career working for AIG."
good,In all honesty it wasn't that bed of a place to work. Management needed more training and they need to make the schedule more accessible to people who live out of town. Don't automatically put them on 10 hour shifts in then make them work overtime in not give them lunches.  The pay is not that great it was $10.50 an hour. To do it again I doubt I would work there again.
good,Customer service organization was a godsent! Most co- workers were friendly and professional.  The culture was antiquated but was trying to improve. There was plenty of training available but not for the day to day task. There was a get it youself attitude. Politics was the hardest part of the job. It was enjoyable to network amongst some peers.
good,"Challenging , fast paced environment, rewarding for self-starters.  Company coming from manual process to automation. Be proactive in gaining knowledge."
good,"Really enjoyed working there. AIG is a really strong company and they take care of their employees very well. Even though they had the bailout, they recovered nicely."
good,AIG used to be a great company to work for in the beginning.  When the Vice President's position began to have a high turnover rate.  I believe the focus on what was best for the company & employee's got lost by personal vision.
good,Good work place.  I enjoyed my time there as a project manager.  The office atmosphere was nice with friendly co workers.  Pleasure to work on site at the office
good,"The good things of this company is the work environment and culture. It is a comfortable place to work at but strict 'house rule'."
good,If you are all about proven systems and procedures this is the company for you. Very little autonomy but they are very efficient at getting things done. Success here depends on how willing you are to follow the AIG process.
good,"Relaxed work environment, most people were willing to help advance your skills and gave you opportunities with projects if you showed that you are motivated to learn and will deliver results"
good,"When I worked in the NJ/NY offices for a different group - I would have given the company an excellent rating.  "
good,"AIG is like a family. We had weekends off and publick hilidays too, had free lunches and working tjere was a geat pleasure. Work was done on time and a lot of new things to learn."
good,"it is a place of work, that allow a lot of days off,  the best part of the job is being able to listen to must.  they do provide free bags of fresh popped popcorn.  well hope this is what you wanted to know"
good,"I learned that the harder you worked and were good at your job you would not be promoted, those who didn't perform were moved up the ladder while others were not."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my team who were very cooperative and respectful. Management in general was easy to communicate with.
good,It is a cool place to work I enjoyed my coworkers but one thing I didn't like is that I you have to wait 3 months for your commission check & I found myself drink less water because in order to qualify for commission you had to be at you desk for a certain percentage of the day therefore I made sure I didn't have to take a bathroom break so I wouldn't become ineligible for my hard earned bonus.
good,Management give employee freedom to come up with innovative solutions. Learn to lead global cross functional team. Opportunities to help business to created innovative solutions.
good,I liked working there very much.  Met a lot of nice people and had fun while doing my job.  Flexible working hours and work life balance.  Enjoyed my job very much.
good,there was nice and mean people but the nice people made it all worth it. working in the shipping department was lots of fun.There was times of complicated work and less hands on training.
good,AIG was a good introductory opportunity into the business but I did not feel like there we’re many learning opportunities or room for growth. Management was dependent on who you were assigned to work with and the work was not split evenly amongst interns.
good,"While working for AIG i learned a ton of information. This field is great. The company on the other hand is something different. Not secure at all. Due to financial issues, they are having a massive amount of layoffs and my department is dwindling down to only a few individuals. Slowly they are transitioning to moving everything overseas."
good,"It is a good company,. just too much change happening. The benefits are good but the hours are very long. It is a good company,. just too much change happening."
good,"I never worked at AIG, but did some consulting for them.  Indeed is insisting I rate AIG in order to upload my resume.  It was fun working with them through the capacity."
good,An environment that facilitated productivity and competitiveness. Also allowed for independent time and project management with healthy benefits and pension.
good,"Good office atmosphere"
good,"Spent 20+ years there. "
good,AIG is a complex organization.  Can be chaotic at times.  It provides plenty of career opportunities.  Sometimes it is fast paced other times small decisions are slowed down by bureaucracy.
good,I enjoyed my time at AIG.  The management was always helpful and knowledgeable.  We had great teams in our departments and it was fun to come to work each day.
good,Ok place to work if you are a ok with contract. Decent work environment and i learned a lot. Learned a new remote tool and got more experience with Active Directory
good,Great job and environment. Would recommend for an aggressive sales men. Very face paced. Very relaxed environment. Managers are very helpful and try their best to accommodate employees needs.
good,Smaller company purchased by larger. Smaller company was dysfunctional but had a lot of dedicated employees. Systems were outdated but have been updated since then.
good,"méthodes très américaines avec plateau ouvert bruyant"
good,"Very Friendly staff but a busy environment, i recommend this job if you are looking to get experience from a multi platform systems."
good,"OK place to work. No salary increase, hard to get promoted. You must move around to make more money. Flexible work hours. Great employees like family. Most work days are extremely busy. The job is not challenging."
good,AIG has provided me with the tools to advance my career. My direct supervisors are second to none and have supported me throughout my 10 years at the company.
good,"The team I was on was great.  We helped each other to make sure that everyone shined.  Pretty sad that 13 out of 15 of us were let go.  Most of us felt bewildered why were let go; if it was because the expenditures were too high, then why keep hiring senior executives."
good,"- Cách quản lý công việc tài liệu một cách khoa học"
good,"The company tries to run with the herd, it tries to get the latest technology and devices to use."
good,"Good management and friendly workplace. People are open to different perspectives and opinions. There is unity in diversity and everyone works in harmony to a common goal. Since its a captive setup, there are very limited growth opportunities.The movement across teams and processes (lateral and vertical) is not free flowing. All in all it is a good company with hard-core exposure to the Insurance sector, as it is one of the global leaders in their industry."
good,"I was an underwriter assistant and content at the time. I was assigned to an underwriter that was willing to train me. But as time grew and underwriters started to get laid off or quit, I was then promoted to be an underwriter. The manager that was under was not a good mentor. After restructuring of the organization, my unit was thrown around and did not know who we reported to."
good,"If it weren't for the level of uncertainty, I would never leave. Working here has been a great experience thus far and the only hope is that will continue in some structured form."
good,"It used to be a great company to work for.  Over the past 6-10 years, the morale of the workforce has been deteriorating due to the constant fear of being laid-off.  The company posts positive financial numbers quarter after quarter yet employees are laid off often."
good,Constant change breeds instability constant feelings of insecurity of job progressions.  Hiring freezes as a result of poor company performance.medioc
good,"*Great work and life balance"
good,Serious ambiguity about company management. Lack of structure. Company has been trying to rightsize for years and can't seem to get it right. Work life balance is good.
good,"My time at AIG was contract work, not full time. my manager and the team I worked for were great. i cannot provide feedback ion the company, the benefits, etc as I was a contractor and did not have experience with any of this"
good,"If you like highly competitive culture, this Shared Service is the place for you.   There are great rewards for high production achievement and great mentoring program.    Check out the website."
good,It was a good place to work until new management took over I do appreciate the experience that I have learned to take with me to another step and experience in my life.
good,"Loved the job , but they walked in to a meeting one day and let all agent go , said they were taking another route. Would have loved to stay with company"
good,"This was the very first company I worked for but I was actually hired through a placement agency so I can't really tell so much about this company. "
good,It has been many years since I worked at this company and the office I worked for shut down. While i worked there management had transitioned and they were struggling.
good,"its an alright company, hard to move up unless you know somebody, very low pay in my opinion. Very relaxed work place environment. Depending on the area you get hired in the hours can be flexible."
good,"During my time at AIG (American International Group), I was able to successfully increase productivity and greatly reduce exposure to potential liabilities with the creation of and implementation of databases and reports; perform end-to-end over sight of alternative investment month end processes and identify, track, and age variances in transactions for review, analysis and subsequent resolution."
good,"I worked in the claims division of AIG. I worked with some of the most experienced supevisors and managers ever.  Like most claim departments, the number of incoming claim can be challenging."
good,"Temporary position, finite, hired by a temp agency.  Company site was closing. Friendly staff and supervisors, many company perks, community oriented."
good,This was my first time working as an Investment Advisor.  I learned much information about financial planning and retirement.  My career was going along great until AIG shut down our office.
good,"Found the employees to be uninterested in assisting us in doing our job."
good,I worked in the Troy office doing insurance applications for other states which our agents were not qualified to do. The customers did not know they were calling in to Michigan.
good,"Had a good experience, learned a lot and moved up the corporate ladder with good mentorship along the way. The company would benefit from a better workplace culture."
good,"The culture of AIG changed as I progressed in my career. Promotion from within was strong, but as I went into a niche market there was little room for growth. Depending on the manager the experience with the company could be great or sour. My last job title I was not compensated at the proper salary grade because I came from another office. Instead of increasing my salary and salary grade, it was left three grades lower. I'd applied for positions with the same job title and the same job description but was told that I could not get the salary grade three levels higher."
good,"Good place to work, learned a great deal on the overall operations of the business. Collaborative environment for the most part. There is a high turnover rate in IT upper management. Hardest part of the job is connecting with the various departments within the organization as the company is very large. It takes awhile to develop these relationship so that you can connect with the right people to get your job done."
good,Company went through several reorganizations while i was there however my colleagues always maintained a good attitude and focused on the projects/tasks in front of them.
good,"I enjoyed my coworkers, the job function in itself, the flexibility to work remotely when necessary, my mentor and assistant manager were both great as educators and as people. The main drawback, and it was a big one, was an incompetent, recluse manager who did not much enjoy being around people, seemed dismissive of female opinions, talked about women's attractiveness in the work place, and really lacked expertise in the field we were in, and was in the office what seemed like three days a week on average."
good,overall good. they are trying a modern workplace culture with open floor plan. everyone is kind and wants to help you. stressful work with good people
good,"Used to be a very good place - now not so much.  IT is much more about compliance and paper, and less about solving problems and moving the business forward."
good,"AIG is a very fast paced environment.  Very entrepreneurial shop, but like any other organization, the process of getting deals done can become very cumbersome.  Difficult to be nimble."
good,never acutally worked for aig was a vendor in their facility. people seemed nice and they always had something going on to help the communicty. ie: packing supplies for hurricane victims in puerto rico
good,A typical day would consist of 
good,"Good benefits and a management team that listens to feedback that can have a positive impact on outdated processes and procedures. However, with AIG being such a large company, change takes quite a long time to get through the proper channels before they can be implemented."
good,"The job was fine, we received training, the hours were flexible and the job was laid back. The compensation was also fair, but given the option I would chose not to work off commission."
good,The Office is on Wall Street. Well actually Pine street. So working New York City was a new adventure. I really enjoyed the people and the work. I then went their R and D in Boston.
good,"Full time employee for a finance company;"
good,"Helping people resolve there financial issues on a daily basis also assisting member's with loan paybacks, assisting with hardship requests and helping with members change stock options."
good,"Reorg always happening."
good,"Productive and fun place to work. Fast paced.  Very busy.  At times stressful.  Cost conscious,   Good people to work with.  Management does its best to ensure the staff engages in social events to balance the hard work with social events"
good,It was a great job for the short time I was there. My coworkers were great. Most of the management was good. I unfortunately didn't have a good manager.
good,"Good Company. Insurance based environment focusing on both Commercial and Consumer insurance products both domestically and internationally."
good,I am feeling good  but its not great . Some people criticized as its bail out company during recession . So i am not feeling good to say some one refer to work .
good,This was an experiment to see if aig could be an agency life insurance company. Howev er it did not work out. They did not have the support system in place.
good,Just seemed to be a run of the mill call center job. They sell it as a Customer Service role. Just answering calls. Helping no one but their bottom line.
good,"Good company to work for with good benefits, but they don’t offer raises  the starting pay is very low . They have montory over time with only 1 day notices. The shift changes every quarter based of your performance"
good,"good work lift balance, friendly people to work with, one day promote, nice working environment, fairly paid, lots of good training staff, holiday days paid."
good,Good place to work.  Enjoyed working in the HR dept.  Management and President is nice.  I haven't worked there in awhile so not sure  how it is to work there now.
good,It depends on which department you would work. AIG in general is a great process oriented company. Their SDLC process is very book like and you can't go wrong anywhere.
good,"Company has been in a state of flux since CEOs retirement in 2015.  Sadly, the CEO that was put in place (Hancock) was asked to retire.  Company is going thru a lot of organizational changes."
good,Job is wonderful.  There is a lot to learn on the job. Workplace culture is great. The hardest part of the job is to learn all of the applications that AIG supports.Meeting new people the teamwork is wonderful.
good,this is a wonderful company to work for. I work there when it was American General.  I work for this company for 21 years.  If I was able I will go back and work for them.
good,"Working at night"
good,"Day to day consists of answering phones with a high call volume. 2 15 minute breaks (paid) and 1 hour lunch (unpaid) per day. As a CSR you are highly micromanaged and must be on the phone every second scheduled. Depending upon the department, your calls will involve various tasks involving assisting insureds, agent, third parties, medical providers, and attorneys. The teams within the departments consist of a great group of individuals. Teammates will often quickly assist and support one another. The most enjoyable part of this job is being able to help others. However, the hardest part of the job is the lack of pay and difficulty in advancing within the company. If you plan to remain a customer service representative your entire career, this might be the position for you."
good,"When I worked in customer service it was a fun atmosphere, but little pay. I moved to sales for more pay & all the fun went out the window. We don't get any appreciation for what we do. There are great benefits, health 401k, even 2 weeks paid vacation of the bat, however there are no pay raises. None! So if you don't change positions or move up you're such with the same pay no matter how good you are at your job, no matter what the economy is like, no raise!"
good,"I worked for AIG in NY office, Wall Street. The company was large with varying personalities. Most of the management is fair. I learned a lot here. Each of my workdays were every different, making it more enjoyable to me."
good,"The organization was wonderful staff. The processes were well chalked out and it was a very  innovative experience to work there."
good,So many changes taking place now and over the last few years. Seems to be heading in the right direction and has a great customer focus. The people that work there are the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,Good support from the management. Good place to work and learn about different communities. Salary is good and one can make lots of incentives and bonus
good,"I have worked for AIG since 2013 and have had a handful of experiences during my time working for this company. A typical day for the department I currently work in is filled with working out of queues, reviewing Divorce and Power of Attorney documents while working with other processors in those same and different queues. Management tends to work fairly well with employees, especially if an emergency arises or the sudden need to take time off occurs. The job can be a bit stressful sometimes but overall, AIG is not a bad place to work."
good,"High paced environment included live trading with many companies and independent traders making trades in the commodities market.  Great place to work, however due to electronic trading, the physical pits have since been closed."
good,Very challenging.  Data center is set in their procedure and not open for change.  Every day was a challenge and recommendations made for improvement were usually no acted upon.
good,"Prime Responsibilities:"
good,Nice place to work for but not having long term projects. rest all is fine and we get our own space to express the views and thoughts while working here . I will rate 3.
good,"Normal hours. High turnover due to nature of business. Pay didn't match work. Solid job for someone looking for good benefits. Culture was fine, just high turnover."
good,This was a temp job in the Head Office. Made photocopies and helped the Office Manager with personnel files making sure that everything was up to date.
good,"Coordinate communications regrding order status with all constituents of the order which can include claims adjusters, nurse case managers, physicians, claimants, and suppliers."
good,"Totally self generated sales. Very little to no support to field agents form local management. They will want you to sell to all of your friends and family in your first 2 months, then leave you on your own to find clients."
good,Company's upper management was not watching the active management of company's assets which led to the collapse of the US economy. I grew to the top 3% of annuity producers in a tri-state area within the first yr. Company went bankrupt after which I decided to get out of the financial services industry.
good,"I gain a lot of new experience"
good,It wasn't until I was put on a team that I really felt like part of the company. I did learn how to use new software and went over my skills in Excel.
good,I learned all my insurance basics working at AIG and it was invaluable to me. At that time AIG was the 800 lbs gorilla of the insurance world and I would never have had that experience anywhere else.
good,Your experience really depends on your team and your boss. Some co-workers are not willing to learn new stuff and just want to secure their jobs. Not a good choice to work here if you really want to do something in your career.
good,"Employees are rewarded for their performance. Although salaries don't start high, they train their employees well that provides a solid foundation should they decide to move to other opportunities."
good,It has been a pleasure to work for one of AIG's smaller divisions.  Big company resources with a little company attitude.  Gained experiences I wouldn't have had the opportunity elsewhere.
good,AIG is a good place to begin a career and obtain insurance business knowledge to last a lifetime.  There does appear to be a considerable learning curve upon entry that some people may struggle with.
good,As the title says. There were too many towers at aig within the IT group to ever accomplish a cohesive end product. They did not foster a well flowing devops community and were not really willing to do so.
good,"I currently manage NCM from the Midwest to the West Coast. Work closely with AIG adjusters and their managers as well as our UR department, Medical affairs department and other supervisors and managers within the TCM unit. Provide QA audits on nurses from coast to coast. Analysis outcomes and implement a POA for improvement of the scores to meet the needs of Company and the customer. I enjoy teaching and training nurses; providing feedback on the progression made."
good,Good company but need to improve management skills. Too much over time and management is too old fashion. Company is doing oursourcing. Think again when you apply the job there.
good,good company to work with but the pay out is very less as compared to work. great culture but the management is little confusing as there communication channel is slow
good,"Expertise in on-site transition, operation management & project management."
good,"Captive & BPO work culture                  "
good,"Great vacation and time off schedule, Great location, nice building. Great parking. Many places to have lunch and great working hours."
good,"Working in several departments and cities for this company, I noticed the same conservative culture throughout and little innovation too.  But they did have a good send of work/life balance."
good,"Everyday is different. I get to talk to different people everyday. I learn everyday from the Managers and my Co-workers. "
good,It's a great company headquaterred in US with regional offices leading each country business. The workplace culture is very open. Working time can be flexible. Can frequenty communicate with the counterpart in other countries in work.
good,"Good compensation, benefits are standard for the industry but used to be better, corporate culture is poor, raises don't happen as expectation is that you will take on a new job or additional responsibilities to increase pay"
good,"The working environment was not friendly, staff was never considered as part of group. "
good,I liked my job.  My manager was wonderful.  The hours were great. I enjoyed my time there and the free education. I made many friends there. The training was well done.
good,"A typical day is a metrics of 50 calls. However with the recent change in company infrastructure, basically the huge layoff of agents. All calls were routed to the call center employees since agents were no longer there to assist."
good,Productive and the people that I had worked with were all very nice.  Everyone was very helpful when I first started working.  I was able to reach out and get the answers that I was looking for.
good,"Bonne entente avec le personnel."
good,People were great to work with. Plenty of claims to keep you more than busy on daily basis. Managment ok but could have been more supportive and rewarded employees better.
good,"AIG is the good organisation, there are lots of thing which i have learn new ideas and domain knowledge. i had nice experience with team member they are supportive and well culture . "
good,Productive Workplace. I have worked with AIG for eight years and I am currently looking for a Customer Service or Administrative position.
good,"Desde o inicio de 2016, a empresa esta passando por um momento de ruptura na estrategia e modelo de gestao global."
good,"My co-workers are awesome and they mingle with me very well and they are very supportive,i like working with them with nice team work."
good,Exciting place to work.  Time on the road took more than I was willing to give at the time from family. My children are no longer in school so that is not an issue.
good,"This is a non-life insurance company. I was assigned to Finance and Collections Department and was part of Legal, Compliance, Regulatory, Bankruptcy and Collections team. It was nice working with the team as we value everyone's effort. We normally focus on the solution and not the problem itself."
good,Worked with very bright people and enjoyed the team we put together. We collaborated with AIG Investments and applied the most appropriate technology for the needed business solutions.
good,"Compensation is above market compared to similar roles, however, company culture and focus on employee and development overall is poor.  In general a knee jerk reaction organization with limited planning and due diligence related to substantial organizational decisions. A great firm for short periods in ones career"
good,"My job was very busy, always meeting new people.  Workplace, it was great to work with AIG until company decided that there was no place for our offices and let all go.  I enjoyed working there, people were great and would still be working if this did not happen to me and  all my co-workers"
good,"Management sucks, but job is good and benefits are excellent.  Paid time off is great, benefits and PTO start day 1."
good,"Good Company until the end."
good,"working and learning new project to start digitial transformation"
good,"Very structured, predictable, precision-focused processing job. Heavy overtime requirements, internal communication and problem-solving focused."
good,"I worked in Alpharetta location they closed down in 2015. No raises in four years just a once a year ""bonus"". Advancement was not fair. Managers chose friends not better workers that applied for positions. Some managers were great and others tried to put blame on there employees if something went wrong. They were very fair on severance when office closed. Quality reviews every month must hit 98 percent or get written up and couseled. Very strict attendance because so many people abused calling in sick years ago. Vacation time was good. And eworking four days a week was great but with all the restructuring no job security."
good,"A typical work day for me is coming checking my voicemail and emails for my daily task"
good,"Bit hard since you work with teachers, and they are out of office for about three months every year. It's hard to get them to agree to meet with you, and discuss their retirement, while they are on vacation."
good,"Great company overall, but depending on what area you work in not much room for advancement and the pay is not good! Would be better company if advancement was possible."
good,After almost 15 years not a very promising position; They outsourced a lot of jobs including mine. I don't feel like it was fair
good,The company is in the process of major layoffs. The job is a wonderful place to work. I work with a great group of people who are all willing to work as a team to get our jobs accomplished.
good,It is a great opportunity to work in the company and i have learned a lot especially the knowledge of work and i enjoy working with my co-workers.
good,Firma solidna do momentu kiedy właścicielami byli Amerykanie
good,"In general, it is a good company. working hours are flexible. Tuition reimbursement plan are nice. But the company is too big, therefore your visibility is very low."
good,"Working as Onsite Coordinator,Managing a team of 5 member is responsible for Estimation, Design, Development, Training and delivery of the product for project and  overall quality of the deliverable by the team."
good,"Riche d'une longue expérience au sein du département comptable et financier j'ai pu constater son essor, son expansion. Les processus mis en place, l'environnement fort en contrôle interne m'ont permis de développer des notions incontournables afin de répondre tant aux enjeux de fiabilité des données financières que du respect des délais de clôture. Ces réalisations ont été possible grâce à un fort esprit d'équipe, un élément moteur indéniable."
good,its an overall great company i just feel they could improve their training for the processors not just the call agents. As well as have nicer managers.
good,"Great Benefits, work from home options, able to move around within the company. Great Leadership, retirement plan, good culture and community involvement"
good,one of the most stable company in our country and has supportive management. A fun work place because of working alongside your friends with common interest.  But we do have a challenging job and that's make our work more interesting and exciting.
good,"I worked here a long time ago.  It a decent company to work for good, benefits, nice people, training. There was a lot of investigation to be done. I learned a lot there."
good,Very busy environment but fun.  Co-worker are friendly and always willing to help.  I have the opportunity to learn new database and improve the skills.  The hardest of the job the work load can be overwhelming
good,An amazing atmosphere among colleagues but too much politics in upper management. A few life time friends were created in the trenches; and certainly some life lessons on not being too trusting in upper management.
good,Empresa em start up me deu uma visão mais geral sobre a área de Recursos Humanos o que me ajudou muito.
good,"Good places to learn new data center technologies. Lots company activities (free lunch on Wednesday, free movie, sport event) however at the same time fill with red tape and politics."
good,"My review is somewhat bias, as i started working for AIG Sun America in 2008 right before the great financial crisis.  This being my first real job out of college, i was thrown into a situation no one could have prepared me for.  I will say that upper management did a great job keeping the environment as lively and upbeat as possible."
good,"My job consisted of independent investigative work, however the position is no longer available due to a elimination of the position.  They provided good benefits and flexible work hours with a work from home environment."
good,"I dont really like sitting all day in 1 place with head phones on. But it is a good job to have, it has great benifits and the people you work with is great people"
good,Not much in the way of stability.  Frequent reorganizations and management changes.  No commitment to keeping an NYC footprint or staff in that region.
good,"Very nice people, however, have given too much freedom third party vendors, become confusing at times whom to deal with."
good,In this company I learned how to manage TIME & WORK PRESSURE as during quarter end we have to stretch and provide deliverables. Overall management is too good and my manager & co-workers are too supportive & too lucky to work with them.
good,"Designing and delivering training"
good,"Working for AIG was exciting to work for such a huge company and I was given many opportunities to advance. Overall, I enjoyed my career and had very good pay and very good benefits.  I did however have to work out of town a great deal and I would travel 500 miles a week between appointments and the office.  The middle and upper management positions were very short lived.  Most associate managers lasted only three years, it was very competitive and there was always someone more eager and without a family that was willing to take the assignment you had to pass up.  A downfall in working with AIG was the downfall of AIG several years ago and my position and many others were eliminated when the company was bailed out by the US government."
good,"Un muy buen nivel laboral en presencia del mercado, con respaldo económico importante de la Multinacional."
good,"I worked hard while with AIG, and was able to develop useful skills by interacting with co-workers.  I also assisted in the training of a number of individuals.  I facilitated a higher morale, and made the office a more pleasant place to work."
good,Being with my team is like being with my family. Really fun working atmosphere. I learned a lot and I am thankful to be part of this company.
good,Love working in the Belle Vernon office.  AIG is hard to work for.  They need better structuring.  Sales force needs a base salary and then commission on top of that.  To hard to make a living and get a pay check with how slow they are.
good,"Typical day, is answering emails, taking or making calls to brokers or underwriters if need be and following up on documents that are needed, invoicing and pulling work to process."
good,Fast paced work environment sometimes with short time frames for projects.  Ability can exist to move from project to project.
good,very good company for start up career and will get opportunity to learn here. Benefits are very less and salary is negotiable
good,"Workplace is nice.."
good,There have been multiple layoffs over the past three years. There is not a lot of training provided at AIG. You mostly learn from doing and making mistakes as you go.
good,"Mis prácticas se han desarrollado de una forma agradable, dentro de un ambiente de trabajo que invitaba al aprendizaje."
good,"	Managed and grew book of business of $45.8 million from 2012 to 2013."
good,"AIG was not particularly a pleasant firm to work for years ago but with it's complete renovation in the last few years may very well be a good investment for your time, effort and even money."
good,"Great place to work for seasoned employees in the insurance industry. Not a great place to work for employees who are starting out as there is very little training offered. Most training is offered ""on the job"" which is fine but be prepared as volume picks up quickly and you can fall behind before you know it. Management provides autonomy to work your diary/files. If you are highly organized, this is a great place for you!"
good,"Takes for ever to gain full access to be able to fully do job duties, poor comunication to the processing floor, great people who work around you."
good,"Calls are non-stop, and a lot of them are people who we have already called several times.  Most leads are either worthless or ice cold.  A good sales person can make a lot of money, but it is hard to succeed unless you can get out of the outbound calls and into the inbound."
good,"Good experience if you are starting out in financial services.  Required to make lots of phone calls and sometimes drive out to peoples homes to collect their money for their past due accounts.  Can go to some pretty poor areas to collect this money, such as trailer parks and inner city ghettos."
good,"This job require that you know what insurance we take and what we don't take.  Also, if were going to pay or not."
good,"Bank no longer exists, was a great place to learn and develop"
good,AIG was a great place to work for but the management was not very approachable to speak with.
good,"Currently a business analyst in the Vendor Governance group.  This is a very unique and interesting in that it exposes me to an area of compliance and risk management as it relates to vendor engagement. "
good,"Until September of 2012, AIG was subject to the many US state insurance regulators as well as various international regulators in the countries in which the Group operates.  "
good,"Provided 24X7 support for all areas of responsibility with tenacity.  Consistently implemented complex e-commerce applications utilizing AIX, Linux, Solaris and Intel platforms together with various software packages as well as in house developed for seventeen years."
good,co-workers were great...got laid off when it all went south
good,"Being sensitive to my clients and team mate’s needs, and delivering superior service are genuine concerns of mine. I take great satisfaction in working with clients to ensure repetitive business and generate referrals to enhance my employer’s reputation."
good,"American International Group, Inc. (AIG) is a leading international insurance organization serving customers in more than 130 countries."
good,Answered questions about balance and interest rate. Sent out correspondence/statements. Gave general advice about what they should do with their retirement. Advise of rules and guidelines of having an annuity.
good,"Professional work environment with a small company feeling.  The department and coworkers I have are an extension of my family.  Managers are flexible with start times due to family concerns and commute. Unfortunately, with the quarterly deadlines, which causes for long work hours, and the long commute it requires a lot of time away from my immediate family."
good,Fun and Productive environment; learned a lot during my time there. The best stepping stone in my career. I really appreciate everything that job has taught me and the experience I gained.
good,I enjoyed the pleasant working environment at this company.
good,"Responsible for all administrative functions for Real Estate, Oil and Gas and Venture Capital investment partnerships."
good,"Fast pace environment."
good,AIG is going through a period of re-branding itself and so it has been very interesting time to work at AIG.
good,A very busy invironment where you will be working together as a team within your department which is one of the best part.
good,This was the first job where I was able to apply the skills I learned through my college education and learn new skills.
good,This was a short experience due the merger between ABN Banco Real with Banco Santander Brasil.
good,Reviewed adjustments on daily basis ensuring legal compliance.  Operating during normal business hours.
good,A typical day is understaffed teams working weekends for little pay
good,"Finished the assigned task for the day. Meeting targets. Come early to work. "
good,"a typical day at work "
good,"Took the position thinking I would gain growth within my field. Was told the only way to move up was to switch gears completely, and become a part of the sales force. I loved my co-workers but left because ultimately I did not want to be in sales, nor stay in the same Marketing position forever."
good,Great place to work...friendly atmosphere and great group of people to work with.
good,"great company, worked for almost 8 years. typical day is normal. co-workers are great team"
good,"Meeting with Business Owners, CPA's, HR Managers. Reviewing business operations, employee duties, payroll/accounting records. Touring various business operations to determine risk and classification"
good,Enjoyed my 10 years at AIG. Worked with a number of business continuity discipline. Do not regret relocating from Boston to make this career move.
good,Work is boring and doesn't offer room for advancement unless willing to locate. Limited opportunities with location. 
good,"Handled 50 to 75 calls per day in a busy contact center environment, creating and presenting renewal proposals to existing clients, adhered to cross-selling goals which were frequently surpassed, helped to increase company profits with up-selling additional insurance products and coverages."
good,"Both of my stints at SunAmerica AIG were enjoyable and I learned so much.  The hardest part of this position was being brought in with a contractor and having to figure most things out by myself.  They did offer great benefits and good pay."
good,Good place to work. Allowed management team to make decisions.
good,I enjoyed working here.  The people was friendly and willing to help each other.  I was very happy with the work  place and would recommend them to others.
good,"I began working at Agency Auto as a Temp in 2001, and after 90 days hired permanently to handle high -risk specialty claims. It was a rewarding work environment. After 3 years I was promoted to the Commercial Division."
good,I enjoyed working at AIG. Best part would be the co-workers!
good,Not as multicultural as I expected; unfortunatelly this company does not exists any longer as it used to be
good,Learned sound underwriting practices. Management very encouraging. Great place to learn
good,I worked in subrogation so I dealt with other insurance companies and uninsured parties directly to try and get money paid out back.
good,I learned a lot about worker's compensation and how to review claims we received. Management was a little racist.
good,Admin support for insurance company exceptional learning experience.
good,Ensure accurate accounting and reporting of the investments
good,Each day presents a new set of challenges but typically new ideas are promoted and vetted. Teams are created to test and implement projects to promote efficiency and save money.
good,This company has some of the best incentives I've ever been part of.
good,"AIG values its employees and encourage growth. Excellent benefits were also provided,"
good,"very organized structured work environment. Daily learning opportunities. top heavy management,"
good,The environment did not offer opportunities for internal advancement. Opted to hire from outside company for newly created opportunities. Communication from senior management was poor.
good,Of course I learn new things everyday. Fun to be with the people I work with. That's actually the reason why I love working there. Though management appreciation is being begged. Compensation is not that OK in my region. I'm not sure in other regions.
good,"The Householder Group was a nice place to work. Unfortunately, I did not learn applicable skills during this internship to help me find a better position."
good,A typical day as a Project Manager is working with cross-functional teams to launch company initiatives.
good,"excellent customer service , detail orient, mulit-task, people friendly"
good,Was only at the company for a short period of time.
good,This is a workplace where they trained their staff
good,Very political environment. Management was difficult to work with at times.
good,A typical day at work included reviewing previous day's productivity and adjusting daily and monthly goals accordingly. Reviewing live and recorded calls of staff was a daily task followed by one on one sessions with staff as needed.
good,"Very easy job, clients and coworkers were very easy to get along with."
good,Management over work their employee's and do not offer compensation for the etra million and one things they ask of the employee's
good,"big company just a number and pencil pusher. stressful work environment, great benefits, really try to boost morale for employees but just a stressful job"
good,AIG is a corporate structure dedicated to selling various insurance products.
good,The most rewarding part of the job was satisfying tne clients who really apreciated my call. The management and executive staff alwsys reward you when a client called back about the service you give.
good,"It was an OK place to start my professional career, but since the department was so small, promotion was almost impossible."
good,"Initiated over a 100 outgoing collection calls to prior customers, negotiated payment arrangements. Researched disputes and provided follow up to ensure a resolution."
good,"The job can be very demanding, but management and co-workers are great and easy to work with as a team."
good,"Great People., great people, good work life/family balance."
good,"Provides a great service to clients and community.Flexible work environment, great work life balance. Great benefits"
good,"Work from home option has been very effective over the last 2 years."
good,"Company provides good pay and benefits, which is why most people stay as long as they can.  However, senior management appears to not care about employees, as there is high turnover at executive management levels.  As a result, reorganizations and restructuring is occurring every 6 months for the time period that I have worked there."
good,"It's a call center.. company culture is good.. it can be a fun place to work.. they get into holidays and have contests and games amongst teams.. co workers are cool.. overtime is usually available.. very high call volume, very fast paced, very upset customers lol.. as long as you're used to working escalated calls you'll be fine. It's a warranty company.. so all the calls are from people who had something go wrong.. broke their phone.. refrigerator stopped working.. washer is leaking water.. it will never be a happy customer on the other end of the phone haha but it can be fulfilling helping people who are in a tough spot.. so if you have the right mindset it might work for you. They don't pay amazing but they've got better since I worked there. I think I made $9.50/h back in 2016 and they raised it to $11/h after I left. You get paid more working in other departments.."
good,The company clearly prioritizes shareholder returns over employee satisfaction. Work hours are not flexible. Compensation and benefits are competitive.
good,"Good when I started here - management was laid back and it was easy to network in a big company. Things turned sour over time with countless reorgs, massive layoffs, and abysmal employee morale. It still was easy to work there, but the more recent years I was there I wasn't learning anything new and no one had any faith in the management."
good,very great working environment and very organized. Some people treated staff poorly and some were very respectful and nice but for the most part its your typical workplace culture.
good,"overall good company to work for. good benefits, nice atmosphere. nice location. good support staff. i would recommend this company to work for. conveniently located in tampa."
good,"Working on the Service Desk is a good opportunity to experience multiple applications and systems. AIG does not give pay raises, they expect employees to increase their compensation through moving to different positions within the company. However, it is very difficult for Service Desk Analysts to move off of the Service Desk. In theory it should be easy, but in practice it is difficult. This lack of advancement seemed to be limited to the Service Desk. Other departments appeared to be better suited to career advancement within the AIG corporation."
good,"Different job program"
good,"Looking back, I think I could have handled the stress better if it wasn't my first job. Not for the inexperienced. The job was okay but the management sometimes was confusing and overwhelming. I got yelled at a lot by one manager because I often made mistakes."
good,"Was a good atmosphere but has changed as it is going through a transition. Work force reductions, reports and lack of knowledge create a stressful day to day."
good,It was a great opportunity working at AIG.  I was able to grow and increase my skills.  I was given an opportunity for promotion and to advance my skills.
good,"Be prepared for leadership changes and managerial initiatives.  A nice place to work with good hours and a stable business / product.  Some things are old fashioned, as expected."
good,"AIG has an excellent work life balance and truly invest in their employees. If you have a great manager your growth potential is endless. Unfortunately, without a good manager you will either be stuck in the same seat until you proactively work to change managers."
good,"Job can be a steep learning curve pending on where you're placed in the company. Training is improving overall within the company as a whole, but more focus is needed in certain areas. Work can be fast paced, overtime required if you are a same day processor, i.e. Capital Transfers area. Benefits are good, better than many other places, however pay starts low at entry level and does not climb as quickly as other companies."
good,"Great benefits and they have open opportunities for you to grow. Management just needs a lot of work."
good,"Lot of flexibility, worked from home 3 -5 days a week. Work, life, and balance was great as well. The team i worked with was awesome and they had team outing all the time."
good,"Nice people to work with"
good,Your entire income is determined by your production and commissions therefrom. Can be a good or bad thing.  Management is very hands off and work/life balance is very good.
good,All depends on who you are being managed by. I started off with a great supervisor and ended with a not so great supervisor. There is no place for movement in certain divisions of AIG.
good,"AIG provides very competitive pay.  The atmosphere is tense as the company has been struggling to find an identity for more than 5 years.  Transformation is continuous be doesn't have a defined start and end point.  Technology is behind the bar and unfortunately the organization doesn't have the budget to further invest in automation or emerging technologies.  "
good,"I found an incredible number of talented, committed employees at AIG and the overall work/life balance and benefits were great. However, AIG is hampered by the typical large public company constraints of proving quarter-by-quarter improvements to analysts and investors. They made major moves in cost-reduction, as the fastest lever to pull, but some moves felt less-than-strategic, and dropped successful initiatives and personnel. My opinion: it is the pressure of quarterly reports that is driving what could be an incredible company to less than strategically optimal decisions."
good,"Good job, not great. Traveled to many countries which was nice. However, the amount of hours and work needed for the minimal payoff was not good. Needed more support from management for advancement. Favorites and politics were very bad."
good,AIG was a good place to learn different products in an entrepreneurial environment.  Constant change in management and vision was the most difficult part of the job
good,"Like any company, AIG's working environment depends on the department.  Each department I've worked in had completely different settings and culture.  Overall it was a good place to work.  The biggest negative of course is the lack of stability, always wondering if you will be part of next lay off wave.  Compensation is not great because of their condition as well."
good,"Mired in political issues early, I never had a proper chance at career advancement. I was paid ok but only in my last year. The bonuses were awfully low for low level employees."
good,Very good benefits and PTO. Organization people for the most part is friendly and is willing to listen to different ideas. Job security is an issue (layoffs tend to be somewhat frequent).
good,"Managers are helpful, they rely their trust on you."
good,"My experiance as an AIG was a challenging yet very rewarding experience"
good,Workplace culture was very welcoming and enjoyable for interns. The hardest part of the job was getting work that was related to our field because I was an intern.
good,"AIG SunAmerica is company that sells individual annuity products in all 50 states.  During that time I had worked in several different departments learning variety of function and developing a full understanding of the daily operations of the company.  This required me and all employees of the company to have a basic understanding of all federal and individual state regulation within the insurance industry.  One of my primary daily functions in the Compensation Department was to run audits for some of our larger broker-dealers that sold our products including companies like Edward Jones and Morgan Stanley.  These audits were done to verify commission events and to ensure there were no discrepancies found within.  If any were found, I was responsible to research the cause and determine if this was a one off situation or if there was any ongoing situation that would need to be address.  Once the problem was determine, I was responsible for making all necessary adjustment to correct the commission payout.  In addition, over the last three years, I was primary representative handling all collection duties for the Compensation (Commission) Department; which average about $1,000.00 in debt collection from other companies a week.   All of this while maintaining a high quality of customer services to all of our internal and external customers."
good,"Salary is low differ to other company. - Workload and need to handle stress very well - Hard to get a promotion, - Your performance will determines your rating, bonus and increment - A minimal work life balance environment - This is a multinational company hence, your working hours based on the country that you served"
good,"The work was stressful and the co-workers did not really get reprimanded for being rude to each other. The management is wonderful besides that, they're understanding and always pushing you to be a better you. The hardest part of the job is the constant screaming customers, but you will get that being a Supervisor anywhere. I enjoyed helping my customers the most. I was able to be the person who followed the claims all the way through and assisted them until they were able to be fully satisfied."
good,"I felt like the management at AIG was top-notch.  After being at AIG for less than a year, they restructured their whole sales force and laid off over 2,000 employees."
good,Work environment is good. There's a pantry for all the employees and the security of the management is quiete good compare to other BPO company. You can enjoy all of these upon employment.
good,"The Company the recent years been working on a work/life balance, promoting Flexible work arrangements whenever possible. They have also continued to encourage training and development"
good,"AIG offers great benefits and a laid back work environment.  Management needs a lot of work, but if you find yourself working under a great leader stick with them."
good,Great Insurance for Customers but shortage of managers and support team. Job provided balance.  Culture was lacking due to office short of staff support
good,"The AIG Law Department was very law firm-like.  Long hours and lots of interesting assignments.  However, top managers where uninterested and lacked basic management skills."
good,Good working environment. Company still restructuring after financial issues. Good compensation and benefits package.  Good working atmosphere and work life balance.
good,"This is a great company if you are looking to get your start in customer service.  Their benefits are wonderful and if they offer hours for any schedule (student, third shift, etc)."
good,Overall decent place to work if you are searching for a fast pace diverse unconventional level of responsibilities. Nice Advising Assistance. Decent work environment.
good,"AIG was a great place to learn about my sub-industry, but a difficult place to stay, as competitors offered a significantly greater amount in pay and benefits."
good,"workplace environment/culture is great. good relationship between team members and managers. the work types are okay. not to stressful at all. although, i think they should look into the systems they're investing on. i think some are just a waste of money. also, stop with the micromanagement."
good,"Good opportunity to learn more about insurance and improve my skills.  Amazing work atmosphere and colleagues. Not everything went according to plan, but we found out."
good,Decent company. Needed more opportunities for advancement. Good worklife balance. Expected performance standards not very clear. Family oriented. Needed more employee engagement.
good,"The work is fast path. The company is business driven due to the cost consideration. The project is short term project. This particular project is also an one-man project. The challenge is to find the key person of related system. Although the applications are documented, the complication of the business contributed the challenge of maintenance. The co-workers are friendly."
good,Nice to work for when I first got there then after one year they replaced my Manager. The new Manager came in and started dismantling the department little by little.
good,"One needs to be proactive in their style of work. The work is interesting- cutting edge- ML, Innovation, Strategy. You get to own your work. Plus it has really nice work-life balance."
good,"The company itself is not that bad but has lacked direction in 2017, and they only plan on new things starting in 2020.  There are some good solid benefits within the company, but pay seems to be all over the place. My position was eliminated as part of the 3rd re-org since the end of 2016.  This latest round was big, and they are moving folks to either Charlotte, New York, Houston, or San Francisco.  I did not want to move to Charlotte."
good,"Many consider it stressful, but I felt it was reasonable. Experience gained could be excellent for someone's career.  For better or worse, new leadership is a constant, as is inevitable change.  Lack of job security and overall morale is an extremely clear and known issue internally."
good,"Good place to work.But if you looking for career advancement. Then there is very little scope."
good,"Need to pay better and have more official training on day to day task.  Very nice office space, new building.  Company making lots of changes so not very good job security."
good,"It was a great place to start a career.  I learned a lot and very quickly, as the culture is that of survival of the fittest.  The hours became overwhelming as I moved into a management role, but the work was enjoyable."
good,A typical day was calling on existing customers and prospects for the sale of Universal Life Policies and Annuities in the protection of their assets. I learned that this company was all about the cash and not about the customer. I to leave before they had their legal problems with the Insurance Commissioner for inappropriate behavior.
good,"I worked at AIG for many years and enjoyed my time there. Things have significantly changed. Since 2008, is has been an unstable workplace for me, not knowing I was going to lose my job with the multiple re-orgs across the firm."
good,"Mainly spent the day next to the copier, making copies. Had to make 3 copies of each file. File them away when done. Supervisor was kinda hard to understand since she wasn't native English speaker. Other co-workers were nice and helpful."
good,Historically AIG was a great place to work.  There have been many leadership changes in recent months which have negatively impacted employee morale and it is not the same place it was 20 years ago when I joined.
good,"Like any big company, the RIF's come regardless of tenure."
good,It was a nice company before restructure and moved jobs to India.  It is not easy to work in AIG now due to many people left the company and no proper training for job function.  Long hours to work because not many people know about the work because they lay off too many people who know the work.
good,"Currently no vision"
good,"AIG is trying as best they can to transform itself into a desirable company to work for, it's too big for that. It's great for a young person coming out of school looking to learn about Insurance, there are some opportunities for mobility but mostly you work hard and very long hours.  The pay is competitive along with generous PTO but with so many projects and workload most don't enjoy the time off. Management is trying to change but it takes time, I recommend at AIG for the exposure but not long term, there is life after AIG."
good,It can be a very busy at times. Learned how to answer complains. There is a lot of information to take in to remember. When the phones are busy so are you.
good,"Compensation could be better, over burden with work.  They need to compensate better for job responsibilities.  Plenty of change all at the same time is causing confusion between groups."
good,"I was with AIG for over 16 years and enjoyed the challenges and opportunities. It was a good place to work, however over the past few years with the management changes and cost containment, the culture appears to have changed from a one of growth oriented organization to a survival mode. "
good,"American International Group, Inc. (AIG) is a leading international insurance organization serving customers in more than 100 countries and jurisdictions. AIG companies serve commercial, institutional, and individual customers through one of the most extensive worldwide property-casualty networks of any insurer. In addition, AIG companies are leading providers of life insurance and retirement services in the United States"
good,"I work with a great team with smart, collaborative people.  We grew closer and worked harder together because we managed to get through the tough days of activist investors pressuring the firm.  The executives were not supportive, however.  All focus was on extreme cost reduction.  The uncertainty caused adversely affected morale"
good,"The organization is very reactive and the company struggles adapting to change in the industry.  Also, the company has difficulty setting values and expectations across the organization."
good,"Good place for new or fresh graduate to join. Being an American company, lack of job security. The company tent to make some drastic decision and spend unnecessary for system will not produce results as expected"
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my 10 years with AIG.  "
good,It was nice working with the people who appreciate your effort. They recognize all the things and ideas that we contribute to the team. This is always about teamwork.
good,"pretty good job, however, incredibly repetitive. had to work with people who did not want to be audited/hostile to being audited/living in a different country/underneath an entirely different structure."
good,"AIG is a decent place to work, though I enjoyed my time there, my particular area is challenged in structure.Overall though, not a bad experience."
good,Overall pleasant place to work.  Ability to work from home is greatest plus.  Salary is awful for internal transfers/promotions.
good,"This job was great at first. They had 3rd shift, lots of overtime, and the work was pretty simple so you could it fast. You actually make minimum wage but your rate x 0.02cents per paper is added to it. If the project is easy then you make around 12 to 14 an hour. But if the project chages, and they will warn, you will make around 9 dollars an hour. Before I left they were making a lot of changes like attendence and project wise."
good,Work is challenging and employees have indepth knowledge about the task they perform.  Low work life balance but compensation is nice.
good,"While this is a good place to work, there probably could be some improvement made on investing on the existing employees who may have the knowledge and skillset to provide quality results for the company."
good,"-een fijne sfeer."
good,Great work place for young tatents who want to develop their career path in insurance industry. The company provides opportunities and full supports to everyone who is willing to work and take on challenges.
good,Good people to work with.  Lots of re-org going on now.  Area is growing so traffic is increasing.  Lots of restaurants nearby.  Close to Washington Ave. area.
good,Nice place to work but the Alpharetta office is now closing.  Great benefits and PTO.  Pay could be better.
good,"I really enjoyed working for AIG."
good,"High volume, demanding environment."
good,Too much turnover and no leadership.  People in the payroll department do not work as a team and work together.
good,Job I handled challenged my intellectual and analytical ability and thus was a very gratifying one when results ran on AIG's favor. The experience I've earned at AIG honed my skills in building relationships and driving collaborative efforts among peers and superiors.
good,Lot of learning sessions professionally and personally both. Over all personal development
good,"AIG was a great place to work at."
good,Enjoyed meeting  new challenges and projects. The unit that I managed were a great group of women. The hardest part was having to say good bye do to the mass layoffs the company had in the Administrative department.
good,"As a company that is moving forward and once again advancing after the fallout of the financial crisis, there are many opportunities and projects that present themselves to associates that would not typically be available within industry peers.  I personally gained a great deal of experience in a variety of deliverables that would be atypical at other insurance / financial firms."
good,Working for six managers was challenging but thank God I have awesome managers that I enjoyed working for.
good,"Typical day involved meetings on BR/BS documents, test preparation, execution, documentation, logging time on tasks worked on."
good,"Typical Day - work on assigned task and job task "
good,"A typical day is gonna be routine, so if your looking for an exciting job, you may wanna re-think. However the job is very understanding and flexible to a parent lifestyle."
good,I was laid off after 33 years. I wish someone can tell me why I was chosen instead of the other persons
good,"Working at AIG was a great opportunity as I was exposed to various areas, such as insurance and human resources. Each of the departments I worked in were very fast-paced, which is exciting and allows me to produce the highest levels of job performance."
good,Very diversified company with various departments but too many managers. Overall happy employee interacting daily with co workers and managers. Offered stock share to employees and benefits were available for workers. Location was convenient also.
good,"While I enjoyed my time at AIG, the job had run its course and it was time to move on. It was your typical corporate job with clear cut procedures and chain of command, but it lacked the personality of a smaller company."
good,"When I first joined AIG, I managed the IT applications, teams, projects and clients a subset of AIG companies.  This was a phenomenal work  experience and I was eager to get to work every day.  Then, we were reorganized into an IT silo.  This is where politics became a significant portion of my job versus actually getting work done.  They also had a revolving leadership door that brought teams of people in and then spit them out every couple of years.  Sadly it was a terrible waste of time and money.  Hopefully, this has changed over the last couple of years.  It was a great company and hopefully, it will be one again."
good,"Was not very informative regarding job duties. A lot of drama between employees. Not fair, required extra work without extra pay. Could of been such a great job."
good,"AIG had grand plans for their engineering department, but started on a bad foundation. It was too rushed. Obviously, it fell apart. I hope that their future is good."
good,"Good benefits, work from home opportunities. Career opportunities were limited.  401k contribution was better than anywhere else I’ve worked.  Compensation was sub-par."
good,"I loved most of the crew that I worked with.  My direct manager and the lead attorney were get to to work with. Some of the attorneys were very hard to work for. I once needed a new printer to increase my production and it was dis approved because my printer was not broken.  It was old, slow, cutting acrossy ability to service my atorneys swiftly.  This type of thing was upsetting.  Overall the benifits were great but the salary was not great.  I learned alot from everyone there."
good,AIG provide a good initial starting point for gaining experience within the insurance industry. Overall the company was slow to change and adapt so it can be used as a good starting point for next steps within the market.
good,"Comfortable remote position, company car, adequate case load, a lot of autonomy and the ability to handle my cases without any interference from superiors."
good,"The recent position I held provided me a platform to practice my Program Management and Project Management skills - working directly with the business teams, partners, IT teams and IT leadership to deliver strategic initiatives that is in line with the goals of the company. "
good,"My time at AIG has been great however, the management in my department is lacking. There is favoritism and major communication issues between management and employees. The pay is low compared to the job duties.We are taking on more work for the same amount of pay. No room for growth within the department. "
good,"At times the workload was somewhat challenging; however, with prioritizing it was manageable and the end results were satisfying. A wealth of knowledge can be gained working in this position."
good,Management changed often. Could be very stressful at times. For the most part the department worked well together. Provided plenty of time off. The pay was not inline with the job.
good,"The many years I worked for AIG it has provided me with a many opportunities to advance in different areas of the collection departments. Taught me to how to work with high regard under pressure."
good,Management was always available to assist. Plenty of access to training and development courses. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work from home twice a week.
good,"Good benefits"
good,"I had 2 supervisors which I only worked for.  I did office work while they went to public schools and hospitals.  I would schedule appointments, submit paperwork, etc."
good,It used to challenging some times. I had learned a lot especially with Automation tool. Whole team was very helpful. we used to go for a walk quiet often.
good,This job was a typical call center position. I learned patience as each sale counted for monthly bonuses.  Non-stop talking on the phone turned out to be not my 'cup of tea'.  My daily commute to the west suburbs also became the biggest negative for me.
good,The role of Chief Risk and Administrative Officer is a very challenging job in the current environment as the world is moving very fast. Managing entities and locations within and outside PH makes the role challenging and demanding.
good,Competitive Environment and in the process of redefining the management team and culture.  Current focus is on cost reduction and empowerment at a local level globally.
good,AIG closed their northeastern offices to relocate in Atlanta Georgia.  I was very saddened when I had to leave the office and say good bye to collagues.
good,No consistency in requirements of leaders.  A lot of collaboration without action.  Little to no direct line of ownership or culpability for responsibility(ies).
good,"Fue un proyecto corto pero muy productivo, de mucho aprendizaje y selección de cargos muy estratégicos."
good,Division and management team I reported up to during my last 10 years with the company questionable.  Personality/politically driven as oppose to performance.
good,It was a good place to work it just wasn't for me so I decided to move on looking for new opportunities . Didn't like the culture was not the place for me so I moved on
good,"There is a work hard and play hard culture. The team are very intelligent, flexible and motivated. However, the working hours can be challenging at times."
good,"Wonderful place to start your career, with heavy focus on junior talent development. Finance in particular at times seems disjointed and unorganized. High level of upper management turnover makes it difficult for a consistent vision to be followed with constant change. Pays well generally but for finance positions in particular, it underpays at times when compared to what could be earned at a bank or consulting firm doing the same exact work."
good,"It was during my tenure at AIGC that I acquired my health and safety skills, thanks to the support and commitment of the management team. A diverse range of industrial processes were covered."
good,"A typical day at work was busy.  You consistently had incoming calls from customers that needed assistance.  I learned a lot about several different companies, some good and some not so good.  I had 2 different managers within the time I worked at the company. My second manager understood the company and was very helpful."
good,"It is unfair to give an opinion about AIG considering that I worked for them almost 17 years ago. Right now, AIG's management is totally different compared to my time in the organization."
good,"Typical day at work involves making/taking 40 to 50 calls. All calls are recorded and some are reviewed weekly. Everything you do is documented: calls, emails, etc. There's a lot of opportunity for advancement if you want to go into external wholesaling. There are many layers of management, which can result in disorganization and confusion."
good,"All though the job comes with lots of pro like the benefits, be prepared to work more than 50 hours a week. Most of the manager are very nice and pleasant to work for."
good,"I was a coop student there for 4 months and it was a good experience.  Overall very monotonous job, with repeated tasks everyday.  The industry itself is not exciting but the company made an effort to do outside activities such as baseball games and beer parties and Christmas celebrations."
good,"If your fortunate enough to work in a group that allows you to work remote... great benefit!!!"
good,the job is great.  there is a lot of micromanagement also some of the business during underwriting is handled by someone else which for me was frustrating.  the senior director of sales is wonderful and the  benefits are fantastic.  I really the people that work there  and my clients
good,good and liable infrastrure which enables candidate to work comfortably.Working here is a great oppurtunity for starters as they help in building our interpersonal skills and confidence.

good,Looking out for the financial best interest of all. Manager of my dirtrict treated all like family and the customers were treated as much as well.
good,"Company was good to work for then closed it's offices and terminated all managers, reps and support staff with no notice."
good,I loved our team. Great management & training. A lot of opportunity to succeed. Unfortunately AIG in New York made the decision to shut down the AIG Financial Network.
good,"I loved working here, however, our division has been eliminated.  The culture was great, and the only reason I'm leaving is because they have shut down production.  I would recommend a job at AIG to anyone."
good,"Training 12 Insurance Agents on the company's computer on how to sign up for employee benefits, how to take test on anti-corruption and anti-money laundering. Great company to work for.  In three years I learned a lot."
good,"SunAmerica has been a great company to work for, however the time has come for me to explore other career opportunites.  There is limited upward mobility within the company.  It is rare to get promoted within the company."
good,"AIG Claims of Boston is a workplace which is extremely concerned about service and productivity. I learned quite a bit there as I handled a variety of claims in professional liability.  A majority of my files are Real Estate Appraiser's and Home Inspector liability cases.  There is a heavy influence on providing excellent customer service to both internal and external customers. "
good,I have worked with great leaders in the AIG organization which taught me a lot of things to become a great professional in the field of insurance.
good,". Hectic, deadlines"
good,Business in getting the job done on daily manner.  I am team player and help in anyway I can to make sure the the unit I was placed  at was in an organizational manner. Got along with the co-workers with no problem.

good,it was an okay job but needs better leadership and better management that know what they are doing.

good,Challenging position with a lot of coworkers and vendors interaction.

good,"Make out bound calls"
good,the people allowed you do do your job without micromanaging
good,"A typical day at work, from my POV, would be a repetitive work day. I'm constantly sitting all day taking call after call which simply isn't for me. Management is friendly and understandable when it comes to personal life. The hardest part of the job is when it gets busy and more calls start to come in, they make you work mandatory over time. This could be every single day of the week. It's just hard to balance my life out side of work including school, when I'm forced to work over time. They do provide lunch on those days."
good,"I have enjoy my 8 years with the Company. As the Company undergo a process of restructuring, it brings a lot of challenges and a good learning experience."
good,"Working at AIG, I have learned a great deal and advanced my career.   They are a smart group and management is thoughtful and fair."
good,Great benefits and work/life balance.  Fun people depending on the department in which you work.
good,"Coordinating calendars, meeting , parking etc. Assist with Adhoc duties for a team of about 60. "
good,"client contact, research, calendar, run reports, budget numbers"
good,Nice place to work but management heavy.  AIG is a large company and is trying to become more information technical and therefore more quantitative but still has many legacy institutions that hold it back
good,With recent changes many departments are understaffed and below market salaries. Managers can appreciate your work but can't promote or give raises without authorization from the top.
good,"I am thankful for the 18 plus years I had at American General/AIG.  I am thankful for the opportunity I had to learn various products.  I also was involved in their EAC and was able to help out in other TEAM projects as well.  As our jobs were eliminated because of AIG selling off the Affinity and Small Group Employer business, there was no other place within the company.  That would be the one downfault.  Management was fair at times, but upper Management was always changing.  You learned to adapt to their procedures."
good,"Fair working environment. Low compensation. Good benefits, good work life balance, fair management, helpful workmates, clean workplace, learning opportunities."
good,It is almost impossible to give a fair and objective review when one has worked for the same company for twenty years. There is simply nothing to compare to !
good,It not bad job to work at  you can enjoy your work and learn at a semi own pace overall if I could go back I would. Short hours there always work to do so there is never a dual moment.
good,"a lot of turn around and lay offs in the last 5 years, very uncertain place to work. Loved the job and the last 3 years it was a flexible schedule incase of appointments or running late etc. Last 3 years management was off site. Prior to the last 3 years a lot of overtime and went on for ever. It could be overtime for 6 months to 3 years without stopping and always sent employees to other areas to do other jobs and then had to ""rush"" to get their jobs done. A lot benefits, so that was good. In the last 5 years or so, only 1 raise, they did give some bonus' though."
good,"Enjoyed working for the team I was on. Direct boss had an open door policy. Everyone on the team, all though different personalities, worked well together."
good,"The people at AIG are great to work with, and there is a lot of opportunity for improvement and advancement. I would say the compensation is above average. However, there are frequent organizational changes which impact projects, road maps and budgets, and the constant threat of lay offs."
good,"AIG has great benefits, PTO and fair compensation but the current environment is very stressful as the company is laying off 2600+ employees through 2019. Also, the yearly raises are negligible or non-existent. The work/home life balance is very fair, many locations are ""hoteling"" seating so you don't have an assigned desk everyday - your team has a designated number of seats and you rotate days in the office."
good,"Overall was a good job with great benefits, upper management did lack with getting new employees up to speed in new positions. Limited on training or new hires."
good,AIG is a great place to work for certain reasons. the benefits are great and great incentives but its a lot more stressful than when i first started. I have been there for five years and i have gotten one raise and they start new comers at 14 buck an hour. i make 10.69 an hour and they start people higher.
good,"They had good benefits and it was a steady paycheck. I learned a lot about life insurance. "
good,"I enjoyed the work I was doing as a medical only adjuster. My manager at the time as very easy to work with. The company changed policies, eliminated positions and later relocated the office."
good,"Was a mean experience but was also hard work. To begin with I never really enjoyed it but I didn't want to quit so I carried on risk taking even though my bones were sore, overall I ended up liking the job. Disliked working in wet weather and also having to carry 20kg bags of avocados allday"
good,"If you are a new advisor it is great and can help less motivated advisors. It is a great culture if you live near a branch office.If you can't work from home, not a job for you."
good,"Work is stressful with time and quality regulations."
good,"It is good to Work at AIG, one can have a better work life balance."
good,"The company has come a long way since the financial collapse. Lots of strong talent, but there have been significant leadership changes and it has made it a somewhat difficulty culture to work in."
good,"Working at Travel Guard, now known as AIG Travel, is definitely not a boring job. Work culture and management is definately like working for a large corporation. There is are few opportunities for advancement directly within Travel Guard and raises are non-existant but there are advancement opportunities within AIG as a whole."
good,"Really depends on the department you work. During my time there, the company was going through a lot of restructuring which involved a lot of lay offs. So as you can imagine, that environment wasn't really the greatest to work in as many people were worried about Job security. My favorite part about working there though were my managers. Their open door policy, honesty, among many other things made working there quite pleasant"
good,I enjoyed working at jfk. This Was A Temp position. For the shot period I was there. It allowed me to learn more about the coding process. I appreciate the opportunity to work in this environment.
good,"Typical day at work is fun, easy going thanks to my co workers.The hardest part of the job is getting trained through email only and rules and procedures changing daily. The most enjoyable is how easy the work is and my co workers."
good,Learned quoting and servicing policies on 4 different platforms.  needed to be a good multi tasker and quick learner.  My co-workers were the best part of the job.  Being able to help them and the customers was rewarding.  Learned a tremendous wealth of information about insurance.
good,"I usually have a tie working schedule everyday. My work starts at 9:30. After I arrived, the first thing I do is to check my mail box and reply different emails, answer questions and follow up with requests. Around 10:30, I usually go talk to my managers about daily task arrangement, meeting schedules and discuss all the issues we need to take care that day. I need to report to 2 managers currently and they are both very nice and friendly. Including myself, we have 5 coworkers in our finance team so far. They are all very professional work wise and friendly personal wise. I have learned a lot by working with them within my career and professional field. "
good,It is quite good company. I joined there as a fresher .AIG taught me many tools and helped me to improve my skill set.
good,"Nice place to work. I have learned how to operate different machinery to complete my job.  Management was okay.  Co-workers was fine.  There were nothing to hard for me to handle was I knew my responsibilities as a prep clerk.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the overtime to have the work updated, because they were way behind."
good,AIG was a great company to work for and then they started downsizing and things got crazy.
good,"Good company to work for especially for young college graduates."
good,Maintained working rapport with all management levels while handling a specialized blended position which included commercial general liability and no-fault throughout my career with AIG for multiply states. While doing so many strategies were presented to management including presentations and training for the benefit of all others.
good,Access to benefits and paid time off for part-time work is excellent. Job itself is very boring. No opportunities for advancement. Annual raises have been cancelled.
good,"I was able to hit the ground running with the support of my colleagues and was not hindered in getting the tools and the assistance I needed to do my job. What I enjoyed about AIG most is touching base with my manager, who is really our business partner these days, to ensure we are on the same page.  That allowed me to anticipate next steps.  No two days are the same in my line of work, so you had to switch gears to keep up with the demands.  "
good,"Shaped my career sharpening my skill set within Insurance, co-workers were very flexible and cooperative, most top management were very approachable with open door attitude. Staff prone to share knowledge, good teamwork."
good,"un dia tipico en el trabajo seria , llegar temoprano , realizar movbimientos bancarios , otros movimientos administrativos , y lamentablemente estaba sola en la oficina pero cuando recibia clientes trataba de atenderlos al 100 % y darles la informacion necesaria ."

good,It was a great company to work for 10 years.  Learnt a lot & made some great friends along the way. Sorry to see changes made that resulted in my layoff & many others as well.
good,"Greating everyone,opened my office,checked my email and review my daily appointments.Contacting everyone on my staff.I enjoy management,love my co-workers.The hardest part of my job is feeled out death claim forms and,the most enjoyable part is delivering a new policy and cover my clients needs."

good,This company is very good for the experience. This company had great benefits.
good,i really enjoyed AIG Ins. i helped people. and that is a great feeling. Everyday.Management could of been better. It got better when i became superviser. Had the best co workers ever.

good,"Advancement with in learning different scopes of insurance lines, policies and products. Training always provided when needed and very useful. My manager was very knowledgeable and helpful when needed."
good,"I would pay bills everyday on injured workers. Pay out benefits every two weeks and start to pay benefits if the claim was picked up and not denied. Start vocational rehab if needed."
good,"AIG is a very good company to be sure, but it takes a while to get here unless you live downtown.  The've let me do what I want to learn about the job and I have a boss that is well respected in the organization and pretty easy to talk to.  The culture is a bit quiet and everyone keeps to themselves most of the time.  The hardest part is the ability to get to the job even from Houston commute standards and the fact that the pay is lower due to they pay a commission + company performance bonus per year.  You get a ton of paid time off as well as other benefits; the pay is just lower than what I am use to.  Consider other companies if pay is a factor in your decision."
good,"Every thing is fine, the work place is cool.. The people were very approachable, they will help you grow as an individual. They'll give you sone advices to help you succeed"
good,The hardest part of the job would be the mandatory overtime and jobs going overseas or moving.  Constant restructuring is occurring and several people have been laid off as a result.  However the Management Team in Amarillo is one of the best and supportive I have experienced.
good,una empresa grande con muchos conocimientos ... trabajar con esta empresa me ayudo a aprender tener mas conocimientos para haci tener un buen manejo
good,"Foi uma ótima experiência,  a empresa sempre paga em dia, ótimas oportunidades,  porém difícil de conseguir qualquer promoção, pois são muitos líderes,  gerentes para aprovar a solicitação. Ambiente gostoso."

good,Duties were to help people who purchased insurance polices all over the world. Learned about travel policies and pay and file type of insurance. Learned about customer assistance and how people all over the world have different travel policies and benefits they have for coverage of losses. I saw a lot of management at time time I was working there. I think I had about 2 to 3 supervisors and then they had about the same amount of managers. Co workers were nice and they were all knowledgeable about the company and job functions. Hardest part of job was working long hours and trying to interpret policies that were vague. Usually they all would be pay and file or belong to another department. Enjoyable part of job was the people and they culture knowledge from workers all over the world
good,"Long hours, traveling often and used your own car. Great money but Its not for a family person."
good,Management is afraid to take risks. Heavily reliant on excel and unwilling to take advantage of newer and more effective software. Huge disconnect between management and staff.
good,"Great Place for work/life balance. Good advancement opportunities"
good,"AIG is a flexible company, however senior executives appear to only make short-term decisions that satisfies the bottom line that day. They should start thinking about the bigger picture, staffing correctly, and training employees properly. AIG is run inefficiently."
good,"Company is ok.  You could work from home fours days a week. "
good,"Lots of potential, but company was failing financially, and required a multi-billion dollar federal government bailout.  Left in anticipation of financial collapse and amid concerns about being sued for malpractice based on representations we were expected to present to clients regarding the financial strength of the company."
good,"The job included account reconciliations, fixed asset review, variance reporting, updating of monthly forecast, work closely with financial mangers and business partners"

good,Vast international company offers internal opportunities but disorganized HR management causes best people to leave or be fired. Culture is entrepreneurial and intense. Highly stressful work environment.
good,Great environment to grow. Working as a contractor does not make the job really dependable. Looking out for something better within and without. Life goes on.
good,New CEO has made positive changes.  opportunity to learn a lot. hardest part of the job was trying to keep up.  Most enjoyable part of the job was the great relationships with internal and external clients.
good,"I worked for a wholly owned company (Valic) under AIG.  It is an oustanding company that is ranked at the top of its industry as well as being the oldest company in its market.   AIG got a bad rap during the past recession because they had to get the biggest bailout of any company.  I have to respect them though, they paid every penny back on time, with full interest.  Plus the gov't is making out very well on the AIG stock that was part of the deal.  No one lost a penny on AIG's bailout.  The same cannot be said for many others companies.  Until a Corporate Reorganization, it was fun and prosperous to work for Valic.  It deals in a difficult market, teachers.  Teachers all think their pension plans will take care of them in retirement.  Many are now finding this to be iffy at best.  Valic provides an outstanding service to its clients with historically good returns on its products.  This is because Corporate management has done whatever has been necessary, including making the""hard decisions"" when necessary.  Their clients should each send  a ""thank you"" to them for protecting their assets over the long haul."
good,NC State Life and Health License greater opportunities for later in life. Need a more structured pay. I have met a lot of great people and have loved the opportunity to help others.
good,fue enriquesedora la experiencia y los pagos fueron oportunos pero no dan estabilidad laboral ps renuevan el personal cado 3 o 4 meses
good,AIG ran into financial problems and sold this end of their business.   There we a lot of wonderful energetic and positive people at the organization.
good,Pay structure is not good. they will never give you raise every year to match even inflation. Raise is possible if you get Promotion. No scope of promotion and no raise.
good,"Assist with website inquiries, provided customer support in all aspects of on-line Mutual funds and Annuity over phone in call center, limited account assistance. Achieved incentive bonuses based on high quality performance."
good,Some divisions are better than others.  Some managers are better than others.  There is plenty of opportunity to grow and move up if you have the appropriate support.
good,"Great people and work place, Met many interesting and exciting and professional people whilst working in 34 of the major offices in Europe learnt a lot and delivered many many hours of People development ."
good,"AIG offers a great benefits package. However, there is not a significant increase in salary with performance increases. In last two years there have been many layoffs and uncertainty across the company."
good,"You will work a ridiculous amount of hours. Do not expect to have a life, you won't. Corporate culture is toxic. This of the movie 'Mean Girls' but adults. If you want to advance you have to leave the company get a job that pays more with the title you want, then go back and apply."
good,"Depending on location, workin with AIG is good.  Company is in constant change since 2007 and is currently restructuring, so the environment is stressful."
good,"quando entrei na empresa, eram muitos projetos sendo feitos ao mesmo tempo e muita correria, isso me deu grandes oportunidades em poder mostrar meu trabalho e adquirir novos conhecimentos."
good,"I enjoyed my time at AIG, enjoyed the job and the opportunity. I did not enjoy the upper management. Always posted gains and would always cut back. They look to do things ""cheap"" which will cost them later on. My position was eliminated due to re-organization. My job will be out sourced to a vendor who will not do a better job and will not have the company in its best interest."
good,"A typical day at work consists ofcollaborative efforts with internal and external clients, facilitating meetings and project management. The hardest part of the job is gathering all the required data to begin your assigned projects. The most enjoyable part is completing milestones prior to the due date."
good,Ability to work independently as long as timeframes met.  Able to work across company instead of silos.  Do not micromanage at least in department where I worked
good,"Always in a state of employment flux, repeated staff reductions and work demand increases.  No clear path on company plan. Morale suffers because fore reductions have been occurring for a long time and nothing is said or done for those left behind"
good,"Not much support from management, great opportunity for experienced ad visors, lots of commuting to appointments, great technology, company provided work phone and computer."
good,"Great place to work, until Sr. Mgmt. became addicted to rolling layoffs and cost cutting."

good,"Good company, supportive management. Big company with decent amount of red tape and politics. If looking for family work environment, not the right company."
good,I would show  up 30 min before my shift open all of my programs needed for the day. I learned how have patience with people and learned many different work programs. the hardest part of my job was not to get tired of the same thing and always being yelled at by customers.
good,"Company to big, no body can make a decision. Hardest part of the job is finding someone who can help if you have a question. They laid off most of the experienced people. Decent pay and benefits but hard to get anything done."
good,"Dear Reader,"
good,"Every Day is a new day for me and a big chance to learn new things. I am able to reach the highest level of progression and I get a big chance to part part of a big team. My coworkers are extremely nice and helpful, we share the responsibilities and we help each other in order to achieve success in the company. The hardest part in my job being doing this kind of process by myself and being the only person responsible for. however,  i enjoy doing this Kind of Job because I get the chance to lead and to resolve some issues, and make self executive decisions that will benefit the process and the job."
good,"strong company, continuous job related training, salary low"

good,A professional environment and a great place to start a career.  But can be very stressful. I love the fact that I was able to work remotely for the last 5 plus years of working for the company.
good,I think this goes for a lot of companies. It takes a while to get approvals but that's everywhere. A more simplified approach would be more conducive to productivity for employees.
good,"Na época fazia a supervisão da área de seguro de vida."
good,"Good company, good pay. Good management but not much career progression in this office. Most of opportunities are in Croydon or London. Shame to have had to leave."
good,Job was just starting in warranty. Low knowledge of job information from bosses. Kinda learned as I went with no guidance from management. Went to management with a problem and the problem became worse than it was. No communication.

good,"Company challenged to complete turnaround from Financial Crisis. General Insurance continues to be in a cost cutting mode, it is not clear they have found a profitable operating model"
good,"AIG is a very large company and because of that, there were decision that had to be made to satisfy the shareholders.   However, too many executives being hire and not enough work force."
good,"Itwas easy to get into the company and into a department where I worked hard and was eager to learn. Management abruptly decided that education was more valuable than hard work and only hired or promoted individuals with Master's degrees and above. Ultimately they overworked those employees and saw high turnover before the department was closed and transitioned to Dublin, Ireland."
good,"The people here are great, but there is a clear disconnect from upper management. There have been a lot of changes but the lack of involvement is focused more on a reactive approach rather than proactive one. "
good,"AIG is a great place to work if you're well establish in the higher levels or the opposite just starting. If higher up with greater years of experience the opportunity to take a leadership role and really drive the growth/maturity of the Cyber department is truly there. If just starting out in the field the opportunity to gain the experience needed for the next step is here at AIG as they grow and Mature in Cyber."
good,I was laid off from a company (AIG) that I believed that I would retire from. All my evaluations were above average. The company gave no notice of the layoffs.  I suspect the management knew ahead of time.
good,I enjoyed working for AIG. I worked on many major projects and my work day has been very hectic. I learned to challenge myself and co workers to do a better job each and everyday.
good,AIG is a good company to work for with great benefits you will need to get hired with the right department and I think you would love the job and company.
good,"Trabalhei para AIG seguros pela GTI solutions, um projeto especifico da seguradora."
good,"Worked for AIG for 23 years.  Was laid off due to Treasury and Finance jobs being outsourced to India, Phillipines and Ireland. Company had great benefits but the last year I worked there they were eliminating pension plans and changing up the matching of 401K."
good,Established company. Providing good benefits. Needs to improve on salary packafe. Builds harmonious relationships within the company.
good,"No shortage of change at present, I enjoyed my time there and learned a lot.  Good relationships with colleagues made it enjoyable to come to work"
good,Work is good but not employee friendly company. Basically i am in UK Process that involves SAP Working but one thing that management is not so effective to manage team work as well as utilise team efforts.
good,"Start up with any project is highly gives a great experience so , i feel so proud to start with Jumia and AIG which are part of rocket internet with most of supply chain teams(inventory, inbound, outbound, fleet, and Market Place) it really gave me several kind of experience from our supportive supervisors and managers and how to lead our team and riders to get our targets and this best thing I like in my job (Reach Our Target)"

good,"Learned a lot about door to door sales. Would love to see this system come back, but now with technology don't think so."
good,A typical day at AIG is very busy.  Management did a lot of cross training to allow everyone an opportunity to learn something new. My co-workers were easy to get along with. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people.
good,"No one getting raise since 2008, compensation is not good for non management staff."
good,"Great benefits. Due to reorganization, not a lot of room for growth."
good,"The work volume is extremely high. I respect my manager and co-workers. I enjoy meeting with my direct reports once a week for an hour to train, cross train, trade ideas, distribute work, etc. We usually meet in a relaxed ""family dinner table"" type setting. As a manager, I am in meetings all of the time. This is my way of showing them that I am engaged in their work and I am not faceless. They work for me because they want to not because they have to. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the constant lay off rumors set forth to negatively drive productivity. There are no teams. There are people who will do ANYTHING to keep their jobs. If I wanted that type of culture, I would have gone into commision sales."
good,Good place to come for international experience.  Lack of overall strategy from corporate management.  Always shifting roles and responsibilities and departments.  
good,"I have worked for AIG during 7 years, and I am ready to find the next challenge. "
good,"This was a good company to work for until the fall of the Mortgage market. I was in the thick of that when left the Industry. You had to constantly hustle to keep afloat. Iam not opposed to hard work, but I do want my efforts to pay off."
good,I was a customer service representative. I was the 1st form of contact. I learned to use 3 computer screens at one time and how to research in dept. Management was nice and I met one of my best friends here. The work was easy but very detailed. The most enjoyable part of the day was being so busy that I lost the track of time... the day would fly by.
good,I worked at AIG for close to 13 years. Overall I was very happy working there. I came in with minimal recruiting experience and my managers pushed me right into the fire. It was a great learning experience I was able to grow and develope within AIG and take on Generalist reponsibilites.
good,"Exciting company to work for , lots of application that we supported mostly i wokked with an excellent team that was always willing to put in an effort towards our Job."
good,Working at AIG was one of the best experiences I have ever had regarding it's atmosphere and it's training which allowed for an easy paced learning environment
good,"Some managers are good and some are challenging to work, it's all depending on with manager; work culture is ok, distance is ok and commutable. I don't much exposure with other offices"
good,Overall AIG Asset Management provides good and non-hierarchical work environment. The company is keen to reform from the inside and have been progressing consistently over the past few years.
good,There are not many open positions for full-time and most employees have been with the company an average of 8+ years. It is very stable if you are able to fill a position.
good,"AIG take real care when it comes to making it a fun environment to work with constant events like a summer social, halloween games and a Christmas party. "
good,I enjoyed working for AIG and appreciate the opportunities for professional and personal development as well as the support that was provided.

good,this company provide good medical coverage. the working place is convenience and comfortable. there are pantries for you to get drinks and food. management team are very helpful
good,"Great team working environment.  Company was in flux when I worked there though with several reorgs.  This impacted team morale, and could have been handled better."
good,Fun work environment but work tasks is rather repetitive. Always managed to get the job done as I always see to it that I am at all time deadline-driven to get it done. No further comments.
good,"When someone quits the work falls on you, so after 5 people quiting you cant even finish your own job ,but it was good place to work for. I was just overwhelmed."
good,"AIG is a great employer, work life balance is not great. It's a fast paced, busy environment that demands a lot from its employees. Its said that a year with AIG is like 7 elsewhere. The people are friendly, helpful and will answer questions. I work in a great team environment, but some people still think of the old ""Us vs. Them"" mentality."
good,Overall not a bad company...though they do not have any process for compensation reviews so the only way to grow professionally and financially is to look for other opportunities once you are employed.  Has been going through many months of layoff over the past 18 months.  Cronyism is very much alive and well in this organization.
good,"call center to support AIG employees - fat paced and busy call center. - good team environment, worked with customers from around the World."
good,Great place to work with great professional people.  During my 18 years with the company I was able to improve professionally and expand my skills thanks to their continuous training philosophy
good,Pros of AIG - great PTO allotment and medical benefits very good - Cons of AIG - lack of merit based annual raises had awesome annual reviews got nothing for them - and also AIG failed to recognize my talents what a waste only after they RIF'd many departments did they come calling for on me to pick up where others had been let go
good,Big company with lots of growth potentials.  Various locations and friendly staffs.  Always busy.  More meetings with various management teams.  Nice         working environment.
good,A good company to work for. Great benefits and salary. Good learning opportunities. There is room for growth within the company. The salary is on the higher range compared to other insurance companies.
good,"The company expects you to work but has been flexible with time away as needed.  However, tribal knowledge is not revered so, in order to cut costs, staff cuts come about every quarter - this greatly impacts the ability to gain traction in any project that is underway."
good,"I'm am not actively searching for a new job, mostly seeing what is available. AIG is headed in the right direction with its new CEO, Brian. Need investment in IT."
good,The division of AIG I worked for was sold after the banking crisis of 2008.  It was a good place to work and the people were great.  They provided great benefits.
good,"Provides opportunities for career growth."

good,Cater support which focus on Wintel related concerns. Cross culture and diversified. You can work easily with peers and diligently with project-related stuff.
good,"Some of the better managers I ever knew.  Two of them were not from an IT background but were former teachers.  One had been a kindergarten teacher---and you could tell. She was a sweet as could be, but if she had to, could use the ""Teacher Voice"" on you.  They were very good at keeping people on task and working together. I called it ""Sit down, shut up, and share your crayons""."
good,AIG offers many tools and resources to assist you to learn new skills and apply to jobs within the company. I enjoy the work culture and environment. I learned new skills provided by AIG by going to school and applied to different jobs.
good,"Constant cost cutting measures are in place and there is not an organizational growth strategy in place.  The organization has lost a ton of knowledge good people, while constantly changing its strategies."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a group of collaborative and intelligent individuals.  The team made the work day bearable and we feed off of each other's energy.
good,AIG as a company focused on the core insurance business which was different than the travel insurance business I was supporting.  This made implementing new applications and processes more difficult.
good,"Enjoyed being part of a productive team"
good,"* A company in Transition"
good,"Typical day...taking care of the customers"

good,"Call center, night shift/Evening shift."
good,"Pros:"
good,"Would  take calls from internal users on may different issues. "
good,"AIG is a good company to work for, depending on the department you are in.  The actual culture is great, people are great.  Advancement is difficult for me personally as I work from home 3 hours away from the office.  The only way to advance would be to work in a different department, and not many other departments offer work from home as an option.  Also, jobs have ""grades.""  Therefore in order to make more money, you have to get a job with a higher grade.  Therefore, raises are not very existent if you stay within your job title.  That is frustrating."
good,"I have to review all the information I received, and I have to do data entry of all this information, and verify if  the amount a put in the system was right ."
good,"Unfortunately there were massive layoffs.  Reviews were no longer done on an individual basis.  Each title was reviewed across the National instead of the department.  Only a certain number of positions could be graded, so you were rated against others versus what you did for the department."
good,"Very good Company to learn Reinsurance Accounting and I was able to learn a lot and moved up in ranks up to the Assistant Manage position."
good,"My job at AIG was diversified though centred on consumer credit.  The part on working to set up the AIG credit card centre had been most enjoyable.  It's a pity that the 2008 US mortgage crisis had hard hit on AIG,"
good,good working environment and nice coworkers. Lots of interesting projects and learning opportunities. Generally very supportive to actuarial exams taking.
good,"I worked for AIGFP prior to AIG bankrupty resulting from AIGFP's creating a liquidity crisis for the parent AIG.  Regardless of the bad press, AIG was and remains a great institution.  It was brought down by the bad judgment of one man."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the was always the great people I got to work with.  I also enjoyed working with people all of the world as well as get exposure to senior management."
good,"The company was great until they announced no longer managing their own STD plans. They continued to sell these plans but chose not to manage them, it was passed on to another insurance company which resulted in lay-offs. Prior to the job was semi- stressful but the work environment was really relaxed."
good,"hired on with the understanding that overtime was a rare occurrence, ended up being every day and almost every Saturday.  had training, basic training on job functions."

Thorough investigation of all facts; securing recorded statements from the insured; claimants, and witnesses; gathering police and medical records; review of independent scene investigations; and initialing and negotiating first call to the final settlement."
good,Due to the current climate at AIG it is a VERY tense environment to work and grow as an indvidual. Coming in each day and not knowing if your position has been eliminated by noon is stressfull
good,"This was a fun place to work. The groups were small so training was easy. The group I worked in, we helped each other when needed. The work was interesting and could be hard at times, but we got through it together. We were given free lunches at times. My manager was the best, she helped out when needed, both work and personal."
good,Great place to work but not much opportunities to learn and grow. No program for employee recognition and career growth. Sometimes it depends on your direct manager.
good,"This was a great company to work for, before several managmement changes which led to the closing of all offices.  Most representatives now are brokers, and there is no longer any offices in our area."

good,This company has great benefits and PTO availability. There is really no room for advancement. I learned a lot about how to sell warranties to customers and how to work Microsoft Excel. They will work with a school schedule and hours that you at need.
good,"Good place to work for a big company, but you only learn a small piece of the company. The people are fun and the environment is okay. Lots of overtime during quarter end, but overall was okay"
good,This was a good job for me to bridge my job loss from AT&T to retirement. I would recomment this company for other job applicants.
good,enjoyed working as a scheduler but was working 3 jobs and could work the hours. It was too much to handle the hours. I called clients that had a retirement fund with the company and scheduled meetings with their adviser to go over their retirement goals
good,Given the opportunity to advance to a management position within the company.  Management provided training and coaching for an opportunity to further my career.
good,"The company has changed in many ways since I have worked there, however, at that time, AIG was a leader in it's field for all aspects and areas of insurance."

good,Great company to work with. Busy but friendly environment. great team. learned new every day at work that helps to excel in your position. growth opportunities.
good,The organization provides opportunities for advancement but you have to drive your career development.  Senior management has good ideas for the direction of the company but mid-level and front line management sometimes are very slow in adapting the new ideas.  If you do not have any experience in the industry AIG is a good start. You can learn a lot about the industry and variety of products but you have to be eager to learn. People are very friendly and willing to help.

good,"since i joined the groups were new, management was new and goal was clear, so working with high caliber colleagues from banking and insurance has been a delight. as new regulators join the discussions on how company is being risk managed, having ability to see the whole picture has been a great asset and senior management has definitely provided that. only downside i have seen is lack of a cohesive culture in some areas of the organization and parallel efforts as a result so as company redefines and matures i believe these issues will correct itself. the hr framework is in fix so hoping a 360 review process is implemented so it is a more balanced approach that will ensure company doesn't lose good talent."

The great opportunity was working and learning more about the client environment and working with management and underwriting to service the client's needs. Over the course of time, my department and I had to manage the time line to service the customer's needs.

good,Very flexible work environment since I mainly worked from my home office.  Very good pay and benefits.  Had great managers until the layoff. Still in contact with a few of them.  Too big to fail.
good,"AIG changed from 2007 to 2019 and employees need to change with many new environment, changes in leadership and direction.  This was primarily due to the many changes AIG needed to endure primarily due to the economic breakdown in 2009.  Initially the job was exactly was I wanted and changed dramatically throughout  the years."
good,The people at AIG are professional and friendly and make a good working environment. I feel I have progressed at AIG and the management culture works to help you fulfill your abilities.
good,"Short term working environment. got some good excel skills. My boss was a racist and was partial only to his clan members, He was jealous of my female friends talking to me and spending time with me during break."
good,The ability for a work life balance is a huge perk. Career advancement with the right mentoring is available.  You have to work hard to move ahead. Great benefits offered.
good,Good jump start for fresh graduate for IT. The company provides comprehensive and advanced training in relation to your skills. A work-life balance advocate company.
good,"excellent work environnment , My duties were to monitor all mainframe systems, Document and escalate issues to 1st and 2nd points of management contacts.."
good,Great Company. Lot of good opportunities. Great place to work with. Of late it is filled with lot of politics and network based favoritism.  Depends on which team you work with.  Lot of office politics.  Lasting uncertainty and loose information disrupts the flow
good,"No room for job advancement."
good,"The positions in my department allowed for a lot of independence. Not a lot of collaboration. Very few time-wasting meetings. Heavy work load with deadlines. People are congenial, but very busy and willing to help as time allowed. Everyone is very smart."
good,Learned alot. Remote work available.  Great benefits. Friendly environment. Leadership changes presenting change in organization mostly positive and hopeful for the future.
good,"It was busy everyday , between reports, collection and customers it was a full day. "
good,"Nice people, fast pace and lots to learn.  It's a great place to get an introduction to the property and casualty industry.  I liked the people I worked with and learned a lot.  The pay is a problem but the benefits are excellent."
good,"Worked from home 3 days a week. "
good,"Very good company to learn the industry from.  Fast paced, complex risks.  Broad Appetite .  Paid well.  Advancement.  Team oriented, truly a good company minus the outside noise."
good,"I have 3 independents that got my health care insurance services, which means even my brothers and parents were able to go to have check-ups the is covered by the health card which is very important for me."
good,"Very good work environment with friendly colleagues, great company to kick start a professional career."
good,The work load was not to bad however in the last year it really went down which is why I left. I really liked my manager.  The only thing I didin't like was the drive in.
good,"very busy and stressfull"
good,Pay not compensatory for daily production.  No platform for self development and growth.  No platform for promotion and corporate development.........
good,"Staff with experience willing to teach new staff hired."
good,"Great enviorment to develop a career within your work place. Great leadership from LAC and rest of region.  A lot of oportunities to suceed."
good,"American International Group is generally a good company to work for. With over 60,000 employees in over 200 countries around the world, the typical day will vary from location to location. AIG offers flexible working conditions and has comparable perks for staff."
good,"It won't be fair to rate this company while I only worked there for a few months as a temporary employee handling workers' compensation claims. "
good,"Given today's culture and environment, job function was eventually outsourced to a third party. Before the final straw the bulk of the function was transferred to first Houston then to Tennessee branches. I had survived the cuts in NY until the final decision to outsource was finalized."
good,"For the past 6 years, I enjoyed working in AIG. You'll definitely have a work-life balance environment. Workplace is good, work load are bearable. You'll love working in this company especially when you work with the people you get along with, it's like you're really not working, but purely having fun. For the past 5 years of working in this company under one team, I enjoyed my colleagues, team lead, as well as my big bosses. Everything is smooth sailing. But as well all know, not everything is meant to last, there's nothing permanent in this world but -- CHANGE. After a year, we had a new management and for me, that was the hardest part. The work is still the same, but the person who I am working with and working for is not anymore."
good,"I did enjoy my time here. I would gladly return to this company if the opportunity arose, however I am not in the area any longer. For a call center, they did take care of their temp workers, however they would not hire anyone on, which made many of us choose to leave after our time instead of re-up another 3 months."
good,"The work environment at AIG was challenging. I had a great manager that I learned a lot from. I also liked the work-life balance. Overall, my AIG experience has been positive."
good,"Overall a very good experience of MNC culture. Good Work balance good compensation, good management and vry nice cuuture. Townhall and the events organised by HR in the form of Quarterly and annual parties are great platform."
good,"Great overall place, can only make one complaint and its pay. Vacation time is the best, 401k benefits, schedule, work from home options. and the environment is good no micromanagement. Not sure if its my department but everyone get paid pretty low but the same department in Houston is a decent amount more. We are in Brentwood (Nashville), TN so the cost of living is the same or maybe Nashville is more now."
good,"I love this company but am not being paid adequately. I have so much to offer and know my worth which is why I need to go elsewhere. The benefit package is nice, but I have a family to care for so that's not enough."
good,"I learned a lot, but moved on secondary to lack of advancement. Great co-workers and team work. Again, a great place to start a career. Convoluted bonus system."
good,"Competitive and interactive place to work at, relatively relaxed atmosphere.  "
good,It was fine. There was a forced ranking systems in place which may not have been the best way to keep the best mix of staff and people. Perhaps quality rather than just savings should be a consideration.
good,It was a good company to work for.  There was just not enough advancement where I was. It there was I would have stayed. I miss the people I worked with.
good,There are numerous challenges and learning opportunities at AIG. The working environment is pleasant and the peers are collaborative in completing the work.
good,Everyone's experiences differ. Mine was good. I enjoyed my time there. There were good and bad days like every other place you'll ever work in your life.

good,"Well culture and work life balance."
good,"Aig can be a great place to work out but you have to constantly worry about shifting management, projects, and expectations. Employees at AIG are generally really smart, creative and hardworking which is a huge plus to work with intelligent people. A big issue for most regardless of the department is if there is a track for advancement, which for most is not clear at AIG."
good,"Dealing 85% of emails with customer service related issues, coordinate with home office personnel in different departments to solving issues. "
good,"An environment of constant change keeping in tune with domestic and offshore influences."
good,Work was good but very less hike also less projects. Management was ok. Sometimes too much of work. Have learnt many things working here. But the workplace culture has to still be improved.
good,Team oriented environment. Enjoyed working with great people.  Diverse group of people who respect the culture of the company.  On the job learning tools for employees.
good,They are a good company to work for although the benefits/salary are not what they should be.  The job environment is very good and is a great atmosphere to work in.
good,"I've learned a lot particularly about insurance (director's and officer's liability insurance) "
good,"I conquered a lot for my future from working with AIG, and it was a great work experience. I will continue to prosper as a agent or retirement specialist as I am still very knowledgeable & highly experienced in every skill I gained from AIG."
good,My co-workers are amazing. Most of them are from the LAC region and they are very hard working and want to get the job done right. I am very fortunate to have this experience.

good,"My typical day involves the challenges of Ad Hoc reporting and record keeping necessary for Schedule F and US GAAP reporting.  Luckily, my team and I work together to meet the challenges are always looking to improve our processes"
good,"Okay, not as advanced as most companies but they are trying."
good,I worked in Insurance for 3 years and I enjoyed the challenge of the job. I was able to learn information that would help me in the future.
good,Most enjoyable part of my job is my co-workers.  Most of them know how to be nice and encouraging towards others.  Great environment where I work.
good,"I am proud to work with AIG for almost 10 years which I learned and grow a lot. They have a great team always ready to help. Thanks to AIG I complete some important certifications from LOMA which I learn a lot and really help me to grow. The hardest part is to keep working and studying at the same time but it really worth it."
good,"team work and group projects"
good,"Good experiences, good environment, good exposure to technologies, overall good exposure to all types of personalities and social levels.  Hardware was top of the line to cover the work load required on a daily bases."
good,AIG was a great job.  I had a lot of opportunity there and was able to handle many tasks.
good,"Busy most of the day.  Learned MS Access and LuminX claims systems.  Manager had just the right amount of administration, let me work on my own but was there if needed help. Co-workers were wonderful.  Hardest part of the job was keeping up with all the work.  Most enjoyable was my colleagues."
good,A matrix organization with well documented process and project management.
good,Researched non-payment medical claims for payment to avoid penalties and fines.  Reviewed and resolved providers' complaints. Assisted adjusters with updating patients progress in system.
good,"Typical day at work"
good,"Excellent company, good benefits, advancement opportunities, transfer to other departments to learn more and advance more."
good,I assisted a good amount of project managers in this department.  I learned about ordering parts and mailing them out.  How to fill a parts order if needed by a technician on a job site and if in our warehouse.  The most enjoyable part of the job was learning to use Autocad.  I would sometimes be asked to revised asbuilts or blueprints from some of the techs or engineers.  Only minor revisisions.  This didn't last very long and I was laid off as well. 
good,"My day at work starts at 8:30am and ends at 5pm. I worked in the Accident & Health Department as an Customer Service Representative and office worker. I learned about the process of underwriting, marketing, direct sales and assist the customers in the call center. The most enjoyable part of my job was the opportunity that they gave me to serve the customers and answer their questions about their policies and how they worked exactly."
good,"Worked many hours - most of the time 10 hour days, liked independence of my job"
good,"I enjoyed my job of payment processing. - Pay Medical facilities, Hospitals, Doctors, Patients & Attorney bills, Mail out checks, Index Invoices, Research bill inquires to resolve issues. Quality Control for correct amounts on invoices and checks"
good,"A very nice place to work for. Didn't have to worry about management, was able to work independently. Good hours and close to home."
good,"Interesting work. Excellent and dedicated service to insured customers. International dimension makes daily challenges quite engaging and stimulating. Management very bright but a few, not most, could be a bit more circumspect in internal communications and dealings. Enjoyed my time there."
good,It was my temporary job with AIG. I had a great start in the company as a temp. While my temp job I was attending collage. But in general it was nice and worthy experience.
good,Management has very little time for explanation of what is expected of personnel on project sometimes causing project overrun.
good,"Learned invaluable lessons about life, corporate America, management, team building and personalities along with extensive accounting functions to work myself up to VP & CFO after a 25+ year carreer."
good,"A typical day at work would include balancing trouble tickets with phone calls to the helpdesk, processing reports, building machines, rolling out upgrades and other responsibilities depending on the day. I learned time management and sacrifice. I worked with a great manager and co-workers as a team. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the particular politics that claimed they were for our good but really made it more difficult to do our job. The most enjoyable part of my job was successfully performing UAT testing because we knew that our hard work would not only pay off but there was more of a sense of accomplishment because you were part of the process."
good,on a typical day i would take abt 60-78 calls . I have learn alot about 401k ;403b and IRA accts while i was working there.. my co-workers was very helpful when assistance was needed.. the most hardest part of the job was telling a participate that they was denied because they did not meet the requirements or have enough supporting docs..
good,I can't say enough about the people I worked with. The people are wonderful and very helpful if needed. I miss them.
good,"AIG was a good company to work for. The benefits were great and the hours left you time for a work/life balance. The employees tended to be a bit cliquish as many of them had worked in the insurance industry for several years prior to moving to AIG. This was an interesting job at first that soon became a bit redundant. But, if you have a history in insurance and like redundancy this is the job for you."
good,"In this Job you will work with a lot of interesting and kind people. The Job is very fast paced after you have been brought up the independent functional speed and you will be expected to keep that pace or increase that pace as deadlines for items grow closer and as volume of work increases. The position i work in was as an assistant to a financial planner which required a lot of patience and persistence. If you are a hard worker and want to have advancement controlled by your ability to get licenses, then this is a great choice for you."
good,"I Started working at this firm several years ago and since i have been there almost 10 years, i have been Satisfied at work  since getting hired at this firm"
good,"Por muy bajo sueldo hay que trabajar a destajo, hay que trabajar horas extra para sacar el trabajo y no las pagan."
good,"The job is okay. Easy to understand and deliver. However, sometimes the upper management could be the reason you want to leave the company. Probably because they like to Micro-Manage people."
good,"I would go back if there were a position I would want. Not always much job security but I enjoyed the work and coworkers. Once they find out you're a good worker, they keep adding more and more responsibilities but with no additional pay. But, I was able to work from home most of the time which I really liked!"
good,I enjoyed and learned a lot of the years working for aig. It also felt like family and they were understanding if you had personal life to address when used properly. Very understanding. Wouldn’t change it for the world
good,"you must have strong team building and collaborative talents, partnering easily and support staff to identify employee needs, address issues, and promote company spirit"
good,"I will be honest, AIG was a good company.  I spent many years there and was treated relatively well.  However they got to a point where the bottom line was more important than the employees who got you there.  There were many layoff over the years, some needed, some not.  Over time they let go of ""dead weight"", but then starting removing good people who actually had the expertise and did the work needed for the company to thrive.  This created a paranoid culture of ""When is my neck on the block?"""
good,al ser una empresa pequeña en el ramo de autos brinda la oportunidad de conocer las diferentes áreas involucradas en el ramo de autos y esto a su vez forma un perfil multifuncional y mas integral en sus trabajadores
good,"Must be self starter and Goal oriented. Coaching is at a minimum, must be willing to reach out to fellow employees to learn what to do and how to do many things to be successful. Most fellow employees were friendly and helpful."
good,"I was thrown in at the deep end but came up swimming. I wrote the bets business plan that they had seen in years. in fact they used it as a template. I was given a crash course in Spanish, which I still speak fluently, and told to get on with the job. I never had a single day off for over a year, but it was worth the hard work. However, promises of support were not met."
good,AIG is rejuvenating its corporate culture by refocusing on employee development and employee retention. I believe this to be long overdue and a very positive development.
good,"Great job, just company's focused changed to internet service.  Left a lot of clients upset they had no local representation.  Un aware if company's focus has changed since 2016"
good,"There was never a typical day when I worked there. Mostly we would be verifying internal systems data, auditing a client facing system for anomalies or preparing documents (screen design, technical requirements and test cases) for new releases and system enhancements."
good,Great place to work in terms of new technology. Benefits is top amongst the insurance company. Work life balance were practiced and drinks vendo machines are free.
good,Great working environment and the technology is awesome.  Parking and work hours are great.  Break-room facilities are excellent for contractors & employees
good,Very detail oriented.  Highly educated with both a Masters Degree and a Law Degree.  Member of the NY Bar..  Many years of experience in both risk management and insurance.
good,AIG isn't a bad place to work at all. It's got lots of advantages. The benefits are not as great as I had heard. Management and co-worker experience differs greatly from department to department. There are a lot of great people there.
good,"Log into PC, print your work for the day & start working."
good,"The company was good for people with good self motivation and self discipline. There was a decent training system in place for new hires but more importantly, there was a good culture of teamwork. You could always reach out to a colleague for help."
good,I have been away from being employed by the AIG companies.  There have been a number of changes within the company in the past 27 years of which would be unfair to provide an assessment at this time
good,AIG offers great work life opportunities as well as flexible work schedules. In addition they have great health benefits and excellent volunteer donation benefits.
good,"AIG is a great company that can provide its people with stellar benefits. Sometimes the management seemed to be out of sorts but lots of good, smart people in the organization try hard every day to keep it running."
good,"The system was not user friendly, which I could have worked with if the training staff could have compensated somewhat. You found yourself running around in circles due to the program not following the path directed. The employee's who had been there long enough to train could not incorporate how to move the system along. Lots of wasted time and angry customers. Definitely in need of instrument testing."
good,"While it has been great working for AIG, the company's recent focus on their bottom line has caused instability. The company seems to be very top heavy and they are not concerned with attracting and maintaining talent in lower level operations. "
good,"AIG is an excellent place to work in a dynamic and global environment. The work life balance and benefits are probably the best in the financial services industry."
good,"My typical day at work was focused upon product development.  I designed life insurance policies, setting benefits and  charges.  Worked on insurance in various countries, including Canada, Chile, Japan and the United States.  I learned a great deal about business  and how a company runs.  The learning experience was incredible.  The workplace culture was fast paced.  The hardest part of the job was learning computer languages.  The most enjoyable part of the job was exposure to insurance around the world.  Studying for the examinations required for certification as an actuary was very demanding."
good,"Overall satisfied, however plenty of room for improvement. Compensation/benefits are nice, however little room for advancement and lax management culture lacking a clearly defined mission."
good,"AIG is one of the leading Life Insurance companies in America, and having the oppertunity to work for them i have come to know that from the top bottom, AIG is Awsome company and has a lovely work culture"
good,It was a pleasant place to work and I would recommend it to others. The hardest part of the job was fielding the occasional complaint by consumers which was easily resolved.
good,"Great place to work for a temporary job, no benefits, layoff could happen without notice, no room for advancement, manager was easy to work with, relaxed atmosphere"
good,"AIG bought my original employer, American General.  While a number of employees were actually walked out of the office on the day of the acquisition, I was not."
good,"A typical work day for a morning person like myself used to start slow, then speed up. Toward my end with the company it never slowed. I learned how to exercise patients and be a do-er for myself. Management is always there to help. The hardest part of the job was taking non-stop escalated angry calls all day and never a decent one. The best part to me was learning how to multitask and type faster."
good,ok company to work with. Work life balance is fine with limited growth opportunities. Pool table and Table tennis for recreation. Can be good company for you if like to have a good work life balance.
good,"It's been 19 years since I have been there.  It is not fair for me to review the company as it is today.  In my years at AIG I was well compensated, had the opportunity to learn and travel.  The people at the locations I visited were professional and had the best interests of the company in mind."
good,"AIG is an average employer, benefits are great but compensation could be better. Need to pay their employees more to match amount of work required. Extensive background done on each employee, this is a big plus!"
good,Cost cutting has increased job load.  Employees expected to take on larger load and work from home after hours.   Managers sometimes may not listen to your professional opinion when it impacts schedule.
good,"good work-life balance, good colleagues"
good,AIG is a great place to work if you have a desire to learn.  It is an environment that is constantly changing with many projects that are continuously delayed.  This requires a specific mindset of being able redesign and plan a project multiple times.
good,aig invented the insurance business-great place to cut your teeth-interesting people to work with-great global network-good benefits and a chance to advance
good,A typical day at AIG is answering as many phones calls as you can to help out agents and customers. The best part of the job is the people that you get to help with on a daily basis.
good,Es una de las organizaciones de seguros y servicios financieros líderes a nivel mundial donde se maneja un buen clima laboral e incentivan a los empleados a  facilidad de promocion
good,"- Great place to work "
good,While at AIG I was promoted many times. However the job culture change morale was low and job security was a thing of the past. People were being laid off for no reason... It was time to go.
good,"I enjoyed working for AIG ! Great coworkers , history , benifits , work life balance was amazing . My coworkers were great . One thing I miss are the people !"
good,AIG was in the process of becoming an ITIL company. AIG was a great company to work for as a contractor. The culture was easy going while being fast paced and agile.
good,"Due to the competition in insurance industry,  Most jobs are being outsourced to lower paying states.  The company would place you in position with minimal training, and inexperienced underwriters.  Even though it is your job as an underwriting assistance to assist the underwriters, In most cases you end up doing majority or the work, and get very little recognition for the job you do behind the scenes."
good,"In my 5 years working for AIG, this company has a high rate of turn over in the position I am due to poor leadership, lack of direction, lack of advancement."
good,"I enjoyed the job, although the office is now closed and was sold to Farmers insurance. The job was quick paced, and was graded on your efficiency to answer phone calls, and technically to answer all questions correctly. I found the job challenging but interesting and exciting at the same time."
good,"I worked here about 10 years ago. My work in the AMEX department was varied for the most part. Some days we were very busy, other days we could get stuck in one call for a half a day depending on the situation. We received calls from around the world. We had a daycare in the building but there is a new building so I'm not sure if that is still available. We had paid training/training retreats at the bosses cabin, new ownership now so I'm not sure if that's still going on either but it was so amazing - we did Covey's 7 habits and team building training there. First shift was busier and time flew by, second shift was more laid back and more fun."
good,It's ok to work at American International Group.  Benefit is grate compare to other companies.  Specially PTO and 401K.  The hardest part of the job is too many systems.
good,"excellent benefits"
good,Had a solid team and was given opportunity to lead within the company.  Felt like I had the support needed to confidently influence change within the bigger company.  Good experience overall.
good,"Nice place to work and learn.   "
good,"Muy buena institución, espectacular ambiente de trabajo, sin duda una de las mejores aseguradoras del país, muy comprometida con el aprendizaje continuo de sus colaboradores."
good,"Varied work situations due to size of company."
good,"It’s a large corporation with many rules that make it hard to get job done and compensation is always a concern. Short term insentive plan is a joke. Hopefully with new CEO things will change, now looking at growing the business instead of selling off."
good,"Had an overall great experience. Lots of opportunities to network and meet other teams within the company. At the end of the day, make sure you are on good terms with your direct manager. They have all the power to make or break you!"
good,AIG is a good place to work. The company has good work-life balance and coworkers are friendly and welcoming. I enjoy working in the team. AIG is getting better.
good,"Very stressful fast paced environment but rewarding and interesting. Long hours, on call.  International teleconferences at different time zones."
good,The management and persons I worked with were very friendly.  i was afforded three promotions whilst working there.  Unfortunately the company underwent some financial difficulties during my last year.
good,Division fun to work at. Mangers stress automation of reports. Learn a lot of technology and enhancements to the reporting process. There was a high level of turnover but management worked to train and develop the staff.
good,"Great team focus. High net worth clients, good broker relationships. Enjoyed the independent general agents and BGA's, exciting NYC atmosphere where you were allowed to be yourself and nuture your region and business partners. a serious player with great products and comp plans."
good,This company provided excellent training in auditing and insurance topics.  My co-workers and manager was always willing to help to satisfy deadlines.
good,Management issues from the top down to local offices.  Company is going through some difficult times and needs some stronger leadership.  Some employees do not feel secure in their jobs.
good,I worked at AIG as my first job out of graduate school. It provides a great platform and many opportunities to learn and exposure to people. I really appreciate the opportunity.
good,"Working at AIG was a good experience. You could definitely tell that managers had pressure to keep costs down. Also, everyone was really invested in teaching me things."
good,normal business hours and workplace is friendly. Love working here and interacting with customers.  Friendly coworkers that make the day go by fast.  Location is great
good,"Working in AIG has been fun, at the same time, it provided me with effective training sessions that helped improve my skills as a trainer and as an employee. I love working here then. The people were nice and accommodating, their facilities are great, and there are plenty of activities to engage in for all employees."
good,"However, depending on your team, work-life balance may/may not be as flexible as you desire. Management is not the most versatile and you will find there is room for much needed training (i.e. emotional intelligence 101). Still, good place to be at. Going through many changes, then again which company these days isn't do this as well?"
good,I worked for AIG for about 3 years and learned a huge amount. I worked on the retention team which was new to the company so we had a vast amount of training including Barclay's bank training . It was a full time job with shifts from 8am to 8pm . Answering calls from customers who wanted to cancel their policies of which it was our role to go through policy with customer to ensure that they were sure they wanted to cancel it. This was done via a script system of which had to be read verbatim . I excelled in my roll and was one of the top if not the top for retention and also sales.
good,"When it was a smaller company, it was great to work for.  Once a larger corporation took over, it definitely changed the importance of the employees."
good,Focusing a lot on the efficiency and process improvement in recent years. Looking forward to see how management will strategically create good work experience for employees in the future.
good,"As part of management team, work load is unpredictable on a daily basis. Sometimes stressful, but you will always have an option to enjoy it."
good,Exciting and high energy pace. Staff was very friendly and highly motivated. Management was constantly changing and was hard to keep up with who's who.
good,"shift starts at 9pm-530am, weekends off, i learned a lot regarding dedication to work and integrity, my coworkers are fun to be with, they promote work life balance. they even have billiard tables, pingpong tables, dart boards and a gym inside the company premises. the most enjoyable part of the job is during special events wherein you are allowed to watch singing competitions and other attractions during your free time. the company also give incentives to performing employees in cash or in the form of gift certificates and other novelty items."
good,The job has a lot of resources from your coach to your supervisor. It is a rewarding position and company that handled business fairly
good,"For such a huge company, it's remarkable that they allow employees to work at home. It is at the discretion of each department manager and so not everyone has this option.  "
good,"Good and Friendly Environment, good Progress to my Sales Career. Management was amazing, which was best part. give amazing chance to freshers. was convenient as well."
good,I like working at AIG as a contractor. Good pay and company culture/environment is good. Too many lay offs so everyone is on the edge of their seats. overall good place to work.
good,"• Worked predominantly as a Business Support Analyst for AIG Insurance supporting the UK, Ireland, Nordic regions– Handling Premiums, Claims, Reinsurance data on daily and weekly basis"
good,"Talented people, abundant employee resources and diverse culture. AIG is a good place to be for the beginning of one's career. The company has lots of bureaucracy and politics. I do not recommend it for one's advancement to management level."
good,"This position gave me phone call experience, a more indepth knowledge in Microsoft office, and improved my typing skills."
good,"AIG has a strong board of directors and is well run. Focus is on getting the best-qualified candidate for the open role."
good,I worked 14 years for AIG and enjoyed the challenges of my job.  I liked the interaction with the agents and working with the insureds.
good,"Manage complex casualty and excess construction defect claims for subcontractors involving a variety of trades.  Investigate and evaluate property damage values and negotiate settlements.  Analyze and interpret multiple types of commercial policies.  Prepare coverage letters and issue settlement checks.  Hire investigation experts and manage attorneys in coordinating settlements involving multiple parties.  Participate in site inspections, attend mediations and settlement conferences.  Reviewed legal documents and insured contracts.  Manage excess policy accounts."
good,"Great company that provides a safe environment to work in. Good opportunities to advance, and maintain a balanced life style. Work, family, and social life can be well lived as an AIG employee. Compensation is good as well."
good,The Management gives me a lot of help. I could keep asking questions if I felt confused. Very good company to work. It is a regret because the department I work will be wiped out and moved all jobs to India.
good,"In my time in AIG, I have learned so much both personally and professionally. All the people are highly knowledgeable in everything they do and are capable of working in a very fast paced environment."
good,Loved working at AIG. I learned a lot and changed positions during my ten years there.  The people were nice and the Admins. were all very supportive to each other.
good,"es una buena compañía, goza de excelentes productos,responde a las necesides de los clientes."
good,"I am happy working with AIG. As I am looking out for exposure and growth in my career, I would like to apply in other organizations."
good,"Very corporate and company is going though many transitions since 2008, but okay place to work."
good,"The insurance business is interesting with the mortally tables, life expectances. Was fun work place and never a dull moment."
good,"If you search indeed, payscale, salary, glassdoor, or any other compe sation site you will see that AIG consistently pays less than competitors for the same job title.  With that said, with the benefits package they offer, you'd have a hard time matching what the extras are that are offered.  If you've ever faced a large medical bill, you know that this is worth it."
good,"When I was still a call center agent, I had to multi task. I was asked to take calls and process claims at the same time as I was trained to do both. I was given a kot of opportunities from simply doing my responsibilities to additional tasks such as coaching, training, forecasting volume to handling escalated calls."
good,"This was a great place to work, there was lots of fun experiences and room for advancement. I met and maintained many friends from this company. There was a good deal of work at times, and we tackled it as a team. I learned how to deal with diverse group of clients. Regrettably, the company was caught up in the financial crisis of 2008, and contracted. We lost a lot of our work due to this. That was very hard for the staff and myself. Nevertheless it was a memorable growth and learning experience."
good,"A typical day consist of obtaining statuses on projects, managing others and helping solve day to day system problems.  Co workers are very professional and courteous.  Best part of the day is helping others solve problems and the instant gratification of seeing a project successfully implemented into production.  Hardest part of the job is not having enough time in the day to help others and get project  management tasks completed.  Managing others is a very rewarding challenge."
good,Co-workers made working here great and there was plenty of work to do in the beginning
good,"Fast paced, multi task, quite yet energetic office environment. Always balance between productivity and quality, and be ready for regular unexpected surprise of extras.."
good,"Good environment and very knowledgeable co-workers. I was part of the O&S Finance team, which gave me a board spectrum to explore my skills, on the domestic and international level. I was part of a highly qualified team and added value to the company by setting up Project Cost Reporting and Allocation Modules with a complex expense reporting process, having an Accounting and Finance background and being the linking key between Finance Operations & Systems and Technology team I was able to translate and understand specific financial requirements in order to deliver a better product. It was a pleasure to work with such talented people, both in the Finance and IT department, they were all great co-workers, team players and good mentors. I have learned a lot from our Financial managers, AIO and entire team."
good,Enjoyed working with this company because every was always willing to help others to meet deadlines
good,"No room for advancement as the company is laying off rather than hiring. Good management, decent workplace environment, very corporate. Not overly fun or exciting, just a normal job. Good benefits and pay."
good,"After 2008 and it's momentous changes, my work here took many twists and turns.  Working in a small direct group we were liaisons between NY Federal Reserve and other departments within the company.  I had direct responsibility for reconciling and arranging payments to and draws from Government line of credit.  In addition, our group oversaw derivatives reporting around the world, training groups from California to Japan and maintaining reports for cashflow and risk stemming from debt, foreign exchange and investments, as well."
good,"Answering phones, processing payments etc. It was an enjoyable experience, my co-workers and supervisors were a good lot."
good,"Responsible for reviewing, correcting and balancing of suspense items for entire disbursement unit"
good,AIG was a great place to work with lots of benefits and great knowledgeable people.
good,I have learned a lot and once was open to learn and excel. At that time I took initiative to learn all aspects of the jobs in my departments. My co-workers have all had over 20 years of insurance experience and taught me all I wanted to learn. Most days are full and although lunch is encouraged many days involve working through lunch to leave on time. Working from home is an option now so working extra hours is easier to do and maintain a home life. The hardest part of my job is gaining approval to write accounts and compete.
good,"Employees are respected,"
good,"My experience here at AIG is wonderful, the experience I have gained while working here for 22 years will provide assistance to me when I do leave the company.   The company has been downsizing during the last few years, that is the sole reason I am looking for employment elsewhere."
good,Typical day included interfacing with internal Business Units and coordination of projects with Technical Data Center staff; managing projects; problem resolution; insuring client satisfaction with service commitments.
good,I enjoyed solving problems and seeking answers for customers.
good,During my time there I enjoyed working for them and would have kept working for them if they had not sold my department.
good,"You work very hard and make your boss happy but when it comes to promotion they don't remember what you have done for the department. Instead, they give you silly reasons why they cannot promote you. I have more responsibilities this time than before and yet Management comes up with silly reasons not to promote me. There's too much politics involved when it comes to promotion."
good,clear instructions = quick processing.
good,Learned the processing of obtaining licensing for your vehicle
good,My engagement was temporary however I was able to learn and become knowledgeable with different software programs. This is where I became proficient with Microsoft Excel.
good,"Excellent company. Very good at training claim personnel. Management people were not as well trained which presented a problem. Co workers were great everyone engaged. Hardest part of the job was working with supervisor who was not commfortable with technical information. The most enjoyable was the company environment, benefits and pay."
good,You Learn a lot at AIG. Each person has a well defined job profile without any overlapping.
good,"One of the better call center opportunities. They do have a strict structure, typical of large call centers."
good,"Enjoyed working with all my co-workers, Always empowered to excel, Working conditions were great. Travel distance was very hectic, Compensation and advancement was minimal."
good,Very high volume / demand IT shop with strong goals to deliver against. Great compensation packages with some work flexibility. Lost of smart people but some politics that aren't unusual at other similar / large IT firms.
good,Good company to work for.  There is a work life balance culture that is encouraged.  And pay is competitive to market/industry standard.  Great benefits.
good,"This position offered security,  great benefits and an average salary."
good,I am no longer at aig I am a broker working mostly at transamerica I was a manager for Aig for 6 years  if my credentials aren’t enough I don’t need your company
good,"Good people and enjoyable company to work for. "
good,"Good work culture, good work from home, study policy."
good,Good job but commissions where not good if people didn’t pay you didn’t get paid. But if people paid their insurance it was good..my general manager was really good but they did change management a lot but then the offices closed where we live they had down size
good,AIG provides a great work life balance and the ability to work remotely 4 days a week and my team and manager are excellent.  There is no room for advancement in my department and salary increase is slim to none.
good,"I enjoyed my time working at AIG in the operations department. The building was nice, located in dtla. The parking was close by, free parking and near the freeway. My department colleagues and management were great. Work life balance was good. Good learning experience."
good,Management is encouraging and willing to change to deliver their products and services.  Management provides support to remove organizational challenges.
good,I loved my experience at AIG as a contractor and had a wonderful time there. The hardest part of the job was getting used to the very American centric style of working
good,"Nice environment, but unstable.  Very flexible and work with your schedule.  Vacations and Personal leave options are good. It was a great place to work except for the many lay offs."
good,"Answering phone, scheduling appointments, running client review"
good,"Good experience.  I learned a lot about handling professional liability claims.  I liked attending mediations and negotiatiating settlements. I developed skills including analyzing liablity and damages, and evaluating exposure."
good,It was indeed a great experience and learning with AIG. Working as an outbound campaign executive is tough but persistence and hard work are well compensated. The working culture was great however lapses are less opportunity to grow and excel in a higher or better position.
good,"A very fun please to work if you enjoy what you do."
good,My overall time with AIG was a pleasure. I grew fond of everyone but hate that all the office had to close. Would love to be there still. I worked with an awesome admin team. We had a great manager who wanted the company to grow and there were consent learning every day.
good,Good Work Life Balance. Flexible working hours. Management is changing  frequently. Way behind technology infrastructure compared to peers in market  .
good,"It seemed like there was room for advancement if you could get past the call center and its bad office politics and subpar management. They wanted to interview me for the job I wanted after I left the company, how could HR not know I was no longer employed there?"
good,"Great place - great people and a wonderful culture, leadership is earnest and well meaning … but big isn't always better. this is an industry leader top of the heap go there only if that is where you want to be."
good,good company to work if they had the Agency model. The culture of the company is sound. People helping Main street America. Quality of life.... insurance is a suite of products that change how we look at insurance.
good,Workplace at AIG was productive and fun. It was a pretty quiet environment. I learned to be able to work on my own. I only had 1 counterpart I worked directly with in the IT asset management department. We were the only ones in the entire IT inventory room
good,"Working with AIG was a fruitful experience as they not only focus on helping you grow in your career by providing the necessary trainings but also help you grow as a responsible , sensitive citizen of the world."
good,"Reviewed UW support team"
good,"Working in Aiggs IT dept allowed a work life balance. Pro: working remotely at least 3day week."
good,AIG gives a good platform to professionals who are looking to restart their career after completing college. They have management who promotes an environment that is conducive to young professionals who want to learn and add value to their team. They also give yearly incentive bonuses for performance to employees who maintain and exceed the expectations of their role.
good,Management changes every 18-36 months and with each change a different direction is implemented. The vision set for the impacted areas are never met.  Constantly starting over but never seeing anything through the complete transformation.
good,"Great place to work, there are good team building initiatives as well as cross functional teams that actually make sense.   For the most part I felt as though my work was my own."
good,"AIG è un'azienda che richiede molto."
good,Scope of work started to be focused and eventually scope expands as part of economic development.The regional role was very challenging due to difference in  the provisions of the law.
good,"I was attached to CS and now back end team. I love helping my customer's who call in to resolve their problem.The happiness when the issue has been resolve and they they greet thank you,that situation always make me happy. I have learned how to be more patient, and talk in a good manner.The is hectic sometimes to keep answering the calls, but i do enjoy it, my management did valued me that's why looking for diff job."
good,"Productive, business-casual drss-code workplace with high professional standards of workplace ettiquette, and strict adherance to PCI standards, with private desks."
good,"There's nothing but at all based on my experience.i would say that its the Best place to work and management. However, sometimes Reassurance is difficult when compromise by some manipulative nature."
good,"It is a good company as it is very solid management. However you need to look upon the operation team on how they are treated."
good,"AIG is a great place to work. Great people, professional culture, and a supportive staff. The company direction will be pretty evident to you early on, and whether or not you will want to be there long term will be pretty easy to determine."
good,"Being a life claim examiner where you deal with death on a daily basis can be stressful. However, we had a strong work family environment and supported each other on a regular basis."
good,"AIG was a challenging, yet rewarding place to work. While the work environment was fairly conservative, the people were friendly and approachable. Things do tend to move slower at such a  large company, so pack your patience. You do, however, learn a great deal of business sense, competitive insight, and power moves at AIG."
good,"Workplace allows Project Managers to lead projects to completion if funding and management is available to support project initiatives."
good,"We worked hard and had very supportive relationships with the other employees. "
good,Gained all Insurance knowledge and experience at AIG.  I started working at AIG in 1991 and left the Organization in 2015.  I do not know who the current AIG CEO is.
good,Overall a great place to work. Onboard process needs some improvement.  Work anywhere policy supports a great work -life balance. Senior management open to suggestions for innovation and actually implemented them.
good,AIG is an amazing place to work and has great managers that are willing to help you with any issues you may have. AIG's interview process is slightly more difficult than other companies' but it is worth it to be able to work in such a great place.
good,"Been around since 2012 and AIG has gone through DRAMATIC shifts of layoffs, change in management, stagnant pay, and no merit increases. During layoffs, workload was redistributed, which was needed, but very little acknowledgement from management on the hard work. Overall pleased, and new management has done very well in changing the status quo"
good,The office was very laid back.  We were able to work from home two days a week.  We could also wear jeans. My direct managers were always good managers and looked out for their reports.  I enjoyed my position at AIG.
good,"Managers are flexible regrading work/life balance, requesting time off, etc...Not interrupted by agent calls and emails as much as other companies. Good communication system."
good,able to work remotely and come into the office once a week was really great for worklife balance. management was local in the office and open to discussions
good,My work involved gathering data from different groups and there are too many systems carrying similar data and it took a lot of time to synchronize it and put it to use.
good,"The manager at the office was good, in Hicksville. He was concerned about the workers and listened to their problems. He walked around the office almost every day to ask the attorneys what problems they had with their cases. He therefore had few surprises. The support staff seemed to like him also."
good,"The job was wonderful, until the bail out happened, the company down sized and then my branch got cut, we all were laid off due to non relocation. The worst part is that I just hit my three years."
good,Good technology and team members but very poor management. Lack of training and constant micromanagement creates a very hostile environment for employees.
good,"Nice infrastructure setup which, really helped our mind to work with lot of focus."
good,"* A typical work day was 9-10 hours a day"
good,AIG is a company with diverse culture and diverse technologies. I would recommend AIG to anyone at anytime.Very good benefits. Flexible work arrangements.
good,"AIG has some of the best benefits to offer. They match you up to 6 percent in 401k, start with 24 PTO days, maternity leave for both partners, short-leaves, and health benefits."
good,Every day includes interesting work and routine work.   Interesting work includes understanding business opportunities and how we can apply technology to create real business value.   Focusing on a few things that make a difference has worked well in moving things forward.   The biggest challenge is getting buy-in from all the stake holders which requires creating relationships and explaining business value in non-IT terms.   The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing your hard work pay off and doing something that makes a difference.
good,"AIG is an always changing environment, so I learnt to implement new processes within a though deadline."
good,"A typical day on the call-floor is very laid back. Most managers are willing to help you. There are a team of supervisors that are available during business hours to answer questions that customer service representatives may have, or take supervisor calls should they need to. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping others and building relationships with your coworkers. The hardest part of the job is keeping calm with upset customers that call in, and continuing to help them even though you may be frustrated. Throughout my time here I have gained a lot of experience in dealing with all kinds of people in multiple situations and how to deescalate people very well."
good,"AIG is a good place to work in. Has a nice environment and friendly managers and teammates. Their benefits are good, especially their free health card. NO need to pay additional for dependents."
good,"Great PTO and 401K benefits. Overall good place to work."
good,"AIG gives you many opportunities to expand your skill set, and to gain exposure in several different fields. However, it is a difficult company to advance in."
good,"It happened when one of the IT bosses from Texas visited Manila. We were on an early shift to attend the activity in the afternoon. We need to manage our time properly in our time properly in order to submit our deliverables for that day. After our shift ended, we went to the venue and it so nice to see the Fiesta-theme which shows how the Filipinos celebrate an event like this. The committee wore an Ati-atihan costume, there were food like turon (sweet wrapped bananas), dirty ice cream, fish balls, etc. We played games such as Luksong-Baka and some relay games. At the end of the day, we were able to make our boss very happy."
good,"Pros"
good,"Travail en equipe avec des collegues bien sympa"
good,"Un + pour son environnement son dynamisme et sa culture d'entreprise."
good,overall a great place to work with great benefits. Currently in a transitioning period where uncertainty remains. Salaries are competitive based on role and skillset. Opportunity for advancement continues to be non-existent in some areas.
good,"Learn to be patient w nasty or impatient policyholders."
good,The environment is suitable for a good and productive organization. It feels like a home away from home. The people are accommodating and you will feel at home right away. I was able to share and further enhance my skills as a Customer Care Associate III and they were able to provide me with the proper training that I needed in order to perform my duties well.
good,"Working in AIG Shared Services made me enjoy my career more because of the several opportunities I was able to experience while I was an employee. I was given the chance to acquire certifications and even work closely with upper management. My exposure to this experience made me more interested in project management and organizational development. Also, I love how friendly and accommodating the people I've worked with here were. Lastly, the targeted coaching that my supervisors provided me. This company showed me that family can also be found in one's workplace."
good,"Work culture is great, good salary but they keep changing the structure and eliminating positions which makes the job very challenging by letting go very smart and knowledgeable people. One day it's likely you'll meet the criteria."
good,A typical day at work involves many challenges not only with the work itself but also working with over 100 underwriters who in effect are our customers as well as co workers.
good,"start at 8:00 AM (at latest) and finish around 5 PM...  Staff and Management were great to work with.  As in any Office Operation, there are some people that make it challenging.  But, they were in the minority.  Local and Middle Managers were very reasonable to work with.  It was nice to learn new things as an Environmental Underwriter."
good,"Good Place to work, enjoyed my tenure with this company, Learned a lot in terms of business and Corporate Policies."
good,AIG is a good workplace where you can learn alot from colleagues and in company.  There's always a quarterly team building.  It gives us a chance to know more about our co-workers which is fun and enjoyable.
good,I learned a lot at AIG and the management is generally easy to work with.  The hardest part of the job was the way systems were sometime implemented.  The people were the best part of the job.
good,"Allowed myself to have creative freedom in a relaxed atmosphere, with great management. AIG did the best to accommodate me for the high costs of living in the San Francisco Bay Area. Only downfall was being laid-off during company cutbacks from a job I truly enjoyed."
good,"AIG has good working environment. Employees are easy to deal with. However, since it's a US based company, most of its employees are on graveyard shift."
good,"With more than 2+ years experienced as Analyst in and AIG, my area of expertise is Data Virtualisation/Visualisation and Data Analytics using CIS, SQL Server and PLSQL scripting."
good,"Atypical day at work goes with small feeling of excitment expecting the unexpected and there's no rutine."
good,"Management Transition"
good,"Change direction often, always busy great promotion of teamwork!! opportunity for growth always present if you are on the correct career path. Very inclusive and always positive."
good,"An organisation constantly changing and providing new challenges and experiences, gives a real opportunity to develop and broaden skills, knowledge and experience. one of the key challenges is managing language and timezones in a global organisation when driving global transformation initiatives."
good,Nice place and people. Good start for me. I learned a lot at AIG. Meet some friends. Verified employee and ensured all content was updated.

good,AIG is transforming in to lean and Agile company. It is a very interesting work environment with lot of projects to support various BU globally.

good,"I didn't have any benefits because I'm in a temporary position. "
good,No micro management from management for day to day assignments.  Need to be self driven and good working with virtual teams
good,Assisted clients with their retirements. Also New Business-Retirement Manager. Re balance assets-Helped with loans. Sent out loan application if not available online.
good,"When I started at AIG (Formally known as Fleet Legal) I was shy, had no confidence and had minimal skills and knowledge. "
good,This is a very good company to work for and the people are very intelligent. I have certainly enjoyed working there. It's an environment that fosters learning and management is very supportive.
good,"Overtime were not paid."
good,"Good work culture and team work if one is experienced. Place for learning latest technologies. "
good,This was a excellent place to work. There were room for advancement and opportunity to grow with the company. The company had flexible time frames which assisted throughout my career.
good,Good Work life balance and working environment. Noo emphasis on talent retention or advancement. Restricted learning and growth opportunities.
good,The Advisor Group is a great company to work for. The job culture if great but no real opportunities for growth or advancement. They offer great benefits however the compensation is not within industry standards. I'm looking for growth therefore I'm seeking other employment.

good,"Pro: E-working is probably the best part about this company.  "
good,"Es un trabajo bastante agradable donde podíamos aportar nuevas ideas ,había consideraciones en ocaciones si surgía alguna necesidad familiar por mi parte fue agradable laboral ahí,"
good,I was able to display my supervisory role if my team lead was out. The experience at the lender services facility has allow me to evolve and understand the credit industry.
good,"What I like about this job is it makes me better in planning & organizing tasks as one needs to juggle multiple priorities at once. We keep a daily, monthly and quarterly plans as well as organize meetings & conferences in order for the job to be done on specific timelines, but not sacrifcing the quality of deliverables."
good,Very structured and culture is great but the opportunity for growth was lacking at the time.  It's been over 10 years since I worked for AIG so not sure if my review would still be relevant.
good,"It is a highly deadline driven culture with so much of on the job learning opportunities specially during the peak times of each quarter. The organization is changing aggressively at the moment."
good,"The job was okay, I was able to make some great friends which to me was the best part of the job but there was never a feel for job security and they are known for lay offs."

good,I learned a variety of management jobs while employed with AIG.  Great people and work environment.
good,"Flexibility in work-from-home and hours."
good,"My typical day at work started at 9am. I would  take care of the administrative duties, and then proceed to the accounting part of my job. This part was the most challenging. I had to familiarize myself with basic and some advanced accounting practices and principles. This was in order for me to be able to properly reconcile premium payments that were already made to clients in the past. We were basically double checking that the payouts were properly allocated and calculated. "
good,Good place to work but limited opportunities in my office. Branch location.
good,"I experience some pros and cons, co-workers are excellent."
good,"Typical day at work involves speaking to insurance brokers regarding insurance policies; generally renewal increase discrepancies, coverage accuracy, inspection changes, coverage questions.  I underwrite renewal policies and endorsements to existing insurance policies.  Interact and work with the underwriter daily to ensure proper policy pricing or to seek approval to release renewals & endorsements."
good,You get to work with different people with varied pespective. It is indeed one great place to gain experience of working in a fast paced environment with short time to product ad hoc analysis.
good,"Training Specialist in a fortune 500 finance company. Experienced in human resource management and benefits development. During my time at AIG, I was able to increase productivity in the benefits customer service division through mentoring new employees.

good,There are great employees to work with at AIG. AIG offer on site training and great job advancements.
good,Very fun family friendly work environment. I hated to have to leave.
good,"Starting at the clerical position was a good introduction to the insurance claims. I was able to see the beginning to the end of how a claim was handled, contacts made and payments to go out to customers, businesses and attorneys. As I progress up the ladder, so to speak, I had a better insite to what the customer needed as well as what was expected from the company's needs. Most of my co-workers were more like friends and family and very helpful. To some the hardest part of the job was working with the public, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. My hardest part was trying not to be too involved in one claim."
good,Was like being a lobbyist daily. Learn all government affairs domestically and internationally. Loved visiting AIG HQ in New York.
good,"Good place to work.  Lots of training opportunities.   Global company which means you may work in the United States but your direct manager may be based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"
good,Workload dwindled once cost cutting was the main focus. Jobs were being sent overseas and projects were being cancelled. Good work-life balance for the most part...
good,during my time at AIG at felt like my job actually had a purpose. it never felt boring. Management team was always willing to help you and train you to help you understand the task at hand.
good,"The managers are fantastic and the work environment is great. However there is little to no room for advancement, promotions or compensation increases. This lowers moral over time and drives employees to leave."
good,"AIG has so many aspects for learning and educational growth with regards to Commercial Insurance."
good,"Working at AIG has helped my progression in not only typing, but knowledge in certain computer programs and software. As a quality analyst, I review hundreds of transactions on a daily basis dealing with clients retirement funds and life insurance policies. A transaction is processed, and it's my responsibility to make sure it is correct before the funds leave the company. The management team over my department is very laid back and easy to work with. When a problem arises, the management does their best to help fix it. The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with individuals with a poor work ethic. My job weighs heavily on other people doing their job, so if that job isn't done properly then it makes my days longer as I have to wait on them to finish all work that comes in that day. The most enjoyable part of the day is certain co-workers that I have the pleasure of working with. AIG is a good company overall, but I am definitely ready for something new."
good,"AIG is a company that, while geared to providing the best service possible for its clients, makes sure its employees are well compensated and treated fairly."
good,"Excellent work-life balance, possibly the best as far as I know. The managers there are easy-going and care about your career development. Great support for work authorization."
good,I had a good experience working for that company. I wish they kept all the offices throughout the country and avoid consolidating their operations. It was good for a long while.
good,Ability to work as an individual contributor or in a group depending on manager.  Lots of flexibility to work remotely if you want. Some slow periods during the early summer but work picks up by end of July.
good,"I live working at AIG. The work environment is great and inclusive and management is also very good. Pay and benefits, specially 401K, are excellent; however, recently there have been a large amount of layoffs which creates a lot of uncertainty in regards to job security."
good,friendly environment. Learn new technologies good place for freshers. Need to increase compensation for existing employees other wise everything is good
good,"Former department dissolved, up to and including CEO."
good,I felt like all of my co-workers were highly capable and a pleasure to work with.  We were also provided with up-to-date work tools and a nice working environment.  The biggest challenge was navigating through the bureaucracy of working in such a large corporation.  There were too many layers of management and departmental silos.  Overall I would recommend working for this company.
good,"Worked for AIG first as a contractor then as an FTE (full time employee) for a several years. "
good,"Working with Strategy directors on the business strategy presentation."
good,"Very enjoyable job. Monday through Friday, no weekends. They feed you for lunch if you have to work overtime. You get to pick your schedule if you are in the top 50."

The most difficult part is gathering enough information on time from the broker in order to have the accounts prepped.  The underwriters have also taken me on client meeting/luncheons to meet with our clients to put my name to a face and vice versa.  It has been a pleasure meeting the people I interact in person than just through emails and phone calls. I've learned a lot about insurance and how accounts are analyzed.  the experience has been great. 
good,"it was a very busy day.  I learned more about computer and different machines.  it was nice working with my co-workers.  after working at maksin / aig for 13 years I had a lot friends that care for me."

I loved my co-workers and managers.  The hardest part was when we were told that the company was closing and people were upset and didn't complete their work correctly.  
good,"AIG provided a great opportunity for me to use my skills and dedication to advance my career in this industry. I was provided many opportunities to learn various parts of the annuity business.  I worked for several different managers and directors and prior to my years from 2000 to 2007 I worked from 1990 through 1994 as a Commission supervisor.I wouldn't call my various duties as hard but challenging. I made good friends who all worked together toward a common goal, to be a part of a growing leader in the Amarillo area. "

good,Excellent company to work for. Very professional but warm friendly atmosphere and great interaction with staff members.
good,"Very smart and collegial employees"
good,AIG met my needs as gave me an opportunity to prove myself.  The position allowed me the chance to grow my career.    It was demanding work as always in a call center environment.
good,"I happened to be interning at AIG during a time when the technology department was being phased out of the New York offices, so several employment changes around me and above me kept my work from being very consistent. That said, all of my coworkers were extremely supportive and willing to help me find enw tasks to work on when projects were canceled by higher-ups, and very encouraging of me developing new skills and having an active role in group sessions. The intern experience specifically was very enjoyable, with weekly gatherings of all the young interns to network, discuss our work, and relax with some chess boards and a ping-pong table."
good,AIG as a whole was a great corporation that values it employees. I truly enjoyed working there and appreciated having a supervisor who values his team. I was laid off due to cut backs and having my department outsourced. AIG not only gave me a HEALTHY severance package and hired a job finding group called Risemart. A company dedicated to finding me a new job and assisted in the creation of a brand new eye catching resume.
good,"You start out with 2 weeks of training, and jump right into the job. There are opportunities to learn more, and get raises. It is an inbound call center. There is not a lot of calls that are escalated because most people are calling to ask for help. The staff is great, and the office has a good atmosphere."
good,Overall I would say that AIG is the best place I have worked so far. The company really values its team members and I always felt included in activities. Training and opportunities to rotate from operations to engineering are great. I wish I was still there working for them. This is the only company I would go back to if the opportunity presented itself.
good,Sales agent good job and great products to sell. Very good company probably the largest insurance company.  This company has great benefits too. A fun place to work.

good,"Great culture and management. Vacation and benefits are a plus. If you like working for a family oriented company, this is the place for you.  They deliver on their promises."
good,"The workplace culture is quite diverse and while the company has greatly expanded its work from anywhere (remote) environment, it makes for a difficult way to meet with your manager when they are in a 5 hour different time zone.  However, there is a lot of flexibility in your hours as there are times when you would be training teams quite literally around the globe.  That makes working from home a super way to achieve the work/life balance!  The downside is that a company as big as AIG is in a constant state of change when it comes to upper management.  One man's vision does not last long until someone else comes up with something different.... market trends maybe, but not all the time."
good,"Uma boa empresa para se trabalhar, com grande possibilidade de promoção e aprendizado."
good,I was a scheduler. The job was only to get me through school. But the work environment was awesome and so was management. I loved the culture. It was a family-oriented business.

good,"Generally, it is a well-managed organization with high standards for employees and it does provide areas for growth.  My tenure ended due to workforce reductions nation-wide."
good,Lots to learn which is a plus since I enjoy learning. I worked with a lot of good people whom I will miss. I felt that I could speak with management whenever needed. The hardest parts of the job were overcoming systems issues which at times created backlog and getting people trained well enough to do the job independently. The most enjoyable parts of the job were becoming an expert in my field and being able to train and support fellow employees. A typical day included processing claim including legal documents and urgent items and assisting anyone who needed help.
good,The workplace has a conducive environment to perform our daily tasks without any objections. I have learned to give my 100% concentration on my job. All my team leader and managers are so friendly and supportive. They are willing to teach and assist when I do mistakes or have any doubts regarding job tasks.
good,"Well, a typical work day. Just come in and do what is required and expected of you. Very pleasant and professional environment. You earn your trust with the quality work you do with management and fellow peers. In time you do all your tasks without supervision. Casual dress in the office. Nothing is hard if you put your mind into it. You always learn something new and how to approach obstacles daily. Interacting and socially you can learn from everyone.The most enjoyable part is if you get recognized for the tasks and projects completed then complimented with a simple thanks, job well done or even a smile. That was my rewards which I got many times throughout the years. I come each day to earned those achievements of given my 90%+ of quality services and my 110% all to do so."

I could not longer work there because I became pregnant and it would affect my pregnancy.

I worked closely with the senior financial analyst to determine the formula and the solutions to accurately compensate the claimants. I compiled spreadsheets, reports, and put together th manual.

good,"I’ve been with AIG for just under 2 years. The department has a great culture and only has a few obnoxious/annoying people. However, there are a lot of people who think the management team sets unreasonable expectations but those are the people who are consistently ranked in the bottom of performance. Do your job and management will leave you alone. I’ve been promoted a couple of times already and have been able to accomplish and grow so much professionally."
good,AIG has a great company culture and morale that they pride themselves in! Great opportunity for anyone looking to advance within the financial/insurance industry!
good,"Enjoyed flexible hours, going to conventions, and getting to know brokers. Old software (excel) led to large amounts of data input. Worked as a team, but there was competition between teammembers, and performance was strongly based upon numbers of sales."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my responsibilities' at AIG is to be a part of a work related family that believes in commitment, success and longevity.  Through AIG I've gained professional and personal advancement."
good,"If you can understand retirement accounts and want to do all you can to assist clients with understanding and assisting them with their retirement accounts/goals, this would be the place for you.  Not required to be a financial advisor, although the knowledge here is more of the inner workings of retirement accounts (i.e.. Annuities and Mutual fund accounts) that could assist one in becoming a financial advisor."
good,"Very nice environment. I worked with my counterparts across the Glove, from Asia to Europe, great friends to work with, some times I have to be on the conference calls off normal business hours.

good,"I have been at the company since January 2015 and I have no complaints about AIG. There is always room for growth within the company as your personal goals towards your career path/job position. The hardest part of the job is attaining new knowledge in a short amount of time. I learned DO NOT hesitate to ask questions toward your manager, even the smallest question will benefit your job title. They always have monthly events with everyone within the company like BBQ's, American Cross, or 5k walks. Managers from different departments would have Town Hall meetings on a monthly basis  encourage in employees to interact with discussions/ topics open to the public. The management style may vary depending who you get as your manager. There are managers who are hands-ons with bi-weekly one-on-one meetings or even group meetings. Don't be afraid to speak up with a concern you have because they are willing to listen and work with you. Keep in mind to be respectful and professional in the workplace.  I recommend anyone to work at AIG because you will be more open minded about any position available online their website. Not all position require you to have a certification in insurance unless you are interested to be an underwriter."

I also did quality control to review other co workers work,   I trained new employees that came to work for the team.  I was then asked  by management to start processing the funds that came in for the other companies.  I was responsible for making sure that all the queues were worked.

Work Life balance is sufficient, you have at least 2 weeks paid vacation plus PPO days.  Management was ok, just depended upon who you got as a manager there.

My co-workers are always a blessing as they provide me with many new possibilities and challenges. The hardest part of the job is not being able to give a customer what they want. The most enjoyable part was being able to assist anyone who needed my help."
good,-Great Company to work for . I work at the company for 25 years
good,"Constant in-fighting, layoffs, downsizing. mismanagement. No salary raises or increases in years. No clear strategy or direction. asked to do more work with less people. leadership out of touch and showed favoritism. Sent work overseas to India.

good,Poor management and no tolerance for explaining duties or expectations to subordinates. Feared for your job from day to day and it was threatened every day....................................................................................................
good,"Started this job back in '89. Since that time we changed names, and were bought out twice. Typical day was busy. I learned a lot over the years as initially it was old slave terminals and then progressed to full online programs, windows etc.  I learned a lot with regard to commissions, check issuance, general ledger reconciliations, and basic insurance practices as well as audit procedures for internal and external.  The management tem was decent but lacking in guidance and incentive over the last few years in our division due to the uncertainty of our division.  The hardest part of the job was finding the correct contact as there was no directory that provided which offices people were in unless you knew a specific individual and office location.  The most enjoyable part was working with agents and interoffice/regional contacts who were appreciative for the extra efforts made."
good,"Very stressful place to work,  You do not know if you will have a job tomorrow.  Work is being outsourced."
good,"One of the bests jobs I have ever had. Exceptional boss, 100% remote based with the option to work onsite as necessary. Exceptional benefits (health, employee discounts, bonus, PTO, etc). The salary was not as competitive as I would have wished but the work flexibility and employee benefits  made up for some of that. AIG like many other companies had massive lay-off and it affected employee morale and work allocations significantly."
good,Es una gran empresa que exige conocimiento e iniciativa. Puedes tener muchos retos y oportunidades

good,"Absolutely fantastic company to work for. Work hours are good, the training is extremely extensive, the environment is friendly, in management is completely understanding. The only downside to working here was the inability to get things done for customers quickly. Anything that has to go to another department when you're a customer service representative has to be done through a ""work item"" , which meant that you had to submit the equivalent of an orange screen email to put it in a query. I for the most part would simply call the other department and have them take care of the problem immediately. Failing to do so usually would create redundant scenarios where they were giving the same generic answers over and over again, thus giving customers the runaround. This eventually upset upper management, who attempted to get me in trouble for it. Other than this one issue with working here it's otherwise a great place to work for. If you have patience, this is the job for you."

After all these trainings and readings, I got a general idea of the property and casualty industry. I was very grateful that my manager and my buddy gave me a lot of help and support, and really paid attention on me during the summer internship.

My day consisted of answering phones, creating spreadsheets, producing word documentations, ordering supplies, customer relations with clients and interacting with various department heads to get input needed to complete projects."
good,Must meet quotas and stay in bonus to make any kind of money. In 2015 compensation was changed to individual pool where you draw a percentage and no one like that. It was hard to have a high number paycheck.

good,"Not too many bad things to say about this place. The pay is amazing, the managers are alright, they keep to themselves most of the time except for when they grade you once a month on your calls and attendance of course. I added fast-paced and slow-paced because sometimes the calls would be off the hook and sometimes non-existant. A lot of people would take their PTO for granted and call out whole days and it would make the call log busier which sucked, but as long as everyone was at work, usually the call log is pretty decent. If you don't mind setting up claims and repeating yourself over and over again a million times a day every day then this job is for you. It got really old, really quick for me lol."

Considering that I am fresh out of college with minimum experience and has yet to acquire many of the skills that they had from working for AIG for years, they really took it upon themselves to make sure that the transition for me was smooth. Any time I had a questions, they were always willing to help with no problem. Many of them also had a great sense of humor, which helped the day go by.
