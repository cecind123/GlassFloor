rating,review
bad,"plant shutdowns during your shift, sent home early; try living on 28 hours a week or less, always threatening to close the doors and go out of business. and there no masco and haven't been in years, merrilat. a poor place to work and no future or job security."
bad,"You'll have to do 4-5 different jobs simultaneously somehow and your managers won't care that you're stressed. I'd recommend not going anywhere near this place, unless you enjoy being ignored and overworked."
bad,I was an employee of 9 years worked as a production lead and machine operator in a lot of departments. there attendance policy sucks and the management team is right there with it. they always pick who they like for jobs instead of who is more qualified and who has more time in the company. I liked my co-workers and employees I never had one person that I could not work well with. if it wasn't for there management and stupid policies people might stay.
bad,horrible place to work. they act like they give a  and they could not possibly care less. your superiors will always be lying and manipulating. I have never worked in such a terrible place.
bad,"This company is unethical, and harmful to the communicates that is targets. Through acquisitions MASCO consumes competitors only to run the plant into the ground. This company harms communities, ignores the safety of its workers, and uses tax dollars to do it. I recommend you research Mills Pride in Waverly, Ohio. Prior to considering applying at any MASCO affiliate."
bad,"seriously don't work here, management has no idea what they are doing, they want to work your butt off for little pay, they expect too much and are willing to give nothing. Training here also terrible."
bad,"I was employed as a contract worker. I did data entry for the cabinet orders. I was terribly mistreated everyday, im not sure if it was because of my race or job status. I literally dreaded going to work, the atmosphere was so toxic, being commonly referred to as ""the temp"" instead of my name. I would not recommended."
bad,"This place sucks, it's hot first off, the work is fairly easy but tiring ! You get 3 breaks but the break room is so classless & dirty it's sad. Old school equipment, dirty dirty dirty place. Insulin hanging out of the walls, cobwebs in the ceiling. The bathrooms are a DISGRACE, the people up there don't even wash their hands GROSS. They force you to count during morning exercises. Training is trash they show you 3 times how to do something then boom you on your own for the next 3 hours until they remember they're training you. The pay isn't even worth it honestly. Not friendly or welcoming people, they watch you struggle with a task and don't even help. I would not not recommend someone working here."
bad,Masco is definitely one of the worst places I've ever worked at. The communication is terrible. No structure. I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone
bad,"did not like the work environment. a lot of gossip, confusion about who to report to, managers were unhelpful at times, co workers always seemed unhappy"
bad,"My first two years was good until new management came in and screwed everything up for everyone. A lot of people left. Poor management, favoritism, and lack of employees for the rising work load."
bad,Shortly after leaving this company they changed hands again and no longer exist. Management was terrible and the sales staff outdated and did not keep up with industry changes
bad,"reported drug use and they wrote me up for it, when I complained they fired me. nepotism is rampant. unbelievable. they will defend their friends no matter what."
bad,i worked here for longer than expected only because the money was decent enough and i lived close.this was not a very good place to make a career.
bad,Just a job to get money to pay the bills learned a lot co-worker were nice management was okay it was all hard the most enjoyable part of the job was to go home
bad,Working in the AR billing department is a set up for failure position.   The pay is not good at all especially for a bachelor degree requirement.  The company is disconnected with corporate office.   Save your time and stay away from MASCO especially the Dublin location.  Promises are told but not delivered.  They chew you up and spit you out.
bad,"This company/branch had to be the most unorganized, fragmented company I have ever worked for.  No one knew what tasks they were assigned and there was no direction from management.  The sales guys in the office bored on offensive with the language and inappropriate comments.  Run away from this company!"
bad,I knew how to run everything in the plant and how to fix them. i had my hands in every proccess knowing them and making them. But still no respect.  
bad,overtime without notice different standards for different people
bad,Upper management treats employees as if they are children. They set unattainable expectations and change rules to set an unfavorable work environment.
bad,I was offered this position through the employment agency I was working for at the time. It was within 3 miles from my home.
bad,"A typical work day would be coding of AP invoices. Analysis of balance sheet accounts to ensure proper posting and balances. Working with assigned divisions on purchase order corrections and expense analysis."
bad,Behr Paint Tech Support and Customer Service is a revolving door. You will be asked to go through a local temp agency; this is your first clue.
bad,In my opinion I have seen a lot of favoritism. Management is picked by each other not by there qualifications. If you get put in a position there is no room for you to improve your self unless your part of their click.
bad,"Poor Management in Temecula Location, very high turnover, long hours, unrealistic goals, micro managed, always undermiined by management. The pay is ok but not worth it. Used to be a fun company with parties and perks but not anymore. This location supports a few locations and thats where all the money goes. Puts product on the market with known flaws and works it out later."
bad,"This is my experience... As soon as you come in youre finding out everything that was negative the day before and they tell you in a way that belittles you. If the job isn't your job you still worry BC of how negative everything is. In a ur and a half so and I've heard good job once. The PLANT manager is always yelling at the supervisors for more more more when he knows nothing about why, might know some bit he doesn't come to us and find out. As a source of punishment they took the ice machine away so now you have to walk way farther when parched...."
bad,The management at Masco was under change during my employment there..  I was hired by a manager that left before my start date..My role was under immediate change .
bad,I Have total 8 years Experience in construction back ground.i have also abroad experience . i am doing job MEP QA /QC right now . i am in Dubai with dhabi contracting LLC
bad,Do not plan on a life outside of work. Mandatory overtime every single week for years. Management says it will get better but it just kept getting worse. Some Saturdays are mandatory as well.
bad,"Mt sterling plant has idiots in the office that don't have a clue what's going on out on the floor. They don't care about you getting to see your family. You only know what time to come in, but never know when your getting off work. They don't fix anything that breaks, they expect you to ""make it work."" Good lord willing and the creek don't rise, I will never work there again."
bad,I didn't work here long  I was getting close to my 90 days so I thought I was getting hired in. Showed up to work and not many people were there and they said only permanent employees work when it's slow so I showed up to work and didn't even know I was laid off until I got there. The pay was very low but it was an easy job. Maybe management has changed since then but I didn't have a good experience. It just would have been nice to know I was laid off.
bad,There was no room for job Improvement raises were rarely given management tend to favor other employees are bonuses got taken away and are pay got decreased because of that
bad,"Work you extra hard, no compensation"
bad,"good fun working environment, co- workers where great to work with easy to get along with. we where like a family if somebody needed help there was one of us always there to help them."
bad,"A typical day at work for me is getting myself setup for the day, and I've learned how kitchen cabinets are made, and how much work it really takes to make a perfect doors for a kitchen. Management I really don't know what to say about them, and far as the culture it's diverse, and the hardest thing about the job is the heat, and the most enjoyable part besides seeing something being put together that I helped build is my co-workers because I'm a people person, and I get along with everyone"
bad,Trust me these people do not care about you. Starting with the people in Orlando. The management suck. They will set you up to get rid of you. Do not trust the driver next to you.
bad,"The application process is ridiculous. The management group tells you they are very impressed with your experience and look forward to working with you. When you follow up on the status they tell you they don't know anything. They still claim they want to hire you but need to wait for corporate to make a decision. Why would a corporate office select a construction sales rep that they have never met. In the beginning it seems like a great place to work. But the warning bells ring loud and clear that they are not a descent place to work. I worry about their ability to deliver to there customers. If hiring is this hard for them, running a company must be a fiasco."
bad,Liked at first then hated. No time for anything cause you'll always be working. Don't get vacation til after a year get points for calling off even for emergencies.
bad,Not recommended to work there if u are not of latino descent. There will be no advancement before the families that work there. Green cards preferred.
bad,"How can you succeed when you have 3 changes in managent 2 levels deep in 10 months. I never talked to my direct supervisor (new and old) more than 2 times in 10 months about MY business. When it came time for my mid year review with #3 the company decided that their business model was not working for the company and they could not justify having a sales person in a territory that had such a small volume of work to chase. WTF! They changed their business model twice in 10 months. It takes time to ramp up a sales funnel people."
bad,Everything happens for a reason but if your a big company like masco you should be on top of things. And they are terrible at that. The breaks are no acceptable they want you to rush in from smoking but not giving enough time to get to car and smoke.
bad,New Vice president took over and changed the whole sales process that was bringing in a large return on investment. Closed a lot of facilities and laid off a lot of good people. I was grateful that I was not one of them.
bad,Its a factory. That's all I have to say. If you never worked a factory this is a new experience
bad,Masco Bought the company I worked for (Mills Pride) as it was one of it competitors. Masco ruined the company on purpose costing hundreds of people jobs.
bad,I worked there for 2 years at first it was ok but it keep getting worse the management would set stuff in place that didnt work and instead of admitting failure the kept pressing it trying to get it to work and if one the rivalry aginst the management was gone work would probably go smoother but that will never happen what needsnto happen is all the supervisors need fired and people that is qualified brought in to do the job right
bad,"For a Security officer it was not to bad, job was steady, sadly the supervisor for security need to be replaced, is childesh and petty, holds grudges for no reason. do your job, dont question, dont volunteer. and you will be fine."
bad,Senior management is focused on short term and personal agendas.  They promised Wall Street numbers without serious input from the business units and now scrambling.
bad,"Poor work conditions, poor pay, poor management, poor training."
bad,"Like most places, when business is good so goes the moods of management. Feeble attempts at team building were short lived. As with any public company it is all about the numbers and liability avoidance. I found resistance to my expression of ideas that were put forth as being in the best interest of all. The culture changed, for the worse I believe, when the economy faltered, loyalty was lost and pride went south. The pre MASCO reputation and employees have been key to the branch's survival. True leadership and team spirit are absent."
bad,Management has no clear idea of necessary plant flow. More important for Supervisors and Managers to micromanage employees instead of focusing on real causes for missing key metrics.
bad,"The hours are either feast or famine.  Poor management,  they put people in charge that know nothing about the job. Machines are old and out dated. Way to much favoritism."
bad,I’ve been here for almost 5 years. It’s a decent place to work. I’ve had my good days and bad days. I wouldn’t mind working there for longer but I feel there is just a lack of advancement. I’m 25 and the other class 3 employees who have been there for 30+ years make the same amount per hour as myself.
bad,At Kraftmaid you are a machine not a person. The 4 - 10 hour days are just a dream. I worked at plant 3 for a year and never see a 10 hour day or a 40 hour week (except the week of vacation). 12 hours every day and some Saturdays. They hand out attendance points like candy. If you have young kids you will spend your paycheck for daycare. You will only see them on the weekends if your not working. It will take you 2 years to make top wage.
bad,not a good place to work at all  no one talked to each other but they sure did talk about each other. the wages were terrible and they promised lots of different things but didn't deliver
bad,Management has no communication and very poor effort to train employees. Plenty of layoffs. Very low chances to improve yourself in the company. Work load is not paid appropriately
bad,"You can give your job your all and at the end of the day it's still not enough.  There is no support from management, issues are brought to HR and nothing ever happens. They always say we are looking into it."
bad,Management is the worse I ever worked for. working long hours weekends . super hot and all they care about is numbers don't care if you past out for the heat
bad,"Although this company offers competitive wages, it's not really worth it. The work schedule is supposed to be 4 ten hour days. Most of the time you work longer than that and don't know what time you'll leave. You won't have too much of an outside life working here.  Some of the management is not very knowledgeable. This company has a good benefits package. They don't usually promote within the company. So not much room for advancement. If you like hard work and no life, please apply here."
bad,"It was difficult to meet customers needs as they do not have enough resources to keep up with sales orders. Hard to keep the builders on schedule as they need installations on specific dates."
bad,"I have been bounced around from one position to the next but have learned a great deal about how the company operates. As far as advancement, it does happen but not too often. They seem to hire outside instead of advancing employees."
bad,Management cycles through most employees regularly. Formal training is nearly non-existant.
bad,"A schedule is given , usually more than 8hrs, expected to be completed before the day is over, working most weekends, not knowing the condition of the job or house we are working on, removing insulation from older crawl spaces itch more, co-workers do not always agree on how to complete the task at hand.When the day is over , getting home and cleaned up is the best part of the evening."
bad,"If you're salary, beware. You will have a strong choke hold by management to do their bidding...whenever and wherever."
bad,"Masco has many great benefits.  Unfortunately if you work in sales, you see very few.  Long hours are a normal part of any day.  For me this included 3-6 hours of work at home.(After 5PM)  The management is EXCELLENT on the local level.  I could never say anything bad about the DM's. However the regional (sales) managers are out of touch with the local sales reps and it shows.  Moral needs a serious boost among almost every person in the office.  Other than that, I would love to work there again."
bad,"Lack of training and strong expectations, high speed with low quality.. Running business for numbers.. NOT employee friendly. Understanding with time off for medical. Over all in need of management restructures."
bad,"Not a unified work environment. Management does not operate as a team. Union and Management adversarial."
bad,"I used to love my job until it was ran by our current manager. He verbally abuses people, calling them names and degrading them, and nothing has been done. He has changed our attendance policy, and back tracked it to before he was even working there and handed out write ups. Let me be clear, we had an attendance policy that was being followed. He changed it this month (September), and is now back tracking it to January and writing employees up. We regularly hear (like, every day) do this or you’re fired. Very negative workplace. This manager has said several times to “fix it. I don’t know how, but just fix it”. He will not help us or work beside us to try and figure out the problems, but instead yells every day. Corporate has been called, but to my knowledge it has not gotten addressed."
bad,"Workers were not team players which made it difficult to get tasks done in time and correctly. Managing was horrible and would make mistakes and forget things everyday. It was just not ran correctly. No communication skills, manager and parts manager throw you under the bus and take things personal. They are also very mean( they’ve gotten multiple write ups) I wish they could get it together because it could be saved."
bad,"it is very hot in there. It is not dependable to get 40 hours a week. They send you home all the time mainly in the winter months. You can have mandatory overtime,. and it seems like that is in the summer . They do have drinks on the floor for the employees so i suppose that is the positive side of working there."
bad,"Typical work day is very routine"
bad,"Management has created a sketchy place to work, and the job lacked any formal training."
bad,"New things every day, and always many surprises. I learned to deal with all walks of people. Management was often good.  "
bad,"Management and fellow coworkers are very nice and friendly, everyone was able to laugh and have fun alongside of working. Although if you intend to have a life outside of KraftMaid that's not going to be an option. It will be very hard to see family and friends, especially working night shift on a flipped schedule from everyone, if you even can. Work days can range from 10-12+ hours of monotonous work, which can be very physically and mentally draining, especially when you're doing the same thing over and over with little to no change of pace. Mandatory overtime is scheduled very frequently on Fridays and sometimes Saturdays, even on back to back weeks, leaving you with only 1-2 days to recover from a 55+ hour work week. Work hours per day can also very so you never know when you'll be done and can go home. And when you do have your days off it's very difficult to keep adjusting back to a daytime schedule and actually be able to function properly.  If you're looking for an easy paycheck, don't even bother. This job comes at a greater cost than what it's worth."
bad,"what can you say about a place that you hated going to. I liked my job and most of my coworkers, but it got so bad with the management: from leads to supervisors to the plant manager... that I hated going to work and couldn't wait to leave every day.  I used to go in early and talk to people in the break room and hang out to slowly walk out with friends.  At the end I was getting to work just in to punch in without being late.... and if there was a chance to leave 15 minutes early I was running out the door."
bad,"Management lacks in a lot of areas, mainly due to incompetence and just a general lack of dedication. There seems to be a lot of turn around in employees with no general sense on what's going on to help retain them."
bad,I lost my job due to my daughter dying so if you have family don't expect them to understand what you are going thru. Just take that into consideration before applying for the job
bad,"A typical day at work is Stressful because there are layoffs almost every month, with no new hire the work is given to employees that survive until the next layoffs."
good,They are poorly managed .For example corporate would change size of the panels and not inform the operators then the supervisors would write them up three write ups and your fired. they would change quality specs from day to day .Also i operated a 2 person machine by myself and still was expected to hit hourly goal as when there were 2 people.I also had to operate the giben saw to cut the panels then run them through the celaschi and i also had to operate the forklift as well when the other 2 shifts forklift and machine operators weren't required to.they pay the  machine operators more.
good,"Need more room for advancement."
good,I had a very challenging and enjoyable experience working at Masco Cabinetry. This company had an awesome team that made my work environment easy to manage.
good,"Worked on the axle line promoted to mentor in the shipping receiving never had done it but figured hard work will pay off and it did. Schedualed truck pick ups, loading of trucks unloading of trucks. you name it I done it what ever needed to get the job done."
good,Poor Management that lacks the concept of what it is to be a manager.
good,"You get a lot of time off, if you've been there for a while. Otherwise, they are really strict on your attendance with no flexibility.  It's always hot in there."
good,"You may spend 12 + hours working a day but only get paid minimal at the end of the week. "
good,masco was a very stressful place to work the environment was filled with people who didn't want to do their part of the work load with a lot of petty nonsense. It was like being in high school again
good,"Decent place with good co-workers. Good the only downfall is they would start the week with mandatory twelve hour days then send you home early when there was no work,so you woud do one or two 12 hour days and not break 40 hours for the week. management played favoritism."
good,Typical day started with getting my crews out to the job sites. then maintaining inventory and meeting with potential clients to serve their construction needs
good,"The job is enjoyable but unfortunately there is a lack of job security."
good,"A typical day at work, one receives the schedule and prepares for the day a head. The crew makes sure the necessary equipments is in the truck and heads out. We then would do an initial inspection of the job site for safety precautions.  We would then execute the job. I learned how to effectively manage a crew and execute the job at hand no matter what. I learned that I needed to have clear communication with my co-workers to finish as job effectively. The hardest part of the job was when they laid me off. The most enjoyable part of my job was the world of knowledge. Everything was new to me and I learn a lot from everyone around me."
good,I enjoyed most of my challenges at Masco and the people I worked with in MI.
good,Typical workday in my territory was 12 -16 hour days. I did learn  more specific group of business management skills and market projection from top CFO managers.
good,"Day starts at 6:30 am."
good,keeping my shipping crew busy for the 8 hrs but making it a fun place to work
good,"Company began as an expanding company acquiring smaller construction companies with the focus on supplying products and services at the highest consumer satisfaction. With the economical deterioration, divisions are being forced to close to salvage the remaining stock values."
good,"Very corporate atmosphere. "
good,Everyday with different working in Human Resources.  We had several employees that worked there more than 20 years.  Employees have a change of moving up through Internal promotions
good,"I have spent a lot of years at this place (before it was masco) and I have never seen it in such bad shape. The starting pay has gotten better but the vacation time has gotten not so good. A good supervisor is a very rare find in this place anymore. Most of them don't care about your issues, just do your jobs. I say jobs because "
good,"Masco was high paced and had everything that a big company has to offered for the good and the bad. If you don't perform, you won't be there very long."
good,"They pay well but they don't give you any personal days. They also don't allow any excused absences for any reason whatsoever. "
good,"Employees have lots of projects.  We are all expected to complete the projects with limited time and resources.  I appreciate the "
good,"Masco was a pretty good place to work mainly thanks to your co-workers, long hours and poor management are the main issues at the Mt. Sterling Location"
good,"Masco used to be a family oriented, caring place to work. Now it is a job with not much advancement opportunities. Management doesn't care about the employees unless you are management."
good,masco has such a high hire and fire rate that they don't hire many people on permanently! The management there is awful! the hire up management is not the greatest!
good,non stop fast pace from start of the work day till the end. some of the computer work was hard to get used to for keeping shipping orders in order
good,"Good culture, significant change in management philosophy in 2014, unsure what company's direction is.  History of being a ""great place to work"", now the future is uncertain."
good,"Merchandising/ Route Sales"
good,"masco closed, I left company when they closed down our product line,It was moved to INDIANA"
good,My co-worker are very interesting people I love working with them.
good,Great people to work with developed life long friendships. Leadership instituted a bad Work/Life/Balance culture. Pressure to produce reporting that no one looked at and employees pushed to stay for long hours.
good,"In my opinion you are fairly compensated for the work you are expected to perform. The major problem is the lack of work/life balance. Working 12hrs a day, 4 sometimes 5 days a week leaves no time for family during the week."
good,"Masco is a typical construction company, not a lot of upward movement but a good steady job that pays the bills. The crews were all pretty cool, you are expected to work hard but don't have to kill yourself doing it."
good,"Culture is fast paced, high stress with high results expectations with little true support from management. Training is minimal at best with the mediocre results that follow. High personnel turn over in most departments including management. There is a nice ERP software system they use to track productivity, but there is no software provided for maintenance and they must rely on paper documentations."
good,its A tough job. I worked during the summer so It was hot and we were working all day. I worked hard and I made a nice amount of money. drink lots of water.
good,"Typical day is moving from client to client achieving certain goals regarding product placement, education, and product launches.  Product knowledge is key in my job for which I give presentations to associates."
good,"Learned how to make espresso drinks but the management and pay was not great for how much you are forced to do on a daily basis, do not recommend working here if you cannot take hard criticism."
good,"Masco was a great place to work, they believed in team-building and had a family feel. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with and the honesty among my co-workers and peers on my performance"
good,Regular work days were productive. More than adequate responsibilities to keep busy. Various projects to be a part of. Great learning experience with the use of excel.
good,"15 Hours a day to make any money, am certified class 1,2, &3 florida rater, no a lot of contact with management, or co-workers, the hours to income ratio, most enjoyable is working in my field,"
good,"It was a pretty decent place to work. Hot in the summer. At times it could be fast paced and physically demanding, but overall tolerable. Usually long hours during the summer months, with less hours during late fall and the winter months."
good,Very physical and fast paced. This company has a high turnover rate and mandatory overtime. I enjoyed my job but i was hurt by a machine and ended up leaving.
good,It would be better if some things changed like perhaps some paid sick days. Other than that its not bad they give you alot of opportunities there to make money
good,"The hired me to sell in the commercial market but were unable to provide the support once the contacts were acquired."
good,Not everyone can handle working at MASCO due to the temperature. It is a work place that is very demanding physically. Over all it is like most other factory type jobs.
good,"Decent pay but a lot of hours and not a lot of organization, they only care about numbers there for production and not about anything else, the supervisors are kid back and coworkers are friendly"
good,This company was changing when I left and seems to have become more stable.  It is unfair to rate due to the long period of time that has passed since I have worked there.
good,i wold still be thear if  the plant wold not have shut down and moved. was not to bad to work at i had 3 weeks vc time and did get a rase every year..
good,I enjoyed the position in the beginning but the other legal assistants were too involved in cliques and gossip.  The head of legal was a great manager at all.  Maybe things are different now.
good,"People were very friendly."
good,"Big corporate company with corporate politics,  the management turnover or changes were up ad down and could see no room for advancement.  My role was territory sales and is different from the other positions,"
good,Thing are a little different in the corporate world. I had to deal with unions and there employees. I had some great workers and I had some bad. With union they are all the same.
good,I did a lot of different things while I worked there. I feel O got a lot out of working there. A lot of different skills that I can use in others jobs that I may have.
good,"Typical day:fun fast paced workplace"
good,Locally this company provides a wide range of gutters and insulation services for retro and new construction.  They provide quality workmanship at a competitive price.
good,Great pay and benefits. But does get very hot in summer and certain departments have lots of drama and two face people. Did love it when I started.  Over the years it's been getting worse  changing policy etc
good,"Teamwork, hard work, diversified."
good,"Hot but manageable and they help with ice ect.. learned how to work in a group here as well as give orders, decent pay and great hrs."
good,"Masco as a company I cannot judge, the vendor company that I had a chance to work with was not a very welcoming environment. "
good,"Average environment but challenging like any other major corporation. Fast paced but manageable. Overall, employees are the most valuable asset and full of fond memories."
good,good place to learn but they expect too much from workers and expect you to do shay things to benefit the company. there is no future at this company but its an easy working environment
good,Associates are nice and easy to get along with. Work is easy to learn. Decent work/life balance. Pay is nice for the work that is given.
good,"The perfect job that offers me the opportunity to apply the skills and knowledge that I learned in school. An ideal flawless job for me is I look forward to coming to, and the people are happy to see me and at the end of the day we have met our objectives and goal. I feel wanted, and needed. Location does not matter when you are happy in your environment."
good,"A typical day included me grabbing end panels, frames and gluing them, and then stapling them, sliding it down the line, then jumping down to the next position and putting the back on the cabinet.  At times I would have to get on the saw and cut the parts I needed for the cabinet.  At other times I would hardware the cabinet, this included drilling the holes for the doors and putting rails in the cabinet for the drawers and adding any instruction booklets or packets the cabinet called for.  Other times I would have to hinge the doors and get them ready to put on the cabinet, and put the heads on the drawers and then also put them in the cabinet.  I was responsible for getting cabinets out of the floor that were missing parts, so that they could be completed and put on the truck. I was in charge of what they call the clean up crew, this was my responsibility to get any cabinet that was ship today out the door."
good,Servicing Lowe's Home Improvement stores offered a direct line of communication for business units at the store level
good,"•	Perform valet duties and park vehicles in open spots."
good,"I managed field crews installing products & also worked in the office part of ea day. I learned through various trainings how to deal with difficult, daily situations. we had a great staff, we all worked hard, but had a lot of fun as well. the hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers, who had different expectations. the people were the most enjoyable part, made great friends & did many things together outside of work."
good,"There are so many truly great people who work here - smart, driven, and fun - that it's easy to forget some of the company's major shortfalls.  Mainly, decisions are made in secret at the very highest level, without involving those who are closer to the process and could provide valuable insight.  There is also a real lack of trust that employees are working hard and doing the right thing by the company.  This is very demotivating and overall engenders a culture of negativity."
good,This company was ok to work for but I am glad they shut the door on it because they gave me the chance to go back to school and get my drgree in Medical Assisting.
good,I knew next to nothing about this industry so it was trial by fire since they offer no form of structured training.
good,Manufacturing Granite Counter Tops . Good place to work but decided to close and sub work out.
good,• Supervised and directed crews for gutter installation projects
good,Its an overall ok job just alot of drama do to the facy its a factory
good,I work security at this building. typical office setting.control access to the building and a lot of clerical work. good co-workers.
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was the flexibility it offered. You could work different hours every day just so you got your work done. You also could control your own schedule weekly and could work around any conflicts you might come across on a weekly basis.
good,fast paced assembly skills. Provides plenty of healthy exercise stock for cabinet door assembly steps counter would at times equal several miles a day.
good,Masco Cabinetry is a leader in the industry.  The company is dedicated to their dealers.  The sales team is focused on gaining share and improving profitability.  The company has many departments supporting this initiative.  Masco is a great place to improve an individuals skillset.  Their are advancement opportunities for those who excel in their positions.  The work load tends to be excessive.
good,I liked the job I did there. I liked the other employees I worked with. It was a place to learn different skills for different jobs. I enjoyed the time I worked there .
good,"I operate multiple machines it all depends on what machines have backlog which determine what I'll be running. The machines I have learned include Heeseman sander, Langzuaner veneer saw,  Guillotine and a Router. Masco is a very fast paced atmosphere and lots of moving around to other parts of the factory to accomplish getting backlog out. Currently management is poor due to their being one supervisor for all three shifts. The hardest part of the job is learning new machines due to poor training you have to learn how to operate machines almost entirely by yourself. The most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to move around and not be in one spot the whole shift."
good,Work Schedule and benefits are the best of the company. Management hard to change all being in company for many years more than 20 plus years. Which it makes it hard to anyone to advance in any direction in the company.
good,I performed daily maintenance and upkeep on all machinery that gave me the opportunity to learn every aspect of how machines operated.  Management was very supportive with any questions I encountered.  There was a diverse range of personnel that provided possibilities to enhance my people skills.  The work was hard and challenging but gave me the chance to modify and fabricate machinery to produce a higher quality of product.
good,i liked working there. if they wouldnt lay people off they would be a good employer.
good,this was a decent job I had for a year and a half. its a lot of work but you do sometimes get free lunch if everyone productivity is excellent. not the worst job.
good,"Customer requirements & traveling to other facilities"
good,"Was hard work, but your felt that you accomplished something at the end of the day. The people you work with you bonded with."
good,"A typical day was a day of constantly doing something. There was plenty of time to learn new things about the building product business, from the contracts to the installation of the products. Managment somewhat fullfilled their positions. Co-workers were a bit difficult because of the consistant need to out-do one another rather then working together. Hardest part of the job was dealing with the people you worked with. Sometimes it was easier to just stay to yourself and achieve goals on your own. The best part of the job was that the pay and benefits were fitting for the work being done, while it lasted. Lay-offs did take place at a period of time."
good,Has many redeeming benefits with great heath care available.   The struggle by many people is with the work/home balance but a top priority is employee safety.
good,Great place to meet new people and learn new operator skills. Great way to move forward in the skills and friend area. Always a possible way to move up
good,Job is by compensation and work is always available if you want to work for it. Set your own schedule and use your personal vehicle in order to go to job sites
good,"Good, hard, fast-paced labor. Supervisors are power hungry and inappropriate at times. A couple people I worked with got fired for really no reason. Supervisors sucks, but pay is decent."
good,"it was a nice place to work, stayed busy, people were very professional, everyone knew there job, team building, management was fair"
good,"I really enjoyed my job and most all of my co workers I feel i was easy to get along with./a 7-3 job sometimes I  volunteered to work over and I volunteered a lot when our hours were way down/i liked my job.I learned that nothing last forever and you have to take the positive with the negative and find a happy medium between the 2 and work with or around if that benefits your life the best. not much to say about management in this work area. I would have loved to be a lead for the company.but they were displaced often so i was also ok being where I was. i loved my co workers, i can have fun no matter where i work or who i work with once i get used to their likes and dislikes so i can have fun but also have respect for the more serious worker that don't like to have fun. The hardest part of the job was not knowing for sure if you were gonna get an 8 hour day or a 4 hour day.or if when you go to work if they were going to displace your line and seperate all the ones whom became your work family. or if they were gonna shut the doors and walk everyone out. the family events that they had like kings island for the family discounted tickets for ball games etc. and that i knew i had medical coverage as long as i had my job,"
good,This was a past position.  Promises made to lure resources were not kept and the job /position changed after entry as well as the accommodations and the promised vacation time.
good,The closed most of the Masco operated shops in town after the recession. While it was open it had a good environment and bosses that listened to issues. But the raises were few and far between.
good,Management makes work confusing with instruction everyday but they try to help the workers with their concerns in their job. Good effort to improve work conditions.
good,This job is good if you need something right away as their always hiring. The pay is okay and can increase over time which is a plus but the hours don't allow you to have much of a life outside of working there.
good,Masco is one of those places that is an acquired taste so-to-speak it is a decent place to work the people and management were good but they often wait until the last minute to notify about overtime
good,job taken over by computer time  not for me  worked min 10 hrs a day  only break was lunch  didnt have time for that most days  no fun anymore just work
good,they are very productive they demand a lot if all their employees but not very good for those that have small children you only get 7 point to use as sick days.
good,"Advancement potential with skillset."
good,"If you can stand the heat, it’s ok. Fast paced, very time consuming work. If you like getting all the overtime hours you can handle. This is your place."
good,"Management from the top down does not understand what the typical employee encounters on a daily basis, and the company tends to be task oriented rather than sales oriented"
good,A day of making sure that all product sent to our customer was both complete and 100 %. I would mange my work flow around where I was needed most in order to complete my scheduled work orders. I learned to adapt quickly with new challenges that were both at times hard or easy. A day would be eight to twelve hours long which was hard but manageable.
good,Wonderful company with great leadership.  Masco is a solid environment with good people and a plan. They have done wonderful work over the past years in moving the company forward.
good,"Stressful but good teams."
good,"- Great place to work, if the employees were able to get along"
good,good culture- financially stable and opportunities for advancement.  Several different departments that are available to work in and close to downtown Ann Arbor.
good,"Masco is a good company, but sometimes some people that are working there is not that nice and approachable.Some of the supervisor are biased when solving some problems between the worker."
good,Masco is a very relaxed environment.  The  management set the tone that everyone's opinions counted & no micromanaging was allowed.  This is a great company to learn & grow.
good,Build quality cabinets. fast paced work environment. safety is always first. management is great. Forty hours a week always a good chance for overtime.
good,"Fired 1,400 people and closed the plant because they wanted ""to take the company in a different direction.""  Refused to consider an employee buyout even with a ""non compete"" clause.  Refused to see the plant to another company.  Just threw all 1,400 people out in a county of just 22,000."
good,"Each day was very busy and went by extremely quick.  Enjoyed the people, some of the middle management were not clear with their communication.  Overall, a good place to work."
good,"Busy from start to finish- not ever the same thing happening as it was the day before- not for the faint of heart"
good," Work Order Support / Administrator"
good,"One of the better jobs I've had. Both the Accounting Manager and the Project Manager who helped in the Inventory Accounting unit were great mentors. The days were long and sometimes hard, but we were at the very least recognized for our work by our managers. Co-workers were a mixed bag, but the branches we dealt with were far and away more challenging. The systems were changed due to SOX auditing and there was a lot of conversations with Branch Managers in order to hammer out understandings as to why things were being done differently and how to best get information we needed."
good,I have been there for 14 years have learned a lot. Lots of great people work there.
good,"My typical day would be someone stress full. The co workers were great we used a lot of team work. team work makes it an easer envirorment. The management were good , they were bad and good times . Anywhere you work you may have difference of opioion. It how you chose to conduct yourself in how it is played out. The hardest part of the job was waiting for bins to be moved. I enjoyed the most with the job cause I gave satisfication  with the orders to my customers."
good,Masco offered me a great opportunity to utilize my problem solving skills and engineering background.  I was able to work at several manufacturing facilities and gain extensive knowledge of several products and industries.
good,The company tends to be go and bad all the time. Shifts vary and the management doesn't give NO support
good,managed shipping/receiving and inventory control for the IT department for the corporation. Worked closely with the IT department on repairs and preparing new equipment. Work extensively with the ERP rollout group.
good,Masco is an American Bath and Shower Incorporation. It's a great starter for an person who is seeking a job to make a career out of or simply to pay your bills. It's a high paced environment with friendly co-workers and management.
good,"very good place to work people were very nice it was a job i enjoyed doing, the work was not real hard but was steady. my co workers were very helpful"
good,loved the job only hours a day 5 days a week piad weekly but lot of safety issues need to be fixed and management would not fix them at the time of my empolyment
good,Incredible career with demanding amount of work with lots of opportunity to develop your own brand.  Relationship driven business including all facets.
good,Good people nice working environment give u opportunity to move up in the company also benifits are real good for the employees i really enjoyed the job
good,"There isn't much room for advancement. Piece work, will get paid based off how much work there is to complete. The good thing about Masco is, that you get to make you own schedule based of how much work there is."
good,"My job consisted of installing mirrors,shelves,bath hardware and shower doors. Work is done on piece rate ,the more you install the more money you make."
good,It's was a decent place of work but being a small town favoritism was a I'm going issue ... they claim to have open door policy and wasn't always the case..
good,"Very fast paced with great people. Management does the best they can. The work can be hard at times but mostly easy days, very long days especially if you work in shipping. I would recommend it. If  didnt have a better job offer i would work for masco."
good,Enjoyed working in this office and with the inside and outside teams. Learned a lot about new-home building and after-care.  Developed great working relationships with all levels of management as well as peers.
good,"Loved the work, always pushed myself. Fast pace work environment, some of the management poor, enjoyed driving my forklift and dropping parts to fill orders"
good,I like working there and it is great company to work. The atmosphere is  family friendly
good,"It is good company i work here 4 year and 10 monthes from 2012 to 2017."
good,Really hot in the factory but hours aren't bad and work isn't that difficult. Just tedious is all. I would recommend this job to someone in the area if they were looking
good,"I really liked working at Masco, the pay was good and they had really good benefits, it was a really hot job but the would cross train you to do different jobs even in the office where it was air conditioned."
good,"The new office building changed the culture for the better.  However, many employees are still afraid of management and continued layoffs.  They do not promote from within and salaries are lower than at comparable companies."
good,MASCO was a great company to work and I thoroughly enjoyed working for the company. There is a great management team in place with lots of opportunity to develop professionally
good,"I enjoyed working with Masco, it was a comfortable working environment.  I was challenged with the work and had great relationships with my managers and coworkers."

good,"Things were set up first thing before the day began"
good,Learned a lot about the industry as a whole. Management was helpful. Little to no raised. Maxed out in pay very early on in my career. Decent benefits. Not too much room for advancement.
good,Set up and maintained stockroom for Maintenance Department.  Managed 3 employees. maintained 98% inventory accuracy.
good,"As a manager within the company, we have implemented many lean principles. 5S, Masco Production System, Problem Solving using PDCA principles have been a staple during my career. We are now venturing into Shop Floor management, which focuses on empowering the shop floor teammates. We are also beginning to use Orange Belt and Green Belt principles to problem solve. Overall, I have enjoyed my time with the company. "
good,Management was good but the machines were very old and needed a lot of updates. They needed better ventilation so that heat reduction on the employees was greatly reduced.
good,outside field rep. Sales management is new. There belief that their unique place in the market excludes them from the common sales practices that every other competitor faces. They are finding their way. Overall people are great.
good,"Fun place to work but they overload employees with work. Clean place, the coworkers care about you but you work with a bunch of woman and it can get to be to much so you need to stay out of the drama. Management does not keep conversation to themselves when you talk with them depending on the manager. "
good,Masco treated their employees very well.  It was an incredibly positive work environment.  Lots of employee perks and they allowed you to work independatly
good,"Lots of work to be done, and, if you're willing, lots of money to be made."
good,Working at Masco Corporation cabinetry division has provided not only a safe work environment but  the training needed to be successful in the maintenance field.
good,I love working at Masco Cabinetry. It was just too far of a drive for me. It had a lot to do with team players. You had to work as a team to get the job done.
good,"I was involved in bidding plan and spec work - estimating off of plans and putting bids together per specs and submitting bids to general contractors bidding the jobs."

good,Able to train and teach others skills that you excel in. Company promoted rotation and an ergo friendly work environment
good,"Good people,good money. Better management and policies wouldn't hurt its production at all. They need to do away with stupid policies,they lose too many good workers, make shifts 8 hours instead of 7.5 hours and more air circulation would be a God sent."
good,"Good co-workers to work with, learn a lot from employees from all walks of life. Good hours and good company, plus having company activities was also fun."
good,I wasn't looking for this job it found me through a customer of mine. I really enjoyed working there the projects where fun and I got to be creative and learn about the home building industry.
good,"I respected the immediate management and held them in high esteem as they always backed me and trusted me on projects that were critical to the functioning of the plant. The mistakes were not highlighted to belittle a person but rather to discuss and make improvements so that they were not repeated. Things were much better before the merger and the financial downturn, but I am sure that the management is beginning to get a handle on the situation. It would have been even better if the management were to able to keep their most loyal and hard working employees from quitting after the merger."
good,"	Administration for Canadian Head Office of Delta Faucet.  Includes preparation and tabulation of accurate and timely sales reports for trade sales, quotations and executive management teams. Prepare and update builder marketing presentations, compile and track expenditure of local and national marketing fund programs, maintain agency contracts, builder and contractor programs, rebate letters and brand status reports."
good,"My typical day at work was alright, I learned a lot about cutting wood, the management was ok, my co-workers were good people and the hardest part of the job was moving the carts which wasn't that hard. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that customers would have a cabinet or door that I cut out myself."
good,"• Conducted daily store calls organizing in-store merchandising and point of purchase material"
good,I had some really nice co worker we all work togther. There was no hard part for working their for me. My typical day at work is getting to know the people who work at the company to the buildings I had to clean and getting everything done on time. Learning people likes and dislike to where as that they don't want you to touch or move any of there things around in there office.
good,"Masco Corporation is an excellent company to work for, though I unfortunately was laid off from there back in September 2007. They offer their employees great benefits and decent pay. If it wasn't for this poor economy, I believe I would still be working there."

good,"was a ok company to work for I was there over 20 something years"
good,If you are looking for a more friendly and looser atmosphere then the Adrian office is for you.  If you are looking for better pay and advancement opportunities then you want the Ann Arbor office.
good,the people are friendly there and everyone knows each other its a family affair....the training is bad and you'll learn everything on your own other than that its not a bad place to work
good,"A typical day was smooth, with multiple incoming calls for customer service. Co-workers were great to work with."

good,Masco provided me an opportunity to grow in directions that suited my skillset.  I worked in several different areas of the company and each presented new challenges
good,Wish I still worked there. Great company and great product. just too much over time and couldn't schedule VA appointments without missing days due to the overtime.
good,I enjoyed working at Masco until they underwent a huge management change and moved a lot of the jobs out of the state.  Hours were cut and job were taken away.
good,"Masco was a great place to work for 18 years, family oriented, understanding of most situations. Bad Economy happens, downsizing happens, if they could have kept everyone, I feel they would have."
good,Other than report Tuesday there is no such thing as a typical day.  Each day is its on adventure in data analysis.  A Sales Analyst must always be seeking to find a way to help the business whether in inventory needs or expansion of successful products.
good,"I only left Masco CS for a better opportunity in Texas. looking back, I should have stayed at Masco. Good people with great benefits and a easy going culture."
good,Before Masco bought out company it was an employee owned company with profit sharing and was a great place to work.  The Masco came in and changed the work environment to a what have you done for me lately attitude
good,The company is an excellent company to work for but the Manager who runs the Compliance Department is horrible. Very immature and had no experience managing adults.

good,"Masco Contractor Services- Dallas, Texas (02/13-Present) - Sales Representative"
good,I learned so much from my boss about health & safety.  I enjoyed traveling all over the US teaching others the company's health & safety programs.  Even though we were a huge company the co workers were like family.  Lots of traveling was the hardest part of the job.
good,I think Masco was a good place to work and I would recommend anyone that can work a good pace job to work there management was good to you and it was a fare pay for me
good,"Very fast paced, very long hours and a lot of overtime. I worked with kraftmaid cabinetry owned by masco and its a very rewarding place to work but exhausting. very hot and dirty environment."
good,"On a typical day I am seen overseeing and leading a team in various aspects of production and delivery of material to my customer. During my time at Masco I have learned leadership, commutative, and certification type skills. As a team leader I like to think my team enjoys the type of atmosphere I represent which is a safe, competitive, and goal setting and exceeding style. The hardest part of the job is when there are issues that sometimes I can’t seem to wrap my hands around due to lack of knowledge. I may not be able to put the problem to rest as fast as I would like. The most enjoyable aspect of the job is feeling of accomplishment when my team and I are able to make and sometimes exceed our daily goals."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job are my co-workers.  Now that we are in an open concept environment, we are closer and communicate well together. Since the Treasury Supervisor retired, I’m learning new things every day.  I am even branching out to assist with Masco's Global Supply Chain  Financing Department."
good,"There was no typical day at Masco .  There was always something new and lots of thinking to keep one occupied in an 8 hour shift.  I learned a lot about the way production machinery works and how to keep them running. Management was great, would not only work with you on certain projects but also listen when you had a good idea. Co-workers were great,had no problem helping you out if you weren't quite sure how to fix something. Hardest part about the job was trouble shooting, but that was also the most enjoyable part of the job, finding the problem and fixing it."
good,"On the go getting jobs done. "
good,"-Gained knowledge and experience in the credit & collections, CSR, office administraion, and Safety departments."
good,"Its been great place to work with wonderful people."

good,"Every day was a neat learning experience. Management was able to coordinate everybodys schedule perfectly. I really enjoyed meeting new Home Owners, warranty people, and superintendents. The greatest joy was finalizing all work, and putting smiles on customers faces."
good,"If anyone has a chance to work at Masco Canada, take the opportunity. Masco offers a multitude of jobs and has a fantastic work environment. Management is understanding and flexible yet extremely professional."
good,"Was a great experience because there was always opportunity for growth, relaxed environment, and great benefits. Coworkers were very helpful and friendly."
good,I really enjoyed my job as a Customer Service Rep. I stayed busy the entire day. I enjoyed interaction with my customers as well as my coworkers. I enjoyed my hours as well as my cubical set up.
good,"Day to day office duties "
good,"A typical day of work included me scanning papers, entering in data on Microsoft Excel, working on spreadsheets, cleaning out supply rooms, etc..I learned a lot while working at Masco, most having to do with Microsoft Excel and working on a computer. Management is great, my supervisors always seemed to care and would offer assistance if i needed it. The hardest part of the job was probably having to work on long assignments that would span say upon days to finish. The most enjoyable part was simply me leaning something new or getting feedback. although assignments were often repetitive, I enjoyed when I got to work on something I've never seen before."
good,"I enjoyed working at Masco for the challenge and experience that i had while working this position.I have resolved few issues that were for the benefit for the company.I am a people person, got along with all personal and co-workers alike.My typical day at work was general cleaning duties, to include and maintain the place i felt so passionate about."
good,This place had it's usual problems but as far as good place to work it was excellent. The company took care of the employees and helped them to excel.
good,"Great opportunity for learning different jobs and roles within your paygrade. "
good,"fun environment and fast paced ,they try to do the jobs safe."
good,"I love my job as an order picker, could there be improvements of course,  anywhere has room to grow and improve. The co workers are great and the hours are perfect."
good,This is a very diverse company and they handle it all with ease.  They are fair in their pay and staffing with little of the office politics.  I found my time there to be quite educational and a great experience.
good,"Typical day was 8:30 am to 5:30 pm"
good,"I was considered a Floater at Kraft Maid so I had to learn more then one area. I worked in 3 different areas, each of them being very different from the last. I had to learn multiple door styles and colors, Therefore i have pretty good memory. My supervisors were amazing because they worked along side with the rest of my co workers. The most difficult part of my job wasn't even at work, it was trying to make time for my daughter."
good,I truly loved this job. I learned so much including driving fork truck. Everyday is a huge team effort. The hardest part of the job is the long hours you sometimes had to work.
good,lots of fun easy to do kind poeple good place I like to work with wood
good,"Excellent working environment with employee benifits."
good,"Even though a whole department has made comments about management, nothing changes.  Was told to make it work, they are your boss.  How do you expect an employee to be happy working there when you voice a complaint and nothing happens.  Yet, the whole department has voiced the same complaint.  Does not make for a happy work enviroment.  "
good,I loved working here. I loved working for the coperation. It's tuff and danagerous in the home remolding bissniess.
good,"Día Típico: Presión en la Producción de Eventos. Coordinación y designación de labores. Entregar proyecto terminado a tiempo. Supervisión durante realización del evento. Desmontaje."
good,"there was a good work life balance, but the decentralization of the company as a whole made it appear very disorganized. Also had a bad pto policy, where it was very hard to take vacations..."
good,Masco is a very ethical company to work for.  They pride themselves in being fair.  I have worked for 2 different Masco companies and liked each for different reasons.  The first allowed me to work on a team and the second to work on my own.  I experienced much success in both.
good,"Fast paced, easy to do. Most workers were lazy and wanted you to pick up there slack. Paycheck is why I came back every day there. Management always had great ideal and always blew up in there faces, so bad the plant is shut down now. Easy work just some bad people there, there was a few nice people there like how a diamond is made."
good,I would meet up in the morning at the office and gather all my necessary items that I needed for the day. Helped out customer with various issues regarding their cabinets inside their homes. Most enjoyable part of the job was the constantly learning of the trade itself. The hardest part of the job was the hours when I was installing cabinets. Management was great to work with and always helpful whenever I need assistance.
good,"Human resources was really interested in you and how your work experience is pleasent, are patient."
good,I have been with masco for 6 months and I still enjoy my job. I work split shift and I work from home which allows me to save in daycare and gas expenses. They give good paid training in office before starting and pay decent compared to many other work from home jobs
good,"Seemed like a good company, Secure job, Never really saw higher management to often which is ok... Only reason i left is cause i knew that factory work wasn't for me"

good,"For 17 1/2 years this was a really good place to work. They offered good benefits, fair compensation for the area but as of December 31, 2013 they will no longer be in business."
good,"I loved my job and thought I would retire from Behr Paint - Masco Corporation. It is unfortunate that I allowed a bad manager to run me off and my position has been replaced. I still have a close relationship with my team and mentors and my territory never recovered. Because my replacement was never trained, my territory is struggling and it’s teally by no fault of her own."
good,I like Masco and wish there were an opportunity for me to advance Unfortunately that is not so and i must move on to a company that i can advance and grow with
good,I work on a project base.  Instructions are always detailed and than work independently and work towards deadlines that are laid out.  Management is excellent.  I am always learning and open to new challenges.
good,the typical day at work was clocking in at 630 and starting my machine up and inspecting my line and making sure all my people showed up and then start running doors and i learned a lot from the guy that trained me and me and my coworkers had fun and got the work done and did a good job the hardest part of my job was setting the machine up because it had to be within a 1/32 of a inch the most enjoying thing was the people and the work because i enjoyed what i did
good,This was a great concept however not profitable in the warmer climates
good,Great company
good,"Productive workplace, customer driven goals, continuous improvement mindset.  Provided ongoing, nation-wide, cutting edge training for employees as well as for customers.  Provided metrics for 10+ business units falling under the MASCO umbrella, in a timely manner, always forward thinking."
good,"Worked contacts & leasing. Sadly my position was eliminated loved this company. Pay was good, raises good and excellent benefits. No complaints. Management seemed to be good never had any issues. Direct manager was a bit disorganized at times. People were very friendly."
good,"Masco is a very demanding place to work, but it is also very rewarding.  Great advancement opportunities for those who work hard and pay attention to detail.  The company would rather promote from within.  Great place to work!!"
good,"This was a great company to work for, lots of hours, good pay and great benefits. The management could be lacking at times and as with any company there was a certain level of drama, but there were always ways to advance in your career."
good,Great job great people to work with kind of upset that the job laid every one off but things like that happen. good supervisors but they could of been more hands on
good,Good culture with a fair management team.  Good salary and compensation.  Advancement was always a possibility but not openly spoken about the opportunity within.
good,"Solid senior leadership with a stable vision and strategic plan. MCS is on the move in the market with a focus on building a talanted team and they have the resources to achive their goals. The rewards are within anyones grasp in this company if you focus on safely delivering the results expected."

good,"Reading this a person could wonder how I've been working at a fortune 500 company since I was 14. Before I get into that, a typical day of work for me would be arriving at around 8am on a Friday, meeting with my supervisor and finding out what my next assignment is. Usually I would work on editing spreadsheets or scanning certain files into the computer. Management has always been great at Masco and my supervisors always seem to care. The hardest part of my job would be having to sit through some of the repetitive assignments. The most enjoyable would be discovering new things, like new ways to work on spreadsheets or finding easier ways to do things."
good,Overall it was a great company to work for. The training however was not as good as it could have been. I pretty much had to learn everything on my own. Other than that I liked being a employee at Masco.

good,I work on various projects depending on the time of the year.
good,I miss working there. It was truly a employee focused environment. The management was understanding and helpful and so were the co-workers. Felt like family. The hardest part was getting laid off due to the impending economic doom.
good,Outstanding workplace. I love the culture at Masco and the benefits are what you would expect from a fortune 500 company. There was a hiring freeze when I worked here as an intern which made it difficult to become an employee. Otherwise I would love to work for Masco and I would recommend it to anyone.

I have learned so much throughout my years in the workforce.For example:  I didn't have a lot of computer skills but throughout my years of working with different companies they were all willing to teach me and I really appreciated them. I have always gotten along with my managers, supervisor, co-workers and even CEO assistant.  Hardest part of a job is angry client and just maintaining a good attitude. I found if you just briefly talk about something else for a couple of minutes it calms them down."

I really enjoyed everything about this job, the people, the management, the data entry. The culture in the workplace was a wonderful experience. Everyone got along and we all worked well together. The hardest part of the job was leaving to relocate with my family. It would be way too far to travel daily, so it was best for my family to leave Masco. The most enjoyable part of the job was all the work I accomplished on a daily basis and all the friendships that I made and still have from the job. I still talk about this job with my friends and we miss it very much. Masco sadly closed its doors a while back and is no longer in business.  Overall I enjoyed my time within this company, and I stayed very busy every day and I really like staying busy."
good,"everyone is great to work with Scheduling could be flexible so it it easy to have work life balance, Working in teams,  but you work remotely solo most of the time"
good,"I worked for Masco as a MRSS representative.  In the time I have been with Masco, I have enjoyed the work environment and benefits.  For someone who is self-motivated, it is a great job.  You do not get a lot of guidance from Home Office, so you have to figure out projects on your own.  Other representatives are helpful when you reach out to them.  Overall a good experience so far."

My daily routine was to make sure employees were taking these courses and assisting them with logging into the system.

The hardest part of the job was keeping everyone in compliance so upper management would be happy!

I learned a lot during my internship here. Especially how the assessments that we were using can be used at developing employees from within the company to clearly defining where our gaps in talent were so that we know which skills we would like our external candidates to have. The management here was fantastic and you really got a sense that they saw you as a person and not a number."
