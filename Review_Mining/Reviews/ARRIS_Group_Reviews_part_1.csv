rating,review
bad,"A lot of changes weren't well executed, leading to great work stress. Management weren't attentive to the employees, making development in the company seem as low priority."
bad,"Arris acquired a company with a tenth the employees which created superior products."
bad,"They think they are smart , but still a tiny company, They try to do Mergers and Acquisitions to become larger, but deep at heart they are a tiny company, wit not a lot of taalen."
bad,"Facility closed after I left, so, the questions asked about my opinion are irrelevant since they no longer operate that facility.  I am not sure why glassdoor insists I type more when none of it applies."
bad,use to be good place to work for over ten years with entrepreneurial team players  but has turned in more recent years to become a work place of  political players and Machiavellian leaders. If one likes being lied to and kept in the dark this is a great place to work! Training on high tech product is minimal and only for the political select.
bad,"I've learned that hard work only goes so far, you have to work smarter to succeed. I enjoy sharing stories and gaining experience from my co workers."
bad,"Arrive, sit and wait for hours to be instructed/trained on various software. Training mostly consists of idle chit chat, very little hands on training. Manager arrives hours later in tank top non fresh from workout appears to care little."
bad,Company approach was very micromanagement based. Emphasized rigid adherence to arbitrary guidelines. Employees not allowed to perform jobs with any degree of flexibility/individuality.
bad,The company is strong there is much opportunity for growth.. The company just bought out Motorola and has grown substantially.
bad,It wasn't the best company to work for but it paid the bills. I have had a better experience at other companies. With equal opportunity and team work environment.  Management was not very approachable poor communication.
bad,Company doesn't care about the royalty or dedication after all due to the company policy. Company culture seems to be against each other rather than help or cooperate.
bad,"This job is ok to come and get experience but long term wise i dont think so, They are very unorganized, you cannot trust anything the supervisors tell you and are always threatening to terminate you in the weekly meetings. Managers are very irresponsible and lazy, they would rather sit back and watch movie then help."
bad,Worked with outstanding people. Learned a lot. Lacked leadership and management focus. Old product lines. Cheap when it came to pay and getting engineers the tools they needed to get the job done.
bad,"while some of the people there were really nice, the stress of having to meet their ever changing demands, coupled with the often ridiculous customer demands, and a relative lack of job security and advancement opportunity, it was overall a job that i wouldn't have quit unless a better opportunity came along, but that was taken out of my hands when suddenly the branch i worked at was shut down."
bad,Working on the floor was fun . . . at first.  The politics and the environment quickly changes; once you notice the attrition and the reason why people are fired.
bad,"Restricted by Separation Agreement and cannot provide certain details.  "
bad,"Too many layers of management, many of whom have extensive tenure and/or come from large houses (IBM, Tektronix, etc.) Revenue streams are insufficiently broad in some business units. Little chance to work on cutting edge technology. Employee input not valued. Very far removed from a startup environment."
bad,"ARRIS Group, Inc. provides telecommunication products and services. The Company offers video processing, broadband delivery, access networking, and video devices. ARRIS Group serves cable, telecom, satellite, broadcasters, and other industries worldwide."
bad,"The position was going great at first with a great pay, but there was an issue with training for the special program that they had. I understand that there was a manual on the program and all, but when it came to getting hands on training they never took the time to do it. I know now that I never want a contractor job with lack of training."
bad,"Company is growing faster than Management can cope"
bad,"Had meetings everyday when the managers decided to show up, which meant if you started your day at 7 you had to wait for management to come in to get things truly started since they would withhold information until the last minute which always made the jobs harder to do"
bad,"Courted me to join their team. When I got there, I was placed in a corner and under-utilized. Management of the team under which I worked had little knowledge of the industry and seemed to rely on vodoo to keep the systems that were running up."
bad,typically you have to wait for management to arrive to get jobs approved which can waste half your morning so I usually try to push through and start other jobs but if questions arise with that job then again have to wait for management otherwise the environment is good and steady work
bad,A place to work and no more.  Management does not communicate and lacks strategic thinking.  Plans change with little or no notice.  Layoffs and re-organizations are frequent and seemingly without thought or plan.
bad,I worked there for about about 9 years. The benefits were reasonable and pay was ok. i did not however feel that my job was ever really secure even after moving up in the company.
good,Got hire with the intention of moving up in the company only to find that the job was closing but they were still hiring people and conducting training. I just feel bad for the people who had been there for years
good,"The company is filled with great people that make the day more enjoyable. There are many helpful people from agents, performance coaches and supervisors. I was able to learn how to complete many tasks while being understaffed and unsupported  by upper management. Luckily, my peers were supportive and as a team, we were able to complete many tasks."
good,Great people that work hard to do the right thing despite poor and misdirected management. We have had several RIF's recently and most work handled locally is handled by contractors
good,"Throwing money at NBN people issues, instead of helping the customer, they enabled the NBN to get worse by letting incompetent managers at multiple levels cover for each other during high level avoidable outages."
good,Prefer not to as I was just laid off. it was a great place to work until bought out by Commscope new management had no clue what was going on within the company.
good,Management appears to be continually shuffling. Old boy network in full swing. Non-managers have very small cubicles with managers in glass-walled office overlooking the “flock”.
good,Call center helping with tech support and customer service for AT&T u-verse. In-bound phone calls. Was a decent place for work and fast paced. The contract was lost no longer able to work here.
good,Felt over micro managed. Much of that came from the contractor. Supervisors were good. was not a fan of the shift scheduling. Had to shift bid so you could end up with bad hours.
good,"You have to prove your self for 6 months before your promoted.  You don't know how much you will be promoted to.  When six months are done, you have to approach management about your raise."
good,Very laid back place. Management does not micro manage as long as work is being completed in a timely manner. Hardest part of the job is the training when you first start. There is no set training for the job. You rely on shadowing others and everyone does the job differently. The culture is very mellow with everyone getting along and bonding at times with different events.
good,"Good place to work at right out of school. There are a lot of older, solid engineers from Nortel to learn from. There is also a lot of opportunities to move ""sideways"" at Arris if you want to work in a different project."
good,"was downsized from the ARRIS acquisition. did not have the opportunity to be @ ARRIS to evaluate. However, PACE was a great place to work !"
good,"work life balance exist"
good,Everything is overdue and no resources allocated in order to be able to foresee what's coming next. Management just shout orders from office with very little interest in walk through shop floor.
good,"Job work/life balance poor"
good,"Senior management does not care about employee growth. No opportunity to move into new roles. No proper communication from the management team, keeps employees guessing."
good,"Not much company culture, my department seemed like nobody really cared for each other.  People were helpful at times, but conversations were mostly kept at a professional level."
good,buena empresa para aprender y ubicarte de forma definitiva dependiendo el área y el jefe.
good,"Typical day at work would consist of taking in-bound calls. Helping customers with billing, technical support, and questions regarding there at&t accounts. I learned how to address people with billing issues and more help with technical issues concerning u-verse. The management was generally very polite and helpful. Co-workers were amazing. Most enjoyable part of the job was the hours and unlimited overtime available. Hardest part of the day was when there would be a network down or an area that was being services which would spike the call volume."
good,Arris is a company in the midst of streamlining and going lean.  Not many opportunities available currently to join them.
good,"Good place to work, with good benefits and good compensation, however, it's not easy to get promoted. Managers in certain departments are too worried about making themselves look good and don't care enough about their employees. Now that they have bought Motorola they are too big and have had to cut well over 1000 jobs."
good,Answering calls all day dealing with customers and accounts.  I learned how to deal with different personalities.  Hardest part of the job is getting a good schedule.  Workplace is helpful SME are there to help assist when needed.
good,"Recently became commscope but culture is same."
good,"Flexible hrs"
good,"It was an awkward pace to the work."
good,"I have spent 6 months at Arris completing a coop. I believe that the work environment was nice, and the employees were pretty also nice. The managers were pretty receptive to input from there subordinates. My co workers were also very patient and helpful."
good,"Fast paced environment with lack or poor management, often had to wait for materials and equipment to arrive on site, Leadership out of touch with employees and their daily job functions"
good,"Had a great product."
good,A typical day would include logging in to work and for the most part either receiving a call or grabbing work from their people soft crm. On average each representative would take about 10-15 calls and each representative between about 5-8 of us depending on schedules would take turns answering calls. I had a calm but assertive supervisor who we would communicate when any new relative information  was released. The hardest part of the job which I wouldnt say was that difficult was just making sure you were aware of any new procedures just in case you received a call with that particular case. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we would be surprised with lunch from time to time and the fact that everyone was easy to get along with.
good,Great atmosphere. Was a great company but now isn't as innovative as it was. This job is where I learned so many great skills such as
good,Ok work environment. Flex hours. Casual dress. Work pace was constantly changing from slow to insane and back to slow. Use to have great medical benefits. Generous vacation days.
good,Easy job considering you're getting paid more than most people in the filed just to answer the phones. If he place was still open I would still be there and not looking for a job.
good,"i really do like working for the Arris company but currently i am a temp through volt inc, but arris is closing down shop and im sad about it cause i wanted to trsf over to arris and work in there sos department"
good,"very interesting work but horrible leadership. nepotism, bullying, no regard for professionalism. Great coworkers"
good,"Arris had more phone meetings that I had been involved with before witha minimum of for phone or web ex meetings Monday through Thursday, as Friday I only had one phone or web ex meeting."
good,Compensation is low and ARRIS doesn't do a good job keeping talent.  The amount of PTO is fantastic and benefits are good.  Management is about average.
good,La empresa es estable aunque es complicado una promocion debido a que son pocas la vacantes las cuales ya estan ocupadas por personal con mayor antiguedad a la mia.
good,Declining market has hurt this company. No longer an innovator and it has not invested into new technologies.Good benefits and work environment.The company has just been purchased by Commscope.
good,"lo que aprendi es sobre como los productos se generan pór medio de olas de soldadura, ciertas partes se hacen a mano, se podria decir que fue mi primer trabajo, no hubo parte dificil de este trabajo, el comedor y comida esta bn."
good,"Testing Engineering and System Builds for QC Validation"
good,Overall a good company to work for that offers competitive salary and descent benefits.  Limited room for growth. I'd like to see more women in senior leadership roles besides in HR department.
good,"Arris located in Horsham is a great company to work for. The culture, and the people are always willing to help and get the job done. Always active and the benefits are great. When the people you spend 8 hours per day everyday and they become your good friends, and you also want to spend more time at the bar with them, you know it is a great place to work at."
good,"Over my 20+ years of working for Arris, I did enjoy my time.  The other employees provided a fun work environment where many tasks were achieved and accomplished. My only regret is that I wish I could have spent more time here."
good,"Set up station and testing product.Learn NPI every time work with engineer .workplace very nice and clean, so much fun to work with every people in compay"
good,"Management needs to have more structure and clarity on overall team success and employee growth."
good,"A typical day at work would be a few computer setups, software installs and interruptions by customer. I have a very good manager who wants me to learn more. He has setup labs for learning. For the most part, I enjoy my co-workers. We get along very well. The hardest part of the job sometimes not being aloud to learn more because others are afraid that their job is in jeopardy. The most enjoyable is that I am aloud freedom to come and go as I please"
good,"My unit was very seasoned and contained many people with over 15 yrs experience in the industry.  Some nearer to 25.  "
good,Great company to work for and access to latest techs regarding dsl and cable. unfortunately the managers are working managers and do way more than manage and local employees might get looked over for advancement opportunities.
good,"Good to work as employee"
good,"I spent 14 years working for ARRIS, formerly Pace, and formerly 2Wire before that. There was opportunity for advancement, wonderful people to work alongside, and a fun & challenging work environment."
good,"Company provides training (hands on classes)."
good,8 supervisors in 2 years. Turn over very high. I did meet some great ppl there . changes were made all the time without us knowing.
good,"Arris is a leader in its industry. Lots of products and customers. Providing world class services."
good,"A typical day would be interfacing with our R & D team to discuss current projects."
good,"May be a great stepping stone job, but no matter how hard you work you will not advance unless you can get in the ""inner-circle"" click.  Otherwise, you are just a work horse and one of the lesser folks."
good,"Very relaxed atmosphere , not much stress unless there is a project to be completed at a certain time. But very nice place to workat. Wish I was not laid off due to reduction in force due to their acquisitions of smaller companies in the same field which led to axing the repetitive work and hiring new college students at a far lower wages and removing workers with much more experience. Also Demand for H/W was plummeting and cost was not keeping up with sales."
good,"Good company to work for. "
good,"ARRIS is a very competitive company which requires all employees to meet aggressive schedules. This include long days, night and weekend work."
good,"I enjoyed my time at ARRIS."
good,"The company is a hardware company, so software development is kind of a secondary concern. However, they provided the teams with enough information and incentive to do their work. The product line management team is a joke, though, and the project had a tough time finding a customer willing to pay."
good,The culture shift after multiple mergers has been a shock to most. Over the last year or so there has been a lot of concern about losing your job and calls into question the stability of the company.
good,A lot of projects and development groups so that provide opportunity to learn different things at work.  Benefit is not bad.
good,"Worked as a member of the Pace team, which was great!  But then Pace was acquired by ARRIS and we (Boca HW Team) were let go almost immediately.  ARRIS decided that it was better to keep their team (despite having almost 5 times as many people and the fact that we beat them at every project we were in competition for) instead of integrating us or removing a few people from their team."
good,"Arris is a good place to work. I really hate writing reviews, I'm not sure how I got stuck doing it, so here is  one hundred fifty minimum characters."
good,ambientes laborales buenos y horarios muy flexibles
good,"Productive and fun, though varies greatly from department to department. This is an opportunity to learn new technologies, in both software and hardware."
good,"Arris es una empresa con buen ambiente para laborar, con muy buenas personas y gente con mucha experiencia"
good,This company seems ok - i haven't been here long but the benefits are good. They DID just get bought out recently by Commscope though - not sure yet how that will impact everything.
good,The most enjoyable was the team i worked with.... Great people
good,It was a pleasure working for Arris Professional Services. They have talented and skilled personnel who operate autonomously and efficiently.  It was a great experience to work for Arris.
good,Co workers are cool and laid back. but when its time to work its time to work.Overall its a great place to work. jobs towards the fourth quarter are hard to come by though.
good,"Timing is quiet flexible and friendly environment."
good,"Solid company with total focus on telco and cable markets.  Great people and great environment in Beaverton, OR."
good,"I worked for Arris Group, Inc. from June 2000 though February 2012 as a Senior Test Engineer in the Manufacturing Operations department."
good,"Management style is hands off and an open door policy is always in affect. Clean, friendly work environment. Arris has merged with CommScope. Procedures will change."
good,Nice company to work for and the office associates were very kind and helpful. On the floor management leaned more toward those they liked for advancement.
good,"Arris is a great place to work. You get to spend time with some awesome technical support specialists and collaborate to solve problems that can be very complicated. Though it does require some patience, working as technical support at Arris can be very rewarding."
good,In my many years at ARRIS I learned that people are one of the most important assets a company can have.     At times I did not feel this was important to the company as resources were considered easily replaceable.
good,"I really enjoyed the people of ARRIS.  Very warm, friendly and helpful when needed.  They will pay for educations training if needed.  The latest technology is used."
good,"Arris is good company, good people, balance work and life. Some technology is unique and not popular. New technology training should be provided. Benefit is good but can be better."
good,"On the job training included leadership training, coaching tactics and change management."
good,"I had a great 24+ years at ARRIS"
good,"I started with Motorola, and was with the company for 10 years in the same role. The work culture was collaborative, which made the job enjoyable even if the work was frustrating or stressful."
good,"Developed a lot of software and delivered a lot of products.  Worked with a great group of people.  Unfortunately, the industry and cable set top products have matured and the products are now a commodity."
good,Nothing but good things to say about ARRIS.  I would prefer to explain this in more detail in person at this time.  Thank you.
good,I like the working environment. Usually we worked on different city maps for the Comcast Services. I learned the Civil Drafting from there. the Hardest part to learn the Fiber Technology.
good,"At ARRIS, we have flexible timing to work. Work culture is very cool. We have a team outing every year to the resorts. Working from home option is available if you unable to get to office."
good,"The business is ever-changing and they expect alot from their people, but management works hard to accommodate and reward the hard workers."
good,"Now a very large company, where day to day activities would vary greatly from site to site.  Quality upper management for the betterment of the overall company."
good,"Allowed  to work from home, relaxed atmosphere when in office. Management was good. Job got boring after being in same position. Not much on the job training."
good,Found this company to be an exciting place to work with many challenges to keep you busy. Everyone from any department was always friendly and willing to help with a problem.
good,"I worked at ARRIS as part of the Pace team that merged in 2016.  Pace and ARRIS had very similar product lines and working cultures, but the business strategy was not followed as the customers were constantly improving their lines and processes.  There was a good relationship between manager-staff and the working environment was very pleasant.  But there was also a lack of vision for new products and innovation that was part of the growth pain of ARRIS.  While ARRIS was acquiring new companies, other internal teams were not having the same assistance as before and the lack of strategy was visible along the years."
good,Had a great experience working for this company. It made me see what kind of professional field I wanted to get into in the future. It was a difficult task but they were there to help me.
good,Hay oleadas donde por meses la carga de trabajo es muy fuerte y oleadas donde no hay nada de trabajo

good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, oportunidad de desarrollo profesional, apoyo estudiantil y se da trabajo a discapacitados y mayores de edad"
good,La mayor parte del personal con el que trabajé era educado y realizaba sus tareas adecuadamente. A mí como practicante se me regalaba una comida al día. Mis colegas de trabajo provocaban que el ambiente de trabajo fuese relajado. Lo más complicado fue adaptarme pues ha sido mi primer trabajo serio. Lo que más me gustó de este trabajo fue que sentí que desarrollé e implementé conocimientos adquiridos en la universidad.
good,1. the company is very profitable overall. 2. The software business utilize cutting edge technology 3. Job work/life balance is very good. 4. CEO has great vision
good,Overall this company has been good to me.  It's always been a place where your own ambition and work ethics are the only thing that can hold you back.
good,The past 10 years I always looked forward to going to work every morning. Everyone in the office was professional and friendly. People were always willing to help each other.
good,"Had worked here on development of FTTP PON Access BPON and GPON Systems based on C, Vx Works. Also involved in different BPON AND GPON ONTS like ONT 1500 , 1000M, ONT14842 and 1000V."

good,"There were no set hours on the firmware team - as long as you completed your work you were good. "

good,"Best place I have ever worked, I which I could stay. Very sad about the move by the company to relocate our group to Georgia. I learned many different aspects of R&D. Management has open door policy can't beat the flextime, 401k, stock purchases at discount. PTO policy awesome."
good,"lo recomiendo sin duda, tiene oportunidades de crecimiento y mejora"

good,I enjoyed working with everybody at Arris. The cable industry is changing so there will be bumps along the way as some product lines end and others begin. It is a different era in the cable TV industry and people need to adjust.

good,"Flexibility"
good,This is the first job/company I have worked for where I actually love what I do and the people I work with and for. They aim to keep employees informed of everything.

good,"In my 8 years with Arris, I have always been accomadated. Throughout the years I have learned new skills and shared my skills with my colleages. The management made sure we had the tools and materials required for  job assignments and arranged hotel and transportation when assigned work to far from home. it has been a great experience working for Arris."
