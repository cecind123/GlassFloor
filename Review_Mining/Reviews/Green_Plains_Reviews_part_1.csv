bad,They discontinue your position and have no openings that last more than a year.  I would not consider this place a business until they replace management.
bad,"They ask that you are bilingual, yet as an employee i could  ot speak any thing other than English.  The office employees are plain rude, mean, and backstabbers! I would never work there again if my life deppended on it!"
bad,"This facility used to be a good place to work. It is no longer a good place to work due to poor upper management. I gave this company 7 years of my life only to be tossed aside, because management couldn't do their job. Their is no loyalty or job security at this facility. I would not recommend working here to anyone."
bad,"Management leads by fear from the top down.  Just walking down the halls, nobody greets anybody and everybody just looks at the floor.  It is very sad how cold the corporate culture is.  Also, there is absolutely no job security (2 waves of layoffs in the last year alone) but yet they are still hiring at the moment.  Crazy."
bad,"If your looking for a career in ethanol, try any of the other companies in the area before you apply here! This company purchased our facility and have made every single employee hate their job. I have never seen so many people quit so fast"
bad,"Company has downsized twice in 2018.  Lack luster communication and leadership.  Raising the company stock price seems to be the only thing important to Green Plains.  Typical work hours are M-F 7:30 am to 5 pm, but employees are encouraged to come in early and stay late.  New building with gym, breakroom and covered parking spots."
bad,"There are many issues with this company. First, they pay well under the industry standard. An operator can go to just about any other ethanol company and make much more per hour. This in an industry where labor costs don't even show up on a cost sheet."
bad,I wouldn’t recommend the green plains mt Vernon Indiana plant to anyone management is absolutely horrible and they treat you like your less than human. Your expected to work your butt off and do loads and loads of work for only 18.50 an hour !
bad,"Management has their head in the sand most of the time. None of them have any idea what actually goes on. And it's always somebody's fault, they don't think machines and motors ever mess up? or honest mistakes happen. Always looking to point the finger and always looking for a reason to fire you. Morale was low and management was the reason."
bad,"Poor management."
bad,It would be ok job if the replace the micro manager.  They have lots of good online training not to much that has to do with the type of work you do.
bad,"It's a small company and you wear a lot of hats. These hats are very specific one off software hats for which there is no training and if you ask for any, you are told ...""We are too busy to document that"". During my short stint there, there was almost no OJT for their systems. There is monitoring but it consists essentially of a big 200+ email data dump every day. There is no documentation of just about anything and you are pretty much on your on. The few techs are very smart but have zero cooth and are very unprofessional and no respect for customers or their needs. I came from a culture of organization, documentation and constant peer to peer training to ensure knowledge transfer. That does not exist here. A few customers had to wait multiple weeks for a request because the only person that knew how to do something was on vacation. The pay is good, the benefits are good and the only thing the Execs seem to be worried about, is covered parking at the new location."
good,"If it says you must work independently, you might, but you will be micromanaged at a high level. Following the chain of command does nothing to get your voice heard. Overall, a really bad experience with a company I thought had better things to offer."
good,Not a bad place to work just the only place around the area that pays decent. 12 hour shifts. Every two months operators alternate from nights to days.
good,Hiring process was longer than expected. Once hired there was lots of onboarding exercises that took Quite a while. Training was minimal and was expected to learn as you go. Minimal support from management.
good,"my day is usually busy with pm's most of our equipment is new , so not a lot of trouble,hardest part of our job is troubleshooting, when things go bad they get really bad . other than that it is very eazy"
good,Growing company that is the 4 largest ethanol producer in the US. Considered as the 8th fastest growing company in the US.
good,This Job takes a lot of patience and a lot of customer service.  The hardest part of the job is it can be a bit stressful at times.  You get to meet a lot of great people.
good,"this is a great company, it just that the management at that time was very bad they didn't know how to treat their employee the manager at that time was very bad."
good,"great company to work for, work is not hard, In Obion you have to be the production manager's buddy to get hired or promoted,"
good,Over all the company is a great place to work. The management needs some work. I worked there for almost 4 years and only received a $1.04 raise over that period of time. The company is more about making money...then taking care of its employees.
good,The employees are the best I've worked with!  Location couldn't be any better in Aksarben Village. Great work life balance. Did I mention the great employees!
good,"This was probably my favorite job I've ever had. The salary and benefits are great and it's a relaxed atmosphere. However, the company has reduced employees by nearly 33% in the past year and I'm guessing there will be further reductions if their market doesn't turn around."
good,it is a good solid steady job with low turnover at the management level. this lends itself to stability of purpose but limits internal advancement opportunities.
good,Green Plains is a 12hr work day in a factory setting. You work in buldings and outside in all weather types. You either run the front end or the dryers.
good,Loved working here but I needed to move closer to my kids. The people are great and they made the work place great. Loved the insurance that they provide there for you!
good,"Very fast paced, but laid back atmosphere.  Some micromanaging goes on at times, but for the most part, you are allowed to become a business partner with other departments and make your own decisions."
good,"I was a temp seasonal and was treated GREAT! "
good,Excellent employer takes good care of employees and takes pride in training and improving skills take time to teach and better employees free lunches regularly
good,"Very good place to work. This company takes care of their employees. Excellent benefits and the pay is average for our area. We work some overtime occasionally, and typically have two shutdowns per year."
good,"Green Plains Inc. offers competitive pay; a generous benefit package; paid holidays, vacation and sick time; a retirement savings plan; flexible spending accounts; a business casual attire work environment"
good,Very good place to work. Very respectful people. Show you appreciation. They are very caring. Kind heartfelt. Very good environment. Good ace to work.
good,Relaxed environment. Work isn’t bad for the pay. Management is great. Very fun place to work and coworkers are always happy. Stellar benefits. Swing shift isn’t the best but the rotation is nice and easy to adjust to. Lots of variety in your Work so you’re not always doing the same thing.
good,it was a great place to work .i would tell a friend . there work life balance is great an pay is good all along with good benefits. Mangers an staff are very helpful
good,Nice people and good job!  This job is not easy and it does take knowledge.  It is 12 hour shifts yet makes the week go by quick.
