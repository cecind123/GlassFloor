bad,"It's nice when you work with talented team members who carry their share of the workload."
bad,"One of the worst companies I've worked for and Quality Assurance is the epitome of a thankless job."
bad,"Overworked, underpaid, temporary contract, zero benefits. "
bad,"None of the perks of working in a real game company office - passive aggressive management - NO job security or room for advancement. Poor treatment. Even as a satellite office it's really poor. The only perk? Decent coffee (when the machine works) If you have any history working in the games industry at all you know that part of the 'payment' for long hours and substandard payrates are the perks (snacks, game nights at the very least) Activision Dublin... nothing - seriously we couldn't even use the canteen after work to play board games once a week..."
bad,"I realy hated this job. The managers don't tell the QA Testers things until after they have spent days trying to test a bug or they expect you to meet a bug quota for every day when you are placed on a team that has to test one bug on a map that has had all the bugs reported for days. They are not very open with employees being themselves at work. They require a more casual formal dress code, so sorry guys no punk rocker looks metal faces or heavy tats, least you be fired for being yourself."
bad,This was a seasonal job during the christmas times and here I would answer phone calls from clients that purchased games from Activition and help them with default products. I leard to just stay calm here and treat people with kindness
bad,"Very poor working conditions, exploitation at its finest. Shame on Activision for running the Localizations office as a sweat shop. People were amazed to hear that such high profile company would treat their employees this way."
bad,"if you like being treated like cattle, work here. you dont even feel like a human worker when employed here. treated like a dime a dozen. seen hard workers there for 10+ years and never got a promotion or raise."
bad,You come in as a contracted employee and stay as one. Very rare chance that you will ever become an Activision employee.
bad,"It's all about personal relationsips in this company. It doesn't matter how talented, skilled and intelligent you are in the specific expertise you are passionate for. There will always be a person who has much less skillset and talent but does his best job on politics and lobbying behind the doors to edge out others."
bad,"You have to sign an NDA (Non-disclosure Agreement) that's so one-sided I'm surprised I didn't have to sign in blood. I'd go into detail but the NDA doesn't allow me to talk about my NDA...no, seriously."
bad,"Being able to play video game from time to time was great. The free snack and drink was okay too."
bad,"Unless you are a gamer or desperate for any work, do not even think about working here! Very high turnover, back-stubbing and on-going threat of layoffs create a very toxic work environment."
bad,"The work environment at Activision is extremely toxic. The entire rewards and recognition system is based on favoritism. Teamwork is almost non-existent and employees are enticed to compete against each other ""The battle for the best idea"". "
bad,"I worked in Distribution, which is literally the hardest work you could do at the company. Unloading trucks in 100+ degree weather, with someone higher up than you, watching you, always telling you to work harder and faster. Extremely disrespectful.  Got almost no representation with my complaints, and I don't even think my complaints were reviewed.  I will never come back to this place ever. Just not worth killing yourself, working, to make someone else rich.  Management and office people seem to look down upon those who actually do the hard work, and are extremely ungrateful.  "
bad,"I took a job here as a tester to get my foot in the door after moving to California and previously working as an assistant producer at another game studio.  Once hired you are only looked up as your position and previous work experience means nothing. The quality assurance testers are the lowest of the low and were referred to as the monsters in the basement. Overtime would be required without notice and the pay was so poor, nobody minded working the overtime. Moving up or getting hired on full time felt like complete luck and the vast majority of quality assurance testers were kept as temp employees for years non stop. My goal after working here was to move up in the industry till I was an executive, because I wanted to change the industry for the better and treat all my employees fairly and with respect. I would still approve of the CEO because he does make smart business decisions, I just think he doesn't know or care about how his lower employees are treated."
bad,"If you're expecting your hard work to ever be rewarded stay far away. QA positions are still treated like an outsourced job, and management is too chicken to stand up to corporate to fix things."
bad,"To put it simply, Activision's QA office is simply nothing more then a grinder. They bring in testers for their seasonal launch windows and then send them on their way. They require degree's for their minimal QA role and then pay on a scale of someone with no educational experience. You can expect extremely limited job advancement as there are only a handful of full time jobs available and they typically only go to those who have developed an 'in' with the management team. This is a job for those in a transitional period of employment."
bad,"It’s great at first and then you truly get to see who has your back and who doesn’t. There’s a clique in management like in High School. If you don’t agree with them or god forbid form your own opinio, you’re out of a job real soon."
bad,Very fast paced environment for work. very strict management and all about numbers. mostly hire temp staff and no benefits and work -life balance
bad,"QA testing at Activision involves some video game playing but mostly involves searching and writing bugs as well as marking off testing in lists and verifying bug fixes. It's an office job involving video games more than a job about playing video games. This job requires a lot of flexibility as communication from other offices can be sparse and unclear which can lead to a lot of waiting to be able to do things. What we are doing can be changed at a moment's notice. The overall organization can feel scattered and all over the place. "
bad,"Activision aspires to be an innovative, leading company and while many people there are working extremely hard to make that happen, leadership isn't fully aligned and the day-to-day is taxing. The meeting-overloaded culture means little time to do work, so you are expected to be always-on. Most people are given the freedom to work remotely as needed, and be off-site to look-after kids, but it's really case-to-case and overall the culture doesn't seem to have kept up with the fact that the longer-tenured employees are now married with kids and need a more realistic balance. Career pathing is non-existent and when organization shifts occur there is little to no thought put into rolling them out to employees. Many people work hard after the fact to manage through those organization changes, but the transitions in recent months/years have been very bumpy."
bad,"Being there for just a short amount of time, I already sensed that being a game tester amongst other testers in a basement-lke atmosphere, that halfway into my time there was a prison setting. There were tens of games being tested at the same time. Which seems normal for a big company like Activision. But with schedules as the same was just horrifying. We all had the same 10-minute breaks twice a day at the same time. And lunch hours all at the same time. We were trated as if we were robots programmed to take breaks all at once."
bad,"As soon as I started, no one talks to you, everyone there is soo busy and focused there is no time for laughs or play. work work work!"
bad,"Depending on your project, you will find yourself working 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, for weeks or month prior to launch. The Leads are rather hands off, leaving things in the hands of senior testers. These senior testers are generally decent at delegation of tasks, but there were multiple instances of normal testers having to waste time due to their inefficiency at getting things done. 12 hour days would not be needed if the people in charge were more on top of getting things done. Overtime pay is nice, but the base pay leaves much to be desired."
bad,Was a good day always went to work and thats what i did got the day started with an energy drink and a bit a tunes and i was ready to go.leaRNED HOW TO DO EVERYTHING I HAD TO DO AS IN THE CLEANING FORKLIFTING STOCKING PACKING IT WAS  simple  management was good had us on top co workers did there part worked hard for what we need and that was money hardest part was leaving work do to so much thrive i had gotten couldnt rerst after being on a roll and the best part was break got to recharge by taking a trip to the store and grab a drink.
bad,we loaded and unloaded video games for shipping to stores and it was a team environment and i like working there it just wasn't stable
good,"This is a contract job and you are not an Activision employee so your chances of building a path that leads to a career with the company is not that high. The player base that you help is very toxic and constantly verbally bash the help you are trying to provide for them. While I love video games and being surrounded by them on a daily basis, this is not the ideal area of the industry I'd like to be in"
good,"not a career to stay in for a long period of time. 40 hours a week with minimum wages. a good place for a summer job, but wont be able to support long terms financial responsibilities. but with the right crew any fun."
good,"Great place to connect with other Video Game lovers. Many friends have been made throughout my 2 years there. However, there is no room for advancement and you will barely see life outside of work."
good,"Activision is a great starting off poing in the field of quality assurance, however it's also where you learn about how tough life can be when you are trying to move up."
good,"The company promote 'ALL in"" and ""The People"" but I find the staff so unfriendly and stick to who they know.  Not a good working environment. "
good,"Activision is a ton of fun to work for. This job is not for people who are late in their careers and looking for a livable wage for a family or household, but more for someone just out of High School or summers in between college courses."
good,Worked on the floor with over 60 different testers to perform quality checks on a game software product. It is a decent place to start for learning video game quality assurance.
good,"If you're on the right side with HR, you'll get ahead.  If not, they may be limiting your growth potential.  They have a lot of power, including with studios.  The culture of each studio varies, so I would look at each studio to see what fits you.  "
good,a typical day consists of fast paced production line work where I learned multiple useful warehouse tips. Although management was a bit weak I enjoyed working for the company
good,Great company to get experience. They need to work on retaining people. Too many egos. I wish they would provide more employee development and expansion opportunities.
good,"Testers are hired through a temp agency, and are put on call every 4-6 weeks."
good,"Overall, some of the smartest people I've ever worked with worked at this organization. If you want to get an MBA-level education without spending the money, working there gives you a ton of cool opportunities to learn."
good,"I found my time at Activision to be a mixed bag.  I look back at my initial time there as some of the most formative, ""Golden Age"" times of my life.  I worked with quality people and I enjoyed coming to work each day. "
good,Access to the latest titles of games and older versions of games.  the ability to visit headquarters is a plus.  Santa Monica headquarters is very nice.
good,"Activision was a really fun place to work at. Felt at home, so to speak. Yet, the compensation isn't worth it, in a monetary sense. Granted there are a bunch of random perks, also there are long 14 hour days."
good,"Working at Activision has to be the focus of your life. Working QA does not give the employee much notice, if any, for if work will be required on weekends. It was frequently required. It is a fun environment with enjoyable company and management. However,  QAMN feels like it is seperated from the main Company of Activision. While the locational management is fantastic, the overall company seems to just have QA under their boot for whatever the whims of the developers are. If you do not have much else to do and would love to work with a fun group of people on fun projects then this is not bad. However if you have other things to do outside of work, it gets in the way of personal development."
good,64 - 69 hours of committed time per week for over month. Zero communication about how long to expect overtime to continue or what general expectations are. Sometimes they only give an hour's notice that the shift is being extended 2 or 3 hours.
good,"From my experience working at the Activision QA MN branch, I have had a lot of fun as well as experienced a lot of adversity. "
good,"Oversee a team of 10-20, depending on the platform being tested. Writing and submitting daily and weekly reports directly to the producer. Delegate test case scenarios to various team members. Making deadlines."
good,"Upper management only cares about the numbers. Only one aspect of the project is noted by upper management, but many parts are required to deliver a finished product. Direct managers are at least competent."
good,"The employees were wonderful to work with, but management would throw a wrench in the works daily. Sometimes impossible to recover from it. It made everyone question their abilities. Folks proffered not to speak to one another in fear of hearing it from someone that was not suppose to repeat it."
good,"As a huge gamer, ironically I've never had such little free time to play games since working at Activision. The operations tempo and overall demand was ridiculous. Commonly, when ATVI would put on ""fun"" things for us, it was only the admin staff that had the time to partake. Us in the trenches had to skip the fun or try to get one of our finance buddies to grab us a free t-shirt or ice cream that was being handed out for no particular reason. Working at the main HQ the studios were treated like precious princesses that needed their every whim attended to. AP took a subservient approach to managing their dev ops. Our leaders never knew how to say no, no matter how crazy the request was from the studios. The studios would fall behind and we at the HQ would pay the price trying to play catch-up while in turn the studios would blame us for the overall delay. Pumping out a lame CoD game every year isn't working. Wake up ATVI."
good,"Satisfaction Dublin is very nice place to work for, with a strong multicultural environment. Here you can meet a lot of people freshly arrived in Dublin and looking for first work experience."
good,Great group of customer support reps. Many excellent lunches for employee recognition.
good,"The Activision work experience is an exercise is cognitive dissonance. At the personal level, you're surrounded by people who are kind, helpful, smart, and talented. However, its corporate infrastructure and mechanisms are beyond bureaucratic and opaque – its culture and ability to adapt to the quickly-changing gaming landscape is nonexistent, and has been reflected in its market performance as of late. It has survived so far because its business instincts are top-notch – if it could marry those to a more agile and flexible development structure, it would be fine."
good,Work is easy but fast paced and competitive. Employees are very social and kind. Days go quick and are not tiring at all. Culture is productive and easy going.
good,"work long hours and for little pay, but the job and the people there were great, i would recomend this job to anyone who has a love for video gaming and would like to know more about the behind the scenes aspects of the video game culture"
good,I liked it cause it was a fast paste environment and it made time go by faster. The pay wasn't so good but the hours were. I liked how we get to communicate with other workers while working in line and I liked how we rotate our positions.
good,Fun work environment with personal benefits. Work hours were long and compensation was undesirable.
good,"Its not bad for a 1st job, it was a good job to grow in but not to move up in. you could but its really hard too."
good,Going to work every day knowing that they were 12 hours days All week and some times on Saturday. Great place to meet new people and unloading trails that come in
good,"Working here was mind dulling and repetitive with what work they give you. If you are a teenager and want to just play games for a living of 11$ an hour. great, you're set. If you want to move up in the community. Not a chance. Look to a different publisher."
good,New experience meet people  I would Iike to go back and work at this environment again it was. Seasonal job to start and no experience needed to start.
good,"Prior to all releases and launches, most employees will end up working 12+ hours per day up to 7 days per week, not allowing much time outside of work. However, that being said, most of the staff is very nice and friendly to be around for these long hours."
good,I cannot really review Activision because it has been so long since I have been there and the company has changed so much over the last 20 years - I really cannot say much at this point
good,"The good things: The people I work with and management are all pretty cool. The job is easy and you're paid to game all day. It's a fun environment."
good,"Activision Asia Pacific is a US based company, supplied games.It is a second biggest games supplier in the world. Small team, good benefit with bonus and company shares."
good,"Most days would be spent answering calls and e-mails sent by customers needing help.  When there were neither calls nor e-mails, we could enjoy a few minutes playing any game the company made."
good,"I worked at a warehouse and as there temporary employee I was assigned to do the following: putting labels on boxes, stacking the boxes on pallets, receiving shipments, organizing the merchandise, put the merchandise back in to a box, and get the boxes ready to ship out."
good,great inviroment freindly people quick pase work.i learned alot about prodution line work there and about the video game industry
good,"I like working at Activision Blizzard. It's a fun and productive work place. This company is through Placement Pro Temporary Agency. I work there not too long and got lay off. If they ever need me to go back work there, i diffidently will go back to work for them."
good,"A typical warehouse job. Wake bright and early in the morning to pack, label and palatalize...."
good,Loved working here the management was horrible to say the least. The best part of the job was eing able to walk a customer though an issue such as why they were banned or hacked off their system.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Activision, but the pay is not really enough, the hours can be extreme during crunch time, and there is little room for advancement. The management and co-workers were great, but almost all of the jobs are temporary."
good,"It was great to work on industry-leading titles such as World of Warcraft and Call of Duty. However, due to the large number of titles released every year and the relatively small number of people, work days were long and frequently worked on the weekends."
good,"Activision Publishing was my foot in the door into the gaming industry. The management and my fellow employees were such a joy to be around and although we had a lot of fun we also got a lot done in terms of testing. A typical day consisted of analyzing games prior to release and ensuring each bug was being tracked in a database for the game developer to review. I learned how to use new software, how to manage small teams during multiplayer testing, and how to identify bugs and database issues based on their severity."
good,"If you want to jump into the trench warfare of developing for such franchises like Call of Duty, this is the place to work. Every project has a large team of dedicated individuals that find any way to get the work done within very tight deadlines. This environment requires multitasking, diplomacy, and crisis management. At Activision, or any subsidiary studio, you make miracles happen on a daily basis."
good,"Activision Blizzard attracts a fast-paced, typically young workforce who is committed to working hard and collaborating on projects."
good,"While working at Activision, I survived several layoffs. Your luck can only last so long. It is a fun environment and you have management who cares."
good,"I enjoy what I do as a QA and CS rep for this company, but I had difficulty feeling like the company actually cared about the work I did for it. Their QA department for Activision was so large that it was as if you were just another drone to churn out bugs no matter how little or uncritical they were. I felt better working for the CS department. Which was a little less crowed and friendly. The pay though was not worth the what it cost to live in California which why I had to quit and move back to Texas."
good,It was fun at times and easy at times was really fast paced under staft management was poor unfair treatment depending on nationality leads did very little to help workers leads were always right according to management supervisors alike
good,"In my specific group, work culture could be better. Need more collaboration between teams. Company, in general, is a fun work environment with like-minded workers."
good,"Blizzard Activision is an amazing place to work, and I will never regret my time there.  "
good,"Typical day at work walking in to work everyone smiling an talking an getting settled in."
good,"I worked at a distribution center, not the head quarters, so it was a dirty dark facility that no longer exists. The facility was closed in February 2018."
good,"Being able to purchase games discounted is a plus"
good,"tested games"
good,"Activision is like business school on steroids. It can be very motivating because the business sets goals, sticks to its mission and wins. You will learn a ton. But internally it is driven heavily by politics, certain teams carry far more sway than others, and decisions definitely are being made in ""the meeting after the meeting."" Culture can be especially hard for women - very few are in leadership roles and the company's values tend to promote combativeness and aggression. The company does attempt to acknowledge successes and offer rewards to lower-level employees who are outperforming expectations but the company could do better. Some of the creature comforts are cool - everyone gets video game consoles and TVs on their desks, there are free snacks, and the company does lots of happy hours and parties."
good,For a studio spun-off from a gaming company its a surprisingly non-gamer community; like most production companies ABS is a small unit on no-nonsense executives and their assistants. Collaboration and interaction is somewhat low and work is a lot slower than a traditional production company as much is being developed in-house.
good,"Mi sono trovata bene, ho imparato un nuovo sistema operativo."
good,"Typical Day at Work:"
good,"Working at Activision has offered numerous opportunities for growth and development, whether that be mental, emotional, internal, or educational. Management has a good balance of strictness and flexibility. The coworkers, as well as the environment, offered a workspace that was energetic, enjoyable, and a very positive work environment."
good,If you like a fast pace and hot working environment then this isn't such a bad place to work at. Management isn't all that great. There is a lot of favoritism there.
good,"* Rewarding"
good,I learned a lot about working under pressure. Being accountable and taking infinitive when needed. Working here has taught me so much about myself and that I am capable of almost anything in a corporate  or warehouse environment.
good,"Test game, write up bugs, submit bugs."
good,"Very nice and good company."
good,"Company could be better by giving more projects to QA Tester's, normally they lay off QA Tester's after one project was finished when I was working there. Friendly people easy to get along with overall OK company."
good,Great job. Testing video games is a lot of fun. Good hours and overtime also.
good,My experience at Activision is really positive.
good,It's a fun job that is definitely a job. Hours are long and tiresome but it's fun being able to work on videogames all day.
good,"It's a challenging position to test video games since it's not really like playing them. There's a lot of technical issues you have to be aware of as well as first party standards. The job itself was compelling enough to keep me interested in what I was testing, but the 80 hours work weeks got old fast."
good,"I package games Wii , Xbox , ps4 , I worked on the converted belt and stacked boxes 6 high and they had you move positions every 2 hours and they had 2 breaks and 1 lunch break"
good,"Passionate people working on great games."
good,"Working in Activision was very fun due to the diversity of its people, countless languages and cultures. The downside of working in Activision is that it is absolutely impossible to advance in this company, as all contracts are temporary only. Regardless of how much work an individual puts in, it all comes down to the bias opinion of the manager whether you are worth keeping around or not."
good,"Work usually runs from 9 AM to 5 AM during winter and early spring. From late spring the hours run anywhere from 7 AM to 12 AM. "
good,"Overall I loved my time with Activision. If you want to work in the big time of gaming and pull off some amazingly cool projects it can be done here if you work for it. Lots of resources all around you to do great work."
good,"A typical work day is 8:30am to 5:30pm or 5:30pm to 2:30am for night shift, Monday to Friday with varying weekend work. During crunch time for games, typically between June and December, the hours can become more prevalent and can increase to 6 days a week regularly."
good,The culture of Activision was awesome and a company where you feel like you belong to something bigger than life.  It was a very enjoyable experience.
good,"*Learnt a lot both in terms of IT Management and Technical"
good,"Les journées sont atypiques. Beaucoup de sollicitations internes/externes. Beaucoup d'idées, de recherche et de créativité. "
good,"Activision is a great company to work, providing opportunities to add value to the business, take full ownership and responsibility for your role, with great scope to develop and improve existing practices, processes and initiatives."
good,"Great job, room to grow if you are willing to put the time in. Testing games making sure they function and they have met all of the first party standards."
good,Recommend for anyone who lives in the immediate area. Great entertainment company with continuous growth opportunity in the gaming and esport industry.
good,"Great place to work, very busy, allowed you to work on your own.  Management was very good with the company providing you with all the goods needed to execute your position."
good,"After working for Activision Blizzard for ten years, I learned that I could work anywhere. The mentality is either sink or swim at the organization. This approach made me learn quicker by being thrown into the fire with minimal support. It helped me to adapt to difficult situations and plan ways to overcome obstacles. I took initiative by stepping up and taking action without being asked. I tried to look for opportunities to make a difference and see where I can help my team. I would think outside the box and go beyond traditional approaches to see results or solve the problem."
good,"Generally a wonderful atmosphere and culture; some room for improvement for advancement and promotion; sense of achievement and recognition can sometimes seem lacking, but can be overcome with clear communication standards."
good,Fun place to work. People thought it was just playing video games all day but there is so much more to it. Typical day was playing a game you were assigned and a certain task was given to you to make sure the game worked properly. If there was something wrong with the game you were to submit a report to a online database.
good,"I always went to work smiling. At first, didn´t like video games but because of the job, I love them. I´m a very passionate girl."
good,Long hours spent staring at screens and sitting in a chair but a overall really positive experience. Working here made you feel integral to the process of developing a game and making something millions of people will enjoy. It made playing games all day feel vastly important. The only downside to this job were the hours that changed a lot based on the need to achieve certain milestones and release a finished product by a set date.
good,An enjoyable workplace with great management. This job is not for everyone as the workweek can exceed 80 hours per week and pay is hourly but if you have a passion for video games this can be a great introduction.
good,"Typical work day would include productivity, meaning not very much time to stand around. I learned patience is a virtue when trying to handle work at a rapid pace, the management at Activision was superb. Our ""line leads"" were helpful when we had a tough time getting our coordination down. The toughest part overall in my opinion, was the speed in which we had to perform our tasks, but as I previously stated the management were always willing to help. The most enjoyable part of my time working at Activision would have to be the people and the environment, everyone was such a pleasure to be around."
good,Activision Blizzard is the most successful and profitable third party video game publisher in the world!  We have the best products and people in the business
good,"I really liked working at Activision for the time that I was there. I made good friends, worked on good games and they didn't demand a lot of overtime due to having a day shift and a night shift. I also felt like I could advance in the company if given the chance."
good,"A typical day would be helping customers to my full potential, to satisfy their needs so they can be a happy customer when they leave. I learned that giving the customers your full attention will help them feel better about coming to the store and would make them come back. Management was always there for support, my co-workers would sometimes ignore their customers but I would step in if they needed help. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with so many customers, the most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the customers very happy and then I would see them back the next day. That's when I know I've done my job right."
good,typical day at work consisted of inspection of final product to assure that the customer is getting product that is of the best of quality. My co-workers and management made working there really enjoyable. the hardest part of the job was the last minute changes in production plans.
good,A fun company to grow with and be a part of. Management that really understands family life and are very personable people who treat you more like a person than a number and also help you with typical questions one may have when new to video game testing. all in all a great company to work for.
good,"Fun place to work,"
good,It is a fun place to work out but also will keep workers occupied. There is plenty of downtimes but also plenty of time where everyone is working constantly.
good,"Overall, a very good place to work but be prepared to crunch when the time comes. Lots of gamers around passionate about what they and gaming in general.  Professional and well qualified colleagues, know what the are doing and trying to excel. Internal politics can get pretty nasty though."
good,"Les services sont répartis en 3 grands pôles; marketing, commercial et finance. La proximité facilite les échanges. Les bureaux sont en open space, ce qui favorise la circulation de l'information et il y a de nombreuses salles de réunion ou d'espaces qui permet l'isolement."
good,"Blizzard is a company I could see myself working for my whole life, but only if I was able to find a better type of job within the company as well as better pay.  This is a video game company and the atmosphere matches what you'd expect.  It's very laid back and people can be themselves. In fact, it's encouraged.  The only two things that drove me away are the pay and the type of work I was doing.  I was a customer service representative.  Most of the time, you only get to talk to customers that are upset about something, so you need to be someone with a very strong willingness to help, but also very thick skin.  The pay was also fairly typical for customer service.  You'd only be able to earn a decent salary if you managed to work your way up the ladder to a senior or management role, but you'd have to compete with a lot of other people to do so. There are other departments available, but many of them require the best of the best.  You can get there, but it'll be a lot of work."
good,This job was awesome because you get to play video games for a job. The only hard part was meeting the daily bug count towards the end of the project because there were not many left. The best part was just being able to play games. and the friendly co-workers.
good,relaxing work environment while QA testing company products. also nice/fun co-workers
good,"A typical day was going in and testing skylanders,which was a video game for xbox,playstation and wii councel.Making sure the correct quanity was received and the items worked properly."
good,"Best Teams, Best People, Best Games/Products, Nothing But Love! :)"
good,"Was a videogame company and our job as videogame tester was to find problems or bugs in our relative language and of curse have fun aswell, really good people workig here."
good,"Job demands a person with a eye for detail"
good,It was a fun experience all really i would do was just go out and test games and see what flaws they had. Give them my best idea of what they might need to do to improve it.
good,"Typical day on the job is high pressure to ""break the game"" Management was more than willing to answer any questions I had. The culture was what you'd expect; full of gamers."
good,This was a very interesting job because I was constantly surrounded by other gamers. Just knowing that everyone around me enjoys the same thing that I do is just amazing. If you are a gamer this would be a very fun volunteer job to do.
good,"ATVI was a fast and dynamic company.  It was full of ""career-minded"" people that were highly inspired and mostly fun to work with."
good,I cannot describe how fun it is to work with the publishers of the game. The company that's perfect for gamers and gaming enthusiast.  Would like to wait for the new games to come out.
good,"Job was contract based for a short term project.  Informal atmosphere for game testers.  Immediately had to start 12 hour shifts, 6 days a week after hiring, overtime pay included."
good,"The time of the day is free, do as you please as long as you finish a reasonable amount of work. The hardest part was getting through the 12 hours a day 7 days a week, but your co-workers are there to push your through the day. Its not as bad when you connect with the people around you. Management is great, the senior testers are on the floor with QA testers to help with any issue, the leads try to help you with as much as they can and give out tasks to do for the day. Head managers also try to keep everyone posted about any events or changes to anything. You go in as co-workers, but leave the project as a family."
good,"It was a fast paced workplace, strict on their rules for obvious reasons. I have learned enough from this company to become a strong warehouse worker that I see myself being. Management does what they have to do to make deadlines, coworkers do what they are told. There is no time for anything but working, walk in expecting to work and work hard."
good,"Testing current, new and old games on multiple platforms for possible bugs. Putting in bugs so that they get fixed by the devs."
good,"Intensive personal interaction with other departments, external vendors and internal management. Very rewarding and positive experience. Pending merger and lack of growth opportunities were the only major uncertainties in an otherwise great company."
good,"very organized company, with a lot of benefits and opportunities to grow in the industry."
good,Culture d'entreprise et partage entre passionnés dz
good,"The culture at Activision is one that I dare say could be rarely rivaled; extremely competent managers who genuinely want the best for each employee. "
good,great place to work. although the labor was under pay for employees to be working at a fast production line. only one shift per day. everyone gets the same break time.
good,"I will always remember my time at Activision fondly. From my very first day there I knew I would fit right in. There is always a great atmosphere in the office and there's a really satisfying team spirit. The work can be challenging at times, and repetitive at others. All in all, a great place to work."
good,"Activision is a pretty amazing place to work. They take great care of their employees and give equal parts responsibility and deference when it comes to handling customer service opportunities. "
good,Only a temporary job but we got a ton of hours! that was a huge plus! if I wasn't getting over 40 hours I probably wouldn't have stayed because there was a lot of different types of people but also gang members with tattoos so there was a lot of words exchanged and dirty looks all day long. very  uncomfortable.
good,"Selling cars was a new experience for me, something I never thought I would see myself doing. I loved the job, and I regret leaving, but at the time I thought I was going to be able to go back to school and finish my degree. This job required a lot of my time and school didn't really work with my schedule, looked for something more part time and ended up leaving."
good,"Sure, we all know there's no job security when you work QA, but looking around the office, I saw maybe 3 people who were in their late 30 and early 40s. The odds of you making in this company is basically nil."
good,"Great workplace environment. Everyone is treated as an operator owner in that as long as you get your work done, no one is there to tell you when to arrive/leave/eat/take a break."
good,"Good company to work for they provide good long hours and theyre makers of video games. I learned how to work on a production line, my line leaders and supervisers were great always helped if something was wrong."
good,"Accomplishing orders, stocking, manufacturing product. Most enjoyable is working as a team and having a set schedule."
good,A great company to work for in an amazing dynamic industry with tremendous potential. Opportunity abounds and it's truly a global organization offering great products.
good,"Building a video game is incredibly hard work. Lots of 100 hour weeks to finish a game, but if you loves the gaming it is worth all of the sacrifices in your personal life."
good,"It is great to see so many co-workers having passion about this company. Though, the hours can be long. The program used for Bonus structure takes too long, and it can be hard to really gauge your success."
good,"Great team, great leadership, fun place to work.  Start up mindset within a big company (Activision).  If you are looking to work someplace that is in the process of growing and building it's a great place to work."
good,Great place to work. Everyone works hard and makes sure that you get the work done and achieve what they ask of you. Great managers who really care about your growth.
good,"I had a really good time working for Activision. It was a really educational environment. Your exposed to what the video game production industry is, and what they do to get each project out. They also take really good care of their employees. Really an enjoyable experience."
good,Great mentors to learn from and develop a career path within the NWA vendor community.
good,Had a good time doing my work with them. The customers of course were the worst part as you usually dealt with someone angry and upset most of the time. The supervisors I worked under were fun and interactive and helped a lot.
good,Great coworkers and it's definitely a place I would stay long term if there was career advancement built into the role. Management changed often which throws everything into discord.
good,Great company but definitely has some holes as expected. My experience is among bad leadership but this encounter is an isolated situation which does not reflect the company as a whole.
good,"Fun company to work for."
good,Working for the game industry gives you a wonderful bit of insight into how it works.  It is also a very 'ebb and flow' business model so job security can be scary.
good,"Not the greatest pay to start but lots of available overtime to make up for it. Not hard work if you have the right mind for it. Management knows how long a tiresome the process can get and do anything they can to boost moral. free food frequently, and lots of promotional products for game as they come out, movie screenings, and plenty of casual hang out time to relax. its a lot of work and very high competition for positions but they make you feel like your part of something and its more like hanging out with friend than dealing with coworkers."
good,"Au delà d'être un emploi dans le domaine ou je désir faire carrière définitivement, Activision QAQ avait tout les critères d'un emploi agréable et stimulant pour lequel il fait bon se lever le matin."
good,Easy and fun. Loved the environment even though you were inside a dark underground most of the time. I would do it again if possible
good,"Arrive to work a little early, the line to clock in was usually pretty long. Get to my work station. Then sign in with the QA Manager and receive a copy of the project we were working on. The management was awesome as well as the co-workers I have made life long friends. The hardest part off the job I would say was the repetitiveness but definitely not a problem. The most enjoyable part was working on a project and being recognized for your work by having your name put on the credits. I love showing my kids."
good,"Get to work 10 minutes before 9am. Check emails and listen to voicemails.Scheduled and coordinated meetings, appointments, and other similar activities for supervisor, which also included travel arrangements."
good,"Sprinting through unreleased titles searching for bugs/glitches."
good,"Nice to have my own company, just not enough money made to live off.   Wish I could have made more doing this.  I enjoyed this work, and I only do about 5 inspections a year now"
good,"Most of my professional experience is based on my 7 months job as a QA tester for Activision Dublin, where i learned and developed good skills in the QA department and where i was able to discover my best attributes in a work environment. As a QA tester i learned everything about the QA process and developed skills in some of the most important softwares in the videogame industry (Jira, for example), i also worked on franchises which are among the top tier in the industry, like Call of Duty (and it's last incarnation: Advanced Warfare) and Skylanders. As for the attributes which make me a good choice as an employee, i would like to focus on three of them: commitment, team work and resiliency. Team work is usually essential, and my experience made me learn what's the best way of doing it; working together for a higher purpose, a perfect service for the final user, i feel like commitment is one of the most important attributes when the job is a service i'm giving, the service has to be the best i can give and i've always been ready to work harder, overtime and under pressure, and that's where resiliency come into play; putting everything i have on a project and be ready to start once again the day after."
good,There were slow days and busy days.  it was great working as a production line.  also working as a sit down forklift driver and working at distribution worker at Blizzard. as a order picker and rf scanner. I also learned how to work together as a group to be number one at all times.
good,In general it’s a pretty good place to work. Most mangers are nice as well as most of the people. Some mangers play favorites for moving people to DLC.
good,"Great job good pay, long hours with alot of breaks, great enviroment, sad that it is only temporary. i would live there if i could"
good,I tested the Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 and Black Ops 2. I was given the game to simply play and see what is wrong with the game if anything. We would also do scenarios where we would act out certain situations for upcoming trailers for the game. I learned how to be observant and enjoy playing first person shooters. I actually became really good at playing the game and they made me lead in scenarios and kill opposing players. Management was fine they were very relaxed and did their best to teach us what to do and answer any questions that we might have. Coworkers were also a blast we would play ping pong on every break and we truly enjoyed playing the game. Hardest part of the job was not able to play more even thought 90% of the time we were playing. Playing the game was fun but being the first to find a bug or defect is the best feeling. Because thats what we are paid to do is trying to catch as many errors as we can.
good,Demonware is a lovely place to work with nice people. Great benefits and bonuses company's culture is key to it's success
good,The culture of place was good. Their wasn't to hard projects to do. The most enjoyed part of the day was specking with my co workers. Has far has management they were extreme fair.
good,its a great place to be at. The work culture is great and there is a decent work/life balance. there are tons of fun opportunities while at work and a party on every game release.
good,"I worked on many exciting project at Treyarch while I was working there. When team was small, people worked together with fun. Later team got bigger and bigger, some communication between team were lost."
good,"I was with Activision as a junior tester for work experience in Transition Year. My job entailed playing through pre-production video games, and noting down any bugs/text mistakes that occurred so they could be rectified"
good,"I had a real blast working at Activision. The culture was inviting and very warm, even in Activision's subsidiaries. I particularly enjoyed the opportunity to visit Blizzard's campus as part of my intern program."
good,"Assisted customers with technical support for a large library of video games.  PC, Xbox, Playstation, Wii.  Filed reports and managed returns on defective or broken equipment and/or discs."
good,"family business "
good,"Using custom tools we we tasked with assisting customers with a variety of technical and product specific related issues and complaints. My co-workers all custom cultivated passionate individuals who made the place a very inviting place to work."
good,"Amibiente stimolante, collaborazione tra i colleghi, spirito di gruppo per il raggiungimento degli obbiettivi"
good,"Great environment to work in. Amazing people. The benefits you get are worth doing your best while working here. "
good,I was a wonderful experience. I would recommend this company to anyone. I learned a great deal during my time at Activision and I hope to work with them again.
good,"a work day consisted of bottling product and packaging it. with only a floor staff of three, it quickly became easy to work together efficiently. throughout the entire time I was employed there I was excited about the work I did."

good,"Dynamic work environment in a fast moving industry.  Activision is an industry leader with tremendous IP, strong leadership, great work-life balance, and a great culture."
good,I loved working for this company the work was consistent never a time when you did not have something to do fast paste is my joy it make the time fly by the only thing I wished for was overtime
good,"Working at Activision Blizzard's Austin campus was a great experience, the atmosphere was like being with a family."
good,"I had a lot of fun working at Activision. I hope to one day work for Blizzard. I worked in the basement with the Graphics Department. I did have some trouble because of the lighting not being enough but the best i could do was a desk lamp. Nonetheless, great job, great coworkers, and great leaders."
good,"My time as a Summer intern at Activision/Blizzard was an incredible experience. I was a customer service representative there, and I learned how to work with a team of like minded individuals to meet our goals. The hardest part of the job was going back home at the end of the summer."
good,"Working at Activision Blizzard was a blast. The hours are long but your surroundings are very accommodating. The company is great to work for, they take care of their employees very well."
good,great place and I am glad to work as a intern at there. Everyone in the office is nice and the environment is also very nice. I learned many useful thing from this intern experience.

good,Activision is a great company to work for. Provides freedom to manage projects etc while supporting a creative work culture.
good,Activision Blizzard was an amazing environment to work in and i got a lot of experience in QA Testing and Bug writing. I was dedicated in working long hours to get the project done and it was well worth it to see the final thing.
good,Very Friendly workspace with Leads who help support the QA testers. Make sure testers are getting quality work done to assure the game exceeds its expectations. Helps workers get a more hands on perspective of how Video Games produced and also teaches you how to be more computer savvy if that isn't your strongpoint.
good,"I came to learn everything I could about how the biggest and baddest gaming development company operates, and achieved my goal.  From production to QA, their operations are smooth, refined, and methodical.  Would have worked for again had I not moved to Oregon."
good,"The place to find people with open attitude and ready to challenge everything! A lab of crazy ideas."
good,It is a fun place to work and express my talents. People there can really help you learn something. It is a typical American style base in Shanghai with casual but effective working environment.
