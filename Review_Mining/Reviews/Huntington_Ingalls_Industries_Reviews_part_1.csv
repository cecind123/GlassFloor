bad,They don’t care about employees just number they want to fire you as soon as you walk through the gate! Your just a body to them and you better not have an opinion
bad,"Don’t come here to work, very bad place to work you gotta know someone here and don’t speak your mind about anyone cause you’ll be hated for it. Management is crooked and employees you cannot trust cause of management. And the pay sucks don’t let them fool you cause the navy is paying your wages and the shipyard only gives you a smidge of it."
bad,"typical day at work is climbing what seems to be a billion stairs about 100 times a day. ive learned alot of the job but cant explain . management is tricky to get along with, everybody works there with no problem , theres alot of stuff thats hard about the job, nothing enjoyable about it."
bad,"Terrible place to work, no time off without getting in a lot of trouble, even for doctor appointments or family emergencies, no career advancement, terrible management and overall terrible place to work"
bad,"Bad upper management, not organized, you get moved around a lot no room for advancement, you have to kiss butt to move up.Show too much favoritisms to lazy people"
bad,Huntington Ingalls does not respect their employees at all. Work/life balance needs major attention. Managers need to learn that they do not know everything. There is no diversity in the LPD Program Office or Intergration Program Office. Mangagers lack the ability to know how to lead. Employees need to learn how to respect other employees
bad,"The most cut-throat place I have ever worked. Unless you are related to someone or your skin color is not white, you have no chance of ever advancing here. It does not matter how educated you are, they promote the most uneducated, inexperienced, no leadership knowledge person they can find. They wave the old ""we love and respect our military veterans"". It is all a smoke screen to give their public image a boost. This place is awful. Save yourself the aggravation and headache and look elsewhere."
bad,"Highly stressful company to work for. You do a great job for them for years & as soon as you get hurt on the job, than your damage goods and no longer useful to them & they find every reason in the world to fire you."
bad,"tended to hire cheap labor who were not qualified for jobs they were hired for, treated contractors like dirt and did the same to foremen as well, only upper management and union members received fair treatment"
bad,Want a synopsis of management? My Basset Hound has a better understanding of management concepts than those mindless morons. Their egos cash checks that their actual intelligence and ability can't cover. Seek employment ANYWHERE but HII.
bad,i will never work there again. because i burnt my thumbs well working  on the line. I will never work at that kind of factory again. its to hard to work at.
bad,"i constantly wonder if today is the day they will pull the rug out from under me. i don't feel safe in the job, the work procedures change sometime daily, i cant learn to do my job well, and when ever i think i get the hang of what i'm doing the procedure changes and all my previously completely work is rejected for rework"
bad,"I will just say this is a place where the supervisors have all the power.  I will recommend this company, but just know that beware of the supervisors.  Whatever they say goes in this company."
bad,"did not like the atmosphere at all. management sucks, racist, low pay. i will not recommend this place to anyone. you can feed your family is the only good part"
bad,I was an apprentice and failed my first class by two points and was let go after 3 years of never failing. I do not recommend anyone to this company if you have a life or family. They are unfair to there employers and very unethical.
bad,Working with Huntington Ingalls was great at first but when the lay off came around and I was laid off without one second of notice. I was devastated.
bad,Huntington Ingalls Industries has old business practices that are keeping this company from maximizing its full potential. Demanding more work for less money is a come practice.
bad,Very unfair place to work. Management is poor and inexperienced. They put unequipped employees in authority positions. Foremans are power hungry and trying to make names for themselves. I've never worked somewhere that wanted to fire there employees so badly.
bad,"Absolutley horrible place to work.  I wouldnt wish this work on my worst enemy.  Filthy, dirty, extremely unsafe.   Plenty of people slacking off due to union job"
bad,"the job was great we worked hard and worked as a team player, and working on ships was a great job as we did what we had to do and working together with people who know we needed to get the job done."
bad,if you are not kind to someone are giving they something your out of luck. they have been in trouble for poor work and miss charging time. the work is like slave labor and you will end up doing 4 other peoples work that are kissing up to the boss.
bad,"company does not care about employees. good pay but horrible work conditions and environment. management sucks and so does the equipment,"
bad,relation management employees is non-existing . abuse and lack of interest in the employees needs. more interesting keeping contracts at all cost even sacrificing safety and employees needs
bad,Worked there for almost 4 years. Never felt as if my supervisors had my back. Never met the higher ups. No job advancement opportunities. This place is a joke.
bad,it was a place to have income i dont the its for the people that cant stand to work in cold and hot enviroments but you can makes lots of money if you can endure
bad,"no room for advancement in many departments.  only ""some"" people have to meet certain requirements in order to advance. Most job postings already have someone to fill the position before it's posted.  Often, making applying a moot point."
bad,"Company has a great variety of jobs and tasks. The problem is the good old boy network. Extreme favoritism.  "
bad,"Worked in various positions over a 30+ year period. In the early part of career, worked with some brilliant people (graduates of MIT, Rensalier,etc.) who understood shipbuilding and people and the results were amazing and very satisfying. Move ahead to the present..just an irrepairable mess. The current philosophy of this company is to hire as many ex-military personnel as possible to lower training expenses. All levels of management suffer from indifference toward workers' concerns, problems and general contentment needed for long-term success. Never have I seen as many minions constantly running into each other with no idea of which path to take next. In summary, LOOK ELSEWHERE!"
bad,"a welfare company, no continuous improvement, no understanding of human factors, and well below nuclear industry benchmark."
bad,"I found the ""Good Ole Boy"" network still inaffect even in 2015.  Company does not try to utilize employees where therre strengths are, just interested infilling a hole identified by Human Resources.  I have seen this inmy own work experience and those around me."
bad,"Stay Hourly unless you know higher up people, otherwise you will get taken advantage of. Hourly sucks in terms of vacation accrual but at least the union and management ""attempts"" to treat you fairly. Salary management seems under qualified and will let you hang yourself before offering any type of assistance. It's ridiculous"
bad,It is sadly great if you are liked. The company is filled with old ideas and processes and little improvements. If you are not liked you will be shunned and won’t get the opportunities your coworkers that are liked will get. There isn’t a lot of growth.
bad,Company has serious issues in promoting employees along with providing competitive salaries. If the company would improve on those factors of its business it would be a better place to work.
bad,"Over my career, I have worked for many organizations across many industries, and can confidently say that HII by far and quantity has the worse managers that I have ever seen and worked under. I truly believe most were promoted to management position not because they were most qualified or competent but due to attrition, time at HII, and cronyism. If you have any advanced skills and extensive experience gained outside of HII you will be a threat to existing long term staff. You will only be valued for taking your knowledge then eventually dumping you to the street. I seen this happen over and over, until I eventually departed."
bad,Work is boring and repetitive.  No advancement or raises after a point.  Culture is for young workers.  Manangement is short sighted and doesn't plan for parking or seating for employees.
bad,Higher up personnel are unwilling to train the new members of the company. Due to lack of training i felt i was unprepared for the tasks i was asked to perform. Management is mostly unwilling to work with you and dismisses problems easily.
bad,I do not recommend that anybody subject themselves to working for any Newport News Shipbuilding organization or any of their subsidiaries or divisions in Southern California.
bad,"All about the company and not the employees."
bad,"welding was joy for me, beside working you got to meet new people. some of these people you become best friends! workplace was work, and your lunch breaks was your fun times. Where you got together and talk about your day and what a time you are having on a weld or fitting a job!"
bad,"welding was a joy for me, when I put my shield down I was at peace with my surrounding. I learned so much there and I put my heart in every weld that I made. the main I wanted to do as a Pipe welder was to learn my job which I did, because if I every need to go anywhere else I could go and be the best Pipe Welder I can."
bad,"Good place to work.  Many experiences where new and challenging.  The job offered an array of job positions that challenged you and where very important, because it involved nuclear security."
bad,"I was a shipfitter helper apprentice. I was to be trained to be a shipfitter. Instead, because of my lack of experience in the field, I was never taught and more of a laborer. One month shy of a year, where I would have received vacation, I was fired for a misunderstanding. I was accused of theft and was told I had the right to fight their decision, which was a LIE. When I contacted my shop steward she stated my claim was denied, but did not sound sincere. Almost as if she was surprised that II called and made up a response. She claimed that she file an appeal. That was over a week ago and I have yet to hear back. For a company that claims to be ETHICAL and HONEST, they have sure proven to me otherwise, and turned my life upside down. I may lose everything. "
bad,Pay is very low. The running joke is you have to find a job at a different company for a raise. There are lots of times where there is little to no work. Employees are encouraged to use Paid Time Off during the slower times. Management is not concerned with growing employees. Constant restructuring
bad,HII is not a good place to work if you care about making the company money.  The manufacturing side has way too much upper management.  The Superintendents block-out any up and comers that dare challenge the status quo.
bad,Just poor management all across the board! You work hard to please your management and work your way up and then they just forget about you and leave you hanging out to dry. You become management and work people and then they pay people with less responsibility more........
bad,"This work environment is very poorly maintained.  Workers are not held at the accountability they should be.  Work ethic is always overlooked.  Instead of focusing on the quality of work, the company focuses on quantity.  This job lacks severely in the area of safety."
bad,The place is so large there is no interest in the individual and no way to get things done because there are so many management representatives in the way
bad,"This is a fantastic place to work, if you are into any sort of communism or like the idea of being an induentred servent. It's also really great if your into being treated like child and given no respect."
bad,"My career here started OK, then the truth began to reveal itself. Management is completely incompetent. Was promised job security for 10 years and was laid off in 9 months. "
bad,"Huntington Ingalls Industry as a company was a good company to work for however the Department I worked with, they are very unethical. They change the rules to suit their needs and have family members working directly for them. They are a very discriminative organization and like to intimidate and discriminate against women.If I were to have to work for this particular Department again, they would have to fire about 3/4 of their management staff and clerks because they were so horrible to work for and with. If you were not in their click, they harassed you. Advancement was unheard of amongst the women even if you could do the job better than the men"
bad,Of course Huntington Ingalls has great pay but from my experience it is not the best work place. The management sucks and they do not work with you.
bad,"if you enjoy being treated like you're 10 years old, dont mind walking miles to work, having to get to work an hour before you go into work just to find parking, then this is the job for you."
bad,White foreman’s will not train black people to advance their careers but will train  a white person to advance their career even if the black person has been there the longest and has shown great performance on their job. It seems that the older generation is use to it but the younger generation is calling it out. Insulator Department
bad,"Female s aren’t treated the same. There are numerous cases of harassment, sexual, verbal, or physical, from females and most of the reporting females end up fired or demoted in some fashion, while the male receives no reprimand for harassment."
bad,I had to get up at three o clock just to get to work at seven o clock. The parking is horrible and the heat on the carrier was terrible. I definitely would never ever go back.
bad,"And instructed how to use the file system. Then put to work modifying drawings, which was my job. But after a couple of months of doing this, and with no prior warning, was fired. Was later informed it was because I was too slow. And also learned I was one of three that had been released."
bad,"Company is terrible to work for, the only good thing about the company is that its somewhat stable with decent compensation."
bad,"After 6 years of dealing with a crazy supervisor who does not know what she is doing. She has started retaliation against me because I did not want to come in on my day off, on my already scheduled vacation or work 2 shifts on Friday for 26.5 hours for a class I had warned her was expiring 2 months in advance. She waits till 27 days prior of it expiring. I do not feel any of this my fault. General foreman is supporting her on her threats, retaliation & hostile environment she is creating towards me. This is the 3rd complaint against her on threatening & causing hostile work environment but they continue to leave her as a supervisor. I don't hear of too many complaints of  other departments just mine. It is just not the people who work under her that dread working with her. Other departments and support cringe when they hear she is coming to job site. She is yard wide known. Pretty sad..."
bad,"I guess I am a bigger noob when it comes to welding than I expected. I was hired by Ingalls right out of welding school (Tulsa) I passed a welding test and was told that I was hired. I moved from Palatka FL. to Gautier MS. I started on the 8th with orientation where I found that I would make my official start the following Monday at their training department. When I asked, all I was told is that I was starting at the training facility. They said nothing about what the training would involve. I was hired as a class 3 welder. When I arrived training facility I was informed that I had 120 hours to certify in one of many welding processes. I found out later that week that I had to pass a class 1 certification in 120 hours. With that said I believed I was on track. I followed my instructors orders to the letter. And believed that at the 80 hour mark I was ready to test. But to my surprise...I was FIRED. I was only told that my welding was not up to par and thats it. I am now stuck in a new town no where near any family or friends and I am unemployed. Ingalls says thats not their problem and they dont care. I have to say the Ingalls have have poor morals and no ethics. I doubt that they do this sort of thing to every employee but to do it to just one is really pathetic. I just wish they told me what I did wrong. I was there on time every day and I gave 100%. I seriously have no idea how I am going to survive now...."
bad,"This place loves to fire people over insignificant things, theyeven tellyou several times during orientation ""there is someone with their name for your job"". No place should be like that, pay is good though. people I worked with were alright. But the management and fire happy personnel is ridiculous."
bad,"The lazy people are protected by the union, the hard working get punished. If you miss time you get penalized, if you show up on time every day but do nothing while you are there you get rewarded. very backward system. Management is a joke. Everything is backwards. Motto is first time quality at a cost at a loss always good ships built right. But their way of doing things is to measure once cut twice. terrible place and am trying to get out as we speak."
bad,"Its like working at a prison that pays you decently well. If you like to work a job you hate and the people around you barely know how to speak, than this is the job for you."
bad,Great pay and benefits. Poor management poor and dangerous work conditions. Unreasonable productivity expectations no matter what you do it will never be enough.
bad,"Management varies, but mine is hands off and really doesn't do anything. Very much a place where people alienate eachother in groups. Nothing gets done all day. The processes and procedures are constantly changing for the worse while pressures from upper management keep increasing. The job description is always changing and tacking on new responsibilities, but the pay is still garbage."
bad,The people do not care about you or your health. The you can do your job right and will still not good enough for management. You can do your job to the best of your abilities and management will try to fire you.
bad,"Favoritism and, indeed, a sense of almost blackmail-like mistreatment if not doing exactly as management expects, which is far above and beyond 40 hours of work and a normal workload. And you will be targeted if you are not in line with these outrageous expectations. Retaliation is also common."
bad,"I have given this company nearly 10 years of my life an been injured twice on the job, now I have permanent work restrictions and they claim they have no work for me but they have signs up on the interstate saying they are hiring."
bad,"You go to work ready to do your job and as soon as your boss shows up they try to do anything to mess with you. They make up rules and tell you if you break them you will get a layoff, then get made at you for not doing somthing against the rules. The only way to get ahead is to have family that is a somebody or suck up all the time. They don't promote the ones that work hard just their friends."
bad,Is a good job but need to be careful. If you get injured they will do anything to get you out of the company. My advise always work safe. If is unsafe just don't do it. If you see anything that is not safe report it. If you manage to not get injured is a a great job with benefits.
bad,A company in which you must be aware of your surroundings and pay close attention to your work and the people around you. Safety is always a number one priority.
bad,I had a horrible time there!! They base everything off of who is already there opinion. If the person training u does not like you than you will be let go. No chance to improve one's skill at this company.
bad,Fast pace work with poor leadership. Upper management is just looking for their next advancement. Few skilled foremen to teach the trades. A foremen's job is the worst job in the shipyard.
bad,"The work is hard & dangerous. If your hurt or injured, from working hard. Not your fault, or even accident. Even if a Veteran. They WILL FIRE YOU!"
bad,"In following Federal laws and guidelines regarding a fair work place devoid of discrimination, this otherwise Fortune 500 Company is not a place for anyone from outside of the 'South' or Gulf States to work hard and expect career advancement. The HII is not a meritocracy. The accent alone not belonging to the immediate region appears to be hinderance to getting ahead."
bad,"Pay is fair considering most employees are in an apprenticeship. You are just a number here, and the employee turnover rate reveals. That being said, if you can make friends with your crew, it isn't a bad place to work."
bad,The working conditions were very dirty as one would expect. After time people feel dehumanized due to the size of the company and the old school nature of that company.
bad,Basically they violated my reemployment rights long enough until I made a mistake and was fired. Essentially they just wanted any excuse to get rid of me after my second deployment.
bad,I would recommend anyone to work here.  I worked as a contractor for a short time and I was treated as a regular employee by the crew I worked with.
bad,this company was ok too work for until they put a foreman over us that clearly had anger issues i had 21 years n got fired cause i was physical tired n needed to sit down so since i did that on occasion i got fired but what about all the sleeping n sitting i witness i mean sleeping out n the open but u want to fire me n i wasn’t sleeping just tired alone with a lot of other people if u was going to punish me what about a lay off r warning. i’m done huntington ingalls need to get better people n management oh n by the way i didn’t have any warning slips n wasn’t missing time n told i can’t ever reapply don’t know what’s that about. It was just wrong
bad,"A typical day at work involves scheduling testing for hourly candidates, responding to email requests from sourcing team and recruiters via Outlook , answering phone, scheduling hourly interviews and assisting with other assignments as needed. What I've learned is how to be a team player working toward one common goal. In addition, working with management in taking on additional assignments when needed to make the higher ups look good when objectives are met! I love my admin team--we work hard and at the same time we find time to laugh. We respect each other (team of seven women) highly. The hardest part of my job is being hard on myself when I make a mistake simply because I've set such high standards for myself. I've come to realize that when a mistake is made, it's fixable and not the end of the world. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with such a great bunch of people!"
bad,"This is by far the worst job I have ever had in a 38-year career.Managers where terrible, no insurance for contractors, no paid holidays, treated contracts like trash"
bad,"It pays the bills. There's no real opportunity for advancement, and the compensation is definitely sub-par. But it's a guaranteed paycheck every 2 weeks."
bad,"""This is the way we've always done it"". No innovation. No understanding of what job would entail. Management does not know how to manage as managers come from the ranks of Engineering."
bad,the company is not well managed and is not at the least fair or ethical to its hourly employees. It is a great place to learn how to weld at the highest level
bad,"Nothing to say here. The management, not at HII but rather the customer, is hideous.  Very untrustworthy.  Pay is below standards. There was some job satisfaction but no job recognition."
bad,Personnel within the company are easy and wonderful to work with.  Created an environment to work issues out when possible.  Not in agreement with most things being conducted but will be part of the team when working issues for the safety of personnel.
bad,Its an okay place to work ... just don't get hurt... Clinic staff is a joke they misdiagnose workers on purpose so they do not have to pay for medical claims.. if you get hurt see an outside Dr. and get a lawyer... protect yourself...
bad,While working we had higher ups try to force their foremen to threaten us with write ups because we weren't showing up for work due to weather conditions. Some people actually got in trouble because they couldn't show up to work due it icy roads and snow pile ups.
bad,"Every day was a challenge. While working with management, I've learned that its many trades working one project at the time. My co-workers are all team players. Every day as we have many challenges, my team always help one another"
bad,"Almost everyone that works here is frustrated and bitter.  A major source of frustration is just getting to/from work.  Everyone complains about the parking and the company never addresses it.  Even official company documents describing guidelines for parking and traffic refer to the parking lots as incomplete, and also states that parking is considered a privilege (whatever that means).  Upper management only cares about the stock price. Period. Last year they delayed our merit increases and took away a paid holiday trying to reach a 9% operating cost.  We get flex time, but its very limited.  We can't work through lunch and leave early on Friday for example.  Speaking of lunch, we only get 30 minutes, and if you aren't in a department with a mule or company vehicle it's practically impossible to make it to the cafeteria, eat, and back to your location in time.  The time is very strict also.  For example, lunch is from 11:00 to 11:30, but if I go through the gate before 11:04, I will get in trouble because it should take me at least 4 minutes to walk to the gate from where I am.  The same applies to start and end of shift.  The shift ends at 2:30, but if you leave before 2:34 you get in trouble.  Everyone ends up standing around in front of the gate until 2:34, or whatever the limit is for their location.  We get PTO, but it doesn't do any good to save it up.  The yard shuts down for two weeks in the winter and we only get paid for one.  The other week has to come out of your PTO if you need the money.  So that pretty much eliminates any possibility of vacation.  The pay is"
bad,"10 years there. Ever changing management expectations, management has no clue. Typical defense contractor, do more with less."
bad,"There doesn't seem to be enough work to go around, most days we sit around pretending to work until a big issue comes about. "
bad,Its like prison. From 6-330 they own you. You constantly fear lay off management doesn't appreciate anything. Its unionized so the lazyiest sorriest people get to keep jobs. The hard working people have to work harder while the dead weight gets heavier. I would recommend never working there if you have the opportunity to avoid it.
bad,If this company wasn't closing down it would be the biggest waste of money I've ever seen.
bad,"Company did not ensure that the Customer identified the positions role and responsibilities prior to vetting for employees.  Unprofessionalism, harassment, and bullying were not only allowed, but encouraged during my year within this position.  Manpower hours did not match up with position requirements."
bad,Job is great and friendly people.  It’s a pity that upper management is only worried bout getting their bonus.  The union is not worth joining as they worry more about keeping their role and staying out of work.  Wish I could have investigated this company before hand.
bad,The upper management in 27 paint department has a lack of experience and unrealistic goals and budgets. Kris Taylor only has a job there because he didn’t pay attention one day. Terry knight has a very unprofessional attitude and loves playing games while putting the workers in stressful situations. Blasting off of ladders in blastha lol an the pits instead of scaffolding is dangerous but they make the rules as they go
bad,"I started working there in one trade, and switched after 4 years in hopes things would get better. They didn't. You are just a number there. They seem to work harder trying to fire you than anything else. They management only cares about themselves."
bad,"Great money for doing little work. Management is terrible and constantly being harassed for minor issues. Job scared constantly, worrying about getting laid off. I believe the union is the biggest problem for a big company like this. They are there to protect the lazy that don't want to work.  Otherwise, pretty much weak and useless. I do believe it could be a great place to work if it was a more positive environment.  Too many people have negative attitudes."
bad,"This company is poorly managed. There are other, better experienced employees that make a difference in this company, but the opportunities are not available. "
bad,"The management and culture was terrible. People were moved and reorganized on a regular basis with no logical reasoning, departments and positions were created just to be scapegoats and deleted later on. There was no system of honest performance evaluation, the union made it impossible to develop a workforce that was competent and efficient because it was impossible for the company to let go of unsatisfactory workers. Therefore no internal promotions were given for competent employees who could not be replaced and outside people with no experience were hired for the hire ranking positions which further deteriorated employee morale."
bad,There is no need to apply for this company if you are not part of the local clique because you will go nowhere. If your father or grandfather didn't work here you will not advance. It is a good ole boy company that is not interested in anything ever changing or improving. Waste and abuse is the actual company motto.
bad,"Poor management , unsafe work environment.  Parking is unbelievable.  Give company at least eleven hours per day and are only paid for eight due to parking situation."
bad,"Overall its an ok place to work . Reall out in the elements, have to be able to adatp. Salary is ok could be a lot better. Management decision makimg is poor."
bad,"Work on emergent problems to support construction schedule. Acquired self-reliance do to work force being too thin in my area.  Management gives ""lip-service"" to employees but conditions do not change.  Upper management more interested in Carrier Program than Submarine Program.  Have seen personnel from different programs transferred into other program groups to ""save them"" when contracts are thin only to see competent personnel that provide significant value to the other project get laid off.  Human Resources has no concept of what is needed in the technical areas, just interested in plugging a body into a slot or reducing numbers in departments with no idea what the individual contributes.  Management solely interested in investment returns for share holders and not as much in the ""average employee"" actually doing the work.  Co-workers are great, everyone feels the same about management but happy to have a job during this time of ""streamlining"" and RIFs.  Hardest part of the job, getting management to listen when you have a real issue that impacts programs.  Most enjoyable part of the job is the people and the paycheck."
bad,"Tenure of service, education, apprentice program, and experience mean nothing during work force reductions. Working environment created is hostile. There is a lack of respect for tenured employees and those close to retirement. There is a desire to get rid of elderly employees displayed by younger management."
bad,"If you have a disability and have FMLA, missing time will result in non-consideration for advancement or lateral moves. Your work environment if you work on the deck results in filthy, unhealthy, conditions. The mentality from management is that it is a privilege for you to work here. Also, overtime is given, but don't bet on it even if there is plenty of work to do, saving money is the objective, so they  make you work harder during the week, and deny overtime. Top heavy, union is a joke-because the reps tend to be friends with the foreman/General foreman, and Foreman/General Foreman really only care about looking good. This is a great place for someone who has limited education to work, if you are thinking that just getting your shoe in will result in promotion think again, they only promote those individuals that are well connected. Also, to get hired consider being deceptive on your demographic, white is not the norm."
bad,"Management believe they are the reason Ingalls have the success due to them . it's a joke . They don't care bout quality , or fair treatment . They only care about you showing up , so they can get paid from the government . All they looking for warm bodies . NOT qualified tradesmen."
bad,"All shipyard employees get paid the same no matter what trade you have. Janitors and laborers get paid as much as welders and machinists. Safety is put in the backseat when it comes to profit. The only people that I would recommend would be welding contractors, get in and get out ASAP."
bad,Did not allow new hires time for appointments or personal life situations. Lack or management concern when dealing with workers wanting to advance and pursue better work conditions.
bad,"Two stars because the schedule is great, otherwise it would be one star.  Hands off management  and zero room for advancement. Me 3 years no raise, some others up to 6 years no raise. No explanations either. Only way to get noticed is to kiss up to government management. "
bad,"Schedules depend heavily upon individual managers with some more strict than others. Benefits are good, but the work environment needs attention.  Management culture is severely behind the times.  If you have less than a four year degree, this will be a difficult work environment to be in.  Tuition assistance is available, make use of this benefit and leave afterward.  As a whole, this company is good for a career starting point, but not a place to consider retiring from."
bad,"I really dont understand why i am having to write a review. It is a very dangerous place to work.Parking is horrible, driving is worse.Management is fantastic and it is a great company to work for."
bad,"This company is the one you go to when nothing else is available. management treats workers like trash, no consideration at all, totally unattainable expectations. nepotism runs rampant."
bad,No future... Takes a special person to stay. I'd say to never start working there to many people settle because they think it's the best money in the world
bad,At first I thought this would be a great chance to try something new and make good money to support myself and my family. The money is great and the benefits are phenominal BUT this place is not a place for a person that has a family depending on them.
bad,You have to brown nose to get ahead. There are people who do the absolute least and still get promoted. The stress level almost gave me a heart attack under the age of 35.
bad,People are not treated well. Uncompensated OT is expected when it's crunch time so management has little incentive to not call people in and just throw bodies at a problem. I've personally seen people stuck on the ship for 16 hours straight with nothing to eat and no one in management gave a second thought to those people. It's too bad because the work itself can be interesting.
bad,"This is a very labor intesive job. The parking is horrible and the managment needs improvement. If you don't mind having the ""ship yard"" walk in some years this is the job for you."
bad,"I past occupation that I had in the last 5 years. The people were great to get along with, however there are challenges in any job."
bad,"This company was a great company to work for in a previous decade.  However, recently the current management is lacking in focus and drive.  This is a management-heavy business with too many managers/vice presidents/directors, and not enough people to actually do the job."
bad,"NNS, as a general rule, is made up of hundreds of departments, most of which do not communicate needed information to each other.  Management tends to be stodgy and either afraid of change or in favor of change for change's sake.  In many cases, the leaders in given departments play favorites when promoting or giving choice assignments.  Also, the department leaders tend not to provide any sort of information that could possibly render them obsolete or replaceable (meaning, all data has to come from them and them alone).  The philosophy at NNS is ""be here and be seen"" if you want to get ahead.  Almost no attention is paid to those who actually perform difficult or important work, but tend to keep their heads down."
bad,"As an employee at Huntington Ingalls, I was able to experience the work environment from the perspective of managerial and craft. Within management, as an employee, the work was not bad, but the stress and the mental and emotional attachment that accompanied the job made it horrible. As an employee in craft, the working conditions are so horrible."
bad,Not friendly to military and in consider to navy reserve.and the place sucks to go work
bad,"Day-to-day work is typically repetitive drudgery. If your job description says you will be designing robots or anything else exciting and cool, don't believe it. Total trickery."
bad,"The best - worst job I've ever had. Management doesnt know what direction up is. But there is almost no deadline and no one harps on you to work faster. Vastly poor communication from management. And working conditions are rather harsh. Equipment is dated.. if it isnt broken down..the 2 unofficial moto's are ""good enough"" and "" let's do it the dumbest way possible because that's easier for me."""
bad,As a whole the company is okay if you want experience you'll get it here. However the management is a huge issues since they do not listen to feedback whatsoever or care to hear a majority of it.  This is also referring to employees doing manual labor not office workers.  Along with that the work environment is extremely unpleasant as a welder and a majority of the labor work.
bad,It was an okay job. There were alot of problems with supervisors and other issues. The company does tend to care more about the work than the employees.
bad,The environment is one in which the goals never seem achievable and there is never enough support to get the job done.  The materials required to produce work are consistently lacking.  This places too much stress on the workers and their immediate leadership to do super-human things to get the job done.  The people are great and can do anything if given a chance.
bad,"This place wouldn't be bad if the management was better. They can turn a good job into something you hate. They micromanage everything. Its almost better to be a bad worker because if your good at your job they will use you. Not much in the form of advancement unless you join the apprenticeship or have degree's. Also parking is a nightmare, be prepared to show up 2 hrs before your shift and sleep in your car just to find a spot. Im not even joking about this."
bad,"A typical day is usually 8 to 12 hours"
bad,In the production environment salary and benefits are the only real positives of the job. Management style is strict and strong arm style with very little empathy for workers their needs or goals.
bad,"Working for Newport News Shipbuilding was extremely stressful, as management would try to work you to death.  Management was also unethical in many ways.  Often, management was shifted around, so if you had a good manager, that could change.  The Director of Supply Chain Management purposely held people back.  Human Resources treated you like a criminal and management made up things so that they could write you up."
bad,"Decent hours, decent coworkers, supervisors given too much leeway, one bad supervisor can ruin your work experience for however long you are under them. Safety-conscious culture that is worker focused."
bad,The job was very physically demanding but the pay was horrible for the kind of work that was asked of employees. Even management had horrible pay where foremen only made 15 an hr.
bad,"It was a good place to work until they writing me up for having pneumonia and having a severe nasal condition i didnt know about. Both of those have doctor note documents. The personel person i talked said if i went to the right type of doctor that i would be fine. What a lie, i ended up getting written up. And then I fill out some FMLA forms and got it approve. Then the next day, I got my pink slip. WTF is that. My advice will be unless you are looking for a building block or a 1 -2 year job take it but if your looking for career just move on from this place. These people will let you down and they dont care if they do!"
bad,"My typical day at work has always been good, however for the most part, schedule has been issue for the company, to where you can end up being frustrated and pressured to get work out without looking over it to back check to see if it's right or not. The most enjoyable part is the people there who provide great friendship and leadership."
bad,"OK place to work.  Poor management with too much ""in-house"" politics.  Most enjoyable part of the job was SOME of my co-workers  and the fact that I had an excellent supervisor.  I enjoyed the responsibility I had while employed by Newport News Shipbuilding."
bad,"No room for growth and hard work does not pay off here. Unless you happened to be hired in to the Apprentice School then you mine as well find a new career, because you will go no where with this company without it."
bad,"They informed employees that they would be given notice 60 days before layoff, but did not.  They had security escort employees out of the building the day they notified them and kept them on payroll for less than 2 weeks."
bad,The monopoly relationship the company has means that it need not innovate and in many respects views engineering as a necessary evil.  Promotions are most often political.  The company reiterates time after time that it does not care about it's people.  While this is not for every aspect of the company this is the general norm.
bad,Sandblasted Painted sheet metal parts on a moving conveyor
bad,this is the same company i have worked for 30 years. i went back to school while working here and was promoted to design engineering
bad,"Newport News Shipbuilding is a good place to start out at straight from college. You will get some good work experience that you may not be able to get at a smaller company. However, there are very few career advancement opportunities. Like many larger companies, promotions are reserved for the well connected. Hard work and dedication does not go very far and is rarely rewarded with any meaningful reward. I work with many smart, hard working and dedicated people at the shipyard who have never received any form of promotion, or recognition. My advice is to work there for two to three years and then start looking for a company where you will have some genuine growth opportunities."
bad,"A typical day at work for me started at 5 a.m. I always worked two extra hours per day (for free) to ensure that I had enough time to complete required tasking. I learned how to design the systems that go on military ships and craft. I also learned how to manage programs and how to calculate engineering design data for ships. The company has an overabundance of poor and disingenuous management. Most managers had no management training or education, and therefore made very poor business decisions. Those decisions resulted in poor quality performance (due to lack of managerial oversight), and resulted in the loss of business opportunities. Some employees' ideas were either ignored or harshly criticized. Managers yelled at employees and severely downgraded performance evaluations in retaliation against assertive employees. There was a culture of preferential treatment toward certain employees, as well as unethical mistreatment of other employees...Not to mention a culture of corporate greed and corruption seemingly unparalleled in the shipbuilding industry. Too, the unions controlled the shipyard, thereby exacerbating the convoluted management protocol. The hardest part of the job was ignoring these things on a daily basis. Lunch (NOT free) was catered by one vendor whose menu was bland and repetitive. The most enjoyable part of the job was doing the work I was assigned (although I knew I wouldn't get credit for it), as well as communicating with a couple of people with whom I befriended. I also couldn't help but notice the racial disparity among the engineering/technical staff,"
bad,Supervisors don't know how to teach new hires and give zero feedback when asked how you can improve on the job. Was put on fire watch most days instead of being trained as sheet metal worker as hired.
bad,"Get an attorney immediately and your own doctor if you ever hurt. Get your own MRI if one is needed.  Ok place to work, decent pay and benefits. The crew member and supervisor that you are teamed with can make your job tolerable or intolerable."
bad,"Worst management I have ever seen any where, and the Army just gives it to anyone so that says a lot. There are tons of what I call pay check collectors out there. The more you do the more is expected of you, the less you do the less they care and the more they leave you alone. The ones with real drive, dedication and desire to learn get used. It is all about who you know, related to and who may like you. If you work real hard and don't take no stuff from management you'll get nothing but a pay check and watchful eye. If you don't do anything and make friends you'll excel."
bad,"If your a female welder beware they are sexist and your not treated fairly. The pay is fair, overtime is never promised and parking is  ridiculous. Your coworkers take/steal from you. Just watch out, stay  vigilant."
bad,"Let’s start with the good stuff as that’s minimal.. health insurance is good, pays 90/10, $15 co pay, $300 deductible and I think $3 prescriptions.. it’s $55 a week for single people and $80 something for family, no extra cost for additional members, the paid time off is like 10 days and the vacation is time is good also, besides that the place is literally a joke, safety is virtually non existent, for you potential welders like me; god help you is all I can say. The majority of machines are raggedy pieces of junk, people lock lines up and claim company property as their own.. yea you can get fired for cutting chains to get company property to do your job, be prepared to pull 100ft of welding line daily also"
bad,I leave for work at 4am and arrive to work at 4:30 and wait until 5:30 to walk up to the gate and forward on to the ship.You start off upset and mean face from the start.The pay is good but the environment is terrible .When you see someone eyes outside the yard. you can tell by how red they are that the person probably work at the ship yard . Management have no professional training.
bad,"You can live your entire life working here. Even if it's an unhappy one. Must attend their apprentice school if you want to advance. Be here for 11 hours on first shift, but only get paid for 8 (do to parking). Surprised they don't have hall passes to use the restroom. More concerned about image than production. I could go on."
bad,Working at Huntington Ingalls Industries started with job assignments and a quick briefing in the morning before heading to the job.  The hardest part of the job is definitely working in the elements.
bad,"I hated working there. The process at which things are done is backwards and unorganized. There are no opportunities to inform management on how you could improve work experience. I didn't learn anything for my craft. It was basic instructions to follow. The management is less than what the title would imply. People are promoted because of favoritism, not because they understand the job or know how to make it more efficient. the workplace itself for my craft is stressful. Having to always squeeze into a small pocket or twist and contort your body puts you in harms way a lot. The hardest part of the job is trying to make ends meet with the limited resources you have. The best part would be the people you meet and the potential relationships you can form."
bad,"The benefits are great, but the management and ""good old boy"" system are very much a detriment to the experience. Leadership was toxic and that toxicity filtered down through the management chain, with managers often contradicting policy or picking favorites. Communication was very one-sided, with the message or policy being passed down changing from day to day."
bad,"Management needs help with the dinosaurs that work there who do not like change. As a woman it was difficult to work even as a team because their mindset is really ""OLD school"" and your were working against the ""Boys Club"". I was hoping Huntington Ingalls would take more action once they acquired CMSD."
bad,"the most satisfying part of working here is seeing the hard work and effort manifested into the completed projects and satisfied clients. However due to nepotism ,and  repeated safety / injury issues that get ignored by management makes it difficult to execute daily task efficiently."
bad,"SMH.. Trust Me.. You can find a better Job.. Management fails here.. And if the head of the snake fails then the body follows.. Unrealistic time frames and schedules made by production planning on jobs that majority of planning have no ""hands on experience"" completing themselves.. Supervision is pressured and or threatened by upper management to use verbal or written disciplinary actions to ""persuade"" hourly wage craft employees to meet unachievable time frames by lack of quality of work produced on work in which you can be terminated for.. Basically a consistent rotation of cut corners that the lowest man on the totem pole is expect to fix and compensate for.. Beware Craft professionals and Hourly wage Employees.."
bad,"Unfortunately, Newport News Shipbuilding does not cultivate a positive work environment; in fact, I'd go as far to say as the environment can be pretty toxic. They do not value their employees. Raises barely cover cost-of-living increases, and with rising medical insurance cost you end up making less than you did the previous year. They will lure new engineers in with lucrative salaries, but that's all it is -- a lure. Once they have you, employees sometimes find themselves with several years of work experience making the same as what a new engineer makes."
bad,"Buddy buddy program, if you are not fishing and hunting with the bosses, along with mowing their grass do not expect fair treatment."
bad,Government?Union run operation. Its basically a welfare program where all they want you to do is show up. Job knowledge and work ethic mean nothing.
bad,"Company has recently changed names to remove some bad press coverage. Nothing other than a name change, still the same old ways of doing things. When you hire in they promise you the moon,in reality you are just another pawn in the game."
bad,I would not recommend working for this company from my experience.  It is a very toxic environment.  Upper management did absolutely nothing to stop the negative work environment.
bad,Foremen are unprofessional and show favoritism ....The work I do in general is no problem I love it but the favoritisms and unfairness is terrible. They treat their employees like their dumb they don’t understand or care about their employees.... They preach safety first but put thier employees in harms way to get the job done.
bad,"The hardest part of the job is the heat coupled with the hypocritical management pushing production over quality and safety. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing I was building ships that were used to defend the freedom of myself and others. The workplace has an awful culture of cronyism, sexual discrimination, harassment and retaliation tactics."
bad,"The work and ingalls isnt bad. What makes it bad is the the terrible management. HR depatment is nice enough, but every single person on the job is quite frankly mean. You also better be a part of the union if you want anyone to care about what you want. Im not a fan of the the idea of uninons, and the second someone found out that i wasnt union, i was neglected."
bad,I'm usually busy and I have learned Ship Constructor.  Management and co-workers I have to take the good with the bad.  The hardest part of my job is complicated details on hull/structural designs.  The most enjoyable part of my job is when I complete a project/task.
bad,"A typical day at work for me would be adjusting wire-ways. I learned mostly how to adjust wire-ways. The hardest part of the job is being able to work all day in the hot sun or on a hot, steel boat with no air conditioning. The most enjoyable part of my job was at 2:30. That is when the whistle would blow for me to get off."
bad,"Company is on downhill slope, inconsistent management with no clear direction, freezes on raises and promotions for entire years, yet becoming culture of extended work weeks with Saturday becoming just another work day for all salaried employees."
bad,The company is trying to work with a minimal staff.  Many times the workload is too much for the manning.  There will be difficult times in the near future.
bad,"A typical day at work for me would be getting picked on by my supervisor/foreman. I was singled out multiple times by my supervisor and joked by my co-workers because I was new. The hardest part of my job was the fact that we did not work as a team, it was every man for himself. I was then let go from this job because of one of my co-workers lying to an auditor about my PPE(personal protective equipment). I did, however, submit a grievance to try and get my job back. When I was actually working, I did enjoy doing my job. I was a very hardworking individual that would spend most of the day making sure that my job was done correctly and safely."
bad,When a supervisor job is on the line get ready to take the blame
bad,"arrive early to find decent parking, walk anywhere from .5 to 3 miles from the front gate to reach your work area by 6am then receive your tasks from management for the day. exposure to the elements is common and various crews often work against each other rather than with."
bad,Enjoyed the job and the relationships that were created. Was able to lead a team of 27 planners to meet and beat daily and yearly goals set by the company.
bad,"Typical government contractor in the washington metro area. It does not really help you to find another job within the company, once you are laid off from a contract."
bad,The pay and miss themselves were good in pay and we'll worth the pay but all Ingalls administration don't treat their employees right and they don't care about employees. They fired me while I'm my maternity leave and didn't care.!
bad,It is a good place to work until upper management takes out their problems on the workers because they don't know how to do there job.  All the other crafts work together but upper management doesn't care for that.
bad,The work place is cutthroat. You feel like your back in high school again. The Supervisors have picks with in the work group. Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to paint. The hardest part of the job is getting into small tight places. I've learned a lot working with certain Supervisors. Management doesn't really care about the little people. We're just a number to them.
bad,"I found while working for  Newport News Shipbuilding that the work was not very challenging and very boring, there was very little possibility of advancement and the pay was one of poverty level and the company did not seem to care"
bad,no training in job. thrown to the wolves. very cut-throat environment. very unprofessional. worked with a lot of good people in my office. upper mgmt. unsupportive.
bad,very unsafe work place i have never seen anything like it. mangment dont care about the works along with medical team you cant get help from safe on real problms in the yard
bad,Expected to work non stop throughout the shift without stopping unless you are a smoker.  Does not work with employees with families as far as changing shifts.  Little to no advancement.
bad,My typical day at work was good but hot. What I learn how to run a buffer wax floor dust mop floor clean bathroom paint walls take out trash. Management it's good. My co-workers was fun to be around with when got alone. The hardest part of my job is leaving the yard. The most enjoyable part of my job was working hard and getting my job done and no complaints.
bad,"I take weekly and daily surveys to ensure radiation and contamination levels are safe for trade workers to perform their jobs."
bad,Started working there for job security since the economy was not up to par.  It is  a very negative place to work at.  The Management is horrible and they talk to you like a speck of dirt on the wall that is about to be wiped off.  They expect one hours work in 5 minutes.  Conditions are horrible.  Parking does not exist so you have to get there 2 hours before your shift starts to hopefully get a parking spot.  The Pay and benifits is the only thing that keeps me there at the moment.
bad,"The work was good, plenty of it to do. I had a problem with my supervisor he was lazy and didnt really want to do what it took to get the job done."
bad,"I did not believe the engineer that told me that the shipyards in SE Virginia are where engineers go to die. He was right, it is not worth your time. If you want a job where your manager forgets you exist and you don't have any work to do for weeks-months on end then this is the place for you.  Engineers here are either too busy to breathe or so bored they wish for death. Those that are too busy are working 6-7 days a week and 12 hour shifts because they pursued those positions. "
bad,"I enjoyed my job for the most part it had Great benefits , good hours, paid vacation, needs to be more family friendly . Its extremely hot in the summer and you freeze during the winter."
bad,"Like any job there are ups and downs. I enjoyed being a part of designing 3 of our countries aircraft carriers and that's something cool I'll hold with me forever. I got along with and made lifelong friends with some of my coworkers and am thankful for the opportunity I was given when I was hired, right out of school with no experience."
bad,The culture at NNS is archaic and extremely slow on all accounts. This is definitely not recommended for the highly motivated go-getter person. NNS leadership fails at accountability and responsibility.... from the top all the way down. They build ships for the Navy yet don't give Veteran's Day off! LOL
bad,The hardest part of this job was comming to work everyday. there are unrealistic expectations when management has your hands tied behind your back.
bad,Maintain weld records in accordance with the Naval specifications daily and engage with other departments to assit the needs of the shipbuilders.
bad,Overall its a good company but management sucks and when everyone should be busy there is no work lots of rules and procedures to follow and its a very hurry up and wait type of company. Parking and traffic is a nightmare
bad,"Used to be a great place to work but lately upper management does not care about the below Director level employee's. They have taken away a favoritable work schedule, some over time pay, sick leave, taken away front line managers ability to improve productivity, divided the yard into several individual organizations per craft, we used to work as one even between craft to get the job done. taken away incentives to reward the work force. They pay a good salary to the craft and have a good backlog of work if you can put up with the good ole boy system that has gotten worse."
bad,"NNS was an awesome place to work and still is for some people.  Facilities is the best division.  Operations is evolving and getting better (still some old school bubbas to overcome).  IT is a disaster.  People in IT get rotated so often that no one knows what others are doing.  A couple years back the IT org was flattened and ruined the internal careers of all who got a title change. Internal Managers see the supposed demotion and do not know why it happened, just assume there is something wrong with the candidate."
bad,"Best way to advance, in any department or at any level is to become friends.  Hard work and dedications don't amount to much to this company.  Pay was fair although the benefits were hit or miss depending on what you might have already coming into this line of work.  Work is abundant and if you are placed with the right person, learning is fun and enjoyable but it is difficult to find that right person.  A lot of arrogance and back stabbing."
bad,"Company not too bad. As usual, Management ruins the company’s objectives, culture and experience. Have to deal with extreme temperatures rather cold or hot and extreme work conditions, rather fumed or dusty. Tore down your body and happiness but was compensated."
bad,"Job required a lot of attention and physicality  "
bad,Management seems unable to stay on track and a lot of miscommunication between departments. Liked the group I worked with but there was a lot of time with no work and not much experience to move up or out of the company.
bad,Productive workplace with supportive management. Co-workers work as a team to get the job done. Management make good decision to make the job a good place to work. I've learn a lot on the job from the supervisor and co-workers. The hardest part of the job is working in tight spaces. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing the job is complete.
bad,The job was not challenging. I was throttled and not allowed to do everything I could. I was surrounded by a large amount of individuals that had poor work ethics.
bad,The pay  was above fair but to me they just did not think about the situations much before hand.So there was a lot of grinding carbon fiber.Which is not fun.
bad,I job was great as laborer but the pay wasnt. The supervisors were okay to say the most. I can describe working it felt like i was just tgere because it was getting the bills paid. Underpaid & over worked !!!
good,"this place is a okay place to work if you don't mind getting to the parking lot 3 hours early and the union is the worst thing ever all they care about is the people that clean the bathrooms, they don't care about skilled labor."
good,"great place, limited parking, very friendly... management is very knowledgeable. Easy going work environment."
good,"Its a boring work place...the management does not want me to move up. I am a hard and dependable worker. Don't miss time, always try by best and do better job than my coworker. Didn't get a raise in two years. I wanted to move out of my department.. got a job interviewed and everything went well, but the department manager did want to let me go. Tired of see most of my coworkers slacking off everyday and I have work by myself hard and got no rewards."
good,"Clock in visa email, anytime not actively inputting or analyzing information i.e. rest room breaks etc. is required to be made up before the end of the work day and email clock out.  Many supervisors require their team members to clock out and back in when they come or go from their assigned work station.  Time off is difficult to come by as well as upward mobility for military veterans.  Prior service employees are passed over for management positions."
good,Pay good but you have to put up with a lot of unnecessary stuff. A lot of uncoordinated people who do thing backwards and make excuses when reprimanded. Controlling of your breaks. Wants you to stand all day
good,"average work day for a marine pipe welder"
good,"The job is mind-numbingly easy. There is no room for advancement, nor is there opportunity to excel. However, there is job security, and the pay is steady."
good,Very low pay and will always only offer the minimum best thing was the hours and  flexible working hours but depending on your supervisor Huntington Ingalls
good,"Just to get to the job where you can punch in and get paid your hourly rate you have to walk a mile from the parking lot. At end of day you have to wait in grid lock on company property for a hour off the clock. So you waste 2 hours a day off the clock after driving into work or then the drive back home so if you are a half hour drive away then you end up wasting 3 hours a day unpaid just to avail yourself to be put to work that day. Then the managers and formen are all in over there head not having a clue as to how to run the people doing the work but knowing they personally can do it better then anyone else. The policies of the work place prohibit a welder from using quick change filter plates in order to weld and cut steel accurately  and with ease. Required to wear pre WWII welding visors and the heaviest hardhats still on the market. They light the outside of the ship light a christmas tree , lights that are suppose to be used inside the ships dark and dank insides. They have many air conditioning systems they fail to use to there most effective install and end up air conditioning the air over top and beside the ship instead of the inside of the ship. In short they could not bate a mouse trap let alone build a ship without the billions of dollars over spent and the super human efforts of the actual craftsmen that build them."
good,Working for this company was stressful  but a productive enviroment that required lots of  physical work and safety requirements working with others consisting of military and contractors aboard carriers and ships.
good,Like to add that working for Huntington Ingalls has been a learning curve for me. I've grown since starting with this company. Yes there were a lot of ups and down but with there training regiment and job advancement ingalls has and will provide you with a of stability and I'm grateful to be a part of this company.
good,Would spent an entire career at NNS.  Good starting place to start a career after college but do not stay at NNS for the long run. I spent 12 years at NNS and I stayed 8 years too long.
good,"there is a lack of management in this company, they expect more out of you than what they capable of doing themselves, its not fair and it needs to change."
good,Its a good place to learn a trade. Get paid while you learn and leave. Nothing more. Too stressful coming from upper management down to the people performing dailey job tasks. CUTT-THROAT environment.
good,there will be day that it get hot outside or it rain when you are trying to work on the cranes. it does make thing harder . the supervisor is good to work with
good,"Overall, if you can out last the intern probation period; great job to learn either quickly or its not the job for you. They do not have enough skilled manager resources for help and the ones that are, is so busy with multiple task; you can never really know what you are doing is correct or not."
good,the pay and benefits are good but you have to deal with a lot of immature co-workers and foreman. you are also constantly watching your back to make sure no one steals anything from you or take credit for your work or pass off poor work as yours and there's also no job security.
good,Shipbuilding is complicated. There is sufficient room within this organization for sub-optimized solutions that can cause quality minded employees to enjoy their work at different levels.
good,"You learn a lot about ships and subs but the perks are not that good. Parking is the worse. if you work inside the yard you park far far away and have to walk 15 mins into work. By time you get to work you are ready to go home, ESPECIALLY IN THE SUMMER. It seems like you never know when they will be doing layoffs. pros: they will help you build your resume when they are about to lay you off lol."
good,"typical involve talking to cog engineers, doing studies, solving complex problems, design work and customer drawings"
good,"good co-workers, bad training, working in the climate all year, little to no growth or transfers."
good,3Rd shift supervisor is unprofessional and unfair to employees. I would not recommend this shift to anyone that is really trying to learn skills. It is not a lot of opportunities on this shift and you get easily bored
good,"Not a bad place to work but if you want to be paid well expect to work 7 days a week. Although it depends on the trade, some trades have very little to no overtime while others work as much as they want. That also depends on your location within the yard. Overall not bad and decent pad but the management is horrible and repetitive."
good,Had some issues with a makeup supervisor her had me released from work while on probation cause he simply could. I would not be outspoken here while on your 120 day probation period.
good,"Management is rather unorganized. Some employees would go for hours without an assigned task, while others were swamped. Employees connected to management are most likely to be promoted, regardless of qualification."
good,"Pay is good especially for what you do. This job is for a person who doesn't want to do much of anything. You'll be told what to do and how to do it 99% of the time, so if you don't like thinking for yourself, this job is perfect for you. "
good,Enjoyed the job and would love to do it again. Some of the people enjoy working with just have a problem with some management. The company offers many opportunities for education.
good,"Decent place to work with relatively supportive immediate management.  However, its very much about the numbers and little opportunity is provided to train or increase your skills (or learn new ones).  The most enjoyable part of the job is working alongside the great people that work there."
good,A good company but one that preaches work life balance but has forgotten that below the executive level.  Wonderful mission to support the fleet.
good,Worked there for 10 years and obtained lots of schooling and knowledge. Left due to relocation outside of Virginia. Lots of engineering jobs need to be filled.
good,Overall decent work place needs to revamp management and planning. Some favor shown to family members shown throughout shipyard. Some great craftsman employed there.
good,The constant threats of losing your job while you doing said job. Changing crews supervisors every 2 - 6 months. Trades not working together to get job done right the first time.  Its a disaster waiting to happen. Morale is very poor especially in some departments. While in other departments depending on their make up they get treated real well. Jobs are easy to do but management and their constant bickering makes them super hard. To be honest there was no joy in this job what so ever.
good,"This is a huge company, with all the pros and cons that go along with that. For young engineers, it can be a valuable first job since they will help you get a security clearance."
good,"Great company once you get your foot in the door. Unfortunately, Ingalls is still in the practice of the Good Ole Boy network. You better know someone if you plan to advance or swap departments."
good,"not the best in the world some poor work conditions "
good,"Ingalls is owed and operated by the Unions. BUT that is only on the bottom of the Management level with little interaction between those levels. On the job training is the ONLY training you'll get and that is NOT ""standardized"". Sometimes it is great and sometimes it's horrible. Be careful what you learn and from whom."
good,"Huntington very okay company but there a lot of stuff you need to know. You don’t get days off in your 120. Sometimes you have work sometimes things are slow and your cleaning for the day.  Very hard to park if on first shift, second and third super easy. Meant a lot of good people and some really rude and cocky ones. "
good,it was a pay check. but management was not the best. no consideration was given to family hardship. what I learned is if you wanted to do well you had to make your boss feel like he was a god. and the most enjoyable part of the job was going home.
good,"There is some nepotism here. If you are not related, although qualified you might have a hard time getting into IT. People usually very stoic here, not very much happiness for having to be here 3 hours early just to TRY and get a parking spot."
good,"As with most corporations throughout the past few years, Ingalls has combined multiple jobs into one title.  This has caused the workload to increase dramatically for non-represented (Management) employees.  Uncompensated Overtime was mandatory.  There were was very little backing from upper management when pressured from other departments as to why information was incorrect or was hard to come by.  Most positions in the Planning/Scheduling departments are very hard to manage.  Prioritization varied from manager to manager.  Overall I had a good group that I worked with, it was just the overall work conditions that created a stagnant and sometimes miserable workplace.  Holiday celebrations and personal beliefs were not allowed to be publicly displayed and social events were terminated.  There was very little comradery that used to keep company's closely tied. Budgets are very small and most of the time Union Laws were encouraged to be skirted around to give the production that management required.  One of the biggest complaints throughout the workforce was parking.  A 30 minute (3/4 Mile) walk in from parking to the office was the norm.  This added to the lack of parking control and security created havoc.  An extra hour a day has to be taken into consideration for just the walk in and out of the workplace not to mention the lack of adequate parking for the 10,000 plus employees."
good,"Scheduling and staffing problems. I worked a 24/7/365 day job with 3 people covers 3 shifts 7 days a week. Little time off naturally. But the pay and benefits for the area were unmatched, and coworkers were generally friendly and helpful."
good,"This job simply does not pay well.  There is zero opportunity for advancement.  Also, this is contract work, so job stability is questionable.  Company needs to invest more in its most valuable assets.....their employees."
good,"if need a job, it's a check. once you start working there you realize you are really on your own. Way more management than needed and folks don't mind walking on you to get what they need or where they want to be."
good,They put you on whatever shift they want. Make it impossible to get off the shift no matter what the problem is. Pay is good but I would give the back five dollars if I could be on dayshift. I'm looking for another job just so I can be on dayshift
good,The best part about this job was the amount of money you can make. One other thing i liked were the people I worked with. The not so good part about the job is the management.
good,Lazy people just showing up to collect a paycheck and leaving the work for others to make up their slack. Management is horrible. To many chiefs not enough indians.
good,"Shipyard had good and bad moments. Overall it was a good employer. Does important work."
good,"Company is great place to gain experience.  Unstable environment because of lay offs.  Limited growth, but can be enjoyable at times."
good,"Outdated management styles, hard to advance unless your parent worked there or you are part of the old boy network.  Hard for females and minorities to advance due to lack of opportunities to gain experience."
good,"it may be a good place to work for some people...i feel there is no room for advancement for myself in my department. Working for this company can be stressful for others. If you are put in the right position you will excel and get overtime,but for everyone else you will have some type of struggle to overcome."
good,"Run from meeting to meeting. Lack of vision in management and no real reward for the craft production personnel. Safety is supposed to be the top priority, but it is apparent from independent sources that cost performance is the key concern."
good,"I have a total of 20+ years at Huntington; with apprenticeship since 1980.  Just returned and can't seem to move up with my skill and abilities?"
good,"I enjoyed reading blueprints, ripping out ventilation, Shipping and handling. Plenty of learning experiences."
good,"I like the fact this company is still around, i would work there again if givin achance"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job are the challenges you overcome to get the job done.
good,"a very good training school and , excellent support for workers to be trained."
good,Good  job  and good  pay .Just  think the contractors need a little  more support  or leverage. No one  seems to have  a voice  for the  workers. Maybe  it will  get better soon. Really  not a  bad  place to work.
good,Job can be challenging yet stressfull. The idea of building the worlds best and top ships can be awe inspiring. Newer a dull moment in the yard. Job has taught me many ways to improve myself.
good,"Too many meetings..."
good,"Huntington Ingalls Industeries is a good place to work at. The benefits are good, but a lot of the people working for them do not have Flex time so that would have to use their PTO to take time off if anything happens to their family."
good,Need respect for management and management should be paid a lot more than craft as an incentive   Boat foreman should have more authority in order in functionality complete tasks at a timely pace.
good,The work is fairly easy . The managers make the job stressful. I love my job but have only had 1 boss that I actually liked in the 5 years that I have been here.
good,"If you're just starting out in any skilled labor position this is a great first stop for you. The environment can be pleasant among your fellow workers. Management on the other hand can be extremely negative and very unorganized. If you have any good ideas, when you tell them about it they will brush you off and belittle you for thinking of it. Than turn around and present the idea to their higher ups as their idea. When you confront them they make it seem like you never told them about it. They stress safety but when it comes to production safety goes out the window. They are not family oriented at all. Even with all the negative attributes there are still a lot of benefits and you will learn a lot. Again its a great first stop but if you're a free thinker and a hard worker don't make it career."
good,Parking is terrible the walk in and out everyday is very monotonous management does their best while trying to manage thousands of people at the same time really pushy Foreman's always going for their bonuses
good,"I learned a lot a Huntington Ingalls, and I wouldn't trade the experience for anything, but it is a cliquey company, and if you don't fit into the culture you find yourself on the outside. There was a lot of interesting work to do but emphasis was placed on formatting, rather than writing in my department, and I didn't like that."
good,"New to the Shipbuilding. It's an alright place to start off your career, but management will not work with you in working the preferred shift of your choice. Do not request 3rd shift or they place you on 1st or 2nd, because it's not enough ""people"". They'll have you working in any condition and will send employees home less affected by weather conditions."
good,"Enjoy working for Amsec. Very good company and nice environment to work for. Learn all the job on the waterfront.  Workers are great, there are hardworkers"
good,"Hard, hot, and physically demanding . Pays well but wears you down fast . between the heat and picking up extremely heavy material , the job wears you out . As they say you need to be tougher than steel for this job ."
good,I enjoyed working there but there has to be something done about favoritism with a foreman. I just got fired today because my foreman wouldn't get us the right material or tools to complete the job. He wrote me up for loafing 2 day in a row when I was putting in my time on one and someone else told him I was sitting down. So something should be done about that in my eyes before a lot more people loose their jobs as well
good,This job is a good job for engineers out of college. It exposes them to the industrial and military environments. It provides the opportunity to work across many departments to see how different professionals engage and fit into the overall picture of major ship projects.
good,"It is a good place to work and great for experience. "
good,Ingalls is a great work environment. I was working with a contracting company and not the actual Ingalls. They didn't respect their workers and cheated us out of our pay.
good,"The pay is great for this area. Some of the managers have a slave driver's mentality. Most of line supervisors are untrained, uneducated and unprofessional."
good,"Difficult and slow hiring process, Very efficient security, Good work, working environment lacking due to poor communication and non-existent training, Constant issues due to leadership that doesn't communicate with each other or with their workers"
good,"A typical day at work as a supervisor/manager normally starts at least 30 minutes before the shift/hourly workers and ends at least an hour after.  You are required to attend many meetings, most of which are redundant and do nothing to actually solve or improve process/conditions.  Trusting team members, management and others from different departments is almost impossible.  There is still a prevalent sexist, racist, and regional bias which can be very difficult to overcome.  Technically speaking, the company is surprisingly behind the curve.  A phrase you will hear often is ""That's how we've always done it""; thinking differntly makes many uncomfortable. "
good,"A job environment that is challenging on a daily basis. Changes in job focus and responsibilities can be implemented without sufficient discussion with the department responsible parties. While your given the opportunity to run with the opportunity, it may not be the direction ultimately expected by management."
good,good company. pay and benefits are awesome. dealing with the elements and conditions is the hardest part. like the one mile walk into work. work with great people from all different backgrounds
good,"The hardest part of the job is getting coworkers to accept change.  To accept that a process that has been in place for many years, can and probably does need to be updated. The most enjoyable part of the job is struggle with a task that many think is impossible, but through hard work, trail and error, and pure determination finding a workable solution."
good,"As an hourly employee for almost eighteen years I felt that management did not appreciate us. Whenever you had a problem you felt like no one cared and you didn't really have a voice. The most common refrain from management was if you don't like it, go find a job somewhere else. "
good,Overall average place to work. Great benefits package for health and retirement. Some parts of management need overhaul. Some managers can make working here a tough place.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is learning something new everyday.  This position has taught me valuable lesson.  Grooming me to be the professional career woman that I've wanted to become.  I am very grateful for the opportunity to have worked in such an environment.
good,as a pipe insulator a typical day is working safe and doing a quality job the first time. i have learned how to install the proper insulation on the proper system. My co-workers are like family we help each other daily caring for others safety is very important. i enjoy my job i do my best at it. if i need help my supervisor provides me with what i need to do the job correctly.
good,"There was very little time for a life outside of work, and no one is safe in the layoffs. Benefits are pretty good, but not sure it was worth constantly being worried about the pending layoffs. I was on restricted light duty following a surgery and was still laid off."
good,Advancement is hard to do within this company. Trying to progress is hard. Lots of red tape. Great place to start if you need a job.
good,Supervisor was not competent and should not have been in that position. co-workers were alright to work with and around. Alot of nepotism there and playing favorites. not my cup of tea
good,"Huntington Ingalls is a great place to get your feet off the ground, and to find out what you have a passion for in life.  Far as a long term company its not a good place to make into a career."
good,N/a welding burning great place to work friendly people sjjbbhsafzhxgxgzv
good,"If you are a pipe welder, the shipyard is not ideal. Ingalls is a decent company. Most of the foremen are great guys, but once you get higher up the ladder it's a nightmare. Pay is below average for a skilled welder."
good,"A typical day at work is exhausting, I learned welding, some management were great others well I don't wanna go there. My coworkers were great. There was nothing hard at all. The most enjoyable part of the day was lunch when you got to talk with your coworkers and laugh."
good,The company was ok I had fun when I was working learning new welding technics. If was just some of the supervisors wasn't. Supervisor material.
good,"I was new to shipbuilding gain a lot of exposure, great way to learn shipbuilding engineering, and new software. I would recommend this for a new engineer or designer"
good,"Too much time spent talking about tasks. Too many meetings. Inability for upper management to make decisions. Very difficult to get on calendars of upper management, which prolongs time to complete tasks."
good,I enjoy working with Huntington Ingalls Industries. I have had the opportunity to provide quality control and assurance on Aircraft Carriers and Submarines.
good,"It’s a solid job to have that pays decent. With the cost of living and the rise in insurance policies, we’re slightly under the bar for maintaining a comfortable lifestyle."
good,I was only in one area so i can only speak of the area I was working in and it needed alot of work with management and was unorganized and was no being held accountable for screw ups but was relaxed and good pay..as a contractor but also good pay entry level.
good,"Promotions for senior employees are non-existent. Good benefits and pay, but very little employee consideration."
good,there were a lot of opportunities to learn. some really great people to work with and several people with in depth knowledge of the job. always a source to go to when there was a question.
good,it used to be a good company. Growth was not high on upper management radar. Their intention: sub themselves to larger competitors and never rise to become a prime.
good,HII is an ok place to work but it lacks clear paths for advancement and the pay when compared to the amount of work performed is low. Pay is normally why people leave the company because it is not on track with the average.
good,it's a good place to start a career wouldn't stay here all my life though. has high job security but low advancement. Very repetitive day in and out not much changes day to day
good,"It is a shipyard.  Old School and dirty.  Met some amazing people, but nowhere I will return to work.  The pay was okay, but low for industry standards."
good,Production Planning/Nuclear Planning tasks assisting waterfront trades with scheduling and planning of nuclear aircraft carrier construction or overhall
good,A typical day could vary depending if material was available. If we didn't have the right material we have to wait or move to another assignment. I learned multiple processes of welding as well as fitting. Management is on the poor side especially where I was located. The culture was great. It was all about the camaraderie.
good,"The positive: In the Hampton Roads area not many jobs will pay you above minimum wage for minimal to no skill set, and teach you the skill.  But your same job title in other states are getting paid 30 to 50 percent more, have better working conditions and their management seem more relaxed."
good,The upper managment puts too much pressure on mid-level managers to mid-charge and falsely bill the government. They continue to cut budgets on ships that they know can not be made.  If you couldn’t build it for the anount of hours on the previous ship how can you beat it.
good,Decent environment working with other employees.  You learn alot with the trade you are working in. The pay is good.  Just need better communication between management.
good,"Dog eat dog. Lots of smoke and mirrors. Big show but slow go. Deep family ties control playground. My association over forth years in this  engineering department and a combined history of over 260 years of family ties, I can say it is like too many other military contract companies have been given too much power for too long. This has encouraged a old house of history with many rats in the closets. It has been the only show in town for a long time. Like most government systems lots of non-producers. If you see something wrong, keep it to yourself. NEVER leave your back open. The infestation has grown to not just individuals but organizations and secret societies working behind things.  Weak HR does not react until it over reacts."
good,I really don't have anything to say.   I did have and met some good people there. and there are many back stabbing upper management there that have no ethics and integrity.
good,"Doggie Dog world out their on that campus.Like a soap opera.They don't value the experience workers like they should enough to let them move up in the company,it's the people who don't really know anything or not good at their craft that makes it further up the ladder,and the women,OMG,they move up really fast,just like I said its like a Soap Opera ,Real Talk, just telling it like it is ,not directing at anyone in particular."
good,"no communication"
good,"if you are in the ""in crowd"", you can do great.... otherwise the organization will turn and it will not be a fun ride.   Promotions can be low with entrenched personnel and the next person already identified."
good,This can be a great place to work if you are younger and don't have to balance work and family too much. The department I worked for was very demanding and required you to practically live there but when I applied for job it was said as if you had a choice in the overtime. However once you started to work there it was said it was mandatory so that was a little disappointing. Other than that you had good opportunity to make overtime money.
good,I started my career at Newport News Shipbuilding.  They offer somewhat low pay; when I left my job there I was able to almost double my salary by moving out of the area.
good,"I would recommend anyone thinking about learning a trade skill to apply and work at this employer. If you can succeed here, then you can achieve any goal you set for you career in the future."
good,You have no choice what shift you are on and can get passed around  if you don't kiss butt. You can be the best worker in the world and ask to be moved and if the supervisor wants to block you he can.
good,Typical engineering environment. Probably the most diverse workplace I have been in. Management makes themselves available to address issues/concerns.
good,"24 hours work force non stop work "
good,way to top heavy in management at the expense of the people who get the products out. supervisors in design tend to micro manage and not rely on the experienced people to make decisions.
good,"Take some getting use to, just not the place for me. offer good benefits and offsite work is pretty cool. overtime is set up double time on sundays"
good,"learn a lot of different types of material"
good,The company is geared towards cutting costs at the labor side while having 27 vice presidents. Management is only concerned with their bonus program. Motto at the company is do more with less. Soon will be doing all with nothing.
good,Shipyard is fun and a cool place to work. Parking sucks. Management is far from the best. Overtime is great. Holidays are iffy but shut down is PERFECT. Advancing is hard. My co-workers are my family.
good,"I enjoyed working at the shipyard when it was owned by Northrop Grumman.  As soon as the Northrop Grumman sold the company it became a steady fight to keep up contracts.  They hire a bunch of people in to build a ship within a required time frame but then have to let people go if they cannot secure a contract.  So nowadays you don't feel secure in your workplace when you go there day in and day out.  They also don't keep their employees in the loop.  We are the last to know what is coming but the only ones affected.  They have also done things with the company that the employees have tried to legitimately fight to no avail, ex; the health clinic they are building that took away 500+ parking places.  "
good,It was the best and worst job of my career.  The best because I was challenged daily to reroute the network so that and team would be able to complete a test. The worst because there is little advancement for employees that are really good at what they do.
good,when the company made money so did the employees. as long as you were doing your for the most part management did not intervined.
good,The four + years at Huntington Ingalls was a great learning experience.  I genuinely enjoyed my job and had some excellent mentors.
good,"*My day varied between crane operation or filling in as a foreman."
good,I liked knowing that i had a part in building ships..My and other employees experience built ships to safely ferry our soldiers safely around the world.  For the most part management was fair.My co workers were very knowledgable and fun to be around..The haqrdest part of the job was picking 45gallons of resin and carrying the heavy fiberglass materials.
good,"I made good money for the work performed; but, the shipyard has got to be one of the harshest environments in the world to earn a living. When it was hot, there's no place hotter and when it was cold; you were cold all day. There were lots of good people that worked out there that had to put up with the out dated style of managing used...reminded me of what you might see a prison show employing."
good,Newport News Shipbuilding is an okay place to work. I think they expect their hourly employees to perform miracles using severely outdated tools and equipment.
good,"Management is not this company's strong suit and ultimately lead to it's closing. The union was awful and fought more for the company than it's people. It was a decent place to work, though, with a lot of good people and hard workers. I learned a lot at this job despite it's faults."
good,the pay is good.the work is steady but not to back breaking. management is not so good they need to learn a better way to talk to the workers.they switch your shift with only five days notice so might not be the best job for a person with a family.
good,"-Learn something new everyday."
good,"Great talent in the department, but management and job security are very sad."
good,"The company provided great opportunities to learn a variety of management skills. The management also provided multiple training venues, policies, work instructions and on-line classroom instructions which if followed helped employees to be more efficient in thier daily work routines."
good,HII is company on the move but it needs to value its employees more especially when it comes to pay.  They will pay a new hire more with less experience vs a valued long time employee with experience and company knowledge.
good,"Not a terrible place to work.like all companies ingalls has it areas where it could use improvement. Some examples are the first line supervision can not focus on pushing their crew because they have to play the 'numbers' game. The second area that need s addressing is the advancement opportunity. If you don't know the right people, it is impossible to advance."
good,Good place to work.  High paced and competitive.  The work environment is culturally diverse and many positions are technology driven.  The hardest part of the job is keeping all customers satisfied and being able to support the daily customer demands.
good,"Shipbuilding environment, schedule driven, government funding dependent. Long hours, and high expectations for those in system lead spots.  Company needs to a do a better Job empowering the younger engineers with lead roles, but also making them accountable."
good,"Great benefits. Great group of coworkers. Would work with them again. However, parking is an issue. You should not have to pay to park to go to work. I liked my position but without a degree, there is no room for advancement."
good,"If you are looking for a weekly check, I recommend working slow as to not work yourself out of a job. Everyone whom has been working there for 10+ years gets first dibs on any other job openings that come available whether they are qualified for the job or not. That's the downfall of Ingalls."
good,"doing an assessment on a job location,, then getting all materials to that job ten working that job the hardest part of this job was i was my own support so we had no help from other departments in assisting but we assisted every department in setup"
good,"good supervisor, good crew to work with.  project is organized and well managed.  company supplies all the tools needed to do the work.  safe place to work."
good,Overall it is a decent company with decent pay and hours. It was hard to advance past the regular worker status. A good place to start and learn job skills you can build on.
good,"not a bad place to work, the people in the craft areas are fun to work with, the poor management is very disagreeable, lots of back door hand shakes............................................................................."
good,"A typical day working can be doing the same activities all the time which some people may get tired of doing, but there new programs that are available to experience different fields within the company."
good,The job was unsympathetic to my difficulties as a caregiver to a handicapped child. I regret working for them was tickled pink when they got bought out.
good,"The shipyard is a stable consistent place to work, but is slow to change and culture is very management-driven and innovation is stifled as a result.  It's not a terrible place to work especially in engineering and IT, but it doesn't provide a lot of challenge for new ideas."
good,"I am came to the shipyard to get a career started. I've been here for 13 years. Like any other jobs, there are ups and downs. I've learned a multitude of things. I've encountered almost every aspect of my job that is available."
good,Keep your nose clean and stay on your tools.  You can support your family and retire.  Management requires shady dealings. Do not take any management position if you have morals.
good,"Team building is not in place, Leader's is  not leading, It is hard to move up. As for me I would be very careful as to the  department you choose to work with."
good,Largely a closed Navy centric business with no competition or incentive to follow best practices.  Lost of talented employees as long as you following the heritage of the company.
good,The job is dangerous and if you are not careful death or injury will find you quickly. Layoffs are often and the work is typically in open bay buildings so your at the mercy of the weather.
good,"Large organization with average compensation however, the nature of work forces engineers to consistently think inside the box with little room for process and design improvement"
good,"You can work long hours.  There are many great people working there.  Management is a mixed group of good and great people.  Hardest part is accepting the wages will not be cutting edge but mid level, you sacrifice that for a normally stable work environment.."
good,Profits go to the top. Layoffs and CEO doubles his salary. You are just a number and your skills and performance are expendable. Sitting in 4 man cubes with unprofessional environment in dilapidated buildings!
good,All you are is a number on HR's payroll. Too many overhead processes that need to be followed and poor company morals. If you are a young engineer trying to do something new and innovative don't come here. This is a good place to end your career if your looking for a cozy office for the last 5 years before you retire.
good,work on aircraft carrier welding pipe. It gets very hot and cold on it. Have to work in some very tight place and have to mirror weld daily. Weld all pipe using tig
good,There are pros and cons to working anywhere. But the knee jerk reactionary nature of the middle management of NNS is getting to be quite ridiculous. Lots of good ole boy syndrome among management and executives. Pay and benefits are adequate. There are certain areas of the yard that are better than others.
good,"This job has great Benefits Great Pay but poor leadership individually. ie Foremans, most lack the social quality to communicate on a professional level. Makes you def. just feel like a number on the board. If it wasnt for the other good employees i worked with i would not have stayed this long , 1 1/2 years."
good,"NNI as a company is not as bad as most in this area."
good,"A good day at work consisted of having an assignment that could be worked with very little discrepancies. Learned a great bit a detail to being able to install various hardware onboard this new class of Aircraft Carrier. Welding, fitting, measuring, installing, and fabricating. Management, well my direct manager was ok. Wasn't truly a fair person in spreading around the over-time. Some task assigned proved to be a bit challenging but over all the job was pretty straight forward."
good,Wake up early to get to work for 6:30am. Great place to gain good manufacturing experience. Get to walk large Navy Warships.
good,Really interesting place to work. Always see something different every shift. Working in rotating shifts depending on department but thats not the norm. Just depends on scope of work. Excellent benefits! Parking is terrible.
good,"40 hr week, supports your family, does not help you advance to learn more or better your career. overall good place to work."
good,I enjoyed working at Huntington Ingalls because there were opportunities for advancement and it fed my family.
good,"Huntington Ingalls is a Department of Defense work place. As a Pipe Welder, the Training and experience I received will last a lifetime. I learned to mirror weld with both hands and did a lot of it. At Ingalls, I worked daily with Pipe Fitter to overcome problems with new systems being installed, and ultimately the desired outcome was a 1st time quality Passing review by QA and the Navy. Doing this Safely, On Budget, and On Time were our daily drivers. The Management that I worked with, were some of the best I have known to date. However, they are not all like that. The most enjoyable part of the day, was the end of the day."
good,very top secret no special training cannot go into detail burned c-seqamsnfor nuculear submarines
good,"Craft people at this company is what made this company."
good,"This company has a lot of potential.  There is room to grow, but there are options for improvement that are not being acknowledge.  There has been improvement since we split from Northrop Grumman."
good,"Great Company, however Avondale Shipyard is closing at the end of 2013"
good,"Working in the military contracting world as a non-engineer was very ""results driven"". Family/work balance was very one sided. It afforded me a very good living; being without a college degree, so I had no problem with the company over all. Management was very much into micromanaging, but the people/coworkers were very pleasant."
good,I work in the refueling department and this is just an average job.
good,"A typical day work involves communicating with a lot of customers and trades to make sure the job is getting done properly. My communication skills have gotten stronger over my time at Newport News Shipbuilding. I have learned a lot about nuclear reactors and how they evolve on a submarine and aircraft carrier. Learning to communicate with every one at this company was task but at the end of the day, I received guidance on a lot of subjects. My co-workers were hard to work with at times but I had continue to work hard on my tasks that were given to me at work and get assistance if I needed help with anything."
good,"Excluding the US Navy revising their list of ships to be built and cutting it by 52%, Huntington Ingalls is currently in a transitional phase following its separation from Northrop Grumman. The Newport News sector is absolutely a wonderful place to work. You will be dealing the some of the very best and brightest in the shipyard industry, work is well organized, excellent intercraft communication, excellent response times on engineering, all around spectacular. Been there and would gladly go back. The Gulf Coast sector, however, is quite the opposite. Left neglected and allowed to their own devices, they are their own worst enemy. Ingalls Operations received nothing from NG taking over other than a name, and it didn't get much better in the HII spinoff. Avondale is being consolidated(ie. closed) because the contract that they had won from the Navy is now going to be completed at the Ingalls Operation instead. Terrible organization, no communication between crafts or even within crafts, you will have days where noone will work in a room at all and then you will have days where that same space is so packed that you can't move without bumping into someone. You will be blamed for things you never did and often won't be told until you're written up, there is no defending yourself. The union has succeeded in conning the whole gulf coast sector out of their money and not provided anything in return, unless you have a habit of sleeping at work, then you're covered. Newport News will eventually become its own entity, however the colossal drag of the gulf coast is a liability until then."
good,Good working environment unfortunately the Avondale yard is closing in 2013
good,"very little you can get fired for, but not that much room for advancement"
good,i worked 3rd shift i learned a lot about welding that you could be in any type of situation or postion welding and thats its always good to have someone thats near you in case something happened
good,My boss is not exactly what u would call good it would help if he could pat me on the back every now and again instead of talking about negative things. I weld UT work and when someone else fails i have to fix it and then i take the response from the foreman. I don't need to be treated like a child!
good,get to work 2 hours before you have to be there just to get parking. then traffic when you leave it takes 1 hour to get home. the place is very dirty place to work and unsafe.
good,Generally great people to work with but sometimes politics get in the way of progress. Lots of pressure to get things done today rather than wait for tomorrow even if folks are already tired.
good,they will teach you the skills you need to be one of the best shipbuilders in the nation. They have their own welding school in the yard. They will teach you to weld to navy standards
good,"If you come to work with the mindset to learn and grow, you can acquire the skills needed to learn your craft. Attendance is critical. The drive to do a good job does not go unnoticed."
good,"Overall, Huntington Ingalls is a good company to work for... The benefits and holidays are great.  Also, there are many opportunities to learn and  grow...."
good,"Surveying of Navy ships for radiation daily, employees were kind and generous. A few werent so but thats to be expected with every job. Management took care of things"
good,"Great job for a man with a family. Awesome job for someone who fresh out of high school. Pay is alright, some things you do is very underpaid. Biggest thing is you got these apprentice’s thinking they better than you getting paid way more than someone who been there 12 years. Great money when overtime is there, but sometimes the stress isn’t even worth it. You gotta know someone in order to move up, management can care less about your feelings. Navy treats you like you’re worthless to them. Females have an advantage over everybody."
good,the pay is good but as far as advancement Work most the time your in a group and need to be able to effectively communicate as well and work with others
good,"You can learn a lot at the job, you dont have to stay in your original department. There are a lot of training and development classes. You learn a lot from the older shipbuilders"
good,Salary is not competitive with other industries of the same caliber. Management overlooks employees that have been there longer than those that get promoted.
good,Management isn’t the best. The company has programs inacted to make sure everyone is treated fairly. However if you speak up you will be blackballed eventually fired. Just hope you luck up and work for one of the good ones.
good,Good place to get experience under your belt at an entry level. The company offers good benefits and a apprenticeship program. Although there are some long and hot workdays.
good,"Typical day consist of perform daily task"
good,I learned a lot in four years as an apprentice. I experienced LHA from start to finish.  Worked the AN/SPS 49 radar which was a hard radar to get going.
good,There appears to be little opportunity for growth. Only worked for a short while so far hence it is hard to completely conclude. Limited career growth opportunites
good,"I’ve worked numerous projects displaying leadership traits and even been recognized by multiple supervisors as a studious,hard working, team playing,  abide by the rules  kinda guy.  When it comes to getting promoted my management doesn’t influence personnel on what they should do to get promoted which makes it difficult to fulfill what’s required."
good,decent company everything is on the job training they give you opportunities to advance and move up in the company. they preach saftey and also offer apprenticeship
good,it was a decent experience working here. quite a few people tried to be the big man that didnt have much say so. the safety aspect of the job was fine
good,it was a normal work place nothing majorly good about it or nothing majorly bad about it just was a normal job to me would go back if I had to but just
good,"Fast working environment, Must be a quick learner. Provides job security. Plenty of room to move around so if you don't like what you are doing there are other departments you can explore."
good,"Received my training while there, however, the politically correctness and the advancement of people based on ethnicity and not ability is something that occurs over and over again.  For fear of being sued they advance the under-performing and people lose their jobs quicker for a lie then anywhere else."
good,"Pays Salary Overtime"
good,You will need to be there 1 hour before work to get decent parking. I gained a fair amount of experience working there. You will find good and bad management.
good,"On a typical day at work, the stress starts the minute you walk thru the gate.  You are there 2 hours before the shift and 2 hours after the shift and not get paid for it unless working overtime.  The pressure is on in management because you can get fired at anytime and for anything.  The hardest part of the job is getting to work..  The most enjoyable part is when you walk out that gate and no stress."
good,Not much opportunity to get more duties.  There was no opportunity for growth.  Did not get much opportunity to meet the client. No requirements tool was available
good,"Family, work-life balance, love, love, love my BOSS..  I love that fact that he and I get along very well.  I take pride in my job and making sure I'm committed to doing it well 1000%"
good,"busy, hot days, depending on  the climate"
good,"Teamwork among coworkers to achieve the customer's goals is generally high."
good,"I have not had the best experience here mostly due to poor upper mamagement, however if you can get past that the job is paid ok for the local cost of living."
good,"A lot of Redundancy in the work itself. "
good,Good place to work.  Hard work environment.  Always behind schedule and keeps people in a stressed condition but as long as you can see past the stress you are good to go.
good,"Its the shipyard, people use fowl language, management is cut throat and the good old boy system is at work and runs very very deep at this company. A day at work is hit and miss, the upper management gets kick-backs from making scheduled completions, and quality of work suffers from this time crunch. Management is luck of the draw, favoritism and politics play a large role in your position. The culture depends on which department you work in, overall there is a lot of gossip and its kind of like a high school physical education class. Hardest part of the job is getting to work early enough and fighting the traffic on the way home. The job has rather decent benefits for people with little education and experience. The company basically needs a lot of warm bodies because they get paid by the head count from the navy. There is a hand full of workers who really know their trade, and these workers are worked to the core, often times bringing their morale down, because of the added pressure to perform. This is the honest and straightforward work environment at this shipyard. Could be worse, could be better, its my opinion. Good luck."
good,Not a bad place to work if you want to start out in the engineering field for naval ships. Will learn a lot at a fast pace and will become qualified quick.
good,"Not a bad place to work if you live close and work at a slow pace. Decent safety culture, Friendly environment to work in. Great benefits for the most part"
good,"Lots of great people to work with, with incredibly interesting products, but salaries are not competitive to support rising home costs, career advancement is slow or nonexistent. Healthcare and benefits are pretty solid. Management proficiency is a mixed bag, and company culture is on the up swing, but relies heavily on the unpaid extra efforts of a few hyper-engaged employees to propel their culture into the 20th century. "
good,"Great company to learn alot of skills if you want to learn how to weld, fabricate or become a machinist"
good,The job pays well and the benefits are awesome. Its just a stressful job. Going into work and leaving is a terrible pain. Some of the bosses are nice but most of them could care less about you. They are usually more focused on moving up professionally in stead of making sure their workers have everything they need to work.
good,Did not feel as if they where prepared to set up shop in Jacksonville. They did not provide adequate work to sustain a living and the total lack of corporate direction was apparent.
good,"The days flew by, as there was always a lot to do. The company had three thousand documents to work on, and the topics ranged from highly technical to business-related to quality control. I learned many new software techniques, and I learned a lot about budgeting my time. The work was stressful at times. The hardest part of the job was having to be extremely meticulous. The most enjoyable part was working with the engineers."
good,It was good place to work but advancement doesn't exist. The PTO package isn't the greatest. The weekly pay is very rewarding and the overtime is almost unlimited.
good,"O51 is a great place to learn and advance if you have the correct people in the leadership roles. If you have a relative in a management position and they are white you will move up extremely fast. The hardest part of the job is consistently working to get promoted by taking the difficult jobs but not getting promoted or recognized for it. It does not matter how much education you have it only matters if you have a relative or spouse in a management position. Also, you have to be in the in crowd in O51. You have a lot of people that are qualified and some over qualified for the position they are in but due to not being part of the in crowd or not having a relative in a management position do not ever think about O51."
good,"Ok job to work at no good parking  "
good,"It is a nice place to work, but has many stipulations with the company.  My time there was short due to a switch in companies which I have recently experienced."
good,Too many things to learn in a short period of time. Trying to learn where everything you need to perform the job is a memory overload. Constantly taking notes as well as referencing those notes.
good,"While i worked at the Newport News Shipyard for a few months while i was going back to school to learn about Networking, i enjoyed my time.  The people were very helpful and the job was more Admin than technical."
good,Main problem was the management.  However overall it was decent job. Liked the hours and the paid vacation received after a yearbof working there. The benefits are well worth it
good,"What I liked about working there most was the diversity among everyone along with everyone working together."
good,Getting along with the other employees was not a problem it was upper management that didn't know how to manage and took it out on the employees.  They also took out the bad attitudes on the employees.
good,"*good pay, and benefits"
good,"A very good work environment, with many walks of life working along side you. Benefits are great and as long as you show up to work and do what you're supposed to do you will have good job security."
good,"A work day is usually very slow, and time consuming jumping through administrative hoops. I always had more fun at work when stuff was going wrong when compared to when everything was going right."
good,"The benefits here are fantastic. However, I was laid off two weeks before I was promised a promotion. I moved away from my family, got married, and started a life here to be laid off two years later. I was laid off along with 60 other men in my same position. I received no warning of the lay off."
good,"Offer multiple opportunities; benefits are declining; salaries need to be more competitive; workplace culture is still rigid, but company is trying progressive initiatives"
good,Rough work. Working in the climate. Can take as many breaks as you want as long as your getting your production done. Get off at 2:30pm. Traffic is horrible.
good,just be in office answer phones calls bored all day make good money meet great people i had a great time there but watch out for layoff me and my husband was laid off around the same time
good,It really isn't a job for a young person. It's a place to go to retire from. Pay wasn't that great. Management wasn't that great either. I'd have to be pretty desperate to go back there.
good,"safe, friendly environment for the most part. i was just a contractor for 3 weeks and was fired for no reason at all. Ive been with this company for 8 years previously and had zero problems"
good,"I got on with the company right before the layoffs started.  It was a stressful time for everyone.  If the company would have been more stable at the time, it might have been a better experience."
good,"good steady job if you can deal with the favoritism, bias management, culture of only friends get promoted...etc.  This job is generational therefore individuals get promoted based on their last name."
good,"Enjoyed working independently and as a team. "
good,"I work a 7-3 work day. It laid the foundation for my future job with Diamond Offshore. It taught me the basics of Trouble Shooting Electrical Problems"
good,"Treatment of injuries/minor suturing, burn care, cardiac emergencies. "
good,"work is very pre-determined for engineering, and very few engineers at this company have the ability to innovate or be creative due to the constricting nature of the navy nuclear propulsion program. work life balance is great, and benefits are solid, but upper-middle management is disconnected from employee needs, and career advancement is extremely difficult without political relationships"
good,"Decent place to work with great benefits. Management can get out of hand at times. All in all I would recommend, it is a well paying job."
good,Great work environment. Good people to work with. Many opportunities. Very challenging and rewarding. Many skills acquired.
good,I learned a lot with this company but the company don't give you a lot of room to grown. The company has been slowly going down hill for a while now and conditions aren't getting any better.
good,This program will not allow me to pass up this part of the process of applying for a job. So I have to type in 20 words here to get past this part of the process.
good,"Good work. Nice people to work around. Timely work, a lot of micro-mangament. Good pay and benefits. Hot during the summers and cold during the winter."
good,"Very low manpower, which requires personnel to work long hours (12 to 16) daily. This is a practice that has been going on for years. The job is not difficult, but rather easy. However, with all the hours on the job, the quality of life suffers and/or is challenging."
good,It was a very good place to work. The employees were very nice and helpful. I felt I was a important part of the team. We designed the sound equipment for the aircraft carriers. I also got to work with the teams in damage control.
good,Multiple opportunities for employment. Average starting pay with minimal raises after hiring on. Raises are not based upon job performance and are evenly spread whether an employee performs well or not.
good,"work as flexible hours"
good,I enjoyed working here and would recommend Newport News Shipbuilding to anyone. I learned some good skills while employed there.
good,"i worked here for two years, i wasn't to bad if you don't mind the hard physical labor and not the greatest working conditions."
good,overall fine place to work. however management is in need of training. was laid off with little to no warning and no compensated at all
good,Good coworkers.  Learned a lot.  I enjoyed going on to the ship to check systems.  Was allowed to work at own pace.  Worked way up from electrician on board ship to a marine designer.  The company paid for my degree.
good,"•	Build and restore metal  and wood  furnishings  for commercial and residential "
good,"Newport News Shipbuilding is a great place to work.  It offers fun and rewarding opportunities for growth.  I enjoyed the co-workers and management teams. The hardest part of the job was to organize and process ship check traveling, but with the help of the team made the job manageable and successful.  The atmosphere was secured and pleasant.  I enjoyed the brainstorming & fellowship group meetings."
good,Long hours & few benefits to there hourly employees. Need a lot of changes in upper management & how they treat their fellow co-workers.
good,"This was a great position to work hand and hand with engineering, craftsmen, quality and the Navy. "
good,"The negative in working with this company comes with the positive.  It is a large company with thousands of employees.  Therefore, you meet a lot of different people."
good,Nice place to work to gain experience. Recently there has become lots of micro managing which is causing employees to look elsewhere.
good,Enjoyed working for the company. Had the privilege of working for two outstanding bosses who were flexible with my schedule when needed since I have small children. My jobs were not stressful but very productive.
good,Management was O.K. I work well with my co-workers. I enjoy working a job that will help our Navy protect our freedom. That is the best part of the job for me.
good,"Worked for several different supervisors all of whom were pleasure to work for. Excellent flexibility in working around an individuals personal needs (e.g. furthering education)."
good,Northrop Grumman was bought out by Huntington Ingalls. the same work environment and management styles. I learned a lot from this company and i enjoyed the people who i worked with the best
good,Working here afforded me the opportunity to go back to school and some financial stability. I had the opportunity of being a Make up Foreman for 8 months with my own crew. During that time I organized and managed to sell at least 50 spaces to the Navy with no issues. I received many praises for my work ethics and leadership.
good,"Again, a fairly ordinary construction job, maintain your wits about yourself, maintain a good pace on your work to adhere to expected quality and standards and pull your own weight, and things will go well for you."
good,electrician and blueprint reading installed and  repaired wiring.fixtures and equipment for all electrical service aborad shop and welder and welder inspector
good,welding be came my passion reguardless of how the day goes. Im good at it and i know it.If your company can find me a spot the company will gain a hard working quality employee with a good head on my shouders.
good,"Like all big work sites, 10k+, you work a small portion of the bigger project.  Reasonable safe work place, decent wages, and chance for advancements."
good,Work was challenging working in a shipyard. Safety is stressed among work personnel. The work is steady and always expanding.
good,This company needs a restructure. Lot of things I disagree with. They don't communicate an plan very well. They allow to much waste to go on. Safety will over look or actually walk over trip hazards to get someone for not having earplugs in. Over all they have lots of work an pay is good.
good,The company lacks good management to much red tape but good pay. The company provides a good learning experience  new skills  (computer and planning).
good,Great company to start an electrical career with room for growth and education in the electrical field. Pay to start not good but the benefits were great.
good,Its a good place to work.  If you have a good foreman and crew you can be productive and still have fun. There are a lot of good mechanics in the yard.
good,I used to be a homeroom electrical IE and now I perform Physical Progress Audits on the craft to make sure the government pays us accurately.
good,it was a nice place to work but some of the people were hard to work with.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of different job scopes by different upper managers. It was almost always mass confusion and the upper management was always wanting to push the limits on company policies and procedures. I have learned many different things, mostly to play it straight and abide by company policies and procedures. Most of the coworkers were easy to get along with and work beside. the hardest part of the job was to perform my assigned job scope to obey my upper management, but to also hold to the companies policies and procedures at the same time. I most enjoyed accomplishing my assignments and goals with overcoming all of the insecurities from upper management."
good,the best thing about here is it is steady and they offer education to their employees.
good,"Power driven work place.  Offers flexible time and has a 2 week shutdown for Christmas holiday.  A typical day at work is getting POC (point of contacts) to deliver their drawings, tech manuals...etc  to the Navy.  I've learned that the company value the employes."
good,this job is an awesome place to work for one reason only and that is u are a part of the construction of navy warships. other than that this place is a double standard kind of place.to many chiefs and not enough indians
good,"Up beat, continous learning experiance from pipe fitting to welding."
good,Good company to work for.  Good benefits and good working conditions.
good,"Electrical Hook-up (light"
good,"Politically biased, apathetic management, more than apathetic employees."
good,Mistreated I was in the wrong department supervisor was treating everyone differently so I hated working for him
good,I was employed with Ingalls for over 30 years and moved up from craft to Design Engineering through an Apprenticeship program. I enjoy working in design mechanical and pipe 2D and 3D design
good,"Typical day at work consists of supporting production technicians in the event of technical issues impacting construction."
good,I think this is great place to start your career. A lot of what you will do is not discipline specific. The job security is great.
good,"In uncertainty of our nations defense spending, shipbuilding is taking a hard hit. There are many layoffs giving uncertainty to employees, along with slim chance of advancement."
good,"After parking prior to shift start, a 30-45 minute walk is required to reach work area. Learned installation, hook-up, testing, and repair of several electrical/electronic systems within different phases of production. Management was poor overall with poor people skills and low knowledge bases on work performed at times. The hardest part was working in extreme heat, cold, &/or rainy conditions. The most enjoyable part was paid holidays off and paid vacation."
good,"Working at Newport News Shipbuilding (NNS) was an overall interesting experience. Being an apprentice within the company, I was rotated through-out the entire yard to perform different objectives on a standard three month schedule. The rotations allowed me to understand the entire shipbuilding process and also allowed me to network with a wide array of individuals. In the last two years of my apprenticeship I was considered an advanced apprentice whom operated as a contract cost estimator. Being on the ""salary-side"" on the shipyard allowed me to better understand the company operations and importance of rules and regulations. No matter where inside NNS I was working, the co-workers were all great people and ready to help should I need it."
good,"I can't tell you what it's like because there are so many different things to do and see in the shipyard.  It all depends on your perception and your job.  The main thing I can say is that there are great opportunities working for Huntington Ingalls: NNS.  Just have to stay positive, keep an open mind, and be thankful and grateful for what you have."
good,Out in the elements for the most part. Co-workers are descent. The hardest part is the heat and lack of fresh air on the boats.
good,the shipyard isnt that great. this place is very bias. If you know someone higher up in the company its easier to get ahead.
good,very short breaks and no good compensation whats so ever lunches was really short
good,Strict rules short breaks . Interesting work but no job secerity
good,"Meet in designated meeting area go over company updates. Then proceed to work area and perform daily job duties, install pipe, hangers, test system, clean system, cut pipe, grind , bevel, ect...."
good,"Cold in winter, hot in summer, dirty all the time."
good,"Loved working in the sheet-metal department as a combination mechanic/welder as there was always room to grow and expands skills and knowledge. Moved over to the welding(only) department for the overtime but am now stuck here welding UT's on superstructures using FCAW and Sub Arc with very little variety or challenge. Once in the ""x18"" welding department anyone who works there is stuck there. I wouldn't mind at all except that there are no options provided to expand or grow and am peaked out with the sector I am in. Good co-workers. Hardest part of the job is no new challenge. Most enjoyable part is doing something I am great and proficient in."
good,A great start after leaving the military. The Management teams are a bit weird but a good place to work when there is nothing else out there.
good,"Daily fuuctions include Cost monitoring, cost control migation, cost anaysis. Daily actives also include budgeting, standard development, progress auditing. Craft interaction and craft assistance is also a daily function"
good,Ok company to work for but hard to move up or grow. Does not foster young talent. Hires a lot of retired or ex military.
good,"I had positive experience working for NNSBDDC. I was a cooperative education engineering student, but I learned a lot and they paid well."
good,i enjoyed my job as a painter it was a hardworking environment i was recently laid off for reasons unknown
good,"The people are not bad, but the management is not the best. Benefits and pay are ok. The union there is absolutely the worst DO NOT JOIN!!! Difficult to advance especially if you have a specialized job."
good,If you are looking for a stable work environment is the place guaranteed 40 hrs a week with possible overtime. Raises every 6 months for those under pay grade 10. So your rate goes up quickly.
good,The work culture at Ingalls is a relaxed and family like work environment.  Typical work day is 7:30 am to 4:00 pm.  Off on most holidays and there is a two week shutdown at year end.
good,"Be prepared to be cold when it's cold out. Hot when it's hot out and most of all to get dirty. The hardest thing about working here is the environment in which you work. Also, plan on getting to work early to find parking or use HRT."
good,"If being able to thrive in todays workforce, we need to provide better support of employees. Give salary more PTO or Sick time, allow for change in the way we do things."
good,Good Apprenticeship Programs.  They have a lot of skilled employees there. Good place to work and support your family. They have decent benefits to take advantage of. Met a lot of quality people but also a lot not so quality people.
good,"Started on day shift for 3 months got switched to swing shift where finding time to do anything after or before work to wind down was rough."
good,Its a decent place to start off your career. The salary is fair and it is located in a fairly affordable city. They need to spend more time training new hires.
good,The pay was great and had great times there. I didn't have a chance to more up. So supervisor will hold you back from moving up. We got paid every week so that was good. Lots and Lots of over time so you can make a good living.
good,"The business side is fairly good: they care about worker safety and provide development resources; however, the shipyard environment is neither ergonomic nor progressive."
good,"Effectively function as a highly versatile craftsman responsible for fabricating, assembling and installing a wide variety of components on Surface Ships, including, but are not limited to ventilation systems, metal joiner bulkheads and framing, furniture, cabinetry, lockers, ladders and handrails, foundations, weapons spaces and wet spaces"
good,Pay was excellent.  Vacation was also. You get 2 weeks of for Christmas and New Year's with 6 paid vacation days. Micro management.  Good insurance plan
good,"Plenty of opportunity to advance your career. You need to learn how to work the system to make it work in your favor. Pay is lower for some roles, particularly in regards to IT and Engineering areas."
good,the culture is changing to be diverse and inclusive. Learn a lot from different people and perspective. You meet a lot of people who have been there all their lives.
good,"Don't have any problems with life, cars, injuries, or anything that will prevent you from showing up to work. Doesn't matter what the reasoning is or if it was approved or not, it still counts against you especially if you are in your 120 day probationary period."
good,.This company provides jobs for people and their families in need of such economical circumstances such as they provide. Huntington Ingalls is a workplace.
good,"Good work culture, poor management. The middle management consist of people that were put in manage by a buddy system, because of this, the work and employee and managers relationships makes the job hard if you are not in good graces with that job.The person in charge of the job sometimes is not knowledgeable of the job, and the job is ran to that person intellect withe the influence of their values and culture. This cause a lot of problems on the job. This can be seen through documented labor relation documents. you can see a pattern of the problems that are documented .The same problem are reported over and over again but swept under the rug. the money is good so people have to make the cope or move on, but must are forced out."
good,Overall good group of people to work with.  People are vested in the product and its importance to the NAVY.  The majority of the coworkers are great to work with.  Some dead weight workers but management knows who gets the work done.  Its a government contractor so lots of red tape to make things complicated.  Big push for diversity and inclusion which means that sometime people are picked not because of what they know or can do but rather on their uniqueness.  Potential to advance just because generation of shipbuilders is retiring.  When you are hired don't expect big raises.  Working in the yard is hard with very few places to park.
good,Huntington ingalls is a great place to start a career you will develop a bond with the people here. management is not the best. its a huge company and the tend to lose track of the fact that we are all humans
good,It wasn’t a bad just just fast pace and production if your a welder out there you always have to carry your tools everywhere you go and you always have to keep track of them because other people will take them
good,"Besides the mile walk in and the mile walk out, the workload is balanced depending on the type of ship and system you are assigned to. A negative would be that you are pulled off assignments and thrown into new assignments without prior notice."
good,Ingalls was a temporary job from the beginning. It had it's pros and cons. The experience I gained there was priceless. The navy ships can be built more efficiently.
good,"Very fast deadlines and push to meet deadlines. Enjoyable atmosphere, albeit some miscommunication and contradictory statements. Learned about budgeting and managing time and the importance of it."
good,I worked in apprentice program in electrical for two years straight out of high school. Went to Junior college at night learning a trade. Worked in extreme conditions from time to time.
good,"not the worst, not the best as claimed, there a lot of good promises to be made, sounds really good, but if your not with a certain crowd, advancement is fleeting"
good,"As someone coming from a company with better benefits and chasing money, I managed to get into a trade that cut overtime, and took a benefit cut top work in a much harder job where I ultimately didn't make any more money than my last job. Don't come if you like paid time off, your first years won't have any. Shutdown has unpaid days. All in all not what I had hoped. On one hand I could do it but on the other hand I could also just go somewhere else."
good,"Most work indoors, ship within walking distance. Work in engineering always changing. Lots of people to work with and learn from."
good,"Hunting Ingalls provide lots of different programs to better yourself. Huntington Ingalls also has room for advancement, if you work hard and come to work."
good,The demanding work culture compounds with infantile management style to create a high school like work environment with a twist of Political correctness and hypocrisy that leads one to believe that if these people aren't definitely working in cahoots with the demon world they cant be far off. <<--Run on sentence but a pouring out of ones heart.
good,"A typical day would usually begin at 7am and continue on till 4. Traffic from my home to work was a struggle, but the environment and the work that would be conducted was kind of interesting."
good,"CMSD is a good place to get work experience and move on. Had a very different time working it that environment with a MBA and did not awarded a management position.  Management did not keep their promise to promote me after I helped turn around the pipe fitting department."
good,dirty work. hard work but rewarding.  Get to work on interesting systems.  large facility. Union environment.  Long walk into work
good,"This company always have something going on at all times. Production is very important and safety. A typical day at work doing a morning safety check with your foreman and getting your job assignment and report to your job. I learned a lot about budget, scheduling, and material. There are different levels of management at Newport News Shipbuilding from engineering to construction supervisor and being that he company employs almost 20,000 people you are always working with different people which we call mates. The hardest part of the job is learning new procedures which changes all the time cause you might be use to doing a procedure one way for years and in a days time everything can change. The most enjoyable  part about the job is watching a new construction project come together."
good,shipyard work. place to take care of my family. earn a good living
good,is a stable work place with average compensation.  large company with a high number of employees.
good,"I learned self control, what to do and not to do since i grew up there. not too good on second chances. Just like any place there are great spots there and there are bad spots there"
good,If you get in with the right group it's good. A lot of back-stabbing going on at that place. It's a great place to work if all you care about is job security and good pay.
good,"Amazing how infusing carbon fibers to balsa wood can make a product that is ten times lighter,and three times stronger than steel.A amazing group of people to work with."
good,Company continues to grow on diversity.  it is very appreciative of its Veterans and military cultures. Contines to grow and bring more pieces to the puzzle.
good,"Great place to learn all the good and bad in life. Not a bad place to work at, just make sure you mix with the correct people or you will be taken advantage of. Show up to work and you will not have a problem. Being positive is the key when working here, if you are not mentally strong and fall to negativity than it will be a rough journey"
good,"HII is a good place to work if you're young and just starting out of high school or college to get some experience. But, depending on your job depends on how fairly you are comensated. A painter is paid just as much as a welder due to the union that runs the shipyard. My most major complaint is that I can make more else where, but this is a stable place to work, and if the opportunity for advancement is there I would take it."
good,"Having younger bosses has helped in my development as an engineer. Days vary, from really busy to calm. Hardest part of the job is getting valuable information from people because there is a lot of run around answers. Finding a place to park can be hectic."
good,"Overall, HII is a great company to work for whether you are just starting out or looing for a career change. I do however think there is to many branches between a worker and there top management. sometimes 6 or 7 tiers of people / channels have to be gone through and what originally is an issue could be interpreted completely different from when it started. Communication is one of the companies largest down falls."
good,"In my 12 years of working here, I was able to accomplish many things, but the hours overwhelmed me. While working 12 hour shifts on and off and pursuing a degree, the long hours were a strained. I couldn't really have a balanced in life but I definitely enjoyed my time there."
good,Company is  a good place to work for taking care of the family. Employees work hard and paid less. Supervisor and management is horrible. Union does not support employee at all. No advancement for employees only if you are friends to management and abide by faulty rules made up by management.
good,"Great Place to get experience. Parking sucks you may have to pay monthly if you don't plan on getting in at 5:30a to wait on a parking spot, the parking lots fill up fast. The work is steady. My mangers are awesome, though I have heard horror stories about other managers in the Engineering department."
good,Good place to learn a trade or trades. Good apprenticeship program although it takes 4 years to top out to journeyman. Very hard work and very hot but a good place to learn for life and many trades.
good,"I enjoyed my time here at the Newport News Shipbuilding. It did have its moments where I didn’t feel like being there, but I haven’t had one job where I didn’t say, “Man, I just don’t feel like doing this, today”. Time here at the shipyard really helped  improve my welding skills. Now, every job has its downsides. One of the down sides in the yard consists of spies. People who watch you and tell on you. Being new to the company, it could be really difficult to tell who is who. One more thing. If you are not liked by your supervisor, they will attempt to get rid of you, by any way they can. Even if you’ve done nothing wrong. And if you don’t know your ish, they’ll win every time."
good,"Limited opportunities for growth, but a good work environment.  Treated employees good a people but not a lot of support on the professional side of ensuring people are matched best with their skills."
good,"Coming in brand new, most were ready to help me learn my trade. Management is off and on. Some supervisors are very easy to get along with, some are not. Vacation/Time off is terrible. It took me one whole year to have any paid time off. But the money is good. It's all about what's important to you."
good,Lots of computer work and communication.  The hardest part of the job is adapting to different group's needs.    The most enjoyable part of the job is walking through the office and learning what other employees are doing.
good,Standard equal opportunity across the company should be fair. Its a company built more on who you know than what you show. Crating what we refer to is the good old boy system.
good,"Typical day at work is attending a daily stand-up meeting, developing code based on user stories, and publishing code to web server for testing. I learned a lot about .NET and web servers. Management tries very hard to be transparent, which is nice."
good,A good place to work. Benefits are great. Career advancement limited.  Advancement within departments are limited.  Company seems to hire outside of the yard for new positions.
good,"The business and the way the needs of the government is changing. "
good,"A typical work day includes interacting with everyone from hourly employees to  upper management Superintendents. I learn something new everyday. My current manager is easy to talk to, he will help as much as he can. The hardest part of my job is at the end of a module. When it's time to ship part of a submarine. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the work that I've planned come to life. Watching a complete U.S Navy vessel get delivered to the Navy."
good,The pay is good to point they don't day you for all the hours you work because foremen are only allowed to get so many hours of over time.  They do a lot of rework
good,Great place to work and to meet people. The management set double standards and do not walk the talk. This was evident in the company's cost reduction for the layoffs.
good,"Dirty Shipyard barely maintaining any kind of cleanliness. Management hates hourly workers, hourlys hate engineers and all around everyone hates everyone else."
good,"overall okay, type of work is compensated with pay. comfortable work environment. Not too many perks otherwise. best to go into apprentice school if working hourly."
good,"Provided concurrences on engineering reports for work package insertion on Virginia Class Submarine program."
good,"Benefits are excellent, good company discounts and use to be 100% paid tuition reimbursement. Unfortunately, job security depends on the amount of contract work that is available. In 6 years I saw 2 layoffs and a furlough. Career advancement is really about who you know."
good,"Really nice work environment, hard to move about the company at times. Learned alot about shipbuilding. Collaborated with other department to get the mission accomplished."
good,"NNS provides a diverse set of challenges each business day. Parking is a major issues for employees.Good benefits, has pros and cons as any job does."
good,"I have been able to sharpen my Recruiting and Leadership skills by working such a vast array positions and special projects, managing teams and tackling very hard to fill positions. I am comfortable  with customers at all management levels, and am comfortable with candidates at all levels due to the diversity of work I have been responsible for."
good,"Great co workers."
good,"The shipyard is a very secure job, however, they have poor management.  You will see that the atmosphere (depending on your location) is very laid-back and relaxed.  They allow you to keep flexible schedules."
good,"Great, very knowledgeable, co-workers make this job worth the while. Micromanagement and lack of knowledge from some supervisors is a bit of a challenge, but do-able. The hardest part of the job is actually finding a parking spot prior to work (28,000 workers over three shifts)."
good,"The most important that I learned is to build navy ship, and coast guard ship that protects our nation. in the electrical part it was different from regular industrial electrical system. The hardest thing there was the heat and hot weather."
good,Your day starts with a nice long walk to your job site where you wait for 6 o clock so you can get your task sheet and start your day
good,"I have learned how to leverage my project management, resourcefulness and time management skills in order to meet deadlines and accomplish various engineering tasks."
good,A typical work day involve going over job sheet and following safety procedure.
good,The work is available and if you are hard working you can have this job for years. Management is very unorganized.
good,"Responsible for storage, handling, and work done to equipment designated reactor plant controlled material.  Included following termination and hookup of cables to equipment.  "
good,"Great atmosphere, but pays sucks. Amsec is able to benefit from retiree's. If you are a none retiree it's a great place to gain experience."
good,the management is good. the co-workers are very supportive. the company has no much opportunities to grow
good,"Was advancing quickly and learning a lot until I was shuffled off to another department and shift for no sensible reason, and then it happened again two months later. Highly frustrating when I'm trying to build my career as a welder. "
good,"great co to work with if shipyard would not be closing. work hours were ideal, overtime was abundant and management was helpful."
good,"The company has existed for over 100 years and is stable in that fact alone. Up until recently, most of the people I know working felt there was always room for growth and potential for advancement. The company was once owned by Northrop Grumman and has since spun off into its current name. I gave the company a 3 out of 5 due to its inability to keep up with the ever changing technology. Other than that the most enjoyable part of any job lies in knowing how every task we do collectively facilitates the safety and wealfare of our military vessels."
good,"HII has given me an excellent opportunity to move into the OE world. I am challenged daily with succession planning, mentor programs and Stengths Coaching. My leadership here has been open, willing to let me grow into new roles and develops each person based on that person's strengths."
good,It is a good job to have. You are able to take care of your family as needed. A typical day at Ingalls is waking up early to beat the busy traffic. Finding a parking spot that is close enough to the gate. You have to grab your tools and work.
good,I miss my job but I hated going to work at work I was stressed I did my job and I did my job well loved what I did but doing my job was not not good enough I'm the type of man oon care if I'm liked long enough I'm respected and I'll always show everyone else respect I'm not here to be your friend are in your group I'm here to do a job sure I font mind the friendly co-worker conversation a
good,The work here is very physical and the younger and in shape you are in a much better you will climb the corporate ladder while working here. Safety  is also a big issue because so many dangerous activities are going on around you all the time.
good,Great Company to work for Changing culture. The shipyard is going through a digital tranformation to change the direction of the company. We have been in buisness 130 years
good,"Overall nice place to work. However compensation is not up to the cost of living. If you would like a place to work with someone job security, Huntington Ingalls is fine but to advance even with a degree is a little difficult."
good,Good job if your local and have a family. The apprenticeship program is a great program to get into. Lot of overtime when it's available. Nice paid vacations.
good,A typical day at work is full of adventure and learning new things constantly. Very energetic people and work. The work is very fluid and keeps me on my toes.
good,Decent place to work decent pay. Management is fair multiple levels of checks and balances very focused on first time quality overall not a bad place to work
good,"Good place to work. "
good,"Low pay, decent benefits. The managers I most recently worked for are amazing, but have also had cut throat ones in the past, luck of the draw! Great job security"
good,"Navigate the ship to locate your job site. Set up in accordance to your job tasks(finding welding equipment and proper tools). I have learned how to become quite adept at using a mirror to weld, carbon arcing, fire safety, environmental awareness,and dangers of confined spaces. Management is ok. Some are super awesome and go out of their way to help you get along in life and grow, some will be hurdles. Hardest part of the job is dealing with extreme heat and lack of air movement while being surrounded by people who don't know a hot work trade at all and are terrified by it. The best part of the job is seeing the ship complete and see her float and move under her own steam."
good,"For 131 years, the ships built at Newport News Shipbuilding, like the American shipbuilders who built them, have served our nation in peace and war, in times of adversity and in times of abundance. Our legacy of “Always Good Ships,” includes the design, construction, overhaul and repair of more than 800 ships for the U.S. Navy and commercial customers."
good,great place to learn and grow. Cannot receive experience like this anywhere else. much room to move up in company. co-workers are friendly
good,It was an okay experience working there. Typical 7am-330pm office lifestyle. Deadlines are important and learning is fundamental.
good,"The original company being bought out and changing names twice from Northrop Grumman, Huntington Ingalls and last Ingalls Shipbuilding, put the Avondale yard at the bottom of the list an put us 1st to be laid off. On a more positive note the Safety program at the Avondale yard seemed to be actually began to improve in my opinion a great deal over the 7 year period I was the from what I remember accidents decreased like in heat related incidences’. The overall attitude of both Salary and hourly workers was good, even with 5000 employees. It was still like a family overall. P.S. Ships usually left out of Avondale on time and under budget I helped build and test the Fiber Optic Local area Net work on bored 5 ships and did testing and Corrections of both Fiber and Copper Networks."
good,"NNSB is a fantastic place for a welder or fitter to become an expert at their trade. Building an aircraft carrier or submarine means various different tight spaces and high jobs to work in, and incredibly tedious and difficult jobs requiring mirrors and half shields, that will only make you better at what you do."
good,I would get my job assignment and go to my job site location and inspect what i have to do and begin my job my co-workers was all young men some thought of me as a big sister and some thought of me as being in the way cause they couldn't talk they wanted the thing i loved more than pay day was just meeting new and different people
good,"The job wasn't too difficult. Upper management just seemed chaotic. I rarely saw my boss, our department ran ourselves. Overall not too bad for a student intern position."
good,"The pay and benefits are excellent. However management is often uncaring, critical, not straight forward. Issues often go unadressed until employees explode. Work life balance needs attention."
good,Huntington Ingalls has adapted the policy of hiring managers with no working knowledge of the department they are managing. Their philosophy is the manager only has to manage people and doesn't need job knowledge. This does not help the people they are managing when crucial decisions need to be made.
good,Workers are very co-operative there but the management seems like they don't have time for the workers there and they don't seem to think it is ok to take time out for the workers either
good,"Good group of people to work for. Not too stressful, flexible hours, unfortunately, no room for advancement. No raises (including cost of living) for 4 years now."
good,"Although the company continues to increase the cost of benefits increases each year and privileges continue to be taken away over time, the environment is pleasant and upbeat in the nuclear overhaul section of the company.  The environment in the nuclear overhaul department nearly makes up for the increased cost of benefits and the decreased vacation/sick time."
good,"pipe fitting"
good,"I resolve issues that the user community has, I work with IT on developing new or improving current processes thought out the Newport News Shipyard. I work under low supervision and provide my manager with a weekly update of issues or new developments dealing with Material Forecasting. I work in a very laid back environment with little stress. The only issue with the area that I work in is, that I have no back up and it's hard to move to a different position. You are not allowed to apply for a promotion at the shipyard you have to wait until your time have been served in your current rank."
good,"In this position, while working as a security officer at Newport News Shipyard, I was able to work alongside of the President of the Union. It was a well rewarding position."
good,A typical day starts at 6 am with a quick briefing. After that you go work just like any other job. You have to be careful not to be caught slacking off or you will get the boot. They are very serious about working and missing time.
good,Company has a lot of potential but seems to have s lack of initiative for reaching that potential. The company does a good job at listening to employees but only acts on the occasion 50% of the time.
good,You have to be a special kind of person to work at Huntington Ingalls. They have great benefits and compensation but it can be a stressful work environment.
good,"It's a great place to start a career with plenty of advancement opportunities.  Upper management demands a lot of unrealistic goals and lower management has their hands tied most of the time.  If you get in the right group, a day can be extremely easy, other groups have the tendency to get overloaded with work."
good,It's hard but fair it gave me stability for my family while employed gave me the opportunity to improve in life taught me the skills needed to become the 1st class painter blaster I am currently
good,Work is steady and confidential must be able to follow schedules and procedures verbatim. Work on ships and submarines inspecting the work of other trades. Working as a team is a must. Must be able to adapt to environment and weather.
good,"A typical workday in the shipyard for a shipfitter goes as follows: "
good,Very hands on work environment. Fast paced challenging duties. Helpful coworkers when needed. Supervisors could be a bit more organized and prepaired.
good,i learned all my shipyard experience at huntingthon ingalls
good,Job is great for those who are willing to stay close to the area. There's great opportunities to grow and move up like the apprenticeship program they provide.
good,The shipyard is a fair permanent job. I found something new so I went for what I thought was better . Newport News Shipbuilding is real big on safety and missing time
good,Overall this is a good company to start a career in but after being here for 10 years. The company is at a decline. Advancement in the company is at a low.
good,I was a pipe fitter here and it was no walk in the park everyday on the job but the pay made it worth while. It gets really hot on those ships so bring lots of water!
good,"Upper management doesn't care about the ""little people"" all they are about is getting the job done on time so they can receive their bonuses. And the traffic is a nightmare!"
good,Typical day at work expect to be watched many times throughout the shift. Expect to be audited at any moment. Always follow procedures. NEVER miss time.
good,"Parking sucks. You must be in the parking lot 2 hours before your shift to get a spot. "
good,"This job is nothing glorious, but it is what you make of it. I personally enjoy my job, but it is not for everybody. Don't come in with the mindset you're going to make easy money, because it's all hard and one time or another."
good,"My review is a little on the negative side.  It is a good paying job, no question and they have a decent benefits package.  The company only offers medical coverage but the dental and vision are through the unions.  The biggest problem is the click or the FBI (Friends, Brothers, In-laws) network.  It is very hard to break through that barrier for an outsider.  Another huge issue is the quality of work being put out.  The president of the company preaches quality first but the senior ship and craft management stress schedule first so quality goes straight out the window.  The reason for this is because there is no competition, Ingalls is the only shipyard that builds LHA/LHD's and LPD,s.  The straw that broke the camels back for me was when I was on the mast looking at a cable that did not have a connector on it and a craft superintendent calling me a liar from her desk.  She kept arguing with my boss calling me a liar instead of sending someone up to check it out.  We wasted a half a work day going round and round with her on this before she finally sent someone to look.  The whole time I was standing there with the cable in my hand, no connector on the end.  this is just one small example of how mismanaged the shipyard truly is.   "
good,"The shipbuilding industry is different at Huntington Ingalls. There is more to focus on than just rip out and installing. There are more areas of interest for an individual to focus on. Workers can become more involved in new construction, overhaul, or nuclear work. There are vast opportunities for workers to advance within this company."
good,Defense contractors are downsizing due to congressional budgets.
good,Its a decent job if you can look past the horrible parking and the clear favoritism displayed around the waterfront. The company preaches safety and quality but refuse to spend money to upgrade outdated tools and processes.
good,The shipyard is a ok place to work if you are in the right department and have a fair supervisor. Supervisors think they know everything because of the triangle on their hat.
good,"This is a large company of 23,000 workers (currently), so a typical day at work varies widely based on the job.  For me, it is typically a day of firefighting.  It is hard to be proactive and get ahead of the work because there are so many flaws and problems to attack and resolve.  "
good,"Parking is bad, management is not responsive to the employees. Layoff are common. Worker conditions are poor. Management don't listen to their employee's input."
good,"It was not a bad company to work for."
good,"Maintaining written and verbal communication between design engineers, supply department, the Navy and the various sections installing the electrical shipboard equipment. Reviewing drawings for compliance and tracking delivery of equipment to meet ships schedule."
good,Will be testing and overseeing work conditions on the deckplates up close and personal. Very enjoyable to lead teams through tests. High stress and pace job environment and long hours will be expected. Overtime pay helps make this easier.
good,They teach you your trade and also have schooling for you to advance in other skills and trades. The environment can be stressful at time but overall a good one there’s lots of learning to do at this job and lots of helpful staff
good,Did not like the work or the people I worked with tried to move to other departments and never got anywhere I tried to move to a different shift and never got anywhere
good,Great starter job right out of school. Great experience and discipline taught. I would recommend this job for those coming straight out of high school and need a trade.
good,honorable and tough work buy pay and benefits were excellent. supervisors and foreman had poor communication and were lazy. work was fun and diverse. no real chances for growth within company
good,"Very little opportunity for overtime work. Good coworkers however. Definitely keep your personal business away from the workplace. Some of the upper management of course are unfair in the division of overtime, workloads."
good,A typical day at the shipyard consist of clocking in getting the day started. The upper management team have their morning briefings and what their expectatiojns or goals are to be met for that day then the mechanics and the supervisor for that particular crew meets in the morning also for morning briefings pertaining to the job assigned for the day and also preparing material for the job. I can say that the shipyard is a good place to work especially for students coming out of high school that they can get exeperience in a trade or even joining the apprenticeship program to further thier education. The hardest part of the job is at the end of the day when you're trying to clean and gather your material from the job youve recently worked and also going home in one piece brcause the shipyard in my opinion is a dangerous place to work if you're not aware of your surroundings.The most enjoyable part of the job is when accompish the task for that day...Confidence is the key.
good,"If you don't have a skillset, rainbow-flavoured work-history or a college education then you can appreciate the initial wages, available training and benefits this company offers."
good,Its a good place to work but if you move into management then they work you 80 hours a week and only pay 56. I would go back if the pay scale was better.
good,"typical ship yard environment, expect the usual favoritism between supervisor and dirt bags kiss up worker.  i would work here again the pay was decent"
good,"Good company but work life experience is something to be desired.  The scheduling you never have a warning as to when you might be scheduled to work 12 on 12 off 7 days a week for 6/7 months in a row."
good,Working at this company you get to learn a lot about shipbuilding. My co-workers are dedicated to doing the best work possible. The hardest part about job is the varying weather conditions. The most enjoyable part my job is seeing a warship completed.
good,"I like my job at Newport News Shipbuilding, but the company had to downsize and are letting thousands of employees go. I need something more certain and stable. great supervisor. My co workers were good people too. Best parts of the day would be at having a finished product to look at and be proud of. Just too many secrets going on and leaving the employees in the dark, but that's business."
good,"The shipyard is an excellent place to work at. Most the people I have come across with are excellent people to do business with. However, being a company that solely relies on the Department of Defense and if we will get certain contracts, job security is on edge at times. "
good,"Work is sometimes challenging mentally and physically but in time you get use to the labor"
good,"Working a Newport News Shipbuilding as a mechanical engineer is very different than other departments.  Mechanical engineers are required to be involved in all aspects of designing, purchasing, maintaining, testing and installing equipment.  The hardest but most enjoyable part of the job is that from day to day one may have to adjust to what aspect of the project one has to work on for that day."
good,During morning muster we get our jobs for the day. Normally working through all different types of weather ensuring much of the job is done to spec.
good,What i learned from Huntington Ingalls is how work with many kinds of different people for a common goal
good,Love working there. Most co-workers considered as friends. Also felt that it was understood that quality was expected in all jobs planned and completed.
good,huntington Ingalls is a great place to work for. they have great benifits and a good salary. the work is sometimes hard but mostly easy work.
good,I make sure all contract suppliers have their representations & certifications (by law) updated so our buyers can purchase from them.
good,"Good work environment but Ingalls definitely needs to figure out how to manage their workforce, and manage the actual work they have under contract. Hiring and laying off like a revolving door is never a good thing for employees or the company."
good,Very great company to work for I learned a lot working for this company. The people are great the management team okay. I love coming to work everyday. Great company!
good,I loved my job and much better I loved doing my job feeling apart of something so important. Navy ships wow I felt I had a purpose and a meaning in life I was proud to tell my son your helps bridge ships for the navy
good,Huntington ingalls is a very great way to start your career off if you have no idea what you wanna do. I highly recommend this company as a good way to make money
good,"Offsite meeting at restaurant with management/employees."
good,"HII is a large organization. There are many contracts and opportunities there, so experiences are based solely on the staff working within those specific opportunities. "
good,Use this facility to get your training in a trade (the training is second to none) and use it to unlock major opportunities in your career. Make the most of your opportunities.
good,"Overall, great culture, good people and okay leadership.  Very laid back place.  If I had one con it will be there slow hiring process and HR's worship of college degrees over relevant experience."
good,"a typical day working at the shipyard is boring at first because you park your car then you get on the bus then you walk into the gate but the fun stuff happens we start work on the ship or subs. I learned how to use heavy power tools and other basic tool. management is ok but it could to be better, workplace culture is fun because you get to know your co workers. is find parts and getting tools that you need.is the lunch break."
good,It’s a good place if you know someone that works here and you want to move up. It’s a good place to work especially if you don’t don’t get your feelings attached to it or the employees.
good,Hard work for the money. Come in do your job. Just do your job. Work as an team. Long hours sometimes. Good pay when starting off as an new welder....
good,A regular work day we would get our assignment every morning and go to our area and get our materials and plan of action ready. They were very understandable especially when I had just started and my father passed away. They gave me the time that I needed off and didn't count it against me. The hardest part of the job was getting into certain locations to work or re-work because another trade would take down your materials and you had to go back through and redo the work.
good,"Good company but need to streamline some antiquated processes. Shut down in December is a great.  However, all Federal Holiday's should be observed by a federal contractor."
good,"Over all good company to work for, there are some managers that need training and take things personal.  I would recommend the company for any one who is looking to gain knowledge of a trait."
good,"In 44 years I have worked various jobs, 1st in a mail room, next an electrical apprenticeship , trades training, then on to supporting engineers. goo place to earn a living"
good,They were not very competitive to the other industries in the area and had poor job advancement. There can also be mandatory back shift work at a moments notice
good,"Originally worked for Camber Corporation before Huntington brought them out fall last year.  I've been with them for 6 years, fairly decent company so far so good.  Only issue is that i haven't received a pay increase in 3 years."
good,"Loved my job,  I just couldn't survive off of the small amount of pay.  I didn't like the temporary badges.  some days waiting for someone to let us in made me late.  all in all it was a good job!"
good,"It was hard work and sometime long hours.  Co workers were always willing to help and work together to solve issues from all departments.  Network, Desktop, AD, server etc."
good,"a typical day at work, what you learned, management, workplace culture, the hardest part of the job, the most enjoyable part of the job. Great place to work."
good,The work itself is good fulfilling work however you are not allowed to simple do your job for all of the additional activities that are forces on the employees forcing them to perform more and more activities in an already filled day causing undue stress and anxiety.
good,HII acquired Camber Corp last year and is in the process of a reorganization. Things are too fluid to say how solid the business will be in the short term.
good,This was a long time ago. I am sure most of the people that I worked with are no longer there. However the group of coworkers was very professional and easy to work with while I was employed there.
good,The money and insurance is great. I really don't know what else I need to put in here. It's steady work and easy to learn. Training is not a problem. Seriously.
good,"I have been with HII for 4 years and it has been a challenging experience.  I currently work multiple areas by myself that in the past have been 3-4 peoples responsibilities with no compensation.  Budget cuts, layoffs, no raises and minimal promotions has made for a bumpy ride.  The people are great, but there is little to no reward for hard work."
good,This was my first job that allowed me to take the helm and be a supervisor. It was an interesting experience interacting with leaders of this company.  Very rewarding.
good,"I enjoyed my time working for Huntington  Ingalls. My work days were very productive in managing time, tasks and responsibilities not only to myself but to my employees as well, when I was put into leadership. Management could have been better in taking care of our needs, checking on us more often and ensuring that we had the proper safety requirements present. my most enjoyable part of my job was being able to provide for my family and meeting people from different walks of life."
good,This is a company that offers a place for most skilled tradesmen. It teaches those tradesmen their craft and pulls even more character out of a person than it does his or her trade.
good,a typical day is very stressful day  collaborating with Engineering and Management all day resolving issues.  The hardest part of the job was constant changes/revisions.
good,"	Coordinated with operations, engineering, purchasing, and vendors to attain production goals."
good,"Very challneging place to work due to the complexity of the product we support.  Most days are a ""good"" challenge and drive you to be the best you can be.  However, the work load can become overwhelming at times and schedule and cost monsters come out to start pushing.  This place is very managment top heavy and loses focus on promoting a team work atmosphere."
good,Come prepared and ready to work. Do the best job you can with first time quality and professionalism. Work safe so you can go back home well with family members.
good,"Very large company with potential be a great place to work.  The employees are not counseled in their career path options.  Lacks a firm ""chain of command"""
good,A typical day at work consist of either setting up the torch or setting up a job to get to work. Your crew mates are cool and you have that one that thinks hes the foreman but hes really not
good,"You are just a number at NNS.  Hard to make it seems like your making a difference.  However, some of the hardest working people I have ever worked with"
good,"Fast paced, busy shipyard.  Lift minimum 30 lbs. Supervisor and coworkers work together to find adequate solutions."
good,"It was a good place to work for 11 years, I enjoyed it.  A big company with a lot of employees, hard to excel in certain departments, but it was a great experience."
good,Newport News Shipbuilding is a great place to learn and grow. There are always opportunities for promotion and rewards for curiosity. Sometimes they take on more employees then work and are forced to do a reduction in force.
good,Very family oriented workforce. Great company to build experience and work on interesting projects. Unfortunately limited advancement opportunities are available.
good,"Depending on the department your work in general work week is 40 hours a week. "
good,Overall great place to work. Military environment with great leadership. Very well organized and took very good care of both full time workers and contractors.
good,"This company is a great place to work for, with good benefits.  There is red tape and politics but that is to be expected.  I enjoy working with my colleagues and the management does its best to make us a part of a team."
good,morning starts with a memo from management about topics around the yard. we discuss our goal for the day while being safe and following procedures. assist fellow crew members with any issues that may come about. if my supervisor decides to take time off I step in as supervisor and run the day to day for the crew. insuring everyone is safe and ensures to look for those around them. the most challenging part of the day is how management comes around and makes it seem as though we aren't doing enough and try to down talk many of the employees. when most them didn't even do half the job the workers do. I enjoy working with my crew members and the support around when needed for the job.
good,Benefits are great.  Enjoyed being a part of working on the Gerald Ford ship.  Not so thrilled about being loaned out to another department and switching from day shift to nights.
good,"Ingalls was a pretty good place to work.  There was a lot to learn.  I was a apprentice.  My typical day consisted of fitting bulkheads, decks and various other fixtures on the ship for things that would be installed later.  My co-workers were really good.  They were always there to help you if you had a problem."
good,This job provides the opportunity to work in a variety of different departments and with a lot off different people.  It also provides the opportunity to work in a variety of work shifts
good,Company has a high standard of ethics and business conduct. Company offers a competitive total compensation package and offers a high level of job security.
good,"One of Hampton Roads' largest employers, NNS offers a diverse selection of career paths. Although I started my career as a structural engineer, as I earned my MBA, I was able to switch to systems engineering and take a less technical/more managerial path. During my 10+ years of employment at NNS, I've had a variety of opportunities: structural analysis, requirements management, risk management, test engineering, procedure writing, procurement, quality, finite element analysis, project management, document verification, metrics capture, etc."
good,This is a fast paced work environment which will challenge you on every level but greatly develop you as an individual.  Working here you are surrounded by rich tradition and history.
good,"Productive, friendly environment and co workers felt like family very fast."
good,A typical day could be something as simple as admin. paper work or as complex as aligning components to start a reactor have learned a great detail of information about S9G class submarines. The management at this job is ok there is not a lot of micro managing which is a plus. The hardest part of my job is sometimes going months without a day off. The most enjoyable thing about my job is that it is neither a 100% office job nor is it a job where you are on your feet all day.
good,"If you are a type of person that works hard or hardly works, there isn't much they do to create competition or spread the workload.  That being said, It is a top paying employer in Hampton Roads area and provides jobs for many.  Due to current budget battles in Washington, D.C., this industry (naval shipbuilding) has taken a substantial hit in their budget.  They are slowing down and I do not believe it is all their fault."
good,"* working in hot and cold tempters"
good,"this was a good place to work with good pay. i enjoyed working here, the type of work was physically damaging to the body"
good,Team work when needed and supplies always in place but there are some people that are annoying but still a good place to learn.
good,I worked at NNS for several years.  the job is very rewarding.  fellow coworkers are knowledgeable and very helpful.
good,"A large company with growth opportunities.  Typical day in the office is self-started and continues with little input from supervision.  Co-workers are from a diverse background, and contribute to unique work experiences."
good,I have come to the end of my career here due to the desire to be closer to my family while taking care of my aging parents.  God and family are the two most endeavors in my life presently.
good,Excellent Work/LIfe Balance. HII offers various opportunities for company growth. They offer numerous programs to encourage individuals to hone their personal talents.
good,"Everything is full time"
good,Huntington Ingalls Shipbuilding was a productive yet fun environment to work in.  I am able to utilize my engineering skills to help build Navy ships.  I feel as though I am helping out our armed forces.
good,"Great environment to learn, many knowledgeable employees willing to teach."
good,I loved working with my hands and troubleshooting circuit boards. I loved the atmosphere that my co-workers created and the sense of accomplishment I would get out of learning something new. The hardest part of the job was pulling cable lines across aircraft carrier units.
good,"This job is very active and hands on. Work with many different tools, testing instruments, and equipment. Co-workers are fun and hard-working."
good,I buy general procurement items for the navy and coast guard.
good,"A large company with many diverse opportunities for employment. Management looks to promote from within, but employees must be proactive and independent. Commitment to company is vital and long-hours can be frequent at times. Compensation starts high and curves out quickly. Great place to work for a lifetime if that's high on your list. The work can get dissatisfying."
good,"Typical day at the Shipyard would depend on the shift. We worked swing shift. I learned the procedures for printing payroll, blueprints for submarines and aircraft carriers, and the forms needed by supervisors for the entire Shipyard. Management was as needed. Co-workers were great to work with. The hardest part was adjusting to the different shifts and the travel distance from home. The most enjoyabe part was the stability and job security."
good,Ship building is a fun job. One must try working even if it may be for a few weeks.
good,I really love my job at Huntington Ingalls I feel they could pay more for white hats. I am only looking to leave because my family and I want to move back to where I am from.
good,"The quality of work life depends on the contract position, but HII has very competitive compensation.  The positions available where I am a contractor do not allow for advancement."
good,No company is perfect so there will always be good and bad associated with it. Overall it is a pretty decent place to work. The pay could be better in some instances.
good,"The shipyard is a place of a lot of networking and opportunities. There is pretty much something for everyone in the shipyard. It is very diverse, with many different background and cultures."
good,"Like all employers, you really get what ever you put in to this job. They have advancement opportunities to do different things if that's where you want to go with it. But if your content with what you do. You'll be welding forever lol.."
good,Plenty of work and a lot of fields to choose from.  Physically demanding at times!  Great Co-workers! Shutdown for Christmas to New Years is a nice benefit.  Hours are pretty convenient.  Parking sucks though.  They do provide HRT Bus privileges!
good,Horrible traffic but expected with 13k daytime employees arriving for the same start time (6am-2:30pm). Over worked management so positions aren't always filled  with most qualified applicants. Work tasks & expectations are very clear & upfront which is great. Working conditions can be harsh to say the least but the but the opportunity to be a part of building warships for the Navy & Coast Guard make it worth it.
good,NNS is a great place to work. There is great job security and plenty of opportunities for advancement. The one negative is the amount hours that are worked throughout the company. A lot is expected from their employees
good,This is a great place to work if your just starting out and not sure what you want to do in life yet. They offer great discounts for cell phones and car rentals.
good,"HII has two distinct sections within the company.  Those who are in the engineering/administration and those in the shipyard itself."
good,"Typical day was getting my job assignment, reviewing the files and drawings, collecting data and processing.  I learned they fundamentals of metrology.  Department management seems to work on The Two List principal.  There's a list that you want to be on and one you don't.  Verbalizing opinions and honest assessments tends to label you as negative which will land you on the list you don't want to be on.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the trades we support.  Jobs will be ""ready"" to survey but when you arrive to do the job you cant.  The most enjoyable part of the job is actually watching something come together from a piece of steel to a warship/submarine,  Its a good feeling that you get when something so massive goes out to defend the country."
good,Interning at Ingalls was a great experience. They make sure you get to see different areas of the shipyard and how they all operate. Supervisors also make sure you get good exposure to different areas of the company.
good,"I have worked here for about 7 months now and the work life balance "
good,"I think that this was one of the best jobs that I have ever had. Went from knowing nothing to defueling a nuclear reactor. The pay was good, my coworkers were great. Great place to learn a trade and the starting pay beats most in the area. You get 8 hours of PTO per quarter, which about the worst thing about the place."
good,the formen would tell me were to go and i would weld out pipe and pull to the next job now i learned alot about osha and there rules  the management was very poor i was ready for 230
good,"Don't get me wrong, HII is an amazing place to work in. I based my rating on the management that I'm under now. They seem out of touch on how to properly manage their personnel. at times very vindictive. If you voice a concern or opinion and they didn't approve of it, they will mess with you and give you a hard time. Again, HII is an amazing place to work in. you will see the best and the worst of work ethics in the shipyard. It's management and unproductive employees are the ones spoiling it for everyone. By the way, this is just our security dept. A dept. in a sea of many. Don't be discouraged with my post, for this is a  small portion of the big pictures."
good,Good place to work. Needs continuous improvement. Great benefits for all. Will recommend. Company is too grandfathered in culture. Not diversified enough.
good,Overall good experience. Great pay scale and frequency. Competitive environments overall. Good ole boy network very strong in the company. Overall workplace culture needs improvements.
good,"The shipyard was a good paying job and also had very good mates to work with. The benefits were good the an excellent 401k program for retirement. Shipyard was a very physical job that required a lot of protective gear like steel toe shoes or boots and hard hat and glasses"
good,"A typical day at my job is, getting to work on time or early. Getting my job from my supervisor and going to the job site and try to complete the job without any problems. Also check in with my supervisor from time to time about the job i am completing."
good,"Depends on where in the yard you work."
good,Steady work for 40 hours a week. A lot of management turn over. Unfair promotions due to friendships and family members. Slightly underpaid for the type of work performed.
good,"While I work for Huntington Ingalls Industries, it is a contract position falling under Lion Vallen Industries.  Some of the required annual classes are redundant, but completing one for HII does not fulfill the requirements for LVI."
good,The work was straight forward when we had it. The management between Florida and Norfolk did not seem to be on the same page. I believe that we could of had more stable employment if our Manager followed Corporate Huntington Ingalls rules.
good,"Shipyard environment provides a safe, educational & experience in the art of ship building. Management promotes a culture of ""Safety & Team Work"",  making any employee's position rewarding. The hardest part of the job is ""doing one's share""."
good,It is a very slow pace work environment. Being a good employee means more responsibility with no increase in pay. Education benefits are a huge plus. Parking is horrible and sometimes you have to arrive at work 2 hours early.
good,"Fast paced and always work to be done.  Enjoyed researching and accomplishing projects. Hardest part of the job was not being able to utilize unavailable resources, management expectation to do more with less."
good,"although job security is not promised, CTR provided a place for me to make a living after military service. It put me in the door to become a permanent employee of HII."
good,ok company IT could be better working in Va Beach there is no HR or IT onsight. All issues are dealt with remotely and thus often can be difficult to solve. Management does not do a very good job of communicating to the employees with regards to what is going on.
good,Very good job. Was the greatest job ive ever had. Working on the Coast Guard cutters (NSC 6 and 7) also worked on LHA7. Only thing i did not like was some of the Management
good,"I enjoyed working for NNS; I met some great people there.  I don't think the compensation was outstanding.  Plus, I did not enjoy having a security clearance; I like being able to talk about my work."
good,"Worked directly with waterfront engineers, cost engineers, production control and scheduling, material control, operations supervisors and program and project management to provide material and service to ensure successful completion of all shipalts, tempalts, repairs and maintenance on contracted Navy submarines."
good,"There is no such thing as a typical day at Newport News Shipbuilding. You do something new every day and learn several new things every day. Since I am a former Navy Sailor, I liked building ships for the next generation of Navy Sailors."
good,This is a cutting edge company that takes shipbuilding to a new level with its innovative ideas and technological advances.  This is a great job to be a stepping stone in order to take your career and work experience to the next level.
good,"Things started well, and then they loose value in their employees. Unreasonably high demands with little to no rewards. I will not speak for all departments, but mine was like that. They liked to place the blame for all of the short comings on Human Resources, but there's really no way to tell. The final straw was taking away tuition reimbursement under the pretense of a ""temporary suspension."""
good,hardest thing is the traffic and the security attitudes... they take things a little over board sometimes... but the job it self is not hard jus show up do ur job no problem
good,great opportunity to grow. good work environment and good people to work with. average day is pretty steady. There is shift work. you have be able to work in many different weather conditions.
good,This is a place that allows one to put to use any prior law enforcement training that one may have. After a briefing before each shift you are assigned to your duty station that allows you to continue to learn new things that are happening at the shipyard. The hardest part of the job was learning the changing faces of the people that you are coming into contact with each day. The most enjoyable part was being a part of each ship that is being built for the defense of our country.
good,This is a good place to work if you can line yourself up with the right circles. I have seen its not really what you know its more about who you know.
good,HII is  overall a good company to work for. The biggest negative for me is taht the company tolerates lazy employees and over works those that will work.
good,working at a shipyard is probably one of the most dangerous work place there is. But the company made sure that every employees are properly trained for the jobs they have to perform and given enough information on how to keep the area a safe place to work.
good,Huntington Ingalls is a good place to work. Its where I work now and where I started my professional career. I received multiple awards and recognition during my short time there. I enjoy the day to day change of my job as well as my direct foreman and general foreman.
good,HII is a good place to work. Got to learn a lot about marine electrical systems and ship building. Learned too much to list. Management team that i worked for is excellent.As a make-up foreman got to work closely with my superiors. Most of the people that i met where good people made a lot of friends. Hardest part of the job is that sometimes you have to work in unfavorable conditions.Most enjoyable was being able to learn new things on a almost daily basis.
good,Very safe and friendly work environment. Very well trained individuals makes the jobs easier and more safe. Management does well to communicate goals and achievements to the workers. Lots of politics and the communication between trades is severely lacking. Willing to train anyone for any position they might wish to pursue.
good,"Very specialized work, good stable job.  Like any other large company, has peaks and valleys in employment.  Really good benefits. Parking is not very good."
good,"My continual experience from the Navy allowed me to grow within this company in 11 years.  The team spirit of working with many engineers, trades and management was a life lesson.  To be apart of a great organization was Awesome."
good,"Work is fast paced, but the people you work with keep it relaxed and informal so the days go by fast. I learned a lot here I epecially like working in a 3d product model for design work."
good,"Great place of employment as far as security have many workers that are still working over 30 years, more than a handful. Management isn't the best of course sometimes it depends on who you know in order to move up in the company. Overall good place"
good,You do the same type of work every day. You have to look out for one another while working. You never know what area you will be working in so all you can do is prepare to do your duty. You have some people with great attitudes then you have some with not so great attitudes.
good,A typical day a work was repetitive yet complex.  I had to collaborate with management and other peer that pertain to the job that had to be  done in a certain amount of man hours.
good,"As a welder for Huntington Ingalls you'll find yourself in the sun during the middle of summer in overalls welding nine hours a day.  This may sound unappealing for some but it's actually rewarding to put in a hard days work and with hardship comes an escalation of comradery between you and the members of the crew you're assigned to. You have a sense of accomplishment after completing a job but sadly after two years the novelty of it all had worn off for me. "
good,This is a good company to work for. They understand your work life balance. They have an evolving IT department that encourages young talent.
good,"Perform program/craft support project management for a multi-billion dollar shipbuilding contract with heavy emphasis on data analysis, communication with management, and presentation of materials. Assist shipyard personnel with labor estimates for upcoming work, plans for improving performance, and earned value terminology. Extensive daily use of Microsoft Excel and Access 2010 as project management tools. In April 2014, after 15 months with Hntington Ingalls, I took on the new role and responsabilites of supporting the Director of Coatings moving out of homeroom. My immediate Industrial Engineering piers and Management team at Huntington Ingalls have been exceptional and working with this team has been a great experience. A large portion of my success with this company would be for not if the working relationships that I’ve developed and maintained had not been established."
good,"The daily routine is:"
good,"Very fast-paced, safety oriented occupation. Everyone is fun and easy to work with and team work and safety are main priority."
good,Review drawings for job assignment. Figuring things out because there are often unforeseen obstacle to overcome. Overcoming the extreme heat and cold can be a challenge.
good,I really liked the work that I was doing here.  It was a nice place to intern at.
good,"I am a third generation shipbuilder and this is a common theme throughout the shipyard with many folks following in parents and grandparents footsteps working at this storied company.  For whatever reason, innovation can be stymied and discouraged due to severe career consequences should an initiative fail.  In this way it can be typical of many large corporations."
good,"A typical day involves a series of fast paced decisions that need to be made in addition to plans for tomorrow."
good,"The people are fantastic, I went in thinking it was so tough place to work everyone welcomes you and greets you daily."
good,"200 am i,m up 0230 i travel from baton rouge to new orleans on a daily basis included overtime when required i began work at 0600am normally 8.0 hrs per day ,i,am a lead paint inspector at my work station i am responsible in assuring the customer that the product i'm presenting him is of top quality product,,the craft notify me to inspect the work once i inspect the units,,i determine the quality acceptance,,i then notify the customer which is the navy,,they then verify my deficencies after correction by the craft,,the customer accepts or writes unsat which is rejection,,i work along with at least 25 other employees,,,the hardest part of my job is only at times i have to enter ballast,,water,,fuel,,and which is the smallest are void tanks,,from the biggest to the smallest,, the top quality of these units or tanks when i present them to the customer with satisfactory acceptance,,my managers allowes me to perform my every day duties with limited or no supervision,,never the less they do assure that i,am performing my duties to the best of my ability,,and make certain that i,m doing my job safely,,,"
good,"Reviewed and revised Ship Systems Manuals and Charts in Microsoft Word and Excel, both confidential and otherwise. Worked in the evenings with miminal supervison. Duplicated ship blueprints upon request."
good,"For the most part, I like my job, and I love assisting the people that I deal with on a daily basis."
good,"Working at Ingalls was a great learning experience, and very inresting work, Especially since I am a great History/Military Buff"
good,Good work place and good pay.Good place for beginners.Good benefits
good,"great co-workers, good management. helpful co-workers. It is a wonderful place to work."
good,•a typical work day was a safety first productive day
good,"Interesting work,many different aspects,out in the weather a lot."
good,I interned at this company for a summer. The people were easy to work with and were very helpful and supportive. The atmosphere was relaxed. I worked on AutoCAD everyday when I interned.
good,Overall a good place to work. Great place for advancement and generally care about its employees. Have been here almost 20 years and create a great career.
good,"Good company to work for. I would recommend anyone to apply here. There are some challenges while working with the company like any other, but overall good company"
good,Fast pace industrial production place. Safety oriented work place.  Government overseas final work in accreditation to there policies and standards for ships that are to be purchased by the navy or coast guard
good,But parking is the worst. You may have to show up as early as 2.5 hours before your shift just for a parking spot.  They keep taking spots away to build more buildings which really lets you know where you stand in the grand scheme of things.
good,My 1st Shipyard job.  I learned a lot from Ingalls Shipyard.. I started off 3rd class and finished as a 1st class welder in almost 3 years. The work environment was ok for the most part.
good,"I entered information into the computer, created purchase request as needed, as well as went out in the yard to locate parts that were lost or misidentified. Also picked up parts that where in the wrong location and made sure they were sent to the correct location. I learned a lot about shipping as well as computer input. The hardest part of my job was learning all the contacts and  numbers. The highlight of my job was knowing that I helped build a safe vessel for our military. My co-workers where great and we often got together outside of work for group outings with our families."
good,Sometimes you end up in a location where you cannot advance. Shipyard is more concerned with time served rather than experience and skills.  Seems as if they give you the opposite of what you ask for.
good,Work there for few years. Gain enough experience to venture off on my own and meet a lot more people in welding field and work in welding shop across the country.
good,"I was a lead man for my crew. I overlooked jobs and assisted on jobs that needed to be completed quickly. Worked on main propulsion and main engine mainly. Replaced and fixed fans, pumps, and auxiliary."
good,"Ingalls is really not a bad place to work. I have been able to stand on my own feet working here. The management and leaders in this company are lacking professionalism in a huge way. The job themselves are not really hard, if you know what to expect. That being said, the everything else measure is extremely stressful and the work will break your body down."
good,"Great benefits, lower than industry pay. Upper management engages employees on a professional level. As a contract company, they try to keep their workers by utilizing them in other contracts should one become unavailable."
good,"The shipyard is, well, a unique place. We are the only builders of nuclear powered aircraft carriers and partner for building submarines. It's not a bad place to work. Just be ready for some curve balls."
good,Great company to work for. Best employer in Mississippi. Friendly and helpful fellow employees. Builds the greatest naval vessels in the United States. Great skilled workforce.
good,"Good shipbuilding company to work for, if you have previous shipbuilding/repair experience. the work is interesting and varied. the working hours were a little much for me, but not too awful."
good,"Many different jobs to choose from. There is a path to advancement, it's just a slow climb up. Great place for veterans to work. Military experience easily transfers over to the job."
good,I enjoyed working as a Designer for Newport News Shipbuilding. The work is interesting.  It was amazing to be a part of the history associated with the design and construction of aircraft carriers and submarines.
good,"I enjoy the ability to work remotely occasionally and use flex time, but that depends on who your boss is.  Some managers do not allow their employees to do this.  I wish the training was better.  Usually you learn new processes by figuring them out yourself when you find out it is your responsibility."
good,"Working there was different each day. Fast paced but downtime occasionally. Once hired on a shift, hard to transfer to a different one. A lot of opportunities in different departments."
good,"I enjoyed working there. The working conditions could be improved. When it's cold it's freezing. When it's hot you feel like you're gonna die. Need ac and heaters. Some foremans are cool but some are straight A-holes. They give you vacation after 1 year it increases after5 years. The company is filthy, don't think you'll come home clean. Over all its a good company to work for. But when they lay off, you are just another number."
good,"I have a 15 year career with Huntington Ingalls. It has provide a way for me to take care of my family and set a foundation for my future. It is a fantastic place to work with benefits that are superior to most companies. i would receive my work assignment and work to the deadline given. we would have staffs meetings weekly to track progress. I learned many things to add to my skillset. From new software and applications to time management. One of the hardest parts of the aspects of the job is sometimes the atmosphere can be dictated by the actions of a few. But along with that, the people are what make the company so great."
good,"I've always been a fan of working at the HII-Newport News Shipyard.  While some things went on that drove me crazy, overall, it was a great place to work.  I do think they undervalued their administrative assistants and didn't pay them enough, and I cannot understand why so many of those positions are now contract.  Still, if I could be hired as a direct, full time employee, I would jump at the chance."
good,"It definitely was an learning experience. I was able to acquire several qualifications,one allowed me to work in the lab. The crew was cool, I learned a lot"
good,"Overall positive work experience with this company, although little opportunity for career growth or advancement.  Alot of managerial transition within department."
good,"Hard working but great place to get started in life enabling young adults to reach set goals. I came in with the apprentice program working the yard, in school, and playing football. They put me in my own apartment with a roommate who was also in the program. Started the job making $15.95 a hour receiving a raise every 3 months."
good,QuriyriyIf you are not doing your job they will walk you threw the gate and you won’t have a job at all. The work is general and full of life along with good spirit people
good,"Avondale did not have professional people. I enjoyed working with my colleagues, but they had never been educated in AutoCAD. The supervisor thought the drawings were not to scale, when a simple Cad command would have done just that. The company eventually went bankrupt."
good,My job at this company offered many challenges with time schedule and work load. The biggest down fall to working at this company is having to wake up at 3:30 AM just to find a parking spot.
good,Good job overall. Upper management gets paid to much for doing nothing . The workers should make more than what the cut off limit is . Shouldn’t have to wait to get personal days off
good,"I came to the shipyard after leaving the fire dept because its my home here in Hampton va..8 hr work day,i have been trained to be a deck plate marine electrician.To me, in my job the hardest part of the job all day is trying to convince  a supervisor that I know exactly how to do this job,that I have been doing the same job for 12  yrs and have never had any complaints about the work that I do.It is so competitive with the supervisors that they have no confidence in the workers.   The best part of my job is the interaction every day with the people I work with..my co workers"
good,"i love working at steel mills,been doing it for over 10 years and i dont see doing anything different. i learned alot working there,for instance ive never done any shipfitting but i picked up on it very fast and past as top of my class"
good,"Working at Newport News Shipbuilding is an honor and a privilege. Being able to work on a section of the United States' defense system is a serious matter. Being a part of the Facilities Engineering organization allows me the opportunity to strategize and plan the facilitation needed to meet the company's short and long term mission. "
good,I would like to work there again if I had the opportunity. I worked in the yard at Avondale back in the 80's. It was interesting that The ships that i helped build back then were being replaced by the ones being built today.
good,Deadline orientated but train on the job and got to work on exciting projects.  Great company with excellent benefits. Experiences that will be life changing.
good,Great company with lots of opportunities for advancement especially if you are an apprentice graduate. The tuition reimbursment program to further education is also better than a lot of other companies.
good,"a good place to get started in your chosen career, but advancement was to slow and to many hoops to jump through to get them. but overall, i enjoyed my time there."
good,Management provided the tools required to accomplish set goals.  Management continued to supply plenty of backlog work and had the ability to move up if applied oneself.
good,Each day worked in Electrical engineering Department as an Designer providing  support to engineers designing construction to nuclear aircraft carriers for the United States Navy. I learned be very open and adaptable to change and learning on the fly.  The management was very good and open to ensuring employees were trained and understood their job.  The culture was very professional and progressive. The hardest part of the job was learning the intricacies of the job.  The most enjoyable part of the job is developing and seeing the finished product. A Nuclear Aircraft carrier that would protect our country.
good,Productive knowledgeable job on the different testing involved in becoming a NDT INSPECTOR.  Enjoy meeting and talking with other NDT inspectors and other co-workers
good,HII is a great company to work for on the Gulf Coast. A large majority of the employees are 2nd and 3rd generation workers. HII is a wonderful community partner and works hard to give back to the area.
good,"Good company overall. As with any company, a lot of the politics can affect morale. Management needs improvement. There are opportunities there, however, just not always easy to obtain."
good,"It may not be the best environment of places to work, but i enjoy welding and knowing that were building ship's to carry some of the bravest  men and women in the  world who risk there lives everyday for our country"
good,Great for veterans who are transitioning. I really enjoyed working for Huntington Ingalls Industries. I still apply to get in just waiting for the opportunity to be granted. If you have a lot going on family wise just make sure your in a position to be able to make it on time and not have to be out for whatever reason. Documentation only lasts for so long they need you there 365.
good,Its a great place to learn your trade and further your learning.  Work with people who will help you learn different ways to look at a problem. Great Place Overall
good,"Working in tight spaces and awkward positions is par for working on ships. The people were fine to work with, but sadly you never knew how long the job would last. So far both times I've worked at Huntington Ingalls all of my foremen have been really good people to work for. There is a ton of walking and climbing involved working there and the parking is just crazy it is a good way to get your exercise because nothing is close. Everything considered I would go back to work there anytime, just don't count on the job to last, as a contractor they think of you as a kleenex they use you and get rid of you."
good,"a good place to work if you can dodge layoffs,overtime is almost always offered,and double time pay on sunday.but would recommend not going into a hotwork trade"
good,"Nice atmosphere to work, I enjoyed all the personnel that i met. Working with Navy was very exciting and just plain cool building all those big ships."
good,Fast paced and stressful environment that is both challenging and rewarding. You will be exposed to the elements as most of the office jobs are inside the yard and will require a bit of walking to get there.
good,Great place to work. I worked for this company for over 11 years. Parking situation is not the greatest. You have to get there one hour early just to find a parking spot. I've worked with some great people over my 11 years.
good,"Most of the management was good, until I work with one boss, that didn't like me because of personal reason.. good training classes, taught me basic information, safety, and procedures about my trade.. great co-workers, people, supervisors.. This company cared about your life and livelihood.. I learn a lot of trade from this company."
good,"I enjoyed working for Newport News Shipbuilding.  There was an understanding of work life balance and when you work well, train well and schedule work well, the environment was conducive to growth and development"
good,Paid classroom training and on the job training through design trainee program. Learned something new everyday. Fast paced and dealine oriented so it can be stressful at times.
good,Cool work place the hours on my shift are 6 A.M. til 2:30 P.M. The work place was pretty chill. The managers can be uptight. Hardest part of the job is the conditions. Most enjoyable part is payday and the characters you meet and work with in the company.
good,"a typical day at HII can go great or it can be bad. I learned how to produce quality work as well as how to work safe. My co-workers are great they have taught me a lot about the job as well as in life its self. The worst part of the job is the conditions, but its all worth it knowing your producing quality ships back to the fleet."
good,"My time in the CVN 78 Lead Design Yard at NNS offered me great opportunities, in both leadership and technical exposure.   As I look back I learned a lot and grew significantly in my professional development.  In a large company at NNS, levels of opportunity and intensity vary.  NNS was a good experience for me."
good,"Comparable to current industry.  Management is satisfactory, with any/all concerns addressed, compliance to company policies & procedures, etc.  Hard working and dependable co-workers."
good,Good place for engineers (especially mechanical). Numerous departments requiring different skills. Provides opportunities to grow. Great fit for entry level engineers.
good,I enjoy the people I work with and the experience I had there. The great thing about Ingalls is the opportunity it gives you to start a career and take care of your family.
good,"Management was to transfixed on building their own little empires and it caused friction in the work place. There were no set goals on how to be promoted, The rules for this were different for each employee."
good,"Newport News Shipbuilding is a very large defense contractor.  if you like working in a industrial environment this is a good place to go. advancement is slow and the culture needs to change from the ""old ways""."
good,"There is easy communication with the main office. Jobs are salaried very well for the type of positions being assigned. Agents handle employee affairs very professionally. Immediate attention is given to any employee discrepancies, or complaints. There is thorough client research, for potential job placement, of employees."
good,"Work first, play later. Can be unorganized at times. Haste seems to be an issue. People are willing to help if you help yourself. Need more welders."
good,"Very productive and busy at least 30 hours out of a week. Weekly, bi-weekly and monthly updates. Manage 5 department overhead budgets. Love my co-workers and down time when im able to go tour the ships. The hardest part of my job is the 10 minute walk to my office."
good,"Huntington Ingallls is a good place to work. The benefits are great, and the pay is well."
good,"Under the Engineering area worksite, the job itself was very interesting and the working environment was enjoyable. It was generally a great place to work. Co-workers were very friendly and family oriented, while management was usually distant. Sitting for long periods of time was hard on the body which was the hardest part of the job. The type of work along with the teamwork spirit from co-workers was the best part. The knowledge gained was very valuable and would be appreciated by companies requiring the same skill and performance."
good,General office knowledge. Relax office environment. Co-workers are willing to train you.
good,I enjoy working in metrology.
good,"A typical day at work is totally dependent upon the job at hand. At any given time you may need grind steel, in order to mount equipment to the ship, set up runways for cable installation, properly fit lights to the overhead and/ hook-up the equipment. Everything is totally dependent on what upper management feels is top priority, and all orders are supplemented with drawings, schematics and methods books in order to ensure proper procedure is followed."
good,"Responsible for auditing purchase orders (P.O.) and versions of $25,000 and above to ensure compliance,"
good,"great place to learn and develope skills,the workers are skilled and well prepared,the managers know the details of the job.it is an over all great work place"

good,Come in do your work and go home be safe at all times...they offer grate opportunity to advance if you choose so.make the best of your time there learn as much as you can from someone
good,"Work is essentially guaranteed. 40 hours a week, health insurance, retirement plans, 401k plans, special car financing for employees, apartment discounts in the area, weekends off, and weekly paychecks make HII a great place to work. You will be taught a trade step by step and can advance with merit and hard work. A dangerous job, but a rewarding one."
good,"An enjoyable place to work. Traffic is probably the most difficult aspect, if you don’t pay for monthly parking you’ll have to arrive 1-2hrs early for parking. Benefits are good on site clinic, don’t feel like we’re compensated fairly in terms of market value. Possible to grow and advance in the company"
good,"It was an interesting place to have been. I loved the work. It aligned closely with my education and background. Good collaborative environment! "
good,"Everyone wants you to succeed, friendly work environment, but work can be boring at times. The company allows employees to apply for a rotational program in order to make everyone happy."
good,"NNS is my first engineering job out of college and I believe it to be a good starting point for a budding engineering career. There is plenty of opportunity to learn about how a naval ship is designed, how to ensure naval ship specifications are met, how a large company functions, etc. Those who end up liking the company will have plenty of opportunity to make career moves within the company. Overall management of the company could definitely be better. There is a disconnect between what management thinks is happening and what the typical employee experiences."
good,"Good company to work for, was a temp position (Intern). I enjoyed it, a lot of the workers didn't do their job - which made mine difficult. People seemed a little too comfortable in their roles because it's difficult to be fired from a GS position."
good,I first started as a shipfitter and switch into the electrical apprenticeship program and continued for 3years and was able to improve as a electrician
good,HII is a good company to work for and their mission is even greater. Sometimes work still can become work if you don't often take a look back to see what is being made.
good,Its shift work... night shift differential is a plus. You are taught how to do your job after that you are on your own. Considerable amount of work for a decent pay
good,"HII was a pretty good place to work.  Job kept you busy, but not overly so. Management was pretty good, left you to do the work assigned without micro-managing. Pay was a little low for the work required in my area but hopefully that improves for others in the future."
good,"As a government contractor with HII, it is always hard to get to know the managers in corporate however HII always makes a point to get to know the employees."
good,"Huntington Ingalls Industries - Newport News Shipbuilding is a large company with good pay and great benefits.  Due to the government work, most positions have great job security."
good,"a great company for growth came in at a young age it changed my way of thinking as a young man. A lot hands on man work habit, teachers and training from the start"

good,You learn a lot about US NAVY Aircraft Carriers and Subs (you are building them). Great atmosphere. Great group of diverse people who brings skills and knowledge to building these GREAT Ships!
good,"It’s a safe work environment, on the job training. Just don’t miss time and you’ll be fine, that’s the fastest way to get terminated. Overtime is usually available But it’s not mandatory."
good,During my time at the company I got to learn alote of new stuff that i will take with me.  The people were friendly and always cheerful for the most part.
good,I worked at Huntington Ingalls for 35 years and it was a great place to work until they allowed inexperince people to become managers and the buddy buddy system to ruin how the company was previously structure. Over the years the hardest part of the job was just being motivated enough to go everyday. Engaging and interacting with co workers was the most enjoyable part of the job.

good,My work life at at the shipyard was fast paced at times but I made many friends there Friends that I worked well with.It was not uncommon for another employee to pitch in on a project with a fast approachin deadline. The company benefits were really great.

We will fulfill our commitments as responsible citizens and employees. We will consistently treat customers and company resources with the respect they deserve..

good,Nice place to work. I recommend for those seeking to work with ship building dynamics. I personally partner with Bell Techlogix which is doing a great job updating company policies.
good,working anywhere can be a challenge. At Huntington-Ingalls Newport News Shipyard you will have steady work. This is good for those looking for long term work
good,Building United States Navy Ships Using Carbon Fiber was an proud experience for me. Being an  Chief Union Steward was even better experience helping craft employees make threw some rocky times and job experiences. My craft was First Class Carbon Fiberglass Mechanic.
good,Very big company very good company to work for it well I would also work for this company again due to the fact it is a contract with the military contracts or sometime interrupted causes layoffs for the most part it is a wonderful place to to work and take care of your family and as a young man this is what we look for it's companies that we can work for and take care of our families.
good,A lot of time is spend with the people in your crew and most crews have fun with each other and make the day go by. Work can be hard but it is always safe. NNS spends a lot of time and money on safety.
good,"Punch in at 6:00"
good,"Great company to work for, especially in the shipyard.  Kesselring site is difficult mainly due to the LMA.  Company provides excellent opportunity for advancement and is highly recommended for engineering graduates, and military veterans."
good,You will learn a lot working at the Shipyard in Newport News.  I was a Computer Aided Designer for about 10 years working on the New Ford Class aircraft carrier program.

This company cared about your life and livelihood.. I learn a lot of trade from this company"
good,"Typical day is 9 hours for salary personnel. It's not unusual to work 50 hours per week. Most of the people working there are nice, and polite. Best part is working with the Navy, giving the new sailors advice on how to make the most of a great experience."
good,"Very specilized work, and good stable job if you are in the correct field.  Like any large company, employment has its peaks and valleys. Parking is not great."
good,"Get a start up brief and job assignment from the Foreman. Read over the work documents and gather the required tooling for the job. Get in contact with the proper supporting departments for assistance in completing the job. Once the job is complete, debrief the job and inform the foreman what was accomplished."
good,Not a bad place if you don't mind a long walk from your car to the site. It can be a bit chaotic at quitting time as well. Imagine thousands of people getting off of work from the same location at the same time.
good,2 years here . tuff work for good money. don't expect to get rich. but it is a top 3 job of the area. great health plan. room to advance.
good,"very productive work day, Learn to be safe and watch out for your co worker as well, management need to improve in the area of treating their employee like a human. co workers works together and getting alone well, the hardest part of the job dealing with supervision. the enjoyable part the days off and the pay"
good,at work almost an hour and a half early if you want to get a parking space. the bell rings you need to have on ppe standing in front of your foreman. get your job assignment go get tools needed for your job. go to work!
good,Learned a lot working at Ingalls. Early mornings and long days are very common. Friendly work environment but management can be overbearing in its policies. Very crowded so traffic can be a pain but it pays to work here. Best shipyard in the area as far as safety and benefits and employee/employer relations.
good,"Work hours 6am to 2;30pm."
good,"First thing in the morning your day starts out fast pace while always emphasizing the importance of safety. Newport News shipbulding has provided me with the proper training that is required for my current trade. I've learned the importance of various paint and paint phases such as sp1 & sp2 , different medals , corrosion, and safety 1st always. The employees are of one of a kind ; they are hard working dedicated team players. While looking for new challenges to meet and exceed the  expectations of the customer and management while maintaing the standards of excellence. The hardest part of the job can be that sometimes there is never enough hours in the day to do what you need to do in a days work. But the most enjoyable part is interacting with my employees , different trades, and the customeras well and seeing the finished product of what are team has produced."
good,"I learned how to read blueprints. I was taught how to lay carbon fiber to match specs in the blueprints. I learned about different chemicals, such as resins and catalysts."

good,My typical day at work involved painting articles for various Navy ships either brush & roll or spray paint. How to achieve satisfactory prepared surfaces for painting and excellent painting techniques. The management at this company was adequately trained. My co-workers could have been more committed to achieving the company's commitment to quality standards with regard to the finished product. The hardest part of the job was the teamwork concept with all the members being open to gaining the knowledge of performing to the highest company quality standards and how to achieve those standards. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was seeing a finished product that we completed done to the utmost quality with no defects.
good,"As a Huntington Ingalls Industries pipe fitter my duties consist of performing Makeup Supervisor and Lead Pipe Fitter. Assume duties of supervisor when supervisor is away on night shift.

good,"learned how to be very responsable from good experience. very good co-workers, and good pay."
good,"This job has been very secure, but with the defense budget cuts it is becoming unstable. The job is great with some possibility of advancement.  "
good,"HII is a great place to work. The company encourages career development by offering developmental training, tuition assistance programs, etc.."
good,"A typical day involves little to no stress where emphasis is placed on the production of quality parts, manufactured and machined to tight tolerances. While working here I learned how to operate a five axis robot and modify G code based programs. Management personnel are all highly experienced and easy to work for. My co-workers have always been committed to being part of the team and to getting the job done. The hardest part of my job comes when a 4500 sq/ft part lands on the cutting table. Getting these parts properly aligned is physically demanding but worth it because it leads directly to the most enjoyable part of my job. Knowing that I am trusted with such a expensive and complex machine gives me a great sense of pride. Also, producing parts for the military gives me the opportunity to do my part for the country. And knowing that service men and women will utilize the parts that I make to do there job leaves me with a great sense of satisfaction."

good,A lot of high-profile and tasking projects that encourage teamwork and solid communication. A typical day at work consists of project tracking and updates for the team. Managment is hands off and allows members to be adults and perform in their roles. Hardest part of the job is working on projects that nobody else is currently doing. The most enjoyable aspect are the individuals that I have the pleasure to work with.
good,"A typical day is showing up on time, get your tools out your tool box and get to work. "
good,good job with a great atmosphere for all employees. Nice facilities with lots of space to get your work completed in a quiet clean environment. Extra training provided through CBT.

good,"Truly enjoy working at the company, many enjoyable things to do. The attitudes of my immediate Supervisor was not workable causing me to seek employment else where."
good,"HII-NNS is not that bad of a career, however, the place is just full of drama. If you stay to yourself and do your work you will not have a problem and management might notice your work ethics and you will move up in the company."
good,"Have to be there at least an hour early to one able to be on the job on time. I learned a good bit about the ins and outs and expectations of working on Naval Ships. "
good,While the benefits and salary were outstanding the opportunities for advancement were very limited. I wish corporate management had communicated with outlining offices more often
good,"A typical day at Ingalls would be very competitive, its a same repetitive job which I wasn't too fond of, but between the boss' and the pay wages and the benefits, I really liked this job."
good,"The is very job to make a career out of. You have options from being a welder, electrian, rigger, or even a painter. Only thing that is really required is come to work on time."

good,get to work early to get a decent parking spot.  most enjoyable part of my job was working with a small 4 man crew. most crews have way more than that.
good,"Had enough work to retire on!  FAST PACE AND EDUCATIONAL!  Provided excellent benefits package but as a company, the pay was below national and regional average!"
good,A great company but no room for progress. Employees have been here over 20 years and only making a little over $20. The Union is a great help but pay could be better.
good,Working as an engineer for Newport News Shipbuilding has been a good experience. I was able to flex my schedule in order to complete my bachelor's degree.
good,"This company offered me many opprotunitys to increase my welding knowledge.  I learned how to use and do a few new welding process which include, stainless steel , aluminum, and copper nickel"
good,"With the shipyards laying off right now, it is hard to stay employed with the shipyard. I really liked my job though and I liked working there. The supervisors were friendly and willing to assist if needed."
good,You deal with a lot of different people at the job. The management needs work but overall its not a bad job. The company is very serious about working safely and I did like that a lot
good,ingalls provides very high salary then most places on the gulf coast. it is a stable job to provide for your family. it has many benefits that help the working people. the union could help people more and people could be less drama

good,"-too many engineer for the job "
good,"Huntington Ingalls opened an office in Houston as a result of survey conducted to test their participation in the Oil & Gas Industry.  Unfortunately, with the downturn in oil prices, it was agreed to abandon HII's involvement in this venture."
good,I enjoyed HII when I was there. Some of their systems were a little outdated but we got the job done. Advancement into other fields and job areas were a little hard to do. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting people from all departments in the shipyard and listening to their stories.
good,"good company to work for up's and down's in my opinion"
good,I loved working at Ingalls. It was the best job I ever had.  They have the best training and they hold you accountable and I like that.  Safety First.......I feel like the hardest part working at Ingalls was waking up and getting to work on time.  Everything else was easy.
good,my first welding job kinda just thrown out there but was able to adapt. great training center for new hires. great long term company to move up in and advance your skills in the trade. nice work enviroment.
good,"good place to work   I was employed there 10 years.  I was laid off. Shipbuilding Industry.  Heavy Industrial."
good,There are numerous job opportunities but its often who you know. You have to be in the right place at the right time with this company alot for advancement.
good,Good place to work. Promote employee accountability. However needs to invest in passing experiences and work practices to rising managers.
good,overall a good place to work with good insurance and good wages. The worst thing about working there is that it can be a dangerous environment and it is very hot during the summer and very cold during the winter.
good,Collaborate with members of my team to test various mechanical systems on naval vessels and perform data anaylsis to certify the system in efforts to deliver the vessels to the Navy. I have been greatful to work with such great co-workers as well as management. The hardest part of the job is to determine a fault when there are faults that have similar characteristics. The cost and the purpose of the system can add stress in getting the right fault.
good,"Satisfying work place with a diverse and knowledgeable crew that came together to get the work done correctly and accordingly to meet ships standards,deadlines and overall expectations. granted the politics and procedures at times may have been counter productive. Overall enjoyed the work and co-workers as there was always something new to learn or perfect whether it was operating drilling equipment on the light deck to turning wrenches in the engine-room which kept things interesting. Every so often personnel would get relocated to better assigned people and skills to the task at hand which was quite efficient."
good,"marking up drawings for equipment removal and checking drawings."
good,decent work environment with good pay and great benefits. very large facility with everything you need for your work day.
good,My 4 years at Huntington Ingalls I enjoy myself working with the people there I learn a lot from the older workers that have been there for 20+ years just how to worked the job right way and what to for look and listen for when working.

good,"This company provides plenty of opportunities for you to receive education and learn other trades."
good,"Analyzed samples, calibrated equipment, and train personnel"
good,"This is the sort of job that is excellent for a new engineer to jumpstart their career, but may not be the best place for every engineer to stay."
good,Good place to work where someone doesn't stand over your back all day but gives you space and the belief that you know they trust that you will get the job done. The drive is probably he hardest part of this job being that it is two hours away. I have learned new techniques with surface pepraration and safe.  My co-workers are some good go getter's and some are lazy of course.
good,"I enjoyed my work experience with my peers, over all good company. My manager didn't have good managing skills and let a lot of personal traits effect her ability to work with others."
good,Met many awesome people over the years. Always did love my job….Started off working on the ships and advanced to Timekeeping dept. and then advanced to Payroll dept. Loved every experience.
good,"Only you can dictate your career in this comany. If you're focused and you work hard, you will succeed. They offer leadership development training for anyone who wishes to become a supervisor, so it's really up to you how far you can go. In my three years of working here, I've been presented with man opportunities to make a name for myself and get into a position to be considered for promotions."

good,Good work.
good,I enjoyed working here but they were closing down. We worked on Navy ships. We built the vessels from the ground up.
good,"they are a very safety continence company, decent pay, cost of benefits a little high but basically a good place to work. their welding school is top notch."
good,"the job was great, i love to weld. working on the carriers was amazing. i will never forget it."
good,my job was pulling cable though wire-way running them to point A to point B terminating them
good,Typical day at work is welding at a set pace enjoyably
good,Good company with great benefits. I would work here again. Lots of good people here who care about your well being.
good,All work completed remotely.  I have worked on many projects as a SME and enjoy the challenge of working with diverse projects and people.  Company culture is positive and have enjoyed the management.
good,i was trained in welding and fab work. learned to work with others as a team member. learning to get jobs done in a timely manner. they also give you a chance to move up in the company with great pay.
good,Very good job great for advancement with hard work and dedication I have seen a lot of my co workers as well as myself go up the ladder of success working with Huntington Ingalls
good,Industrial environment with a wide variety of employees. Focused on safety and providing a good product to the Navy. Things may move a bit slow as that is the way of government contract work.
good,"Start with the Daily task, either restocking the issue line, or helping & assisting Marines and Sailors check-in or out. "
good,"My time there as a contractor was fine. We did our work in a timely manner, any questions I had, would get answered, and everything was effective.It's nice."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to meet new people. Those hardest part of the job is the parking.  I will say a typical day at work for me would be mostly training.
good,To many people wants the big position and willing to do and treat you how ever to get them. It’s to much politics at that yard that’s why the numbers of people leaving is steady going up
good,Newport News Shipbuilding have a lot of opportunities for entry level and experienced tradesman. The pay is fair and the work is rewarding.the management is hit or miss but I got a few good ones before resigning
good,I would recommend the place of work to friends and family good benefits with good pay. Overall good management just can be stressful at times with not alot of time paid off from work.
good,This is a decent place to work. Great company match program and paid holidays.  The pay was great for entry level employees when I hired in back in 2014.
good,"If you WANT TO you can learn a lot make good money and be a part of history."
good,"Productive days, people are easy to get along with. Supervisor is great and thinks about you, keeping you on task. The facilities is very hot in the summer and very cold in the winter."
good,Typical day at work a  place your can learn a lot working there.. It’s not a hard place to work for.. Just keep your PPE on and follow the safety guidelines at all time..
good,The work was very hard at times but it had a big payoff. My work was seen every time a plane took off from a carrier.  I can't really complain about how it was after that.
good,"This company is the first real engineering job I've ever had.  I've been working here for a little over 2 years and so far I've grown to enjoy the work that I do here, and I learn something new every day. "
good,This job provided outstanding benefits and a safe working environment. The hardest part about the job was finding a place to park. Management was helpful
good,"I like my job.  Although there is always something new, there doesn't seem to be opportunity for upward mobility.  I don't see many programs with the company that grooms people for better jobs. I would like to see programs within the company that trains people for better jobs."
good,Huntington Ingalls/Shipyard has been around for 133yrs and still excelling. Its a great and large company to grow and move around. Always opportunities to get exposure too and expand your growth and knowledge. I recommend anyone to work here.
good,"This is a good place to work, but there is no accountability of people. The job pays well, but the lack of supervision has made people have a bad attitude. The supervisors need to know the job more, instead of the hourly employees. The other thing is the parking is horrible there have to get there 2 hours before your shift."
good,"Great Culture, I worked around good team members. It made work enjoyable and not stressful. Working hours were great(6-2:30). The company offers many opportunities to advance my career through education. The hardest part of the job was parking but pay made up for that and working around a good group of individuals."
good,Your basic job. Does get really old in winter on boat and really hot in the summer.  A lot of lifting and walking and standing. Consistant pace type of job. They provide all training required.
good,The job was a good place to work for great employees good supervisor did the job to the best of my abilities enjoyed the job everyone was friendly everyone got along the job was not difficult to do picking and packing and preparing for shipment everyone worked as a team
good,"Typical day of work usually the same about every day so no new surprises; I've learned a lot about my current trade which I am very thankful for. Many fellow ship fitters came to my aid to teach me anything they know at no expense. Management could be a little better, many times you may have a supervisor who just doesn't show compassion for his crew members. I was fortunate enough to have one who cared for each one of his crew members both contracted and company employee. The workplace is very welcoming for new people, usually very comfortable. Hardest part of the job was the lack of breaks, lunch break is only 20-30 mins and taking breaks throughout out the day may be frowned upon if you're just so happened walked up on by the wrong person. Best job perk was the people I worked around, definitely made the days better and the job much more fun for me."
good,A fast paced learning working environment that gives you chances to learn new skills and trades with having training on the work site along with great work benefits
good,Pretty good place to work. Managers are not micromanaging. Down side is the pay and vacation. Other similar companies pay $5+ an hour more. This company is known as a “stepping stone” company.  Employees get experience and then leave to the higher paying companies.
good,Its a descent job a lot of walking I liked welding on different alloys and took pride in welding on navy ships but they hired 3000 new people and cut out all overtime at a bad time for me
good,"I learned a great deal about several different trades in my career at Huntington Ingalls Shipyard Newport News. I learned how to ship fit which would have steel carpentry also shipwright work and safety. Even using various tools for different jobs. Training preparation qualifications were a must. I also got trained in several different other trades such as painting, deck tile work, insulation, cleaning and Pumper. Also the coordination of multiple trades to meet deadlines in construction of a naval vessel from start to finish as well as overhaul."
good,"Review project ideas, create design package including drawings, acquire purchasing documents to vendor to perform required task. very good direct management supervisor.  working with other departments can be difficult.  always find a great group of people to work with."
good,A typical work day we would get our assignment first thing in the morning and go to our area and get our materials and plan of action ready. We would have to have our own tools but my company provided the tools. The management and staff I worked with were outstanding. They were very understandable especially when I had just started and my father passed away. They gave me the time that I needed off and didn't count it against me. The hardest part of the job was getting into certain locations to do the work or re-work because another trade would take down your materials and you had to go back through and redo the work.
good,Good place to work for career advancement and opportunity to be promoted within.  Working conditions are great.  Travel was extensive but manageable.  Recommend working here.

good,"The planning division of the shipyard is spearheading a number of new technologies, which is exciting but can also be frustrating. Communication is not a strong suit, and many of the tenured managers are not in tune with their employees. The company provides many benefits but the pay is not as competitive as it could be."
good,Can't make any better money in the Pascagoula MS area. The shipyard provides steady employment for those who want a career in shipbuilding and they will train you.

I receive good benefits that best fit me as well as good pay rate. They also offer numerous amount of overtime and made it optional to work overtime.
good,good people and nice clean place to work. would go back and stay for for along time. bosses are good and understanding and really care about there employees and there families.
good,"Great place to work and build a career at Newport news shipbuilding"
good,"Your specific experience will depend on what position you have, the department you are in, and your manager. They have thousands of employees at the Pascagoula, MS site. Culture is blue collar so even if you are white collar you are considered ""sitting in the bleachers watching the football players do all the work."" I had a couple of incredibly awesome managers and a few seriously mediocre and a couple more who had no understanding of my skills and just micro managed. They have new postings daily so check back often."
good,"This company presents a wonderful opportunity at learning and building on a trade to start a career. As long as you show up to work and put up a valiant effort on a daily basis, you will always have employment here at this company.

good,It's a union job you have to joint the union to work here. Its a great place the cost of living its cheap. The electrical work its easy you don't need a lot of experience.
good,This was a  great long term job that offered many new experiences in the time that I was there. There was a large diversity in the people that worked there which helped me in learning to work with others who may have different ideas. My only reason for leaving this job was that we moved too far away to commute.

True: a job is a job and it needs to get done, but its amazing how a little psychological accommodation can go a long way and steer things in the right direction. Especially when working in a large corporation. I worked with a lot of people. Most were good. Some were great. Few were difficult. The hardest part of the job was any downtime in between projects when there wasn't much work to do. The best part of the job was both the type of work I did, and the people I worked with. We had a good time and got the job done."

good,"The shipyard is an excellent place to work for someone with Naval, Shipbuilding, DoD interest.  "
good,"Daily challenges to meet cost, schedule and budget sometimes get traded off for safety margins. Safety Action Teams restore the balance.

good,Currently in a state of reduction but overall it is a great company to work for in regards to advancement and job security.
good,"A typical work day would be to come in get our safety briefing from the supervisor, then he/she would tell each person where and what they would be doing on the ship, we would then go inspect the job for ourselves to make sure it was how the supervisor said it would be, next we would set the job up as far as move things out of the room we are working in if needed to prevent a fire, pull welding lines, or go to the tool room and checkout any additional tools we need for the job, and begin work. the hardest part of the day would be not trying to eat a big lunch to slow you down. The most enjoyable part of the day was interacting with co-workers makes jobs a lot less stressful and very easy when there's no conflict between co-workers.

good,"Work typically begins at 7am for most day shift workers getting the morning started begins with looking at any emails, checking to make sure there aren't any immediate problems from the night before or things that have might have just come up. One of the biggest things ive learned working in this position is how to be an effective communicator and my public speaking skills. I have also enhance my abilities to give presentations to upper-management and getting jobs done with little to no supervision at all. I couldn't ask for better managers who have passed down years of knowledge and have allowed me to grow by giving me responsibilities to lead programs and manage employees. I've work with some of the best people who really care about the company and were eager to help each other to be successful. The hardest part of my job had to be dealing with people, I've learned that not everyone is going to buy into a program or agree with what changes are being made but staying persistent and working with them you will eventually get through."
good,"Great place to work, alot of different directions you can move in. Office setting, warehouse and outside work. Great coworkers Great director"
good,"NNS offers a wide-variety of experiences, from the production environment in and around massive aircraft carriers and impressive submarines to the design and planning aspects of building and overhauling these ships.  NNS offers excellent benefits with flexible work arrangements, depending on particular job.  Travel can range from none to months, typically voluntary, and is mostly domestic, such as Bremerton, San Diego, Pearl Harbor, Groton, and DC, but can be oversees, such as Japan.  NNS has a strong focus on safety and engagement.  Parking is a significant challenge in certain areas of the shipyard.  Facilities also range in quality.  The complexity of the work and processes at NNS can be challenging to learn, with most folks needing a year or more, and can bog down change.  The long-term nature of some of the projects can also be a challenge, taking about a decade to plan and build a new carrier.  Other programs, such as the submarines, are more fast-paced, at about 6-month delivery cycles.  The most enjoyable experiences for me have been observing massive castings poured in the NNS foundry, massive propeller shafting work in the antique but high-tech NNS machine shop, and experiencing high-speed turns on an aircraft carrier during sea trials."
good,"A tropical shift at the Huntington Ingalls Shipyard conquests of, getting burned, hard work and great pay. "

good,"Good company to work for, even though can be fired fast without any warning. The company is good, My suggestion would be to train managers on how to effectively communicate with their workers."
good,"the company is very strict on time, do not miss time during your probation period. If you're late there's a currency, leave early currency, missing time is a currency; so if you can use vacation time that will be your best interest. Vacation starts after your first year on the date of hire."

good,"For my time working at huntington ingalls i can honestly say i really enjoyed it. The upper management always offered room for improvement as in different ways to move up in the company. The area i worked at which was new construction the temperature was dependent on the weather, some days it was extremely hot and some were extremely cold. But being that i was in the painting department and we could only paint under certain circumstances upper management always found ways to make it cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter. What i loved the most about the job was working around different people from different cultures, the benefits, and the challenges i faced on a daily!"

good,"The hardest part of any job is completing every task that is set before you; completing it safely and in a timely manner. I have learned that in management there is no room for error or misguided interpretations of  established procedures and rules. As far as management is concern you need to lead by example, you cannot expect your workers to work a job unless you're willing to get in there with them and work along side them. The most enjoyable part of any job for me is the completion part and seeing everything come together working without any problems."
good,"Somme times you can have a rough day at work depend on the job they assign to you, but i can say this job can improve your skills in many ways. The hardest thing about it is that you have to carry this heavy welding box throughout the ship."
good,"Install and remove various types of insulation to ship. Install and remove various pipes, valves, and machinery. Very demanding job that really wasn't rewarded the same way as other jobs that don't take the same effort to do."

They acknowledge that safety is a very big concern for them. They try to prevent any safety hazards and give tips on how to be safe on and off the job. They care about their employees health they do different types of health screening to ensure that the employees are healthy and can do the job at task. They strive for the employee to get ahead whether it be on the job or in education. The on the job training ensures you get the knowledge of what you are be asked to do on the job. A typical day at work was educational i learned something new every time i got a new job assignment. The hardest part of the job was coming to a part in the job where you had to wait on another trade to come and complete their part of the job. You would have to come to a complete stop and couldnt go further in your job until they finished theirs or you had to have another trade come take something down or move it because it was in the way or put in the wrong spot. The most enjoyable part of the day was felling accomplished when you finished a job ahead of time and saved the company money."

good,"I work in the warehouse department of Huntington Ingalls Avondale, which is a shipyard. In the warehouse,in our crew, everyone knew their job every day. We worked as a unit. The hardest thing to do was to find enough hours in the day to get it done. Everyone had at least 10 years of service, many of us much more. Our supervisors were there to give guidance when needed,but we mostly knew our routine every day. Best part of the job was when we would work hard to see a task through, and we would accomplish it. We all cared about each other's safety, and we were there for each other. i had never worked with a closer group of people."
good,"great place to work"
good,"A typical day can sometimes be full throttle or easy going, there is balance in our everyday work schedule. I have learned many aspects of the company, from how to use different operating systems to being a team player. Workers are friendly and everybody is like family, the hardest part of the job is my commute 2 hour round trip takes alot out of anybody. What I enjoy most is the people, you won't find as many fun, outgoing and friendly people as you do at the avondale shipyard."
good,Great friends Greta job. Would reccomend this job to others.
good,"Productive work place, good people to work with Safe work place."

good,"overall great place to work, plenty of opportunity for advancement to eligible candidates. Good supervision and knowledgeable lead men."
good,I loved it. The people or amazing and time of employment was on time the hours or really good as well. The managers for the most part treat you like family i would go back in a flash if they called me one of the best companies i ever worked for.
good,"The department im in now has been extremely flexible and I have not had many issues with my schedule. This being said there are many days you will be working long hours, so even with the flexibility some of the life/work balance is lost."
good,Left spontaneously but regret it. Will return soon. Best place I've ever worked so far as getting ahead. Great benefits as far as health insurance and short term disability .
good,Huntington Ingalls is a great place to work. They train you on the job. You get great benefits and discounts. The pay is fair and you you do not have to rush to do your job.
good,It was a wonderful experience working at Huntington Ingalls. This job allowed me to provide for family. The pay was extremely good with alot of overtime.
good,"Workdays are comprised of onsite investigation of issues to determine extent of repairs to be made, followed by material ordering and work plan preparation."
good,Great place to start a career.  You will have   many opportunities  to choose what Area you would like to expanse your horizon.  You also get education opportunies.
good,Great people. Good benifits over all the company is good to work for the only thing is the parking lts not enough parking for the working people other than that its great
good,Great place to work with  great benefits. Weather is okay but they are building warehouse to eliminate bad weather conditions. Great management paid vacations
good,Various opportunities for employment.  Work experience depends on department hired for.  Managment possibilites are good even better if accepted to Apprentice Training Program.
good,"I learned to use NX and be able to remove hangers and pipes that weren't needed anymore for future ships, the workplace was great, everyone was friendly, some days were very busy and some weren't depending on the amount of jobs we had. Management was great"
good,good work place bad people. good parking has some people take will help and some that dont. welding is great and relaxing. hot in sumer cold in winter
good,"I work in a fast-paced, exciting, exacting environment. I enjoy my work but feel I am somewhat overqualified for what I do. I do mostly editing technical documents, and I would prefer to do more writing. Newport News Shipbuilding is a wonderful place to work. There is plenty of opportunity for you to do basically whatever you want there. A typical day at work flies by, as our department handles 3000 documents! I learn something new every day. The management is on your side as long as you keep up with the work. The hardest part of the job is learning to slow down and do a quality job, not a quantity job. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is working with engineers from all over the company."
good,"Good please to work. Good work environment. company is big and managed very well. company build and repair ships for U.S. Navy."
good,"I miss this place. Some of the people were awesome to work with and for. The benefits and pay is great. The work is a lot some days. You get more than just money working for a company like this, it gives to joy. Makes you very proud."
good,Positive attitude can get u through it all. I really have enjoy the environment and the people. I have gained alot of experience during my time here...
good,"As a combination electrician working aboard naval vessels, one would never know which compartment he or she would work in. This fact keeps the work interesting, but many times frustrating. The job is grimy, hot (regardless of season), and sometimes hazardous. It's an exciting place to work! All of the foreman that I worked with treated me fairly, and with about as much respect as one expects in an industrial capacity. Like most industrial jobs, where the work is tiresome and heavy, attitudes can sometimes get a bit 'chippy', but after the day is done, most of us walked out on good terms. As an electrician working aboard a ship, the toughest part, for me, was the heat. The most enjoyable part was the variety of jobs I would find myself doing."
good,"Working at the Shipyard, especially in the Nuclear Program is very different. This job you are working in a clean environment, you only can do what is told by procedures we train and get qualified to. I have worked plenty of the guys for nine years now, and i can honestly say alot of the experienced guy will show you the ropes if you are a person willing to learn. This job is very repetitive and you can easily get complacent, but you have to treat each day like its a new day and ensure the job is performed completly. Overall I have been at the shipyard for nine years, I enjoy my job and the people I work with. All jobs have there ups and down its all in what you make it."
good,"*Very good place to work  "
good,great opportunity .. learned a lot.. dealt with some heavy machinery/ tools. had very good benefits.great work environment . received  a lot of hours!
good,it was a good job fun to come to work and good people to work for.you can lean different trades with in the company.good and bad cowork at the job
good,You get the chance to work on projects associated with and on board Naval Nuclear warships. The work is interesting leading to the ultimate goal of getting warships ready in time to defend our country.
good,"Working at the shipyard requires you to be very attentive to the ships and nuclear carriers that you work on. A typical day at work for me would be reading blue prints, determining the type of insulation that is required to fit the job I'm working on, fastening insulation properly, removing and dispose of insulation properly, use of compressors and most importantly following safety guidelines. You learn how to measure correctly, how to insulate properly, how to weld certain parts together and also about dangerous materials to the human body. Management really cares about the workers their they want to see you succeed at your job. My co-workers at my job are some of the most amazing people, if you don't know how to do a job correctly or need to ask a question they will certainly guide you in the right direction. The hardest part of the job would for me would be going into confine spaces , which are very tight spaces it requires you to be very careful that there aren't ant toxins where you would be working. The most enjoyable part of the job for me would be the learning and experience that I have received from working at my job for so long."
good,"good place to work and learn with educational classes . learned to work in a professional environment ,with skilled people and in management willing to help. id say hardest part was trying to communicate in a loud environment with earplugs in.i enjoyed the friends i met"
good,NNS is a great workplace with a awesome environment everybody from supervisors to your work mates are so open and willing to help you. I have electrician background but never work on a carrier so I had plenty of question and I can I have gotten good answers. I have learned so much about electricity and how it works on a carrier and the hardest part of it all learning the ship with the different levels and frames but I can say I have learned a lot. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I put in a job and when I finish I apply power to it and see it work for the first time; I love finishing a job and watching it work.
good,"Nice place to work if you are in with the in crowd and the good old boy system."
good,Great social and physical atmosphere with great young aspiring  leaders. The employees there are very friendly in assisting you to better your craft.
good,"I was accepted into the Apprentice School in 1981.  The shipyard provided me with a good education and job.  I was able to move up into a management position after I finished the apprentice school.  I thought that the shipyard would protect an apprentice graduate from a RIF, but I ended up loosing my job after 11 years service and never missing time.  I was shocked.  The shipyard hired me back in 2005 and I ended up back in management 1 year later.  I have learned to be flexible in my everyday activities.  Management has been very good to me and has helped me become a very successful person on the deck plate.  I do not find it hard to do my job if I plane ahead and work through issues with others.  I find my job enjoyable because I make it this way.  I work with others and plan my activities  with them based on schedules.  A production job is based on schedules and I intend to meet or beat the schedule."
good,"The Navy changed my life and got me ahead in the outside world.  Not a great place to have a family in the aspect of spending time, but your family will be well taken care of and they will be proud of you."
good,"I enjoyed working at Huntington Ingalls Industries very much. I learned a phenomenal amount of information. I'm sad that I have to leave, but I am ready to return home to Georgia."
good,"The co-workers have been the best. Working conditions, in the field, are made as safe as possible, and the office culture is friendly but down to business. "
good,"I started at the shipyard in Dec. of 1979.  I loved my job and the people I worked with.  Due to the closure of the Shipyard, I was let go in Sept. of 2013.  "
good,"Great supervisers, worked hard. ther is a lot of overtime so that equals out to great pay. if wiling to work all the over time the superviser love that."
good,The Management is pretty typical. They are your friend as much as they can be but they have that line of information that they cant cross that at time affects moral. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the constantly changes in schedule.
good,Meet with crew in the morning discuss safety any concerns we have .We are given our task for the day who our partner may be and off to the job.Meet at lunch and than back to work .At the end of your shift talk about the job and a plan for the next day.
good,"working at NNS for 15 years, went through 3 companies in the IT Shop. These changes were not the best moves for the employees in that when a company bought NNS they'd bring their own and advance them. Hire people who did not have the experience to lead and efficiently supervise the best IT employees in the world."
good,great ability to learn a new skill. You can meet different people and advance quickly. Different work shifts to make extra money and alot of overtime if giving. Welding was a great experience.
good,I learned how to weld( stick and tig ) as well as use a torch. Also learned how to fit and tack pipe.
good,"Everyday when I got to work I would receive my job. I would then start working on it, welding to my best to makes the job is right with no flaws. I welded on Submarines so everything had to be perfect due to the pressure it would take when out at sea. My supervisor was a well rounded guy. He was nice to all his employees, and made sure everyone knew what was expected from them that day. The hardest part of the job was welding in tight areas. Sometimes i wasn't able to see what i was welding on so i had to use a mirror. The thing I enjoyed most about the job was that it was challenging, and it made me a better welder."
good,It is a meaningful place to work. You find a pride about yourself building ships. They have great benefits and holidays. You can make a living. You can become financially stable
good,"Great company to work for that prides themselves on employee safety, that is their number one priority.  Rewards for going above and beyond call of duty."
good,"A great place to work and build a career always learn something new each day. "
good,Really a good atmosphere I enjoy working at HII  the people are helpful and willing to educate and mentor you along the way  I have been back multiple times
good,"While working at Ingalls it took me some time to get used to the culture and working environment, weather. Most co-workers are very cool, management is cool. Miss working there, miss the pay."
good,"Wonderful place to work. There's not enough to be said about the amazing work that is accomplished in the shipyard on such complex machines as Naval vessels. Highly structured and organized, the shipyard has a great deal of advancement opportunities across the board."
good,Great company that promotes diversity and ethics. Working inside the yard in the production areas can present some hazardous situations and safety must be an ongoing practice. Meeting and working with a diverse realm of people who all play an important role in production and customer service.
good,Overall my experience with this employer has been positive. There’s opportunity for advancement if you’re proactive and dependable. The company is very large and different pros/cons emerge in different divisions.
good,best job i ever had. great pay. excellant benefits. very challenging. you are building and repairing US Navy warships. You are responsible for the safety of every Sailor that serves abourd the vessel. it is also their home. hugely rewarding
good,"I loved the fact that my time at HII-NNS was filled with enormous opportunities to grow as a professional.  I was always challenged everyday and was eager to prove myself capable of accomplishing these tasks.  The workplace culture was that of teamwork and along the way I have made lifelong friends.  I was quite upset the day I was laid off but business is business and if that's what it takes to succeed, then I have accepted that fact.  I hope to return one day and pick up where I left off and that was building the BEST ships in the world."
good,"I love Ingalls! It's a little stuffy and, due to the nature of the job (Navy Contracted work), it is very structured and a little rigid. However, it is overall a great place to work. The benefits are fantastic. And the management staff are awesome."
good,Great work environment. Fast paced work place that is surrounded by people of different walks and professional backgrounds. I enjoyed the team environment that allowed work to get done in a timely fashion
good,A very good place to advance your career. The pay and benefits are excellent.  It's very easy to move up in this company and a very supporting cast. Huntington Ingalls Install is the best place to work in the 757 area
good,"Newport News Shipbuilding is a great place to work if you're looking to learn something new everyday.  It's an awesome feeling knowing that your're building/contributing to the security of our nation and participating in a rich legacy of excellence.  If you want stability, consistency, and a steady routine this is available as well.  Newport News Shipbuilding is a place to learn, grow, and advance if you put in the work!"
good,i have nothing but good to say about working for ingalls. they treat you with respect and are willing to work with you if you have any problems on the job. i will will work for them again someday when I'm ready to live in the south for good.
good,This position was to work on the overhaul of aircraft carriers. It provide me many opportunities to get on carriers and explore them. Much of the work was done while sitting at the computer inputting and updating designs. The challenges of meeting mil-specs and modern technology were huge. On the whole this was a great opportunity for me and did a lot to improve my design skills.
good,I enjoyed my job with all of the benefits and good money. I also learned a lot about the shipbuilding process and how it works.I got along with many people and I was a very open enjoyable man that's always motivated to do better in life.
good,"I designed mechanical drawing bull prints for aircraft carriers. I did 3D Modeling and AutoCAD drawings. I learned a lot about ships, submarines and how the shipyard works. Also a lot about the different drafting, image and storage computer programs I worked with there. The shipyard I worked at was owned by Northrop Grumman which was awesome but then changed once the economy went down and one of their brother corporations Huntington Ingalls Industries Communications took over. Management was good for the most part except when figuring out who their strong workers were and how to not micro manage so much. The hardest part was creating the mechanical drawings. The most enjoyable part was working with computers and learning a lot about ships. I really loved working here and hope to get back in that field or with this company some day. I recommend this job to someone who is a quick learner, good with computers and loves to learn."
good,"My typical day, about a mile walk to clock in and another mile to get to my job site. Meet and greet peoples as you are walking, group assessment from your Supervisor with the group. Get your pretend goal for the day and your work leader man check on you for any needs you may have. And at the end of your shift you turn in your paperwork and tell what you have done or not. Bu not me, I was just giving compartment that need to be stencil ad sold for the week. But all in all I love the job but the people was not my original type of people."
good,"Teams grouped in achieving an overall goal."
good,Huntington Ingalls was a good company to gain experience and move up in salary. The retirement benefits however were not so good. You had to work 30 years in order to receive your retirement.

good,Mississippi's largest employer offers job security for so many. Very diverse company that accomplishes so much amazing warships for our country finest.
good,I start every day with a 10 minute scrum meeting. My work helps me learn a lot because of the exposure to participate on every level of software development which includes from writing design document all the way to testing.

I worked as an intern in the maintenance engineering department, and I have never encountered another group of people so passionate and enthusiastic about their work.

I've learned how to pass UT welds using Fcaw, Gmaw, Smaw, and Gtaw on mild steel, stainless, aluminum, and copper nickel. My co-workers are pretty good people just down to earth people. The hardest part of the job is welding in very tight confined spaces where you might have to mirror weld or do very long continuous welds in a small space.

good,"I really enjoyed my job at ingalls ship yard. I was a pipefitter on the day to day, I also work as tool  room attendant, and firewatcher. I was taught a lot from my supervisor and was giving a opportunity to move up in the company."
good,"I would get up about 4:15 am and drive into the shipyard located roughly five miles from my home. Walk about 2.1 miles into the shipyard from the parking lot and onto LPD 26 where I would arrive at my team meeting spot to await my general manager and my supervisor every morning. My GM and supervisor would set out their expectations and schedules and lead us to our areas and we would begin work. I made quite a lot of friends among my crew and we would often help each other when the other would need help, (i.e. moving lines, machine locating, box locating, wire, tools, & air lines). The hardest part of my days included the arduous heat and stair climbing; sometimes a dozen levels at once. I enjoyed the friends I made, the company I kept in my work crew, but overall I loved the welding. The hardest part of my job was moving lines to my area through mazes and tight spots, but I always had the help of my crew. The complications and solutions of it, helping teach the new welders in my crew things they had never thought to try. Helping others and myself to achieve a happy workplace environment, building our Navy Vessels, and welding in general made me happy. I would then get off work at 2:30 and walk back to my car, and maybe make it home by 3:15."

good,Hands down this is the best job I ever had. I only quit to move out of state to try and keep a failing marriage going. Obviously I am divorced now. I started at 10.82 an hour and left making 25.08 and hour. The union reps are idiots so i highly recommend that all new hires read the uniom contract front to back multiple times so you know the rules. I had a couple of issues with personnel aka HR. If I had not known the rules and let the union rep do the talking for me I could of been fired. Attendance is the most important thing at the shipyard. If you miss 2 days in less than two months you will get wrote up. If you aren't there the company can't get paid for you. Its obviously a contract based company so if you don't show up to work they can't bill the navy for your labor. The people as a majority are awesome. I have met some of the most genuine people working at this job.  They will treat you better than family. I still talk to a bunch of the people I used to work with. You will make a lot of new friends. There will be negatives which come with every job but the positive far outweighs the negative.

At the end of the day we are able to go home with a better sense of accomplishment that we did something that no one else would want to do or didn't know how to do. I've lucked up working with some supervisors that took care of their crew. The crew I was working with didn't mind working hard for each other and for the shipyard.
