rating,review
bad,"This was one of the most challenging jobs I had in my career.  I wanted to leave shortly after joining.  Zero work-life balance.  Long hours, little recognition."
bad,Repetitive busy work. Now I need to fill up space with nothing useful because of a 150 character minimum. So I am typing filler to fill up space that is a waste of space.
bad,"The company was purchased by Pfizer for there cancer medication patents and once those patents were acquired, Pfizer quickly sold the company.  The management needs an overhaul."
bad,Nothing to report it was a learning experience from doing something different from working in an office setting it was a short assignment nothing much more to say
bad,"This company is literally the worse place to work. The attrition rate at Hospira is just ridiculous. I worked at the Lake Forest office (Head Quarters)--on average during my term  there; about 60 people got fired on a monthly basis."
bad,I will never go back to this  company. worst experience ever.
bad,Working with Hospira is bad the management is bad. Nothing much  to say.
bad,"Hospira is a great place to work. There are plenty of opportunities to excel in different departments. On a typical day at work i package iv bags to be shipped off. I inspect the iv bags to check for dirty ports, particals inside the bag, leaks etc. The hardest part of my job is simply making sure i dont miss anything, because we are dealing with peoples lives, and one small mistake could cause the death of someone.My co-workers are hilarious. They put a smile on my face everyday that im there and i couldnt ask for a better supervisor, he is awesome!"
bad,"I was the youngest one, everyone else was so serious and didnt really take the time to get to know me and i didnt feel welcome at all. I wasnt comfortable at all."
bad,not a place to work if you have little kids. company doesn't care anything about family only production. poor communication. no room for advancement unless your cool with someone in upper management or you know someone that can help. a lot of bullying from LC and Supervisors
bad,"Management is indecisive, tactical and only focused on making a profit. No focus on quality. No concern for the little guy, who is doing the work."
bad,A typical work day was always great. I worked on a assembly line with a great team. We inspect label and packed products. I also was a back up machine operator.
bad,Employees feel like cattle.  There is little respect or appreciation of employees.  Unprofessional leads and atmosphere of bullies rule.  Very demoralizing in general.  The only satisfied employees might be those working in the nicer positions in management with little idea what it is like on the line.
bad,"The Quality Department at Hospira, San Jose is a hostile work environment.  The Plant Qualtiy Manger often twisted the fact when there was an error.  She thought she is the smartest person and blamed her employees who have no knowledge, and qualification for the job.  She prefers to use ""job security"" as a tool to treat her employees.  If she is still in Hospira, San Jose site, please do not apply job in the quality department at Hospira San Jose site."
bad,"No advantages to working here. Inflexible hours, ambiguous job, no job security."
bad,I gained experience in aseptic technique and handling of samples in a cGMP/cGDP environment. Very large company with many employees.
bad,I learned a lot with some terrible smells. great time driving and operating heavy equipment.it was a part time job during my college school hours. while getting in heavy diesel equipment technology
bad,Hospira is a great upstart for any one looking to get into pharmaceuticals. I would suggest that you get your six months of experience and look for something better. Hospira is flooded with people in management but the people in management lack a lot of knowledge. The decisions they make sometimes don't make sense and can make the job they want you to do harder than what it needs to be. Also alot of times management seem to not care about your safety or needs at or  outside of work they just care you get what they want you to do done.
bad,"Provide quality control of service on biomedical equipment. Provide FDA reportable information on work done, Have a very good crew , work at various hospitals throughout the US  providing FDA required remediation and repair on Hospira products.  Unfortunately, this is a contract position."
bad,"Hospira was acquired by Pfizer in 2015. It was challenging work but ultimately rewarding. Unfortunately, the benefits were comparatively poor and the culture was difficult to work in."
bad,"12 hours shift, not variable of time to be with your family. Not much to learned just do your work. Management don't work with you if you need something, co-workers are very comprehensive"
bad,"Co-workers were the best part of the job. Many possess great work ethic and are helpful as well as fun to work with. "
bad,"Un día normal tenia que llegar a alistar todos los implemento utilizados en el área, aprendí a tener tolerancia y respeto por las demás personas, no se sabia cuales eran los supervisores y jefes inmediatos no existía una estructura organizada de puestos y labores de cada uno específicamente."
bad,"Pulled and processed order that were necessary for hospitals, doctors and clinics. Did this in record time, earning an award for quickest time, all orders,  without errors."
bad,The corporation is extremely top heavy with multiple levels of managers that do not contribute. The individual contributors are left to take on much more than their roles or experience warrant. Advancement is typically only achieved by leaving the company and returning; internal advancement is nearly impossible as the slightest display of competence will get you locked into your current position.
bad,I am currently in college. I am not working right now. I am taking classes this summer.
bad,"No matter what you did you always made a mistake, even if you followed directions 100 present something was wrong or the directions were wrong and you should have known about it. the best thing was some of the people that works there. really good people just hard to make the higher management happy about anything."
bad,"This company was once an Abbott company and spun off 10 years ago. Corrupt upper management has led to poor quality issues, FDA ship holds and an organization that is going under rapidly."
bad,I started working with hospira just to have a job and have money coming in. We worked 12 hour shifts Monday through Thursdays and every other Saturday as well. It was a warehouse job and was very demanding.
bad,the job I had was the money maker for the company and they didn't care about us.  Management treated us like we were stupid and everybody is trying to leave.
bad,"Think things are up in the air there. Not sure of what Phizer will do to them. My division was completely removed, so was I and all my co-workers. So it is a shaky boat."
bad,Hospira was a good company to work for...then we were purchased by Pfizer.  We are a year in they have shuttered or sold several facilities and are in the process of gutting the facility I work at...the current environment is toxic at best.  But hey that's business right.
bad,Learned a lot about pharmaceutical engineering and made a lot of significant contribution.
bad,Not much to say. Closed and bulldozed the plant. Now it is a big open area.
bad,Horrible co-workers.  It is a drama filled environment where nobody minds their own business.  Management is often unprofessional and will speak to you any way they want.
bad,"Long hours and high pressure enviroment."
bad,"highly repetitive, ergonomically unfriendly work area. fellow employees were a joy to work with. at times a very unpredictable schedule."
bad,"Most departments are losing continuity and leadership direction.  Focus is on budgets and projects are being delayed due the reduced manpower and the quality and knowledge of folks who are left.  Too much knowledge is going out the door.  Too many hot shots come in and claim to have the answers, only to find out it is out of control."
bad,"The Austin facility has some good things going for it. A new leadsership team that may finally be able to bring it around. But it may be too little, too late. Unfortunately, it needs a change of culture within its core team of QA, Production and Engineering Directors and Managers. Because you have always done things a certain way, doesn't make it the right way. Otherwise, the facility wouldn't have FDA issues right now. Bringing in new people who are experts in their field is only good if you utilize their talents appropriately. Marginalizing employees who know what they are aking about only makes it worse. Hiring Managers who have no background in the position they are filling compiunds the problems. Remove the pretenders from management positions, suck up your pride, let the subject matter experts you hired do their jobs and this could be a better place to work. I honestly would not recommend anyone consider employment here until these things are fixed."
bad,Hospira is a great company to work for.  I learned so much about the pharmaceutical business while employed there.  The hardest part of the job was that it was a new position so expectations weren't as clear as I would have liked.
bad,Hospira was more interested in getting product out the door than safety and quality. I felt they were lacking in Auditing the process and the Plant. They eventually shut down after I was laid off.
bad,Hospira is very productive place full of hard working people. We really haven't sold that much product this year due to equipment issues. I enjoy working when there is work to do. The management team sucks because they show favoritism in certain people. It is so hard to get promoted in this company. I have been here 6 years. My attendance is not bad. I just want a better oppurtunity. The benefits are great. I have good health insurance.
bad,"Hospira is no longer in business. When I worked there, it was fast paced and stressful. It felt like management watched my every move. I would constantly be running between 5-6 machines, checking product for flaws and packing boxes."
bad,Refuse to update equipment so  that  they are able to compete with other pharmaceutical companies
bad,I enjoy helping people. Its a very fast pace work environment.
bad,"challenging times, not aggressive to gain market share, contracting department is lacking reasonable response times and getting worse, not better even with addition of new contracting software"
good,"•	Manage supplier audits and provide support to supplier quality team for audit preparation"
good,"Not a fun environment to work. Very serious procedure. A lot of filing papers for an assembly job. Hours of work will get in the way of your normal life. If you're a student or do any extra curricular activities outside of work, you can cancel all of those things. This job is tiring and requires a lot of standing and bending over."
good,"Would be nice, but there are too many idiots in the wrong positions. Many people get treated badly there. watch out!"
good,"If you are a engineer you need to look elsewhere. The company is moving R&D out of the US to offshore locations.  "
good,"Dynamic environment of poor decisions and compromised quality for sake of not stopping the show.  The revolving door of workers and more importantly junior/senior levels of management make for a chaotic circus of cyclical failures as each new hire falls into the same traps of poor decisions, lack of understanding, being out of touch with the workforce, and band-aid fixes/ misdirection to deal with quality issues as their predecessors.  As an employee, expect poorly planned and rushed initiatives, band-aid fixes for major issues, compromises to safety and more so mental well-being and work/life balance.   Also, in any position,  excessive overtime may be required due to volume demands, more often, it is needed due to loss of headcount. (Ex. Sanitation dept. pulled 27 days straight, mandatory with a 1 day turn-around).  "
good,To do this job well you need to have a clinical background and savvy sales experience. You will need to be able to work with out much support from the manager/director.
good,"I loved the people I worked with directly. My immediate supervisor was fantastic, fair, knowledgeable and a great mediator."
good,Good stepping stone. Great colleagues.  Management not always connected. Fantastic customers.  Recurrent supply issues.
good,Typical day at work was a little chaotic - lot of fire fighting.  I learned how to ensure compliance with FDA and other regulatory bodies' compliance standards.  I enjoyed the challenge of cultural transformation.
good,"Under previous leadership, there was a sense of family within the department and a more of a relaxed atmosphere. That is now a thing of the past. More structure and better communication among the group is needed."
good,Every day was a stressful day. The expectations was over board with improper equipment to perform jobs. The pay was well under the job requirements.
good,"good benefits , but now you will be a temp for a long time"
good,"Ive been with the for a while now, and it seems to be going down hill."
good,In general people is nice and is willing to drive for results.
good,This does not value a work life balance. The hardest part are the short deadlines and long hours.
good,"Buen ambiente, algunos buenos beneficios, pero salarios muy bajos"
good,"It's a good place to gain experience after college.  However, there is little room for advancement and there is a large turnover in management."
good,"Worked lots of weekends, long work days, and the location is not ideal"
good,a nice company to work for.  people there are hard workers.  management was there to help their employees.  the position I had was never boring.
good,"Times change. Corporate leaders remain greedy yet it's how the world works."
good,"I worked here for years and unable to move ahead."
good,"Not a good place to work, people felt like the direction was constantly changing, people were  just not friendly,information wasn't shared among others"
good,"Training was good here, and work load was bearable.  Unfortunately, regulatory problems deteriorated the quality of the company.  Most of the residual Abbott benefits slowly eroded over time."
good,Should improve management aspect more effectively and treat all employees equally and employee benefit should be increased to a reliable amount . That way company can please its employee.
good,I got hired on as a contractor and work there for a year. Once i worked i never felt like the culture want to change or improve. I was a quality engineer. Management want to have free improve idea that would improve yields ten folds. Work days with 4-3-3-4 schedule. 12 hours days when you worked. Culture there especially on night shift was not a place were people wanted to be. Day shift was more alive but not as productive. overall this place was not a place for me to thrive in being an EE or engineer for that matter.
good,"Empresa Multinacional , problemas en la comunicación y complicaciones generadas por la diferencia reglamentaria en cada país generaba que ciertas cosas demoraran mas que otras en realizarse."
good,It has been a learning experience. 12 hour shift work takes a while to get used to. Performance based raises are not really based on performance.
good,"Hospira is a great job if you are college graduate or if you would like  your career to be in the pharmaceutical industry .  Working here has increased my documentation skills while paying close attention to detail listed under standard operating procedures.  During FDA audits, I am comfortable interacting with the auditors should they question me about my daily procedures.  My co-workers are great people and make my days better when protocol testing becomes chaotic. For the most part, they are all young college graduates like myself.  However,  I see little room for advancement within this company due to upper management.  I am ready to pursue my science degree in the energy sector rather than the pharmaceutical sector."
good,Fast paced environment.Large volume of products to keep detailed records on during service. Time management is very important. Great team members. Hardest part of the job is keeping team motivated at times. The most enjoyable part is successfully completing projects.
good,"A typical day at Hospira is ok, what I learned is advancing wellness through the right people and right products. Management is ok, but I feel like they should have a balance as far as caring about the people and their self. My co-worker are ok, but my focus is more so on my job and doing it the right way at in a timely manner. I'd have to say the hardest part of my job is moving slow in the core, thats hard because I'm a fast worker. The most enjoyable part of my job is basically making sure I'm doing my job the right way, and making sure the customers get what they need!"
good,Worked at Hospira for two years. Met some of the nicest people and people from different parts of the world. Can be stressful at times as we had to meet targets on a daily basis.
good,The workload here was elevated. The sample/result expectations was rushed. Training was great for the most part. Quality Assurance and Quality Control could work better together. Work interruption by QA was almost a daily occurrence.
good,This company closed. Basic molds with high temp. Prepare parts for health. Its resin in high pressure. When mold open give more than 100 parts for lab and hospital process.
good,"Involved with a lots of online training."
good,"Trabajo en terreno , gestión de ventas a instituciones de salud tanto publicas y privadas ."
good,"As a first place to start a career as an analytical or data review chemist this is a great place to start.  Expect to learn the expectations of a cGMP environment in a fast paced environment.  Learn the company's phraseology of Ownership: Safety, Attendance, 5Ss, Continuous Opportunities Program, and more.  Carolina Star initiative means every month you provide feedback on successes and improvement suggestions.  Patients always come first, so make attendance a top priority.  Local residence is your best choice for successful employment, especially during inclement weather.  Other ownership opportunities may be experienced directly and with great reward depending on the degree of personal contribution."
good,Chemical manufacturing of biosimilars that touches every corner of the globe. Typical to bring in new hires that have experience outside of the company.
good,"This was a great place to work when first started, but went downhill very fast, especially the last few years."
good,Requires you to start on the night shift. this does not work for some people.
good,The hardest part of my job is watching our company continue to make the same mistakes over and over again.  Management manages back orders not people. In addition; the company does not reward  employees for putting in hard work and long hours including weekends.
good,"I release back orders for Hospira's emergency stock, release on-line orders, complete on-line registrations for ordering, re-set passwords for on-line ordering, do manual Pedigree authentications and do credit rebills."
good,"Need to make a change, working and doing your job plus 2 other people jobs made this job very stressful and taking a toll on my health. Some management were very unprofessional, showed no concern to employees, very disrespectful and never show the employees any appreciation for great work."
good,"A typical day would involve meeting on the manufacturing floor where we would discuss issues found on the service lines. I would also have to review and approve the testing performed by the Testing and Investigation department to ensure that the testing was performed and documented to the standards set out by the FDA. I would also have to work with groups on projects such as new part launches, high level quality system investigations, engineering studies, and audit preparations"
good,"Management has issues but my overall issues are not with the job or my co-workers, rather the actual management technique and how the employees are handled. We are hard workers and try to go above and beyond."
good,"I worked for Hospira Buffalo (and previously with Abbott Laboratories) for 34 years as a process technician. A management decision to cut our Sunday premium days resulted in a large loss of income that made me have to retire or I would have lost my house. Was,for years,a great place to be proud to work for but in recent years became worse and worse for those carrying the workload. Many other poor management decisions also led to this. By the time I left they had no plan. Insisted on using a "" gun to your head "" mentality that drove the stress levels into the upper stratosphere and the 12 hour shifts for all those years led me to retire for my own well being, otherwise, I would still be working there and they wouldn't be looking to fill tech jobs. Many other employees felt the same way over the past 2-3 years and also took this action. Also, Hospira took away many retiree benefits when Abbott spun them off into Hospira in 2004. Even though they paid well-money isn't everything. They dropped the ball not training people when they knew people were retiring and thus lost valuable knowledge and experience and forced those left to pick up the slack."
good,"nice place to work, if you would like to have experience working in a plant"
good,"Hospira provide a challenging and learning environment where there are plenty of opportunities to ""shine"". However like any other large company management is slow to adopt changes and make decisions."
good,"Depending what area being worked, the day starts by gathering data to find our where things stand with the schedule."
good,"I thought that the business could be ran better, it was time we would show up to work with nothing to do.  The place look at certain people differently."
good,"Felt like i couldn't grow no matter how hard I worked. Management didn't listen to employees' ideas. Couldn't advance, seemed like the culture wasn't diverse."
good,Company had 12 hours shift but the supervisors were active 24/7 a week. Management was flexible and understandable about production issues. Management did not want to improve their processes
good,"Every day was a challenge dealing with multiple overworked and stressed employees in various departments.  Management has panicked response and high sensitivity to any auditing body including Corporate, FDA, or any foreign country representatives. Extremely difficult to adhere fully to lab procedures with manufacturing managers putting pressure on labs for results, especially when non-compliance results are being confirmed.  Co-workers were generally great to work with.  Multi-tasking and wearing ""many hats"" were some improved upon skills learned in the work environment provided.  Expect to work long hours and weekends if a salary position is sought.  There were enjoyable moments and opportunity for learning when working with vendors on equipment whether it was a preventative maintenance task or newly purchased equipment."
good,"The people were always a joy to be around, which made coming to work a lot more enjoyable. It's a fast paced environment, which I also love because it makes time fly by."
good,"Bad and mad supervisor"
good,Great working atmospher an great product. I would also like to see the company expand even more! Would enjoy moving up more within the company soon.
good,"As a production operator you had mandatory overtime over the coarse of your work week , keep up with standardized operating procedures, and fill out a log book on what product you were working on."
good,Hospira has been a good place to work.  Have learned a lot but unfortunately they are closing.  The management has been changing frequently in the past year I believe due to the sale.  The hardest part of my job has been the increase in hours due to the sale.  The most enjoyable part of my job has been my fellow employees.
good,I have a good manager that has helped me grow in leadership skills.
good,"At Hospira I learned how valuable it is to work as a team. Majority of the task required was a two to three person job. If one person struggles in an area its up to the team to help, encourage and train there partner so that the overall work goal was achieved."
good,New senior leadership taking ownership in rebuilding the foundation.
good,Very demanding management. Not very understanding or compassionate towards family issues.
good,Job is based on accuracy picking at a fast rate. Easy to make mistakes. Company work well with you. Good work environment. On forklift picking for 6+ hours
good,Hospira was a spin off of Abbott more than 10 years ago and was recently acquired by Pfizer for their biosimilars business as Pfizer was looking for growth to fill their pipeline as their drugs were coming off of patents.
good,I was hired to conduct quality investigations. Something I thought I was clearly unqualified to do. I was able to do well in this assignment but was let go due to issues they were having with my manager who has since been let go. This facility is now Pfizer.
good,"Hospira, attained a new CEO and the environment changed to a bottom line driven enterprise with no regard for employee satisfaction.  The end result was a sale to Pfizer, guess the cost cutting worked!"
good,It's been a long time since I worked at Hospira but what I can remember is I always enjoyed going to work.  I gained a lot of experience and really enjoyed the people.
good,They started putting the quantity of products being sent out in front of the safety and quality of products being put out. As a line mechanic I was not happy with how they would hurry batches to make their numbers. I felt like safety was being put on the back burner. That's why I left.
good,"Benefits were very good, however, the Engineering Department was in a constant state of flux, managers were hired to run departments with no experience in the field and a perception of favoritism and inappropriateness prevailed with the Department Director."
good,"typical day at work - routine with some challenges"
good,"Organization is very driven by doing what is right for the customer, and delivering top quality products.  Highly matrixed organization that remains effective."
good,It was hard to make hours & even minimum wage.. not working everyday but have to work 12 hrs.. Also the way to apply for jobs & tricky questions will also get you not hired
good,"The work was steady and depending on customer need could be demanding. The work environment could be pleasant but I found that there were some groups of people that still acted like high school and formed their own cliques. If you are one that focuses on your work and can manage your own schedule, you will do fine. The management was great. I had an illness which could pop-up with little warning and they were very understanding as long as I still got my work done by deadline."
good,"Once Pfizer bought Hospira, we had to get used to working with Pfizer's way of performing operations. In Hospira, where I was a QA Label Editor (in the Quality Systems Division), I performed change control and redlining, updating specifications and labels. Once Pfizer took over, my group fell under their Regulatory Affairs and Safety Division, however I performed the same functions as I did when under Hospira's Quality Systems Division."
good,The company was a good place to work with smart people and a fun culture. However with senior management churn the culture eroded. Upward mobility was limited due to constant change in strategy and focus in IT.
good,Amazing company. Management is outstanding a great job with work life balance that you will enjoy. This is a place that everyone should work.
good,"Good place to work for beginners. It gives space for freshers to learn more. It would be really great if management encourages new ideas, pro-activeness in job."
good,After working in telecom for 30+ years Hospira introduced me to the world of medical devices and associated software. Got to understand better how a highly regulated industry worked
good,Some of the peoplea re dinosaurs that have very little skills. The palce uses old systems from the 70s. if you want to get something done quickly this is not the place for you since the culture is so resistant to change.
good,"Hospira was great place to work until Pfizer took over and created a negative culture.  Hospira was full of dedicated, hard working employees that did what it took to get the job done"
good,"Good place to work, fast pace, good trainers good food, place cleaner, my work there was a great experience for me this was my 1st real job graduating from HS"
good,being safe and quality care for product packing and shipping.   one of the most important things to learn is accountability. Every product must be account for especially controlled drugs. must be alert you and your co workers.
good,"Supportive management but very busy and challenging place to work.Very large company that offers many opportunities to learn. "
good,"Performed functional test to confirm Customer complaint. Troubleshooting return device to component level. Entered test result to INET system, SAP system, and Track wise system. I also worked for Reliability Lab Engineering Technician III conduct test in Reliability /QA lab to assure product meets/exceed specifications. Performed reliability testing and prepare reports on results."
good,"Great people to work with but equipment was outdated and there were maintenance issues daily, main reason they decided to close facility permanently. Overall, I was able to acquire valuable experience in a portion of my field of study and how to troubleshoot issues as they arose."
good,"Just work the lines,how medicine is made. Management can sometimes not know what to do but ones that do try to help you learn things about the company.Co workers are the same help if they can. The hardest part non thing really. Learning the different medicine that are being made."
good,"Enjoyed the people I worked with. Management not very friendly."
good,The pay is good. The work environment is very negative. The employees do not care.
good,"typical day was 13hrs long, very face paced and you worked on own but closed as a group.I was promoted very quickly and learned alot in the ways of how to communicate to my team and conflict resolution and things like that.Hardest part was waking up at 4am to be at work by 530. best part was i knew the work i was doing was going to help save lives."
good,Very strong management and global direction. Diverse engineering and global capital involvement.
good,An evolving pharmaceutical manufacturing company. Heavily investing in quality improvements.
good,"I learned a lot of things but working here would not work with my school schedule. Some people there made it not enjoyable to work there but I overlooked it. Also because of the huge staff, there wasn't really any room for training opportunities or getting hired from temp."
good,"This job was a good experience and a job i felt that coming to work and providing my skills was something i wanted to do for the long run,"
good,"Light testing medications, good management just hard to get on full time"
good,Being a generics manufacturer the company must make the most product in the shortest amount of time. You have to work 6 days /week most weeks. Located in a nice area 1 Hr East of Raleigh. People are usually very nice. Housing is very reasonable.
good,"Learned manufacturing standards and operations, looking constantly for lean manufacturing opportunities and maximum uptime."
good,Production is high there. Everything that is used for a person (medicines by vein) is made in hospira
good,"The work place were under a lot of pressure in response to the regulatory mandate that the department was subject to."
good,12-14 hour days required to meet compliance needs and coach/mentor global employees.  Expectations to complete project deliverables as quickly as possible while maintaining compliance.
good,"Validation activity management and execution"
good,"There is always an opportunity to make over time with this company. In the department I was located in they were supportive of each other, and always worked as a team. Great Place to work over all"
good,". Daily basis we come in to mix solution using batch and records logbooks. We build pumps and filter to transfer solution. We also have a schedule that is printed to base you batch around to meet the lines need. Self governing job. Hardest part of the job is keeping up with the paper working making sure that it is accurate 100 percent of the time to insure that the medicine is made the right time all the time. I enjoy the constant change on a night to night base as far as the batches you may make,"
good,Hospira was bought out by the Pfizer corporation. Restructuring of the business model occurred at all levels of the organization.
good,Monday through friday normal hours with no overtime-necessary however a huge turn around of many posiitons
good,"Manage project workstream and team"
good,The environment was not conducive at all for minority advancement.
good,"Working for Hospira I took a lot of things for granted, that i value so much now. It was a super place to work."
good,"The job is good and it pays well, however the situation that we are sometimes faced with on a daily basis gets a little hard. Their seems to be a lot of favoritism amongst the team and of course with this, some people get treated better than others. They get easier work than others. But overall it is a great job and a great opportunity. As long as you stay out of the drama then you will be just fine."
good,Working with the Global Teams is always a great experience.
good,I enjoyed working in the Clinical Operations department. There was a wealth of information that could ascertain when working on the clinical studies. It was a great opportunity to learn about Clinical trials.
good,"Day started with huddle meeting to review daily and weekly objectives."
good,"filling bags on IV line"
good,"Good place to work for the most part. Overtime was not a problem. work schedule was good, hours were good. Just needed better management and a lot of favoritism which I didn't like."
good,"A typical day at work was hectic. Due to the long hours, the breaks for not long enough, Working for a temporary agent that don't support their employers. The point/absence systems sucks. Supervisor determines if the day counts against you or not. Which was unfair considering favoritism and seniority. The work was fairly easy! The hardest part of the job when the machines were down and no work was available."
good,Great place to work before being acquired by Pfizer.  Many challenging opportunities for growth and advancement.  It also provided mentors for individuals seeking to grow their careers.
good,They continue to rebuild there IT department as they out sourced to an off shored provider that did not exceed any projects or implantation.  Project teams are well managed and processes keep business moving.
good,"A routine production job."
good,"Hospira was initially an exciting place to work. The new R&D building, new logo, and new direction had everyone hoping for long success. Sadly, optimism changed with the weekly layoff meetings in 2009. New owners now."
good,"One of the best moment of the day was at begin of the each shift, the interaction with the partner between shift, it was necessary to share information for keep the right workplace condition and functionality."
good,"At Hospira,i worked third shift. I would get to my job atleast fifteen minutes early to have extra time find a good parking space,put my food in the cafeteria,put on my correct safety materials to prepare for work, and then clock in.A typical night there for me was basically inspecting IV bags ,sterilizing IV bags, taking care of rejects and reclaims, and participating with line clearance. My job helped me learn alot of new things within the job force that i had never heard of,and i enjoyed learning then doing it all.My Management team,supervisors,were a great team.For the most part we all got along and helped eachother.Same as for my co-workers.The hardest part of the job for me was cutting up the rejects and then using a huge bucket to dump out the solution.The most enjoyable part was everything,i loved my job,i loved most of everybody i worked with we all found a way of our own to get along with eachother and helping eachother out.It was a new and different experience for me and i wouldnt trade it for nothing."
good,"Good people to work with,good company,not to well on advanvement"
good,nice  people too bad  they moved all out of state to save a few dollars.   I calibrated  replaced or repaired equipment to support  production   nice coworkers willing to help you.
good,"A temp to hire position.........Which means, temp till the company filled its quota. Your let go till the next big order needs to be filled. Doesnt matter now, the company moved to China."
good,didnt like the 12hour shift especially by it been  night shift 8 in the morning to 8 at night work so many days on n have so many off  not enough time for my babies
good,My day to day duties- 
good,"I work second shift and could work all the overtime I wanted."
good,Empresa com ótimos equipamentos hospitalares e bom nome no mercado.
good,I had horrible management including human resources. Enjoyed the job before kids. Didn't like working 12 hours after kids. Good pay and nice working environment. You can learn a lot and get good experience for future jobs.
good,"A typical day is routine.  I learned how to clean for making drugs."
good,"I love my job and the customers I serve.  However, we are challenged by GPO contracting and not able to truly sell our products..  Strong pipeline of products on the horizon but sales will be dependent on GPO awards.  This is the toughest part of my job."
good,"Pues a decir verdad mi paso por ahí fue un poco efímero ya que en el puesto de jefe que tenía, no había ni posibilidades de ascenso ni de aumentos, todo era en función de realizar tareas muy alejadas a mi campo de acción"
good,Empresa con beneficios pero poca estabilidad  al ser salario muy bajo.
good,"Wear ""bunny suit"" enter vault,disinfect clothes go to bay to start working check and inspect iv-bags for defects report hourly about product keep data report"
good,"Co-Workers are hard working people and willing to help you out.  "
good,"Hospira is a good place to start a career in the pharmaceutical industry but my only complaint is that legacy workers aren't treated as fairly as people who come straight out of college in terms of job advancement. If you want to advance at this company and you've been there for 10+ years, its all in who you know."
good,I store information to our own database everyday. I have learned how to multi task and learn from my mistakes. The management is very friendly and respectful. My co-workers are very professional and productive. The hardest part of my job is satisfying my customers everyday. The thing I enjoy the most about my job is that it lets me practice my strengths everyday.
good,"Well paid for the work you do, Several shift options available depending on your job title. Good work environment with over 2500 employees. Always busy."
good,"Decent job to work at. It just sucks that majority of people got laid off.                                                      "
good,Did not enjoy clinical as much as my temporary Regulatory Affairs job that I had for 2 years at Hospira. It had very little time for people who worked there in that area and management along with communication was very poor.
good,Es una muy buena empresa para laborar y execelente servicio
good,I worked at Hospira a couple of years back.  Overall it was a great job.  The pay was okay.  I think recently the company was bought out by Pfizer.  Overall it was a cool place to work.
good,"The hardest part of the job was making sure that the job procedure was done exactly to the SOP.  I found working here was a good learning exp. Overall, working environment was clean and quiet."
good,"The project was a short one (5 month contract), and there was sometimes a lack of direction by Hospira directors/managers regarding what information they wanted in the reports."
good,ok to work i was a biomedical equipment field service technician and it was 100% travel and paid pretty good. would not wanted to have done it long term but it was temp anyway
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at Hospira. Nice place and colleagues. Part of operations team, handling tickets and configuring the cisco devices. Learnt many new things."
good,"Knowing that I done my best to satisfy out customers in the pharmaceutical industry."
good,Great team of dedicated employees. The hardest part of the job is the long hours required to meet established goals. The best part of the job is the satisfaction of completing assignments and providing quality results for the customers.
good,"The typical work day is usually rather busy, you never know what you are going to walk in to. I have learned a great deal of time management and professionalism while working at Hospira. My co-workers are fun to be around and supportive when it comes to completing daily tasks. The hardest part of the job is time management and being able to multi-task on a day to day basis. Everything we do is based on the clock and sometimes it gets difficult trying to juggle everything at the same time. The most enjoyable part about the job is the satifaction that I get out of being able to say that I made a difference in someone's life by providing the field with beneficial medicine."
good,Hospira is a pharmaceutical lab that produces 80% of the medacines that are provided through hospitals and pharmacy's worldwide. Very good pay as well as benefits.
good,"as product manager for medication safety software in pharma company , i am learning a lot from the friendly environment"
good,"I began working at Abbott Labs and became a literature analyst when the company spun off as Hospira in 2004.  I enjoyed reviewing peer reviewed journals.  Journals were reviewed and assessed to see if they contained adverse events associated with our drug products.  Reports would for the adverse events would then be drafted and submitted to the FDA."
good,The operating environment is generally professional yet casual. Depending on one’s position there are opportunities to stretch beyond the basics of your position.
good,I wasn't on the engineer side of things I just did data entry so it was pretty normal day to day work. All the people that work there were very nice.
good,A typical day at work is what it is for me. Coworkers are helpful and the management does their job. Overall I would say that it is just a job.
good,I enjoyed working will my team.  We all had a goal and vision.  This is a good company.
good,"A typical day at Hospira is busy but fun.  Answering emails, contacting customers, attending emails and managing one's workflow are the main things one does."
good,Excellent company with excellent career opportunities. Would recommend this company to all interested in working within the pharmaceutical industry.
good,"Es una buena empresa para trabajar, el ambiente es muy agradable y la dirección del Dpto. Medico es muy buena"
good,"Contract position with Hospira. Temp to hire Position. Worked on packaging line, for more information see Resume."
good,"SAP PA and OM Configuration"
good,The typical day at Hospira was unpredictable . I've learned from this job the importance of satisfying customers. The management was unprofessional in many ways and very disrespectful. The co- workers was awesome. The most hardest part of the job I performed was the last minute schedule changes. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co- workers and the awesome teamwork.
good,Overtime available if hourly employee since factory runs 24/7
good,Advancing wellness through the right people and the right products.
good,I like to work but more than anything I like to serve and to leave a very good impression while I am on site and after I leave.
good,Perform lab tests to make sure that the sterilizers are working properly.  I have aquired great project management skills and work very well independently.  I get along good with my co-workers.  If there is a problem we address them and talk them out.  Some weeks may require unscheduled overtime but that's all in a day's work.  The most enjoyable part of my job is learning new things.  Each day seem to bring a new adventure.
good,"Good culture, strong retirement benefits.  All around a good place to work."
good,"sampling testing packing printing labeling shipping "
good,we worked on an assembly line so everything was scheduled and very ordered.
good,On average I process approximately 15 background checks daily. I perform drug screens from as many as 4 a week to 4 a day.  In processing background checks I have to follow up with documents.  Keep an eye for fraudulent information.  Generate a report for the requesting HR Manager and submit my findings.  Background checks are processed for Hospira worldwide.  I do have a pretty good solid team.  There are three of us.  I am the only one full time. The other two are part time.  The hardest part of my job would be trying to follow up with one of my coworkers candidates.
good,"Inspected finished products for quality and adherence to customer specifications, sorted"
good,"I was hired to work as a contractor at the Lake Forest, IL location. I found the company to be very pleasant with a professional work environment. It is filled with friendly smart people. Most hold advanced college degrees. However, the employees definitely keep to themselves. They are serious about their jobs. There is NO fun happening here. Keep your nose to the grind-stone, do your job, collect your paycheck and that's about it -- this is how I would describe the company. Perhaps the lay offs over the last several have impacted those employees left at the company today. I wasn't able to really read the Culture/Values of the company, so for this reason I gave it two stars. I live in the city, so I worked flex hours and was home by 4:30 pm, which was/is great (especially during the summer months). I found that the group of high level managers that I worked with were very competent, but very indecisive when it came to reaching a final decision and going with it. Some managers lacked leadership skills in a major way. I also found that everything was ""urgent"" so prioritizing projects became challenging. If I were offered a job at this particular company, I may consider it but wouldn't jump at the first offer."
good,"A typical day is never typical at Hospira.  There are always opportunities to learn something new everyday. It is a fast paced environment which is great, one can never get bored. Management is supportive in daily activities and appreciative to those that go the extra mile. The hardest part of the job can be the conflicting priorities and the off-balance work life-balance, but even that is getting better. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I can positively impact a patient by doing a good job everyday. The greatest benefit of working here are the casual fridays, every Friday is Jeans day!"
good,If I would have been able to interact more with customers this job would have been wonderful!
good,Hospira provides many needed services to increase the quality of life.
good,"Hospira is a very decent place to work, but does limit one from being creative due to FDA restrictions."
good,"Empresa surgida de la separación de parte de la línea de hospitales (incluyendo casi todos los directivos) de Abbott."
good,"Inside an Aseptic Fill line, either operating, repairing setting up to operate the line."
good,Hospira allowed the individual to grow in the job and advance if the employee had the motivation and drive to do so. I think that is all you can ask of a corporation.
good,Assembly of hospital/medical devices.  This was a temporary job through a temp agency so ended when the assignment ended.  Not a bad job if you like the assembly environment but very uninteresting and repetitive work.
good,"Worked on line that achieved 100% of quality goals. Perform product manufacturing tasks on assembly lines, ensure the products get processed in right order and are inserted into the machinery in correct manner."
good,I held different positions at Hospira and felt valued and was promoted  within the years that I was there.  The one area that I felt needed to be addressed was salary.  I did discover that women were paid less than their men counterparts.  I attempted to address with my manager but he did not respond to my concern.
good,"Hospira was a great place to work. While processes were often difficult to work through we had a say in how things were done. We had the ability to innovate, management listened to ideas and helped us make them happen. The Pfizer takeover changed it to where we no longer have input in how things are done. Issues and problems are not addressed. People are losing jobs to overseas contractors."
good,"Answer incoming phone calls and emails regarding the status of orders and products, processing discrepancies in deliveries."
good,"An off-shoot of Abbott Labs, the company is successful in producing infusion pumps, even though recently it has been purchased by Pfizer.  It had a good work environment and the people were good to work with.  Not sure if infusion pumps will be part of Pfizer's future."
good,"Good benefits. Good pay. Procurement organization needs work to be best in class. Not very strategic."
good,My typical day consists of various duties. Mainly administrative in nature.  My co-workers are pleasant and helpful.  The hardest part of the job is anticipating work load.  The most enjoyable part is the variety of work and the challenges I face.
good,The company is fairly good. It has good and bad qualities like any job. If you would like to know more please don't hesitate to ask.
good,Audit electronic lab notebooks. weekly send emails to analysts as reminders to close outstanding experiments.
good,"Expected to stay until the work is done, but no overtime pay because salaried. QA doesn't get time off for Plant Shut-downs, but allowed to take off other times of year!"
good,"Overall I liked Hospira. I learned an enormous amount about Quality and Stability in particular. I enjoyed most of my coworkers. The pay was decent. I had a decent amount of vacation and work hour flexibility. The management I personally dealt with were very supportive. The only issue I had was after a difficult FDA audit, caused by cutting of corners we shouldn't have, the work increase tremendously and the stress was high. I believe a lot of those issue that lead to the difficult FDA audit have been cleared up now though"
good,Same as Hospira a Pfizer Company.  Right now I work an eight hour day Monday through Friday. previously I have worked nights for 11 years.  On both twelve and 8 hour shifts.
good,Hospira was a good work place to be able to learn and grow with the various different jobs throughout the plant. The culture there was very fast paced and the ability to be cross trained was readily available.
good,"This work place is a fast pace environment.  You learn a lot about medicines, machines.  The work place is sometimes hecked and loud and the machines break down but they have good hours."
good,Hospira is a productive/competitive company to work for with many perks to offer. I worked many jobs and gained many skills while working at Hospira.  I trained and became very valuable to the company.  I completed my job and help others to complete theirs. Management was in place but of course needed help like any other company or industrial. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the demands that was out of my control. The most enjoyable part of the job was coming to the end of the day and knowing I've accomplished my job and the company had benefited from me completing my job.
good,I was able to work from home most of the time and work/life balance was great.  Our product was bought out by and individual company that had never led a healthcare company before and was noticed.
good,"If you are searching for an entry level job Hospira was a great choice however, Hospira is now Pfizer. "
good,"Enjoyed my time there.  Field sales should be commended for the heavy lifting they do everyday, making sure that their customers are treated and serviced to the utmost."
good,"Worked for a short time, management and work culture were good. They had work from home, which was nice. As a business analyst, learned more from business perspective."
good,"Its a good place to work as a verification engineer, except that the work have no future, no new things to learn. But people here are so good and helpful if we have any questions and are happy to help."
good,"Most days were fast paced with multi-tasking and slightly different experiences. The longer I worked there the more competent I became with the product lines I supported. I also cross trained on product lines I didn't personally support so that I could assist them during their peak times."
good,"I have found Hospias's Clayton plant a good place to work, but Hospira has decided to close this site at the beginning of July."
good,"Worked 12 hour shifts. Great pay. Great job. assisted in the production of IV bags and filling IV bags with solution. The co-workers made the day go by faster, The job wasn't hard at all. Just long hours. But after awhile you get used to it."
good,"The best part of my job is my awesome boss, and wonderful and supportive coworkers. I receive occasional perks such as some Holidays paid off and employee appreciation lunches, however my position is contracted with Kelly Services and can be terminated at any time. A typical day includes answering calls, contacting new accounts and facilitating the registration and return of medical devices. The work enviornment is not very stressfull and our department manager allows us as many breaks as needed. I specifically work with a team of (5) people on recall related projects."
good,"You will improve industry knowledge tremendously due to the size and complexity of this site. Current leadership is focused, a bit short on mid-level management talent, need to improve in that area. Lots of young talent brought in, after a few years of growth if able to maintain will have bright future. The most enjoyable thing about workng here is knowing the impact you have on Global Healthcare and how rewarding it is to get products back on the market and truly improve this sites performance."
good,Requires a lot of traveling and spending most of the time away from home.
good,"Empresa boa em se trabalhar, com bons salarios e beneficios. Sai pois eu era free lance e nao clt"
good,A typical day at work was just running my line making sure things were right
good,"Productive workplace"
good,"This is a true professional company and the employees behave like real people, down to earth etc.  "
good,it was a very balanced palce to work i especially like getting paid every week. I had a great experience working there. It allowed me time to cross train on some jobs. And a chance to experience leadership
good,Focus on team work.  Never felt that people were throwing you under the bus.  Worked as a team. OWN IT was an important part of the culture.  Encouraged employees to offer feedback to manager.
good,Great place to gain experience if you are given the chance to advance in positions. Management is somewhat transparent when it comes to status of  company.
good,"Nice company to work, but there is no permanent position for this job. Very nice people to work with. Small company with advantage of moving up if employee."
good,my cow works and management where great some of the best people i have ever worked for and with the job was hard physically and mentally stimulating as you always had to learn to operate new machines and equipment i loved the learning everyday there was something new to learn
good,An FDA required supply quality agreement project provided an opportunity to work individually and within teams to develop a robust supplier quality program for both pharmaceuticals material suppliers and medical device parts suppliers.  Much independent time and solo responsibilities were experienced to achieve the quality agreements required for the program to be successful.  Goals and and commitments were met.
good,I enjoy working with the kids that had  special needs.  Knowing that I helped mold a life that someday will become a productive person in society.  Education is very important and most kids don't take it serious so I was able to speak a lot of it's importance.
good,"Enjoyed the atmosphere,good people.Every day was a learning curve especially when new projects were being performed."
good,Hospira is a good company to work for.  There are opportunities for advancement and development.  Hospira is now being acquired by Pfizer.
good,Hospira was a vibrant company when first spun away from Abbott Laboratories; it will be hard to watch Hospira fade away with the closing of the Pfizer transaction.  I wish all of my co-workers well and hope they all achieve success with either Pfizer or another company lucky enough to employ them.
good,"wonderful work environment with smart people, I enjoy coming to work here everyday. It is great. great company where you can learn new things with an excellent and skilled team"
good,Great place to work uncertain with acquisition by Pfizer present staff and management are very much customer focused and results oriented
good,"The people that I work with make this job! The organisation has not been great however. The transition to a new site has been very poorly managed and has impacted negatively on many of us. On the whole, the job is enjoyable and sometimes challenging."
good,A lot of training great coworkers. Great lunch room and nice cafeteria employes . You get to learn how to work in a clean room and how to be aseptic. You get a lot of isotrain every week  other wise it is not a hard job.
good,"Hospira is a great company to work for.  The quality system is very solid and everyone works to achieve the same goal which is to produce products for those in need.  An average work day requires a lot of walking and moving as it can be a very fast paced and sometimes very demanding.  I thoroughly enjoy the morale as there are lots of great individuals that work for Hospira.  Overall, it is a great place to work however the opportunity to advance seems limited."
good,Every day had challenging work and can achieve the company and personal targets.
good,Good place to work back when they were involved in several different businesses. Great benefits and pay was good
good,"Hospira has lots to offer if given the opportunity.  Really depends on the Supervisor you have. They tend to pick out what they want not really what works for this company. A lot of good workers are overlooked.  The job here at Hospira is very important it deals with peoples lives all over the world. It is a pharmaceutical plant in which the drugs that are compounded here go to clinics and many hospitals. I have worked in the medical office and now have had the opportunity to see where the products that help us feel better and save our lives come from. Co workers come and go here. Not meaning they leave the plant they transfer around. The hardest part of the job is knowing you are human and could miss something so easy, and you have to live with that thought day in and day out. The most enjoyable part of my job is that we get a chance to possibly save a life."
good,•	Involved in requirements gathering. Interacted with customer to understand business requirements.  •	Created process flow documentation.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work overtime for fellow co-workers. I learn how to deal with different personalities.
good,"The environment at Hospira was friendly and yet professional. My work day began at 6:00am and ended at 2:30pm, with a half hour lunch. My daily routine would be to pick up work orders from our warehouse, then separate and distribute the orders between myself and customer service reps. From there on most of the day was spent at my desk calculating charges on repairs and parts for medical pumps, then invoicing the customer. Although my co-workers and I were separated by high-walled cubicles, we were able to help and socialize with each other on a regular bases which I enjoyed. The most challenging part of the job usually came when there were problems with our systems in generating an invoice and we had to manipulate the application in hopes of producing an invoice."
good,This company was bought by Pfizer which has brought a better environment to work in than Hospira. Better benefits and chance to be promoted. Bosses are better to work with and they listen to their employees.
good,Don't really remember too much such a long time ago. I like it though worked in the IT department mostly cleaning and organizing the stockroom. I was only temporary contracted through a outside agency.
good,"Fast paced environment, but not stressful.  I would definitely recommend people to work here.  Management is good and flexible.  Benefits are outstanding.  Thumbs up."
good,"Un excelente trabajo, estabilidad laboral, superación y gran experiencia en industria médica."
good,"it was a great place to work, only thing is they lay off so bad. I got laid off and they waited almost 9 months to call me back to work. now its questionable about the business."
good,Hard worker and dependable great to get along with people and I have a team player personality. Don't mind listening and learning more. Always wanting to improve and more up in company.
good,"Working for  Hospira a Pfizer company has been a blessing to me! Ive learned alot her and i""ve enjoyed every minute of it. Although, I like this job I know that it is time to soar and move on. I have encounter some of the best managers and team leaders a job could offer. I feel that my managers, supervisors, leaders, and team members have created a bond. We do not always see eye to eye but we always work out the problem and continue on with our day to ensure that the product we create is at its best to the best of my abillitys. This is what i enjoy most about this company!"
good,"I am nurse by training. Working at Hospira taught me how products come to market. I gained insight into what it takes for generic drugs to meet standards before they reach the patient's bedside. Collaborating with teams at the plant level was enriching and exciting."
good,Hospira is a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant that prepares injectable medical vials. Work can be labor intensive and monotonousness.
good,Hospira and its focus on life saving medication and medical devices is a great place to work.  There is a focus on a good work-life balance - with recognition that at times there are tougher work loads.
good,My day consisted of gathering vital information in determining what the worst case product for cleaning was for SVP . I also tracked the required training for the entire Validation group. I am a people person and work well with everyone for a common goal. I was glad to get credited for the approval of the Milrinone cleaning validation.
good,"I worked for Hospira through Kelly Services. Work is pretty easy and steady in the department I was trained in."
good,Times are a little shaky now but the company overall is good.
good,The great thing about working at Hospira was the spirit of the entire company.  We were going to achieve high levels in the pharma industry and I believe we all worked hard toward that goal.  I have learned a lot about the corporate envirorment since my background before that (28 years) was entirely made up of restaurants.  I received 5 promotions in my first 5 years.
good,"A typical day consisted was to always complete paperwork as soon a task was performed that required for it to be done. Perform aseptic techniques to exact DEA and FDA specifications no shortcuts allowed. Also provide fellow employees with needed training to learn job or update their training. The hardest part was there where times you wanted to cut the process short, but you always are aware that any mistake can affect a persons life and it is not worth it. The most enjoyable part of this job is that you know that everyday your job makes a difference in someone's life."
good,"The Best place I ever worked, great culture, excellent communication with employees from the management, lots of opportunity to grow."
good,Productive and fun place to work with friendly people and encouraging atmosphere to work.  Mid-size company with less bureaucracy prior to being acquired by big pharma.
good,"Was a good relaxed position most of the time, co-workers were very knowledgeable and helpful, they always worked in a team focused environment. Most major problems were always handled in a safe and effective way."
good,"Crecimiento profesional y personal, una empresa excelente en su trato laboral se interesa por el bienestar de su empleado y esto hace que se trabaje con motivación y enfocado a obtener buenos resultados."
good,"Wow were do I start enjoy working here ,co-working were great, work was steady but that was fine because I like staying busy. I would still be there if I hadnt ran into a criss at home."
good,"Hospira provided some opportunities for advancement. I certainly learned much more about QA during my time there, and was exposed to varying levels of decision makers."
good,"Although Hospira was not the right place for me, I would still recommend them. As an employee health nurse, I worked nights which I found to be very boring. I am the type of person that likes to stay busy and this particular position was slow paced."
good,"A very good place to work."
good,"Inspect prints and defects on product while working in a GMP environment, provide minimum daily maintenance and preventative maintenance on fab machine, utilize the forklift to stock and product and prepare it for transport."
good,"Cuenta con instalaciones a las afueras de Bogota."
good,"articulate and stay focus at all time at work, always do the right thing at first time."
good,While working at Hospira  I was able to see how medicine was made and the important of the process was to the security and safety that goes into making of medicine.
good,It was a very fast pace job as material would come through a conveyor belt you would have to inspect each item for any blemishes. The most enjoyable part of the job was working as a team to finish all our duties.
good,Family oriented company.  Work sometime can be stressful but does not need to be if everyone did their job.  Management sometime okay but needs improvement in communicating with employees.  Too many micro management at times. But a very good family oriented place to work.  Good benefits!
good,Hospira was a great company that allowed me to learn about contract administration and implementing contracts.  Management was good and the culture was nice.  The hardest part of the job was learning the job and the most enjoyable was the people.
good,Thanks to my  supervisor and  employee for showing me how to  operate a fork left that was my main job their at that time really enjoyed the company
good,Nice place to work good benifits salary. we work 12 hours and i love the 12 hour shift gives me a lot more time off. The management are very good to their empolyees
good,Campus Recruited under TPDP program. Worked in QA department. Good work culture and perks provided. I had to interact with many colleagues as part of project and made friends.
good,Process and review background information for potential new hires. I've learned so much in regards to the hiring process.  The managers are very supportive and really listen to your needs.  They try to do what they can to help you obtain whatever you need to make your job more productive.  The co-workers are definitely teams players.  Everyone is always willing to help one another and come together to work on projects to meet deadlines no matter what area of the department they support.  The hardest part of the job is consulting with a potential new employee who has been dishonest during the hiring process.  Integrity is everything.  I sincerely enjoy assisting people with any questions or concerns during the process.
good,I would have loved to work here longer but since Pfizer purchased Hospira and the layoff's have begun it's unlikely I will be here long.   The only reason I have survived to this point is because I'm a consultant.
good,This was a clothing store along with jewlary etc. We always had diffenerent sales and promotions going on. We have different contest going on in the store for the employees.
good,Really fun to work with and get along with other working people. Company with many great things to offer and really easy to learn new things to futher advance your career.
good,Good company with great people to work with and a great learning experience. Co workers work together and at time had fun.
good,This job taught me a lot about manufacturing. I learned the cGMPs and SOPs.  Also I learned how to operate heavy machinery.
good,Devised and executed test protocols in support of Design Inputs. Created data reports from testing protocols for submittal to management.
good,"•	Aseptic Trained"
good,i really wish i can go back. i enjoyed knowing what time im going to get off but i did sometimes hate working on the weekend
good,"Learned about working in a Warehouse enviroment, learned how to drive a forktruck, learned alot cGMP protocols."
good,"It is a clean room environment in some departments so proper uniforms and cleanliness was always observed. You do wear scrubs as the uniform so you were comfortable while at work. I did learn the importance of proper documentation witch was a major part of any departments production. Ther was nothing really to hard about working at Hospira, just like any other job, do your work and you'll have no problem. Management was fair to all and co-workers were great people to work with and thats what made it an enjoyable place to work."
good,I have learned a multitude about the pharmaceutical industry as well as about the regulatory and quality processes.
good,job was very fun going great managers and benefits if i could return to this job i would
good,"I worked in solutions for the last job during my employment. I was a group coordinator. We made batches of solutions to go in the IV bags. I checked over what batches to be made that day, physically helped and checked against the BOP's. The culture was good. The hardest part was lifting the 100 pound bags of sugar. The enjoyable part was making medicine to help people."
good,Working with medicine is serious business and any carelessness could effect other people lives. I llearn that what we do can ease people pain and safe lives. Management was ok but sometimes they get too carried away. Hardest part of job is being careful not to make a mistake. The enjoyable part is taking a break.
good,It is a great experience working with the Medical groups. Its culture is completely different and quite impressive.  I would recommend this company to everyone to join and take the best experience.
good,"over all a very good organisation i had aver seen in my life. good for everyone, very familiar environment. so any one can adjust and understand the procedures easily."
good,"Hospira rocks and healthy work environment."
