rating,review
good,"Upper Management truly listens"
bad,"manager turn over rate is ridiculous , so many mangers in a short period of time there were many issues with schedules because you have to cover double shifts every oother day and they are very mean to employees"
bad,not crazy about this company they do not care about the people who work for them. they only care about meeting the goals required by the upper management team
bad,"Under the poor management    I left the company, because I was bullied and she wanted me out by telling me that I don't have work ethic, after I won 17 times EMC365, two times silver coin, three times nominee in the elite team, and a winner of the ten ways and etc"
bad,"Not a good place to work. No work life balance.  Management is not very good.  Never had the tools, materials required to accomplish the job.  No raises"
bad,"The company was ok no complaints. They trained me and help me through mistakes. High turnover in managment tho, which was discouraging and I chose not to move up with the company."
bad,"Equity Residential used to be a great company to work for. Now that it is exiting Orlando it has turned into man vs man to keep your job. Which isn't including the dishonest people in management who are constantly manipulating to keep their butts safe. I learned everything I know at Equity and Equity has helped me truly excel at my job. Management honestly is a joke, RM's are completely disconnected from the real life of each property. The Community Manager is the biggest con-artist of them all who lies with a straight face right in front of you and lies to your RM. I wouldn't recommend working for Equity right now."
bad,"Terrible employer! Don't be fooled!  Management is an uneducated, cheap and a sleazy group. If you want to work like a frantic lunatic with very low pay, handling communities of angry residents, this is the job for you.  A highly miserable experience."
bad,"I worked there 2 years ago.  The pay is low. The company's expectations are unreasonable. If you want to work long hours and be treated like a 2nd class citizen, this place is for you."
bad,"Equity does not care about their employees, only about keeping intimate friends employed regardless of their performance"
bad,I have nothing positive to say. The manager on a different property I was transferred to was out to get rid of me. You either had to be the step mat for the senior agents or you were done!
bad,"The Management is all about money and not the residents. They do not work with the prospects at all, they make so much money but do not want to change the things on the property that can look much more appealing to our prospects. They show favoritism towards certain employees and they are not held accountable, and they are promoted in higher position without fallowing the company standards rules and policies. Opportunity for advancement was completely based on an almost nepotistic basis. Upper management is focused on the bottom line and the employees and tenants are most affected by their policies."
bad,I worked there for about a year the property was for sale the entire time i work for them.  my maintenance tech quit and they wouldn't replace him because they were selling that went on for 10 months.  i was asked to hide things because they didn't want to fix them because they were selling
good,"Upper Management truly listens"
bad,"I feel that this place (the Augusta Office) can be so much better. The management needs to separate personal relationships with co-workers in the workplace. I feel if you stand up for something, its mends to get let go. There are some good moments within this company but it is very far in between. There are a lot of assumptions within this place without proper findings of what a person is said to be doing or not doing. Discrimination is within this work place. You are not paid by the work you do unless you have an outside relationship with the managers. The company does have company outings and lunches for the employees which is great but it does not make it a happy place to be once you have to go back to work. It is a lot of back stabbing within this office and people are not being held accountable for the job they are supposed to do, meaning jobs are pushed off on someone else who is not under that title and being blamed for something that is out of their control."
bad,"All trash lazy handyman, donâ€™t know nothing property managers last minute work to make the leasing agents look good, forget about moving up in this company kiss the right You know what  and you will never go up, thank god I left and got a superintendent job because I never would have gotten it in this company"
bad,"Management put profits over service & residents comfort !"
bad,Not to much to say on company value and ethic. This is for second job not career job
bad,"I worked for the company for 5 years and saw it change from a wonderful company that easily offered advancement, fair wages and a great environment for employees to the exact opposite. It is a tragedy because it was once a company I was proud to  work for.  if you are looking to work in property management, stay clear of this company."
bad,"I was with Equity for years. Trust me, this company does not care about its employees or residents. As an employee, be prepared to be overwhelmed with task after task and expected to be perfect at all of them. If you don't measure up to these impossible standards..look for another job. They will low ball you on your pay, unless you know what to ask for."
bad,"You will advance at Equity if you are part of the clic , no training provided , There is no concern for resident customer service. "
bad,"It was great until the regional manager doesn't like you, and she'll find a way to can you. No matter how hard you worked. So you better know or learn to kiss upper management behind and stay on her good side."
bad,"Equity does not care about their employees, only about keeping intimate friends employed regardless of their performance, This Company is horrible, trust when I say they could careless about the residents, half the people in the office are rude or dumb, barely know their colors let allow how to put in a work order.There is no room for advancement. If you have another job, school, children, or any other commitment, they will make sure your job gets in the way of it. I did not learn anything new here, and felt like I totally lost my edge in the industry after going without continuing education for so many years. The only enjoyable part about working here was being around some of my co-workers"
bad,"Discrimination, passive aggressiveness, breaking company policies to their benefit and ee discomfort . They lie before admitting it was their fault."
bad,"Worked for almost 2 years in the service area, they dont care about the people working for them, they just need to get the job done at all cost, very  frustating, cleaning aparments is the worst part, we do the hard work and other people like doormans and leasing office are treated different, to the point that i see a doorman been treated like a god, so in christmass time he start stealing christmass bonuses envelopes that residenst give to the team and he got away with it not olny 1 time, he will probably keep doing it. ""A"" place with a loot of stupid rules that try really hard, they need to chill more, maybe its just a place to get some experience but thats it, dont expect to jump to a high position there unless you had conections or someting, after all you really wont enjoy the ride because it is so demanding that will consume your life away."
bad,"As the building is under construction and there are still real estate agents showing apartments, there is a lot of pressure to keep things as pristine as possible, while dust falls constantly.  I have learned how to inspect a model apartment from ceiling to floor, assist in nighttime security and fill in for concierge during breaks and learned the MRI software system."
bad,"I was recently a leasing consultant for Equity Residential. I was with the company for 3 years. Prior to accepting the position I read all of the horrible reviews, but desperatly needed a job. There is a pervasive culture of racism and bullying that is ENCOURAGED by management. I had to find out the hard way that all of the reviews I read were 100% TRUE. All levels of management have created an environment that mimmicks high school. If you are with the ""in"" crowd you can be rude, mean, unprofessional, and NEVER get into trouble. If someone in the ""in"" crowd doesn't like you, they all don't like you. Regional manager and AVP are active participants in the HORRIBLE culture that is pervasive at Equity Residential. I am a sales professional who has been in the business for over 20 years. This is the FIRST time I have ever felt compelled to write a review on any company I have ever worked for. I have appealed to corporate in Chicago to go under cover to see what REALLY goes on at their properties. Of course they won't as they view negative reviews as the rantings of disgruntled employees. Not the case. This company is SICK. All you have to do is read the reviews on numerous sites which encompasses employees from all across the country and you will see a common thread. IF YOU DON'T MIND BULLYING, RACISM, BEING OVER WORKED, OVER WHELMED, COMING TO WORK EVERY SINGLE DAY WONDERING IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE FIRED, NO CONSISTENCY WHEN IT COMES TO PUNITIVE ACTION ETC...THEN THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU!!!"
bad,"They treat employees horribly at Equity in Tampa. They do not want you to have any life outside of the office, and demand mandatory overtime with little (or sometimes no) notice. If you have another job, school, children, or any other commitment, they will make sure your job gets in the way of it. I did not learn anything new here, and felt like I totally lost my edge in the industry after going without continuing education for so many years. The only enjoyable part about working here was being around some of my co-workers. Over the last 22 years, this was the only job that I literally dreaded going to every single day."
bad,"Community Manager lied constantly to the staff and residents. Regional Manager from New York micromanaged, was more concerned with her bonus then the well being of the staff and residents. 2 Community Managers forced out in 18 months, staff turnover increased dramatically. "
bad,Equity is very tech forward and has a lot of class A communities. Equity could try to connect more with the people working for them and not be so numbers driven.
bad,"it was a great company, Just didn't think the pay was fair. It was extremely low for a leasing consultant with over  6 years of experience. Also you work every weekend. Which they should change or hire someone to work weekends. I mean every weekend I worked NO weekends off. No work/ life balance. If they would change that policy and increase the pay then overall it would be a good company."
bad,Regional Managers strong arm employees. Don't allow them to move up with fear they will be replaced. Promotions based on who likes you and not your quality or work or knowledge. If you have an opinion then you get pushed out. On site sales teams are beyond underpaid. Force you to work on national holidays and sit in the office alone.
bad,"They don't t care about their employees. We are over worked, underpaid, under appreciated, etc. It all comes down to how much money we make the company while most of us can barely afford to live regardless of the high rent discount. If it wasn't for the discount, many would no longer be with this company. "
bad,From the day I started I felt as if I did not belong! I was basically thrown to the wolves to learn. I felt as if I was bothering someone if I asked a question. Very non-personal staff.
good,"Upper Management truly listens"
bad,"The Management is all about money and not the residents. They do not work with the prospects at all, they make so much money but do not want to change the things on the property that can look much more appealing to our prospects. They don't care too much for the prospects that sell their homes and readjust their finances and living situations to come to a Equity property, but then when their apartment is no longer available the company does not follow the policy of keeping that promise to the prospect."
bad,I in fact was fired for doing my job and i was fought in court for unemployment benefits and not only did all the reps for equity show up at the cost of thousands .. i still won .. i was wrongly terminated.
bad,"Grounds, hvac repairs, general repairs. Staff was kept at a minimal which impacted ability to properly server residents."
bad,Management plays favorites and will let you fail instead of helping you succeed. It's up to you and how willing you are to learn and communicate with your team. Get in where you fit in. Equity prides itself as 10 ways to be a winner however the new staff was not. Working at Equity for years and never had any issues until the new Regional came in. Yuck.
bad,The management is not the best and the job culture and structure suffers because of this matter.
bad,Each day is an opportunity to learn new ways to do daily task.
bad,"The company in itself is large. I found myself being a number and with the amount of employees you became a number and it was difficult to stick out. I worked at a location that had 375 units. I was able to learn a lot from their training courses that they offer but they pay just wasn't enough to keep me there. My family was growing and I needed more. The benefits were great though. Paid insurance, 1 week vacation as soon as you start and sick time."
bad,"I worked at variety of sites here at Equity Residential, my last site has been the worst. Poor Management, Salary increases is only 50 cents and commission is horrible. Career Advancement is poor, you really have to wait until someone leaves. Also, they create this sales class for you to improve on but the training is selected, technically you have to be good with management. The staff at the properties are amazing but all the people I was working with left the company. Equity Residential does not value employees and does not do anything about poor management."
bad,"Residents suddenly became 'the enemy."" It was strange and unpleasant. It wasn't like that when I first started with them. I thought I had found a home. I was wrong."
bad,Number eight is preached about daily but when push comes to shove they quickly forget about their 10rules to success. ESPECIALLY NUMBER 8. Please pass this on to the CEO.
bad,"There are about couple months out of the year when it is busy and have an opportunity to make big money. The rest of the year you are going to struggle financially and will need to get another job. Responsibilities include resident retention, bring in new prospects, manage resident events, and  maintain an organized office. The hardest part of the job is dealing with resident complaints and late payments. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people find a new home."
bad,Equity started out with a great balance of personal and professional integrity but quickly changed their culture to branding which felt cold and impersonal. I would not work for them again
bad,Poor values and management. I had a great 7 year run with them before management changed and I was fired without warning on a minor offense. Pay is poor as well and they do a barely passable job of maintaining properties.
bad,Equity Residential has changed over the years and your performance is based on mostly metrics even though the employees don't have control of them. Most calls are recorded and you must follow a script of conversation or you will be given a written conversation from your supervisor of how to correct your calls. You are a number and the properties are micromanaged.
bad,I worked for Equity for many years. Very customer service oriented with a focus on cost analyzing and profit/rental income opportunities.
bad,"Things I liked most was the relaxed yet faced pace feel of the job, you make commission, and get discounted if you live at one of their properties.  Management at my location just sucked.  They don't do that well of a job/work life balance even though they claim to be all about it.  They'll have you work every weekend while management gets those days off."
bad,"the days all through busy,learned need for hardworking.management was demanding ,one has to be neat.overtimes usually hard due to alot of job bt saturdays very good after recieving extra pay for extra hours"
bad,I applied for positions I was qualified for and later found out it was given to someone with less experience and less time in the career. 
bad,I would only recommend this company to some one with no kids no life maybe it was just the property I was at maybe it was management lack of power to write up my co workers for their mistakes or they were scared to do I don't know I really never asked why I just left. I would never go back for that reason
bad,"everyday is a challenge with different problem "
good,while it may take sometime to get used to the tenants the management isn't stable and your stuck on double shifts without notice. you end up on double shifts without notice because of the lack of communication between supervisors and concierge staff. For the most part you can face tenants that's that are really nasty and you will not have the support of your management team
good,"They hire managers who look the part but aren't properly trained to work on a team.  Our region only made a 1% income growth in 2018, no advancement and very little pay increases. You are compensated well based on your experience."
good,"Learned a lot about the industry. Property is clean and convenient to major highways, public transportation and shops."
good,"Good product, but they need to work on management style and not be so clique.  "
good,"Management didn't work with the evening shifts very frequently, so often I felt unsupported. But the upside of that is that I knew I was trusted. Days were busy with many interactions with residents and contractors."
good,"not a great company work for life, if you have better choice please think about it before join equity residential, when i first start with them was great work and life balance, after management start changing, everything fall a part, they need better management to fix the company."
good,"Upper management applies alot of pressure to get apartments turned around in a short amount of time. "
good,Had a good time working there but time to move on. Very big company room for advancement.  Had a great team for 10 years.  Always willing to work hard.
good,Manage staff and assist with work orders and turns. Organize schedules and assign work activity. Drywall and carpentry experience. Evaluate problematic systems/facilities. Determine what installation and repair services are needed to be performed. Conduct follow ups with residents.
good,"Equity is an interesting place. I have many friends there, so I truly enjoyed coming to work every day. However, as a place to nourish a career, it's not that good. If you're content with just doing your job and getting a 3% raise every year, then you'll love it. But if you want to advance your career, and you don't like corporate politics, it's probably not the place for you. Promotions were based on a very obscure spoils system, and had shifted almost exclusively to women. Lots of VPs (maybe 1/3 of the corporate office), and they all had very comfortable jobs which meant none of them were leaving. It leaves little opportunity for the rest of the non-VPs."
good,"Equity is a good employer with great benefits and a wonderful culture. However, the level of support received in a new satellite market has been challenging. It takes months for corporate decisions to be made leaving onsite staff dealing with customer issues and concerns. Making the onsite staff feeling unsupported."
good,"There's no life balance, usually short stuff. Running all the timeout of that good befits, ok pay......................................................."
good,"I was promised a number of promotions.I interviewed for the promotions, even began doing the work at the new positions. They kept not giving me my raises or official new titles I was promised. It happened repeatedly, became very frustrating."
good,I would work here again if only the compensation was better though I'm not sure about the company statewide but the local property I previously worked did not meet the pay rate to the roles.
good,"This was my first introduction into Property Management, I learned a lot in the time that I was employed with Equity Residential, they had a great training program for all the new hires."
good,OK place to start your career in property management.  Whether you like it or not depends on the manager. They always run light on staffing which is stressful for the current employees. Corporate listens when you offer suggestions.
good,"Long hours. Low wages. Management lack education. Company sold with no warning or plan for employees. However, they were a dream compared to the management company 'PInnacle' that took over."
good,"Upper Management truly listens"
good,"Equity Residential has an overall great idea for culture and benefits and ways to treat their employees. But not everyone follows those guidelines. The best part of the job is the team that you work with. They are a batch of extraordinary people who make you feel like family. However, sometimes the upper management can lose their way."
good,"I was a night concierge, tasked with fulfilling all of the overnight duties to prepare for the next day, including but not limited to cleaning, setting up coffee, security, filing papers, etc."
good,"Equity Residential gave me my 1st opportunity to venture into the Property Management Industry. I was placed in an office in the south end of Atlanta. That was well over 10 years ago and I remembered it so well. everything is very fresh in my mind. The Manager was Cadja and my files had to be in proper order. there was no signing off on a file that was not in the proper order.  I quickly learned how to be meticulous. That stay with me in every company thereafter. Still, I place tremendous value on being organized. I dressed up in my professional attire each day and still i had to clean the toilets and the vacant if it was needed. I never complained. I like to clean. I had to transfer all info from a guest card into the computer system each day for. I maintained data and review them daily to follow up with prospects daily. all while touring, taking classes, cleaning, organizing, and planning. It was very good training."
good,office skills and customer service skills and light accounting. managing the property and providing great service to customers. marketing the homes and listings.
good,A typical day at work included assisting patients with locating thier doctors offices and securing their transportation. It was a largely isolated workplace. I only really interacted with management when I was acting as a go-between with the tenants. The hardest part of the job was providing security for the location. The most enjoyable part was assisting patients with their needs.
good,"I enjoyed working in a fast pace community where I was able to multitask and show off our large community. Residents are always in need of assistance; whether it's transferring, questions about their account, or needing just a simple lease printed."
good,I have enjoyed working for Equity and they company mission is a positivie one!
good,This was a great company to work for just got hit in the housing crunch but it was a great experience.
good,Good company. Good ethics. Decent experience. My manager was a basket case who ended up leaving eventually. I felt empowered and enjoyed interacting with clients and residents.
good,"When I first started working with equity residential, everything was good, then came the change in top management in 2006. The work environment quickly lost its human touch and became all about your numbers and nothing in between. Policies and ways of doing thing were constantly changed. It felt like the staff had lost their voice. The company did throw great parties though."
good,Equity is a decent work place.  I feel they show favoritism towards certain employees and they are not held accountable.  They can improve on the annual performance bonuses.
good,This is a very strict and corporate company to work for. Everyone is a number. This is a problem for people oriented or personable people such as myself.
good,"I enjoyed my time with Equity Residential. I enjoyed leasing apartments and working with the residents and other coworkers. The thing I liked most about this job was meeting new potential residents. "
good,Delegating and directing the work of the department.  Meeting customers immediate needs. Knowing the environment and what needed to be taken care of and setting priorities.
good,"I worked for Archstone when Equity residential bought them out. Day one the atmosphere changed. The entire staff was told on the first day ""There are a lot of people in this company that would love the chance to work here, so you have to step it up and stay on your toes at all times. Slowly the old Archstone employees started disappearing. The property was great, the residents were wonderful, but the atmosphere just became so much more 'corporate'."
good,"Renovated location. Club house, parking, pool and steam room, hot tub with jets, next to shopping center, next to freeways, next to schools. Sunny area."
good,"day to day building operations,  supervision of building staff, delegating contractors,scheduling daily repair tasks to maintenance staff and make sure that the building is kept clean and presentable looking,conducting regular preventative maintenance on items throughout the interior and exterior of the building"
good,Equity Residential is a great company to work at but management is always pressuring the techs to use less supplies and try to fix everything.  This causes supervisors to get fired or quit.
good,"Upper Management truly listens"
good,This place needs to focus more on the customer instead of the stock holders. Need the right leaders in the right positions.
good,"I was responsible for Prospect Trafficking, Outreach Programs, Move-ins, Apartment Inspections, Residential Notices, Residential Maintenance Requests and Etc. The Challenging Term of the job was the inexperience to the skill set, My most enjoyable part of the job was everything I loved everything once you get the knowledge of things"
good,"Good work environment, learn a lot on your own, not a lot of training provided. Fair management"
good,property management. ok to work for but your taken for granted and it feels like there tying your hands at every turn.
good,Was tasked with doing a 3 person job on my own. not managed very well.
good,"Great amount of processes, good support teams. Great benefits. I learned allot about people, how to be a better business manager, and how to be a better mentor."
good,I felt that there was no room for advancement with the company. When a promotional position came open they already new who was going to receive it. I went on 3 of these interviews and two of the position was filled before I even got to interview.
good,"if one thrives in helping people, this place was one of them. had the opportunity to help the tenants in many different ways. the employees are a variety of cultures in which makes it good place to be. management was helpful but at times interesting."
good,"It was a pleasure to work for this company. All the team members were relatively polite to each other. Our typical day began like this: each morning we gathered at the meeting to get a day job, and then when I coped with my responsibilities and I had more time, I would walk into the shop and repair what was not finished by others. I learned a lot there and how to plan your working day. Also I learned how to talk to customers and make them happy. There were moments where my partner did not treat me very well, but this did not prevent me from working with him. Despite this I managed to receive awards from companies such as employee of the month, and various other recognitions. The hardest part of the job was when the garbage compactor was broken and we had to lift garbage on our own. It was especially difficult when it rained. The most enjoyable part of the job was when our manager would treat us to fun boat rides, picnics and other fun events."
good,"typical day at equity was servey apartments and inspect before new move in."
good,"It is great place to learn as it offers constant training in customer service, sale, etc. Lots of customer solving issues and you learn how to deal with them. Everyday can be different. However, most sites are under staff which results in not too much of work/life balance. There has been too many changes and budget cuts that do not benefit the properties or employees. High employee turnover."
good,From the day you start there are so many things to learn and to do that you are always busy
good,"- A typical day at work would be seeing if there are any move-ins for that day so I can make keys and re-key the vacant apartment. Then respond to any priority service request. After, work on turns with vacant apartments such as painting, carpentry, electrical, appliance repair/replacement."
good,"Walk the garages, check to make sure staff did there job,running the scrubbers , maintance on equipment as needed, order supplies,check all lighting replace blubs and ballast as needed.overnight traffic painting. Working with venders. I learned a lot about working on a big property. I enjoyed working with the staff very professional. Hardest thing working overnight for snow removal. Most enjoyable meetings I got to sit down."
good,a company with opportunity to grow and to be engaged to make a difference and to grow as a person.
good,Competitive high employee turnover there's growth in the company 50% off your apartment for managers. Very diverse large company there's jobs all over
good,"Residents are the best in the majority. "
good,"My manager and coworkers are pretty awesome day in and day out. The maintenance staff is very easygoing. Everyone works hard and understands their job. The hardest part of this job is dealing with the different attitudes that resident bring to the leasing office. The good part about this job that if you make a mistake, it could fixed 90% of the time."
good,overall good place to work.  Apartment turnover was my typical job responsibility. I learned basic electrical skills and basic plumbing skills. My co-workers were great people. Hardest part of job was on-call rotation. Most enjoyable was customer service
good,"Upper Management truly listens"
good,"Overall a good company."
good,"This is a modern corporation that is fun to work for, but it operates as a well fueled machine and therefore there aren't many opportunities to advance."
good,I am so fortunate to work in a region with a community manager that has faith in my work ethic. I love going to work each day and being presented with something new each day.
good,"My typical day at work consists of receiving the work load and putting together a strategy/forecast in order to get the job done with all of the equipment needed (each home has certain needs).   I have learned no matter how much you know, there are always ways to improve yourself and your performance. I believe management could be a little more understanding with employees, however, they are there to get a job done.  My co-workers and the residents are the ones that keep/kept me here.  There hardest part of the job is to adjust to the different needs of the situation of what we do.  After 22 years in the military, I should have this down.  Most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the residents happy with what we do for them."
good,Not my cup of tea. Maybe it was just the building i was located at. But the company does not seem to be so bad. A little too serious. They need to chill out a bit and smile. Everyone seem depressed and like they hated working for Equity.
good,"â€¢	Review rental applications and lease agreements to ensure all criteria meet company policies and procedures."
good,"No Stress"
good,I do not feel I was adequately compensated for the workload and the commission structure is lack luster compared to other companies. which is why most people leave.
good,"The work itself is easy and fun,the only thing that sucks is the management team themselves,especially the manager that I worked for.She had terrible people skills and had a major chip on her shoulder.The worst part is they promote people that should not be in management positions and upper management doesn't care.If they had better managers and better district managers this place would be an awesome place to work."
good,"This was a large company with a very large number of employees and business locations."
good,Okay place to work. There is too much turnover in management. Not much room to grow within the company. There is no work life balance. The work hours are super long.
good,"The work place is very busy and often demands you time after the office closes to assist residents.The overall company is great, the role is resident focused. If you do not mind working Saturday and Sunday then its a really great role. If you do mind then I would not suggest you taking the role."
good,I began working for Equity Residential who then sold the property I worked at to Pillar Communities.  I was grateful to be offered a full time job instead of working 3 jobs as I had been doing.  I much preferred working for Pillar Communities as they listened to us and were not a huge natiional company and could make changes based on the local market.
good,Love this company the culture and people are the best!!!   Working with the public and resolving any and all things for residents.  Shipping and receiving accounts payable
good,Equity Residential is an exceptional company to work for and has allowed me three promotions within three years of working for the company.
good,"I have learned the differences of supervising and directing. The hardest part of my job is the high unit turnover on my property. I wish somehow we could get the people to stay. I really enjoy meeting and communicating with the tenants and trying to provide them the very best service that we can, I also enjoy the maintenance team, that we have become!!"
good,enjoyed the 5 years with Equity wish I could have stayed just could not a get a position closer to my home
good,"Upper Management truly listens"
good,"fulfilled the duties of a concierge. Attended to the lobby and everything and everyone who came in and out of the building. Maintaining the safety and security of the building and the residents."
good,I managed a small community for Equity Residential. The regional was great and taught me a lot. I enjoyed working there until they sold my property to Emperian Management.
good,"Large company, lots of opportunity and freedom to take your career anywhere you want.  Offers great training and support for next level roles.  Overall friendly environment."
good,"It is very good company, very large company. I had an opportunity to grow and get a training and work on my career. I had a great management and team."
good,"I have gained a lot of experience on resolving problems and organizing projects with managers and co-workers. I have also gain confidentiality within myself. I would have to say that the hardest part of job is having to work on my own; but, I have managed myself to complete my duties. I would say that the most enjoyable part of my current job is seeing the looks on the residents' faces when I have completed a job."
good,Work for Equity since I moved here in 2003 and learned alot and grow was able to trian people and watch them grow in the company.
good,"As a residential Concierge I was always on the move throughout the day dealing with move ins/outs, answering phones, helping the leasing staff, accommodating residents and their issues. I learned valuable customer service skills. Management was somewhat disconnected and provided only a small amount of guidance which cultivated an independent work ethic that I used to stay productive on my own. The volume of requests and work orders at a 680 unit luxury high-rise building was the hardest part to stay on top of but the gratitude expressed by residents was most enjoyable for me."
good,"Basically everyday was a set of routines. Property maintenance requirements. ie: grounds, pool, cabana and fitness centers."
good,A good place to work to learn. Everyday brings a different experience from working with tenants and visitors.
good,"It's a very professional environment.  There is a lot of resources for you to draw from in just about every aspect of your job.  It is a high pressure company who asks a lot from you, but if you succeed you are put on a quick path to promotion."
good,This place allowed me to improve my skills in the area of human resources. I got experience on a multitude of HRIS platforms and was heavily relied upon for my expertise and experience. 
good,"I started my career here and learned so much of what I wanted to do and who I wanted to be. I advanced pretty quickly for a few years, but after being a community manager, there is no where to go unless you want to relocate out of state."
good,Equity is a great place to work but there is not a chance to advance your career within AZ. If you're looking for a fast paced environment then this a great place to work.
good,"Never have a problem with co-worker learned a lot from them, and like the way the company send the workers to classes for their work. Really like to recommend this company to anyone."
good,"My overall experience has been very positive. I have learned many facets of the entire industry, I seek results through commitment. I cultivate my team to ensure growth and success in the operation. I enjoy that everyday is different and a fast paced working environment. When you think like owner, you have the opportunity for advancement and the company will take care of you."
good,I loved working with my immediate Manager who imparted his technical Skills  and good customer relations with our occupants.
good,"Upper Management truly listens"
good,I had the chance to maintenace from various people as well different classes that were availaible to the employees on a annual basis.
good,"Working with a team, maintaining and repairing apartments required repairs to insure residence are happy. preparing maintenance and painting for new move in residence. I learned all aspects and responsibility as a maintenance tech working with outside contractors minor electric and plumbing repairs. On call outside of work hours. the hardest part of the job snow removal during winter months. My co workers were all good people. the best  part of the job was meeting different people from all walks of life"
good,Working for the Dr. I learned additional skills and was able to advance my knowledge.
good,This company is a great place to start a career in property management
good,I loved my time with Equity. The economy changed and my portfolio was sold. I still feel that EQR is a top notch company.
good,"biggest problem you are on your own. Promises.......and nothing is done.........."
good,Opportunities for advancement and excellent training and support.  Equity has some of the best training and education in the industry and their pay range far exceeds their competition.
good,"This was a fun job unless you are in a crime ridden neighborhood. It can be very scary being confronted by residents who haven't paid thier rent. "
good,"Starting out with Equity was a great choice for me. It helped me meet a lot of new people in a new city. Rent discount was a huge plus. Work was fast-paced which I greatly enjoy. Management can be hit or miss depending on the property but I got lucky with a great sales manager and a great property manager. Opportunity for advancement is there but corporate does pick favorites so if you aren't one of the chosen ones you have to work really hard to move up. Culture is fun and upbeat, always events for you to attend and company sponsored outings like a park day or comedy show. Overall I think for a property management company they did pretty well."
good,This was a great company to work with; the team was amazing the ability we had to provide TOP Tier customer service was impeccable.The one thing I liked working there was the abibility to have a negative situation presented to you and you have the power to turn it into a positive situation for the resident.  That was empowering.
good,"Great place to work, excellent benefits, but I wish they had time to invest in their employees. Hardest part is dealing with management changes, or favoritism. They are not big promoting skills, sometimes whom they know versus someone with the talent. Good beginning for someone starting out."
good,"good company,  was a little slow in promoting and/or recognizing an employee going above and beyond for the betterment of the company. overall an enjoyable work experience"
good,"I enjoyed my job with Equity Residential for a wide varity of reason,"
good,"A typical day at Equity Residential was very exciting, full of learning classes and contests. Along with the usual leasing and turning over apartments and collecting rents. We had a lot of hands on meetings such as getting together to turn over the ideal apartment. We learned about the financial aspects of running the properties, balancing the budgets, new ideas on leasing apartments, the best parts and supplies to order. We all worked together to rent apartments, meaning if one property needed a extra hand we went to help them."
good,You get what you intially put in this company. Rewards happen for the individuals that strive for bettering themselves. Cheap as most companies with such staggering debt/income ratios.
good,"No company can make everyone happy all the time, but at Equity they listen to your opinions an have respect for you. the maintenance teams worked together to make sure the job was done correctly and on time."
good,like most jobs it had its ups and downs but for me it had more ups. if left up to me I would still be there and would've loved to moved up to management.
good,"Equity compensation and benefits are outstanding, however they exhaust you in the ours of work trying to catch up on to many unnecessary requirements,"
good,"Upper Management truly listens"
good,"The have an emphasis on a live, work, and play balance that is conducive to a healthy work place. They provide you with the resources and tools need to accomplish any task at hand."
good,"Working at this company, I had staff that worked with me to keep the property running smoothly.  I worked long hard hours and advanced through the company.  The politics were difficult to deal with."
good,"Excellent workplace to learn about Residential Communities, the ends and outs of property management, payroll and providing  good sound customer service to determine the issue surrounding an employee pay in regards to taxes, hours paid and medical benefits."
good,Great place to work every day is different. Everyday you deal with something new. Lots and lots of problem solving.
good,"I learned the most from this company.  Although there were 61 clubs and none were new, they had a great feel of community.  Great that all management cares about every new, and leaving member."
good,Equity Residential has great training but unfortunately management leaves a lot to be desired.
good,"Good, collaborative work environment and great benefits. I enjoyed my fellow employees. They company offered team building activites and a training program."
good,"If youâ€™ve ever wanted to start your family, or switch careers hereâ€™s a good entry. Leasing is great for ppl with a background in sales! I have recruited for the company and had a great experience with charismatic coworkers and management. Itâ€™s a great family dynamic to join, but feel I need more money to sustain my own family so Iâ€™m ready to leave. Great foot in the door though!  Counter offer the wage! Donâ€™t take their first  offer!"
good,"I've enjoyed my job at EQR. Good pay for a call center, good people, fun environment. Work from home opportunities after a certain period of time. Just need to make more money."
good,"One of the best housing packages compared to other companies in the Silicon Valley (50%, now 40% off of housing). Most of the decision making comes from top management so you get little say as to what happens on your property. Equity's version of MRI is much more intelligent than other systems. Leasing quotas are very lax. You don't engage much with other communities so you tend to stay in your own property bubble. Not as many job position openings compared to other companies so if you're looking to advance quickly it may be best to look elsewhere. Also depends on region you're in as their portfolio can be a bit spare in certain areas."
good,"Work environment was pleasant and we'll organized."
good,I worked in the Equity Call Center. The model was very advanced for it's time and well-run. Some of the matrices were not thought completely through with regard to personal connection over scripting.
good,"Great Team meetings, everyone in my office worked well together to assist when needed. I keep in touch with some today. Good people doing good things to help our military families. At my office we even handed out fruit snacks to the kids in the neighborhood after school. it was a great way to get to know our local community and be in relationship with them."
good,Very good company if you are looking to get into the property management industry or maintenance. It is a great company to start. Very competitive benefits package.
good,Great Company overall I just didn't like the management of my department. My manager spoke down to me as if I couldn't comprehend and micro managed. There was a click amongst the department that I was not apart of from day one.
good,"Upper Management truly listens"
good,"They are were understandable and good company to work for."
good,I enjoy it here. No collection challenges. Residents are quite pleasant. I would like it if additional training was offered on the community level. Overall it's a great opportunity.
good,"Great company, I wish they were more family oriented. They sold out of this area."
good,"Great place to work. Company care about employed and make sure we enjoy work with this company."
good,Property management is an industry with a decent amount of turn over and Equity Residential is always ready to promote from within.
good,"I enjoy working for Equity Residential, the staff are friendly and very professional. The residents are usually friendly and easy going. I love working with different people from all different backgrounds, its something thats very easy for me to do."
good,"Great training, enjoyed my colleagues and fun! Hardest part of the job was the residents."
good,I enjoy my job
good,"Enjoy working with people in all aspects of customer service and sales.  As well as film production.  "
good,Only worked here 1 year and took position closer to home to be able to balance my work/family balance and spend more quality time with my children versus commuting
good,"Received daily work load ,do morning chores. Continue on daily duties."
good,"Equity Residential was one of the best Management Companies to work for. I was given any and all tools needed to do my job, and could at anytime ask for whatever I need, Coworkers were wonderful. Great Company to work for."
good,Maintenance of apartment stall wood floors tile walls and flooring install faucets and lighting outlet s paint wood work of all types clean carpet experience of all tools custodian of all floors
good,"Fun place to work."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Equity. It was challenging, stressful at many times, but I loved the team I was on and felt very accomplished at the end of each day. I love Equity's culture, and their benefits were amazing!"
good,"great place to work, once you became a manger you were kinda stuck in that position. Benefits and pay are great lots of training involved, they was constant support!"
good,A typical day is process rent check from the four properties that were under my care at the time.  I learned that there are many different cultures out there and enjoyed working with everyone of them. Management was part of my daily routine keeping the custodial staff up to date on repairs end who needed emergency services.  The hardest part of the job was telling someone that they did not qualified for the apartment.  Most enjoyable were the tenants that I saw every day.
good,"Great company to work for! Steady work,good compensation plus bonuses, good positive atmosphere! its too bad they pulled out of the market in AZ it was a shame to loose them"
good,frequent meeting so we can all meet and discuss the way forward. the company offer outings and parties for all employees. they pay you for that time also. they also offer holiday bonus
good,"Equity was great to place to work, however they sold the property I was working at and turned them into Condos.  I then accepted employment with AIMCO."
good,good benefits and you feel valued as an employee. Only gripe is about compensation (people with no experience starting off making more money than me with years of experience).
good,I was a leasing agent so my day was spend doing tours.  I also took care of residents concerns and issues around the property.  I learned how to deal with upset people and I also learned how to manage my time.  The management was amazing they always took time to let you know how much they wanted you there.
good,Exciting and challenging  property make the work day fly by. Good people and great location.
good,Great education provided that has laid the foundation for me to progress forward in my career.
good,"daily routine consisted of dealing with residents,tickets and customer service issues.  also processing rents and bills."
good,"Very flexible, everyday you learn something new, teamwork"
good,"I start each day mentally assessing the front of the property as I approach the front desk. I then browse through new emails, post apartment availability on Craigslist, respond to customer leads for apartment information, check underground parking areas for cleanliness and safety. I also show prospective renters sample apartments. I am currently in the process of learning how to lease apartments. The team concept of working together is strongly encourage and works well among co-workers. The hardest part my job is saying good bye to long time residents.The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing many of the building residents personally."
good,Sale and lease high-end condo communities in person and on the phone.
good,If you are new to property management this is an excellent company to work for. There is training in place that allows you to succeed in your role. It is a very team oriented company that promotes over all success
good,"very competitive company, you can use your knowledge and you can learn a lot of the new technology.  Management are very helpful. This company has a very good workplace culture.  You have to do your job but you get recognize for it"
good,"Equity is an excellent company to work for with good benefits.  Although a large company that has numerous employees, policies are in place and adhered to. As with all large companies sometimes you feel like a small fish in a large pond."
good,"Clear expectations, great work life balance. Management and job culture are to be recommended. I worked for this company 7 years and never once questioned my choice."
good,"Worked with our off site controller with every aspect of the P&L"
good,"Great Company, awesome working enviorment. Great place fpr advancement. Provides excellent training and education on leasing."
good,"A typical day at work included opening up the office and walking the property to ensure that it was up to company and compliance standards. I would then see to anything that needed attention. Once that was done I was ready to start my work day which consisted of administrative work, touring and resident relations. Iâ€™ve been in the property management/ leasing field for about 5 years so the objective is pretty much same all over however, I've learned how to navigate and operate MRI and RentSentinel (Equityâ€™s leasing software). I also learned how to run and operate a 141 unit building with little to no supervision. Management as a whole was great, it was very structured; they offered a lot of training and support in for your title. I worked in a very small office with just the property manager and myself however, with her ever changing schedule that left me to work alone quite often to run the building in her absence. The hardest part for me was negotiating renewal rates for a few residents that experienced higher than normal rent increases because the company had tough restrictions on what numbers were negotiable. The most enjoyable part of my job was touring the community with the prospective resident(s); I enjoy meeting new people and assisting them with their search for their new apartment home."
good,"Will train employees even with no experience."
good,"Upper Management truly listens"
good,This was a great place to work. The environment was very casual but productive. Management emphasized the importance of work life balance.
good,"Typical day starts with morning briefing and updates along with job assignments, "
good,Great Benefits and Job Growth Opportunities. Over 58 local properties in the Washington Metro area.
good,"Everyday was always very busy, answering the phones, talking to residence, creating work orders, maintaining excel spreadsheet for the P1, and creating the schedule for maintenance workers. The hardest part of the job was leaving. I enjoyed all of my co-workers, when there was down time we all had allot of fun."
good,"I am in about 30 minutes before the staff gets in and I walk the properties. Once the staff arrives, I meet with my Service Manager first thing. I then check in with my leasing and concierge staffs to get a clear vision of their day. I finish off by talking with the cleaning staff and setting up a project to complete daily. I will send out a daily email of our leasing activity, projects and issues to my Regional Manager. I will usually have resident meetings sporadically throughout the day. I will pay, meet and confirm appointments with vendors. I will check in, with my staff, over the course of the day to be sure everyone is on track with their day. We have pricing calls every two weeks and portfolio meetings every two weeks. On Tuesday I will go to the corporate office and on board all new employees to the Boston region. It is an all day training. About once a week, I will go to other communities and perform training sessions on various topics."
good,Amazing work productivity and overall outgoing colleagues. I loved the atmosphere of the department and the way others were so friendly yet professional.
good,I was able to advance quickly in this career. Starting from call center to neighborhood coordinator and then moving up in rank neighborhood as coordinator.
good,"I really enjoy working for Equity Residential. I love what I do, and I also really like the system Equity uses. This company treats their employees great. They give you all of the tools you need to succeed."
good,"â€¢	Maintained the facility clean and neat. "
good,"Great Values, great pay and training is good too. They are always advancing their technology and training. The people are the best, it is really like a family there."
good,Not to mention the Benefits and other perks of the job.  Really hard to explain unless you have worked there.  Just wish the pay was a bit better.
good,Equity was by far the best company i ever worked for. They provided with with skills that i will be able to carry with me forever! If i didnâ€™t have to resign to take care of my special needs child Iâ€™ll more than likely would still be an employee of Equity. Itâ€™s a Greta place to work and i recommend it to anyone in the property management field.
good,"Worked with Equity Residential under the previous manager and we worked great as a team. once I was given a promotion, working on my own and hardly interacted with the manager of my new building. Issues would go unresolved then she would intervene and behave as if she solved the problem. I would send email to communicate certain issues it would take days for her to answer back and by then we would encounter an angry resident. The hardest part of my job was having a budget to buy supplies that were desperately needed to complete the daily operations of the community."
good,"Equity Residential has an exceptional company culture; one that is truly felt in the workplace.  Exposure and support of senior leadership commonplace.  Fast paced, challenging industry.  Opportunity for growth.  Environment where employee voices and opinions are not only welcomed but encouraged.  Great benefits.  Wonderful company."
good,Well developed company with great marketing strategies. Competitive employee packages and incentives. Decent hours. Solid performing properties create lots of earning potential.
good,Offered excellent training and really took care of their employees.  I worked with them for 14 years starting as a leasing consultant to a Property Manager.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was to work closely with people every day. I learned how to manage properties and all of the hard work that goes into managing them on a day-to-day basis.
good,"I learned a lot like painting, plastering, shampoo and I learn how to work with co-workers how to manage a property on every unit. I like to work with them they friendly workers."
good,"Encouraged to further continue and obtain a the Universal EPA section 608 Certificate."
good,"Upper Management truly listens"
good,This is a good company to work for. Had a great time when I worked there. The owners and coworkers were good people.I unboxed and set up appliances and delivered them.
good,No typical day is this business! Thats what I love about it. Print any necessary reports. Check units that will be used to tour. Morning huddle on any issues that need to be dealt with right away. I have learned that putting a smile on your face every day keeps your team spirited. Customer service can make the difference in your prospect picking your community over another. Work together with your service team so we are all on the same page.
good,"EQR is great place to work! If your at some of the smaller buildings your pay can be limited, but find yourself at a large property and your in the money. Colleagues are great to work with, except the occasional head ache. The company offers you the tools and overview to learn and grow. I started with the company a little over a year ago at a small property with no real estate experience. With the training and help from a few leaders of the company I am now working at one of the top buildings in the northwest. I would highly recommend this company to anyone who is looking to get into real estate or has prior experience."
good,"Completing work orders , preping units to be rented , cleaning grounds"
good,"Management changed too often and it was hard to establish a relationship with them.  However, our team helped for me to perform my job.  We mostly fixed a lot of plumbing problems for residents."
good,"It is a wonderful place to work. Senior management is caring and competent."
good,It was a friendly and fun atmosphere and I enjoyed going to work each day. The leadership team was the most valuable in assisting me with future goals and work related goals.
good,"In my 13 years with Equity, I grew & I learned everything I know about Property Management.I would have state with them for years to come if they hadnâ€™t sold out of Orlando & the surrounding Florida areas, but I was not willing to relocated my family at that time. I do feel the pervious CEO was more focused on the employees & the one who took their place was more focused on the financials, without real knowledge of the employees who worked so hard to keep the companyâ€™s goals. Great company though!"
good,"Equity Residential was a great company to work for.  In particular, I came to love the community and residents of the community that I worked at.  Retaining those residents gave me great joy, and I believe that my confidence in the community, apartment homes and surrounding area helped me greatly in leasing to prospective residents."
good,"I was the assistant manager for three years and I loved the place. It had its ups and downs but it was a great place to work. Room for growth is...challenging. As with any other job, its not what you know but who you know. In any case, I learned alot while employed for Equity and my manager was one of the best managers I ever worked with."
good,"Employees had a say.  VP was always available to discuss upcoming events Shared details of changes that would impact the property, employees and residents"
good,Equity Residential is a really great company to work for.  The only thing is they don't have many positions that fit my skill set.
good,"training-marketing with other community was great, work hours was long and resident enjoyed personal touch that staff provided on monthly bases. We put together a weekly news letter and offered resident breakfast on the go-pool parties-car wash and company offered online payment-resident referral program."
good,I love the property it was beautiful.  Lots of great staff members.  The place always any a lot of prospects.  I was always showing a unit. Walking the property.
good,"As a corporate employee, it's expected that you're influencing and shaping Equity's success. No matter the department or team you work on, we all feel we're making that impact. We're encouraged to share our ideas, challenge the status quo, take educated risks, and test our limits. Certainly, there are times when things get stressful and it doesn't seem like you can get it all done. But that's because we're encouraged not to just get things done, but get things done at a high level of quality resulting in a remarkable experience for our residents, employees, and shareholders. When our results are good, we all enjoy the ride (financially and socially). Equity strives to have an embracing, encouraging, and diverse culture. They definitely exceed those goals. "
good,"Enjoyable company and job...I would recommend working to anyone.  Nice culture, people, departments, places, opportunities. Good experiences and chance to grow"
good,Very nice company to work for. was proud to be a part of the company.W as able to use my expertise to the fullest. for the right Position I would return.
good,day to day maint. repairs for residents and property learned hvac repairs enjoyed the customer service
good,I really enjoy working for Equity Residental. I love coming to work everyday to the great staff that I have.
good,"Upper Management truly listens"
good,"atypical day at work is fast paced, trying 2 complete service repair orders and or turnovers of the residental units in a timely matter."
good,"Equity Residential is a meritocracy. They expect you to do a lot with very little, which is challenging and rewarding. It's like a startup. All of the fat has been trimmed away and the departments run very lean."
good,"A typical day at work involved following up with tenants to ensure their comfort, reaching out potential tenants and closing the sale."
good,"EQR is a great place to start your career."
good,"Great Company to work for!"
good,I worked as a maintenance technician and was responsible for apartment turnover. I also took routine service requests and on call duty.
good,"Enjoyed my time at Equity! Great goals achieved, challenges managed and decent work atmosphere."
good,"Great, company  awesome HR "
good,"When I joined Equity Residential as a Leasing Consultant 8 years ago, I didn't quite imagine what my journey would look like. As I recently closed my career with EQR, I can say I definitely enjoyed the ride. "
good,"Company has great leaders that train and put in the time to help develop employees to do their job. Company invests and listens to employees, strength is training and company culture. Financial goals were achievable and not unrealistic. Great place to work!"
good,If you enjoy working in Seattle then this is a great company to stick with.  What I loved most about management was that there was a willingness to listen and they worked very hard to ensure that everyone was still an individual while working as a team.
good,"Loved working at Eqr. Had a"
good,"I felt Equity Residential was a great company to work for. They cared about employees and were focused on schooling and improving employee skills. Pay was fair, and management was fair as well."
good,The only reason I'm no longer with Equity is because my property sold.
good,"I cannot speak highly enough about the company as a whole. Equity provides great benefits and a decent wage. Management and co-workers alike are enjoyable and highly trained at their jobs. No weekend work unless overtime (at our specific location) has been a extra bonus! Not many holidays off is the hardest part, but the job is well worth it."
good,Worked for Equity for about 5 years and I am only leaving because I am relocating for my husband's job in the U.S. Army.
good,I held many positions with Equity Residential in my ten years of employment. I loved working customers daily. It was wonderful to have so many opportunities at a workplace. I trained classes as needed and attended as well.
good,"Upper Management truly listens"
good,"I don't say it lightly when I say that Equity Residential is the best company for which I have ever worked. Management has clearly put a lot of energy into building a supportive network as well as a positive and inclusive culture at every level of the company. There are clear systems in place throughout the company -- no miscommunications or conflicting information distributed like I have experienced in smaller/less-established companies. "
good,Working with Equity always make you feel you part of the family. They connect you with sisters property within your reach and they believe in transparency for you the individual to deliver successful results.
good,"I've been with Equity Residential for over 6 years. The salary is competitive, benefits are exceptional and the company promotes work life balance. Thanks to Equity being located in most major cities I was able to transfer and work in different markets. Equity does a good job keeping its employees involved and keeping the lines of communication open."
good,"Itâ€™s probably the best choice I made as far as a career, I want to get more involved with the company down the road! Everything is very easy to learn and there is always room for more to learn!"
good,I love working at Equity. They're a great company that really values their employees and their opinions. Upper management is easily accessible and is happy to support your learning and growth. I would easily recommend Equity to anyone looking to work in the field.
good,Overall this is a really big and good company they provide you the chance to grow up professionally as you want to be  and recognized the hard work of their employees indefinitely recommend to apply and work in equity residential.
good,"Great company. I absolutly enjoyed the customer interaction with the prospective/ residents. "
good,The property was a busy property and I enjoyed meeting the prospects. I have learned a lot about the Real Estate business and see my future in this area.
good,"I planned to stay until I retire, however, it was wise for the company to move to Washington DC and we agreed mutually it was not a good move for me, so when they move in March I will find work elsewhere, if not before."
good,I would distribute interoffice mail and send out mail to 108 apartment complexes; order office supplies and food; relieved receptionist (multi-phone lines); maintenance and repair of office machines; prepared monthly reports for 6 executives.
good,"Working for Equity Residential was such a rewarding experience. I worked as a Customer Support Assistant and gained the basic fundamentals of Property Management. Unfortunately, I was laid off back in February. As much as it's an unfortunate circumstance, I'm grateful to have had nine months experience. The sense of teamwork and family is unlike anything I've ever been apart of. We work together to make sure the work gets done and the residents are very satisfied. I would highly recommend to anyone interested to fill out an application. As much as I would have loved to grow with the company, I am not giving up and will once again work in Property Management."
good,Great responsibility. Rewarding career field. Looking to get back into this type of work.
good,I was definitely able to feel valued and rewarded for a job well done  The training and support at EQR is priceless and all of the leadership was motivating. I recommend the company to all applicants
good,"My favorite 3 stander practices are test your limits, take educated guess and see the glass half full.  "
good,"Many decisions are guided by the 10 Ways to be a Winner which are great guiding principles in life too, many of which boil down to: strive to improve and value yourself and those around you. I appreciate the collaborative and understanding work environment, and well as soliciting and listening to feedback by customers and staff alike."
good,"Taking on a new roll of Administrative Assistant and Office Manager was very exciting, challenging and rewarding. I learned numerous skills that have helped me in many aspects of my life. Equity Residential is a solid company that provides good benefits and much opportunity for growth."
good,I cant say enough great things about Equity! I loved working for this company and still would be if they didn't sell all of their communities in Florida. If I would have been able to relocate to stay working for them I would have.
good,What I appreciate the most about working for Equity Residential is the changes. EQR is consistently making makes to improve and if it does now work out then they will listen to their employee's feedback. EQR challenges their employees to be better not only at their job but they encourage and provide the tools to live a healthier and happier life.
good,"Upper Management truly listens"
good,"I have had the pleasure to contributed to Equity for 21 years and hope to retire with Equity. The culture is one of openness, support and understanding."

good,"Worked at several locations and enjoyed the fast-paced working environment. There were opportunities for large bonuses and advancement. I interviewed, showed, and approved individuals and families to find their new home."
good,Siempre dar todo en lo que haces  siempre trabajar en grupo
good,A typical day at Hunt Club apartments was to come in get balloons and put them at the road. Then I would go to our display apartment and clean it. After that I would return to the clubhouse and clean it and make sure everything looks great. As soon as customers would come inside I would talk to them.. My Manager when I first started there was great he had been in property management over 20 yrs and he was a great teacher. We had a great workplace culture the company was constantly having meetings and feeding up as well as paying for our classes.The hardest part of the job was to watch someone move out because they were behind on rent. The best part were the friends I made there both employees and residents.
good,"Ability to work independently with set deadlines and teammates that are always there to help when workload is busier than normal made for productive days. We were encouraged to question authority and present ideas to make processes easier and more thorough.  Management always had an ""open door"" policy and were helpful when it came to the difficult times of being able to relay changes to company policy to Community Managers.  The company had a 1/4% workforce reduction due to sales of properties at which time I was laid off"
good,Equity was a great place to work!  Everyone and every position was treated with respect which created a great work environment and morale within the company from the SVP's to the mailroom staff. We worked hard together and we played together!
good,A typical day at work would be communicating and providing luxury service to my residents.  My job requires us to provide excellence in security for a billion dollar property. I have been working at this property since 2008 as a temp. In October 2011 I was offered a full-time job as a concierge. The hardest part of this job is watching the residents move-out who truly made an impact on your life. The most enjoyable part of my job is when a prospect signs the lease. Seeing how excited they are makes me happy. And knowing that I get partial credit for that is the best feeling ever.
good,"good benefits, great locations to work.  up scale.   I did not work long with them.  they sold all texas assets."
good,"Equity cared about us, we had the training needed to provide our residents with superior maintenance and customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was customer service, I loved keeping our residents happy and because of that they would stay with us longer"
good,"Scheduled tours, scheduled and maintained maintenance board, move-in/move-outs, helped maintain property including light maintenance duties, as well as all legal paperwork for new residents and renewal paperwork of existing residents. I also would hold community meetings, cross=trained for assistant managerial duties with basic knowledge of manager's financial reports for property, quarterly shop scores, and full knowledge of eviction process and Washington State Fair-Housing Laws. All of the above were all things I learned throughout my stint here at Equity Residential. My management team was amazing and we all worked well with each other as we knew what the other expected of each other. Our team worked efficiently together and allowed all of us as co-workers to mesh well. The hardest part of my job would have to be keeping up to date with all legal paperwork, and if people were denied helping them rebuild their credit so we could further assist them. I enjoyed every aspect of this job but what I enjoyed most was making residents apartments their home and taking care of all their need and keeping watch over our property and staff."

good,Equity Residential is an amazing work place. The overall staff is impeccable. There training procedures are on point and very informational.
good,"Every morning I come in, clock in, Then check my zones. Each team member is assigned a floor. I was assigned the 3rd floor . Since we have 2 buildings i check each floor every other day; sweep, check light bulbs, brush away spiders. Get assigned an apartment, take out key from key track, got to apartment do a right to left walk. Make sure lights work, check for holes, make sure appliances are working, and check for anything else that is damaged. I would repair all holes, paint walls, replace anything broken, sometimes appliances need to be replaced. Everyday i learn something new about HVAC, learning how to replace of fix the ice makers, Finding new reasons of why refrigerators wont work or that they leak. My coworkers are very mindful and helpful they have taught me everything i needed to know and when i come up with a new problem they show me how to fix it for the next time i come up with the problem. The hardest part of the job would be during the winter time and pipes freeze up there are a lot of pipe bursts and when you are by yourself can be a lot of work."

good,Enjoyed working with numbers.  Company offered job advancement and training opportunities.
good,"One of the best companies I have worked for, they have a great sense of team spirit and support. I not only learned most of my knowledge today from them but learned to grow with the tool they instilled in me today. I think that in most companies to day there is a lack of one on one training and prepping your staff not only to handle situation but to have the confidence to see it through. with equity I couldn't tell you the hours of training and team building events we held. which not only built a strong foundation but brought everyone together. I enjoyed my 4 years with the company and it would have been 10 by now if they stayed in San Antonio."
